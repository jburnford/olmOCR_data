Nor has it been thought necessary to mark vowels as long in cases where mistakes in pronunciation were not likely to be made.\n\nConsonants\n\nMost Indian languages have different forms for a number of consonants, such as d, t, r, &c., marked in scientific works by the use of dots or italics. As the European ear distinguishes these with difficulty in ordinary pronunciation, it has been considered undesirable to embarrass the reader with them; and only two notes are required. In the first place, the Arabic k, a strong guttural, has been represented by k instead of q, which is often used. Secondly, it should be remarked that aspirated consonants are common; and, in particular, dh and th (except in Burma) never have the sound of th in 'this' or 'thin,' but should be pronounced as in 'woodhouse' and 'boathook.'\nBurmese Words\n\nBurmese and some of the languages on the frontier of China have the following special sounds:\n\naw has the vowel-sound in 'law.'\n\u00f6 and \u00fc are pronounced as in German.\ngy is pronounced almost like j in 'jewel.'\nky is pronounced almost like ch in 'church.'\nth is pronounced in some cases as in 'this,' in some cases as in 'thin.'\nw after a consonant has the force of uw. Thus, ywa and pwe are disyllables, pronounced as if written yuwa and puwe.\n\nIt should also be noted that, whereas in Indian words the accent or stress is distributed almost equally on each syllable, in Burmese there is a tendency to throw special stress on the last syllable.\n\nGeneral\n\nThe names of some places\u2014e.g. Calcutta, Bombay, Lucknow, Cawnpore\u2014have obtained a popular fixity of spelling, while special forms have been officially prescribed for others. Names of persons are often spelt and pronounced differently in different parts of India; but the variations have been made as few as possible by assimilating forms almost alike, especially where a particular spelling has been generally adopted in English books.\n\nNotes on Money, Prices, Weights and Measures\n\nAs the currency of India is based upon the rupee, all statements with regard to money throughout the Gazetteer have necessarily been expressed in rupees, nor has it been found possible to add generally a conversion into sterling. Down to about 1873 the gold value of the rupee (containing 165 grains of pure silver) was approximately equal to 2s., or one-tenth of a \u00a3; and for that period it is easy to convert rupees into sterling by striking off the final cipher (Rs. 1,000 = \u00a3100). But after 1873, owing to the depreciation of silver as compared with gold throughout the world, there came a serious and progressive fall in the exchange, until at one time the gold value of the rupee dropped as low as 1s. In order to provide a remedy for the heavy loss caused to the Government of India in respect of its gold payments to be made in England, and also to relieve foreign trade and finance from the inconvenience due to constant and unforeseen fluctuations in exchange, it was resolved in 1893 to close the mints to the free coinage of silver, and thus force up the value of the rupee by restricting the circulation. The intention was to raise\nthe exchange value of the rupee to 1s. 4d., and then introduce a gold standard (though not necessarily a gold currency) at the rate of Rs. 15 = \u00a31. This policy has been completely successful. From 1899 onwards the value of the rupee has been maintained, with insignificant fluctuations, at the proposed rate of 1s. 4d.; and consequently since that date three rupees have been equivalent to two rupees before 1873. For the intermediate period, between 1873 and 1899, it is manifestly impossible to adopt any fixed sterling value for a constantly changing rupee. But since 1899, if it is desired to convert rupees into sterling, not only must the final cipher be struck off (as before 1873), but also one-third must be subtracted from the result. Thus Rs. 1,000 = \u00a3100 - $\\frac{1}{3}$ = (about) \u00a367.\n\nAnother matter in connexion with the expression of money statements in terms of rupees requires to be explained. The method of numerical notation in India differs from that which prevails throughout Europe. Large numbers are not punctuated in hundreds of thousands and millions, but in lakhs and crores. A lakh is one hundred thousand (written out as 1,00,000), and a crore is one hundred lakhs or ten millions (written out as 1,00,00,000). Consequently, according to the exchange value of the rupee, a lakh of rupees (Rs. 1,00,000) may be read as the equivalent of \u00a310,000 before 1873, and as the equivalent of (about) \u00a36,667 after 1899; while a crore of rupees (Rs. 1,00,00,000) may similarly be read as the equivalent of \u00a31,00,00,000 before 1873, and as the equivalent of (about) \u00a3666,667 after 1899.\n\nFinally, it should be mentioned that the rupee is divided into 16 annas, a fraction commonly used for many purposes by both natives and Europeans. The anna was formerly reckoned as 1$\\frac{1}{2}$d.; it may now be considered as exactly corresponding to 1d. The anna is again subdivided into 12 pies.\n\nThe various systems of weights used in India combine uniformity of scale with immense variations in the weight of units. The scale used generally throughout Northern India, and less commonly in Madras and Bombay, may be thus expressed: one maund = 40 seers; one seer = 16 chittaks or 80 tolas. The actual weight of a seer varies greatly from District to District, and even from village to village; but in the standard system the tola is 180 grains Troy (the exact weight of the rupee), and the seer thus weighs 2.057 lb., and the maund 82.28 lb. This standard is used in official reports and throughout the Gazetteer.\n\nFor calculating retail prices, the universal custom in India is to express them in terms of seers to the rupee. Thus, when prices change, what varies is not the amount of money to be paid for the\nsame quantity, but the quantity to be obtained for the same amount of money. In other words, prices in India are quantity prices, not money prices. When the figure of quantity goes up, this of course means that the price has gone down, which is at first sight perplexing to an English reader. It may, however, be mentioned that quantity prices are not altogether unknown in England, especially at small shops, where pennyworths of many groceries can be bought. Eggs, likewise, are commonly sold at a varying number for the shilling.\n\nIf it be desired to convert quantity prices from Indian into English denominations without having recourse to money prices (which would often be misleading), the following scale may be adopted\u2014based upon the assumptions that a seer is exactly \\(2 \\text{ lb.}\\), and that the value of the rupee remains constant at \\(1 \\text{s. } 4\\text{d.}\\): \\(1 \\text{ seer per rupee} = (\\text{about}) \\ 3 \\text{ lb. for } 2\\text{s.}; \\ 2 \\text{ seers per rupee} = (\\text{about}) \\ 6 \\text{ lb. for } 2\\text{s.}; \\) and so on.\n\nThe name of the unit for square measurement in India generally is the *bigha*, which varies greatly in different parts of the country. But areas have always been expressed throughout the *Gazetteer* either in square miles or in acres.\n\n**MAPS**\n\nEastern Bengal and Assam . . . . . . to face p. 112\n\nBaluchistan . . . . . . . . . . . . . \" 336\nArgaon.\u2014Village in the Akot taluk of Akola District, Berar, situated in 21\u00b0 7' N. and 76\u00b0 59' E. Population (1901), 3,131. The place, the name of which means 'village of wells,' is mentioned in the Ain-i-Akbari as the head-quarters of a pargana. On the broad plain, intersected by watercourses, before Argaon, General Wellesley gained a great victory (November 29, 1803) over the Nagpur army under Venkaji, brother of Raghuji Bhonsla. The battle was followed up by the capture of G\u0101wilgarh. A medal, with a bar commemorative of Argaon, was struck in 1851 and presented to the surviving officers and soldiers.\n\nAriankavu.\u2014Village, pass, and shrine in the Shencottah taluk of Travancore State, Madras, situated in 8\u00b0 59' N. and 77\u00b0 9' E., in a circular valley about a mile from the head of the pass, 54 miles from Trivandrum, 50 from Quilon, and about 50 from Tinnevelly. Population (1901), about 1,000. The principal line of road from Tinnevelly via Shencottah into Travancore passes by this village, as also does the Tinnevelly-Quilon Railway. The extension of the tea- and coffee-planting industry has increased its importance. It contains a temple of great antiquity dedicated to Sastha, which is asserted to have been built by Parasu Rama. It lies in a hollow surrounded by hills. The whole of the pass, about 18 miles in length, presents a succession of grand forest scenery.\n\nAriyalur Subdivision.\u2014Subdivision of Trichinopoly District, Madras, consisting of the Udaiyarpalaiyam and Perambalur taluks.\n\nAriyalur Town.\u2014Chief town of the zamindari of the same name in the Udaiyarpalaiyam taluk of Trichinopoly District, Madras, situated in 11\u00b0 8' N. and 79\u00b0 5' E. Population (1901), 7,370. It is the headquarters of the Ariyalur subdivision, which is in charge of a Deputy-Collector and Magistrate, and comprises the taluks of Perambalur and Udaiyarpalaiyam. It also contains a District Munsif's court and a hospital, and a European firm has a screw cotton press here. Satins\nof various patterns are made in the town by the foreign weaver-caste of the Patn\u016blk\u0101rans, which are most handsome and effective and have a wide reputation. The chiefs of Ariyal\u016br experienced numerous vicissitudes during the Wars of the Carnatic and the government of the Naw\u0101b. When Trichinopoly District passed into the hands of the East India Company in 1801, the polig\u0101r, or chief, was in receipt of a monthly allowance of Rs. 700, the estate being under the management of an agent of the Naw\u0101b. The zam\u012bnd\u0101ri continued under the management of the Company for some years, the proprietor being allowed one-tenth of its net income; but in 1817 he obtained a sanad (title-deed) for the village in which he resided and a number of others adjoining it, the annual value of which was equal to one-tenth of the gross revenue of the estate, and he was required to pay a peshkash of about Rs. 1,090. The zam\u012bnd\u0101rs are Vanniyas by caste, and originally held the estate as arasuk\u0101valg\u0101rs or \u2018heads of police.\u2019 The property has since been dismembered into seventeen portions, as a result of civil court sales held to discharge the debts incurred by its owners. Ariyal\u016br has a particularly fine market, which is regarded as one of the best in Southern India. A large temple of comparatively recent date, about 4 miles from the town, is a sort of local Lourdes, devout Hindus taking their sick to it in the hope that their cure will be effected at the hands of the founder of the temple.\n\nArkalg\u016bd.\u2014Southern t\u0101luk of Hassan District, Mysore, lying between 12\u00b0 31' and 12\u00b0 50' N. and 75\u00b0 56' and 76\u00b0 12' E., with an area of 261 square miles. The population in 1901 was 76,775, compared with 75,812 in 1891. The t\u0101luk contains three towns, Arkalg\u016bd (population, 4,903), the head-quarters, Konan\u016br (2,328), and Basav\u0101patna (1,684); and 300 villages. The land revenue demand in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 1,25,000. The Hem\u0101vati river forms the northern boundary, and the Cauvery runs through part of the south. The rice crop served by the river channels is one of great yield and certainty. Near the large tanks rice is followed by a crop of onions, which is very profitable. The west of the t\u0101luk up to the borders of Coorg is jungly and hilly. In the south are numerous coco-nut and areca-nut gardens, but the areca-nut is the coarse variety called godu. On the high watershed in the centre much tobacco is grown, which is converted into snuff.\n\nArk\u0101vati.\u2014A tributary of the Cauvery, in Mysore, about 120 miles long, having its source on Nandidroog, and flowing through Bangalore District from north to south with a slight westerly direction. The Kumudvati from the west joins it south of Nelamangala, and the Vrishabh\u0101vati from Bangalore on the east, north of K\u0101nk\u0101nhalli. In its upper course are some large tanks, including Hesarghatta, the source of the water-supply of Bangalore. From S\u0101vandurga southwards it runs mostly\nthrough a wild country, amid rocky hills and forest, and is therefore not much used for irrigation.\n\n**Arkonam.**\u2014Town in the W\u0101l\u0101j\u0101pet t\u0101luk of North Arcot District, Madras, situated in $13^\\circ 5' N.$ and $79^\\circ 40' E.$ It has sprung into importance only since it became a railway junction. Here the north-west and south-west lines of the Madras Railway meet, and here also is the terminus of the branch of the South Indian Railway which runs from the main line at Chingleput. Population (1901), 5,313, many of whom are railway employ\u00e9s. The town is a Union under the Local Boards Act, and the head-quarters of a deputy-tahsild\u0101r and sub-magistrate.\n\n**Armagon** (*Armeghon*, *Armugam*).\u2014Village in the G\u016bd\u016br t\u0101luk of Nellore District, Madras, situated in $13^\\circ 59' N.$ and $80^\\circ 10' E.$, on the Bay of Bengal. The place is now sometimes called Monap\u0101lem, from a neighbouring village with a lighthouse, and sometimes Dugar\u0101zupatnam, from another village where open communication with the sea can be maintained. It is said to be named after one Arumuga Mudaliy\u0101r, by whose assistance one of the earliest English settlements on the Coromandel coast, consisting of a factory defended by twelve pieces of cannon, was established in 1625. A lighthouse is maintained at Monap\u0101lem in $13^\\circ 53' N.$ and $80^\\circ 8' E.$, which gives a flash every 20 seconds visible 14 miles away, and warns vessels off the Armagon shoal, 6 miles from shore. The shoal is about 10 miles long, and the shallowest patch on it has $1\\frac{3}{4}$ fathoms of water, and lies from $3\\frac{1}{2}$ to $5\\frac{1}{2}$ miles east-by-north of the lighthouse. The still water inside the shoal is called Blackwood\u2019s Harbour, after Sir Henry Blackwood, once admiral on this coast, who had it charted, and suggested that it would make a practicable harbour. Seven miles north of Armagon lighthouse is Dugar\u0101zupatnam, a small village of 2,388 inhabitants on the Buckingham Canal. Being at the mouth of an entrance to the sea from the backwater in front of which Armagon stands, it was apparently the port of Armagon, and the two places are often spoken of as identical. Near by are the remains of an old fort built by the East India Company.\n\n**Arm\u016br T\u0101luk.**\u2014T\u0101luk in Niz\u0101m\u0101b\u0101d District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, with an area of 1,038 square miles. The population in 1901, including j\u0101girs, was 122,455, compared with 123,285 in 1891. The t\u0101luk contains two towns, Arm\u016br (population, 9,031), the head-quarters, and B\u0101lkonda (5,118), a j\u0101gir town; and 160 villages, of which 51 are j\u0101gir. The land revenue in 1901 was 3.6 lakhs. The statistics include the sub-t\u0101luk of Bimgal, which was merged in Arm\u016br in 1905, and had an area of 491 square miles and a population of 54,290 in 1901. Rice is largely raised by tank irrigation. The t\u0101luk is hilly in the centre, and the God\u0101vari flows through the north.\n**Arm\u016br Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of the *t\u0101luk* of the same name in Niz\u0101m\u0101b\u0101d District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, situated in $18^\\circ 48'$ N. and $78^\\circ 16'$ E., 16 miles north-east of Niz\u0101m\u0101b\u0101d town. Population (1901), 9,031. It contains a sub-post office, a police inspector's office, a dispensary, and a school with 127 pupils. Silk cloth and *s\u0101ris* are largely manufactured.\n\n**Arni Subdivision.**\u2014Subdivision of North Arcot District, Madras, consisting of the *zam\u012bnd\u0101ri tahsil* of Arni and the *t\u0101luks* of Pol\u016br and Wandiw\u0101sh.\n\n**Arni Tahsil.**\u2014Zam\u012bnd\u0101ri tahsil in the south of North Arcot District, Madras, lying between $12^\\circ 29'$ and $12^\\circ 49'$ N. and $79^\\circ 7'$ and $79^\\circ 22'$ E., and comprising the Arni *j\u0101g\u012br*. The area is 184 square miles, or less than any other *tahsil* in the District. Number of villages, 139; population in 1901, 96,542, compared with 91,730 in 1891; headquarters, Arni (population, 12,485); *peshkash* payable to Government (including cesses), Rs. 21,000. The *j\u0101g\u012br* was granted to an ancestor of the present holder early in the seventeenth century, as a reward for military services, by the Mar\u0101th\u0101 chief Sh\u0101hji during his expedition into the Carnatic.\n\n**Arni.**\u2014Town in North Arcot District, Madras, situated in $12^\\circ 41'$ N. and $79^\\circ 17'$ E. It is the head-quarters of a Deputy-Collector and other officials; population (1901), 12,485. The most interesting building is the fort, an almost square structure which has been dismantled to a great extent. Until thirty years ago, Arni was a military station and at one time a very large one, as the long lines of deserted barracks testify. These barracks are fast falling into disrepair, but portions are still used as public offices. There are two old European cemeteries near the western walls. An imposing monument in the shape of a high column stands on one side of the parade ground; it was erected, as an inscription shows, by an officer of the garrison in memory of a brother officer whom he had shot in a duel. At the north-west angle of the enclosure is a fine old temple somewhat recalling that in the Vellore fort, though it does not contain such excellent sculpture. A considerable industry in the manufacture of silk and cotton fabrics is carried on in the town.\n\n**Aror.**\u2014Ruined town in the Rohri *t\u0101luka* of Sukkur District, Sind, Bombay, situated in $27^\\circ 39'$ N. and $68^\\circ 59'$ E., 5 miles to the east of Rohri town. Population (1901), 939. It was formerly the capital of the Hindu R\u0101j\u0101s of Sind, and is said by native historians to have been taken from them by the Muhammadans about A.D. 712. It was built on the bank of the old course of the Indus\u2014then known as the Mihr\u0101n\u2014and was destroyed by the earthquake which, about 962, diverted the river into its present channel. Among the ruins is a mosque built by Alamg\u012br. There is also a cave, considered by\nHindus to be sacred to the goddess K\u0101lika Devi, where an annual fair is held.\n\n**Arrah Subdivision.**\u2014Head-quarters subdivision of Sh\u0101h\u0101b\u0101d District, Bengal, lying between $25^\\circ 10'$ and $25^\\circ 46'$ N. and $84^\\circ 17'$ and $84^\\circ 51'$ E., with an area of 913 square miles. The subdivision is a low-lying alluvial flat, bounded on the north by the Ganges and on the east by the river Son. The population in 1901 was 699,956, compared with 743,582 in 1891, the density being 767 persons to the square mile. It contains two towns, Arrah (population, 46,170), the head-quarters, and Jagd\u012bspur (11,451); and 1,245 villages, one of which, Bihiy\u0101, on the East Indian Railway, is an important trade centre. Arrah is famous on account of the gallant defence of the Judge's house by a handful of Europeans and Sikhs against an overwhelming force of mutineers in 1857.\n\n**Arrah Town (Ar\u0101).**\u2014Head-quarters of Sh\u0101h\u0101b\u0101d District, Bengal, situated in $25^\\circ 34'$ N. and $84^\\circ 40'$ E., on the East Indian Railway, 368 miles from Calcutta. The population increased from 39,386 in 1872 to 42,998 in 1881, and to 46,905 in 1891, but fell to 46,170 in 1901, the decline being probably due to plague. Of the population in the last year, 32,903 were Hindus and 12,797 Musalm\u0101ns, while among the remainder were 433 Jains.\n\nThe town of Arrah is invested with a special historical interest as being the scene of a stirring episode in the Mutiny of 1857. A body of rebels, consisting of about 2,000 sepoys from Dinapore and four times as many armed villagers under Kuar Singh, marched in the end of July on Arrah. They reached the town on the 27th of that month, and forthwith released all the prisoners in the jail and plundered the treasury. The European women and children had already been sent away, but there remained in the town about a dozen Englishmen and three or four other Christians of different races. The Commissioner of Patna, Mr. Tayler, had supplied a garrison of 50 Sikhs. At this time the East Indian Railway was in course of construction, under the local superintendence of Mr. Vicars Boyle, who fortunately had some knowledge of fortification. He occupied two houses, now known as the Judge's houses, the smaller of which, a two-storeyed building about 20 yards from the main house, was forthwith fortified and provisioned. The lower windows, &c., were built up, and sand-bags ranged on the roof. When the news came that the mutineers were advancing along the Arrah road, the Europeans and Sikhs retired to the smaller house. The rebels, after pillaging the town, made straight for Mr. Boyle's little fortress. A volley dispersed them, and forced them to seek the shelter of the larger house, only a few yards off, whence they carried on an almost continuous fire. They attempted to burn or smoke out the little garrison, and tried various other safe modes of attack; but they\nhad no guns. Kuar Singh, however, produced two small cannon which he had dug up, and artillery missiles were improvised out of the house furniture. In the small house there was no thought of surrender. Mr. Herwald Wake, the Magistrate, put himself in command of the Sikhs, who, though sorely tempted by their countrymen among the mutineers, remained faithful throughout the siege. A relieving party of 150 European troops, sent by water from Dinapore, fell into an ambuscade on landing in Sh\u0101h\u0101b\u0101d; and as time passed away and no help arrived, provisions and water began to run short. A bold midnight sally resulted in the capture of four sheep, and water was obtained by digging a well 18 feet deep inside the house. A mine of the enemy was met by countermining. On August 2 the besieged party observed an unusual excitement in the neighbourhood. The fire of the enemy had slackened, and but few of them were visible. The sound of a distant cannonade was heard. Before sunset the eight days' siege was at an end, and on the following morning the gallant garrison welcomed their deliverers\u2014Major Vincent Eyre, with 150 men of the 5th Fusiliers, a few mounted volunteers, and 3 guns with 34 artillery-men. Major Eyre had dispersed Kuar Singh's forces on his way to Arrah, and they never rallied.\n\nArrah was constituted a municipality in 1865. The income during the decade ending 1901-2 averaged Rs. 52,000, and the expenditure Rs. 47,000. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 55,000, including Rs. 21,000 derived from a tax on persons (or property tax), Rs. 11,000 from a water rate, Rs. 5,000 from a tax on vehicles, Rs. 4,000 from a municipal market, and Rs. 6,000 as special grants from Provincial and Local funds for medical purposes. The incidence of taxation was R. 0-14-3 per head of the population. In the same year the expenditure amounted to Rs. 48,000, the chief items being Rs. 10,000 on conservancy, Rs. 5,000 on water-supply, Rs. 8,000 on medical relief, and Rs. 5,000 on roads. The town is supplied with filtered water from the Son; the works, which cost upwards of 4 lakhs, were opened in 1894. The town contains the usual public buildings of a District head-quarters. The District jail has accommodation for 278 prisoners, who are employed chiefly on oil-pressing, thread-twisting, and carpet-making.\n\nArsikere.\u2014Northern taluk of Hassan District, Mysore, lying between 13\u00b0 5' and 13\u00b0 33' N. and 76\u00b0 2' and 76\u00b0 26' E., with an area of 486 square miles. The population in 1901 was 79,588, compared with 65,306 in 1891. The taluk contains three towns, Arsikere (population, 3,565), the headquarters, B\u0101n\u0101var (2,422), and H\u0101ranhalli (2,117); and 354 villages. The land revenue demand in 1903-4 was Rs. 1,62,000. The surface is very undulating. In the west is a chain of rocky hills, covered with scrub jungle. In the north are the Hirekalgudda hills, on which is the\ntemple of M\u0101lekal Tirupati. The drainage is northwards to the Ved\u0101vati river, but there are few streams or tanks. In the south are several Amrit Mah\u0101l grazing-grounds, and a good stamp of cattle is bred, which is in some demand in the Maln\u0101d. The prevailing soil is grey and stony. R\u0101gi is grown everywhere, while in the west and south chillies are largely cultivated for the Maln\u0101d. Coco-nuts allowed to remain on the tree till they drop, called kobri, are much prized, and are exported to Tipt\u016br for the Bangalore and Bellary markets. They are grown in the north in low-lying ground without irrigation.\n\nAruppukkottai.\u2014Head-quarters of the Tiruchuli tahs\u012bl of the R\u0101mn\u0101d estate, in Madura District, Madras, situated in 9\u00b0 31\u2032 N. and 78\u00b0 6\u2032 E. Population (1901), 23,633. It is a thriving place and its population has doubled in the last twenty years; but it suffers from lack of communications, being 13 miles distant from Virudupatti, the nearest railway station. The inhabitants consist chiefly of Sedans, who are weavers, and of Sh\u0101n\u0101ns, an enterprising community in commercial matters, who have brought the town to its flourishing condition. The place has at present to support a force of punitive police, owing to the recent disturbances caused by the claims of the people of the latter caste, which is reckoned low in the social scale, to enter Hindu places of worship. The chief industries are cotton-weaving and dyeing. The fabrics made here are exported to Colombo, Singapore, and Penang.\n\nArvi Tahs\u012bl.\u2014Northern tahs\u012bl of Wardh\u0101 District, Central Provinces, lying between 20\u00b0 45\u2032 and 21\u00b0 22\u2032 N. and 78\u00b0 3\u2032 and 78\u00b0 39\u2032 E., with an area of 890 square miles. The population in 1901 was 137,737, compared with 131,174 in 1891. The density is 155 persons per square mile. The tahs\u012bl has two towns, Arvi (population, 10,676), the head-quarters, and Asht\u012b (5,237); and 299 inhabited villages. The tahs\u012bl is an important cotton tract, and is known also for its fine breed of cattle. The eastern portion is hilly, while to the west a narrow strip of very fertile black soil lies along the bank of the Wardh\u0101 river. Excluding 180 square miles of Government forest, 70 per cent. of the available area is occupied for cultivation. The cultivated area in 1903\u20134 was 472 square miles. The demand for land revenue in the same year was Rs. 1,98,000, and for cesses Rs. 19,000.\n\nArvi Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the tahs\u012bl of the same name in Wardh\u0101 District, Central Provinces, situated in 20\u00b0 59\u2032 N. and 78\u00b0 10\u2032 E., 22 miles from Pulgaon station. Population (1901), 10,676. Arvi was created a municipality in 1867. The municipal receipts during the decade ending 1901 averaged Rs. 14,200. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 27,000, derived principally from octroi and market dues. The town is a flourishing centre of the cotton trade, and contains 7 ginning factories and 3 presses, most of which have been erected within the five\nyears ending 1903. Their aggregate capital is 6\u00bd lakhs, and the profits for 1904 were Rs. 79,000. The water-supply is inadequate, and a water-works scheme is under consideration. A weekly cattle market is held here. Arvi has an English middle school, a dispensary, a public library, and a fine sarai constructed at a cost of Rs. 15,000 by one of the residents. A large market to cost Rs. 40,000 is shortly to be built in the town.\n\n**Aryal\u016br.\u2014** Subdivision and town in Trichinopoly District, Madras. See Ariyal\u016br.\n\n**Asafnagar.\u2014** 'Crown' taluk in the Atr\u0101f-i-balda District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, also known as the Gharbi or 'western' taluk, with an area, including jagirs, of 402 square miles. The population in 1901 was 56,928, compared with 47,264 in 1891. The taluk contains 97 villages, of which 33 are jagir, and Asafnagar (population, 1,694) is the headquarters. The land revenue in 1901 was 2 lakhs. The taluk is composed of sandy soils, and is well supplied with tanks. The paig\u0101h taluk of Far\u012bd\u0101b\u0101d, with 31 villages, a population of 8,446, and an area of about 126 square miles, lies to the west.\n\n**Asandi.\u2014** Village in the Kad\u016br taluk of Kad\u016br District, Mysore, situated in 13\u00b0 42\u2032 N. and 76\u00b0 6\u2032 E., 5 miles from Ajjampur railway station. Population (1901), 1,006. In ancient times it was a place of considerable importance. Under the Gangas and the Hoysalas it was the chief city of a principality, which in the eighth century was governed by Vijay\u0101ditya, son of the king Sripurusha, and in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries by a line of Ganga chiefs.\n\n**Asansol Subdivision.\u2014** North-western subdivision of Burdw\u0101n District, Bengal, lying between 23\u00b0 25\u2032 and 23\u00b0 53\u2032 N. and 86\u00b0 48\u2032 and 87\u00b0 32\u2032 E., with an area of 618 square miles. Until 1906 it was known as the R\u0101n\u012bganj subdivision. The north-western part consists of a rocky undulating country, which merges in the south and south-east in the alluvial plain stretching along the D\u0101modar river. The population in 1901 was 370,988, compared with 310,273 in 1891. It contains two towns, Asansol (population, 14,906), its head-quarters and a great railway centre, and R\u0101n\u012bganj (15,841), its former head-quarters; and 811 villages. The subdivision is now the most progressive part of the District, but its density of population, 600 persons to the square mile, is still slightly less than that of K\u0101twa. It differs from the rest of Burdw\u0101n, which is entirely agricultural in character; the alluvial soil here changes to laterite, and rich coal- and iron-fields have of recent years caused a continuous increase in the number and prosperity of its inhabitants. Brass and bell-metal ware and shellac and lac-dye are manufactured at Dignagar.\n\n**Asansol Town.\u2014** Head-quarters of the subdivision of the same name in Burdw\u0101n District, Bengal, situated in 23\u00b0 41\u2032 N. and 86\u00b0 59\u2032 E.,\non the East Indian Railway, 132 miles from Calcutta. Population (1901), 14,906. Asansol is a rapidly growing town, being an important railway junction and one of the chief centres of the coal industry. A large number of European and Eurasian employ\u00e9s live here. It was constituted a municipality in 1896. The income and expenditure during the decade ending in 1901-2 averaged Rs. 14,000. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 20,300, half of which was derived from a tax on houses and lands; and the expenditure was Rs. 20,400, including Rs. 9,000 spent on conservancy. The East Indian Railway Volunteers and the 'B' troop of the Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur Mounted Rifles have their head-quarters at Asansol. A Roman Catholic mission maintains a church, a convent, and schools; and a Methodist Episcopal mission supports a leper asylum, an orphanage, and a girls' school. The town contains the usual public offices; the subsidiary jail has accommodation for 44 prisoners.\n\nAsar\u016br.\u2014Village in the Kh\u0101ng\u0101h Dogr\u0101n tahsil of Gujr\u0101nw\u0101la District, Punjab, situated in 31\u00b0 47' N. and 73\u00b0 42' E. It is identified by Cunningham with the ancient city of Tse-kie or T\u0101ki, which was visited by Hiuen Tsiang in A.D. 630. The city was then one of great importance, and is said by the Chinese pilgrim to have been 3 miles in circuit, a measurement which agrees well enough with that of the ruins still existing. The antiquity claimed for the place is confirmed by the large size of the bricks, 18 by 10 by 3 inches, which are found all over the ruins, and by the great numbers of Indo-Scythian coins that are discovered after heavy rain. Its history therefore certainly reaches back to the beginning of the Christian era. The ruins consist of an extensive mound, 15,600 feet, or nearly 3 miles, in circuit. The highest point is in the north-west quarter, where the mound rises to 59 feet above the fields. This part, which Cunningham takes to have been the ancient palace, is 600 feet long and 400 feet broad, and quite regular in shape. It contains an old well, 21 feet in diameter, which has not been used for many years and is now dry. The place is completely surrounded by a line of large mounds about 25 feet in height, and 8,100 feet, or 1\u00bd miles, in circuit, which was evidently the stronghold or citadel of the place. The mounds are round and prominent, like the ruins of large towers or bastions. On the east and south sides of the citadel the mass of ruins sinks to 10 and 15 feet in height, but it is twice the size of the citadel, and is no doubt the remains of the old city. There are no visible traces of any ancient buildings, as all the surface bricks have been long ago carried off to the neighbouring shrine of Ug\u0101h Sh\u0101h at Kh\u0101ng\u0101h Masr\u016br on the road from Lahore to Pindi Bhatti\u0101n; but among the old bricks forming the surrounding wall of the mosque, Cunningham found three moulded in different patterns, which could only have belonged to buildings of some importance. He\nfound also a wedge-shaped brick, 15 inches long and 3 inches thick, with a breadth of 10 inches at the narrow end and nearly $10\\frac{1}{2}$ inches at the broad end. This must have been made for a st\u016bpa, or for a well, but most probably for the latter, as the existing well is 21 feet in diameter. The modern village of Asar\u016br contains only forty-five houses. At the time of Hiuen Tsiang's visit there were ten monasteries, but very few Buddhists, and the mass of the people worshipped the Br\u0101hmanical gods. North-east of the town, at 10 li, or nearly 2 miles, was a st\u016bpa of Asoka, 200 feet in height, which marked the spot where Buddha had halted, and which was said to contain a large number of his relics. This st\u016bpa General Cunningham identifies with the little mound of S\u0101l\u0101r, near Thatta Saiyid\u0101n, just 2 miles to the north of Asar\u016br.\n\n**Ashta.**\u2014Town in the V\u0101lva t\u0101luka of S\u0101t\u0101ra District, Bombay, situated in $16\u00b0 57' N.$ and $74\u00b0 25' E.$, on the right bank of the river Kistna, and on the main road from Mir\u0101j to S\u0101t\u0101ra, 20 miles north-west of the former, and 61 miles south-east of the latter. Population (1901), 12,409. Ashta is an agricultural town, with a weekly market, and an annual fair held in June, when about 5,000 persons assemble. It has been a municipality since 1853. During the decade ending 1901 the income averaged Rs. 5,000. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 3,200. The town contains an English school and a dispensary.\n\n**Ashta.**\u2014Village in the M\u0101dha t\u0101luka of Shol\u0101pur District, Bombay, situated in $17\u00b0 51' N.$ and $75\u00b0 28' E.$ Population (1901), 936. The place is interesting as the scene of the battle of February 20, 1818, between General Lionel Smith and B\u0101ji Rao Peshw\u0101's troops, in which the Peshw\u0101 was defeated and his general Gokhale killed. It was entirely a cavalry action, Gokhale having 8,000 to 10,000 horse, and General Smith two regiments of cavalry, a squadron of the 22nd Dragoons, 1,200 auxiliary horse, and 2,500 infantry. The battle had the important result of freeing the S\u0101t\u0101ra R\u0101j\u0101 from B\u0101ji Rao's power. Ashta has a large lake which, when full, has an area of more than 4 square miles and a capacity of $1,419,000,000$ cubic feet of water. The lake has been formed at a cost of upwards of 7 lakhs by throwing across the Ashta stream, a feeder of the Bh\u012bma, an earthen dam 12,709 feet long with a greatest height of 57.75 feet. Two canals are led from the dam; that on the left bank is $11\\frac{1}{2}$ miles long, discharging 30 cubic feet a second, and commanding 12,258 arable acres; while the right-bank canal is 10 miles long, discharging 10 cubic feet a second, and commanding 5,624 arable acres. Ashta contains two schools, one of which is for girls.\n\n**Ashta.**\u2014Head-quarters of the Niz\u0101mat-i-Maghrib or western district of Bhopal State, Central India, situated in $23\u00b0 1' N.$ and $76\u00b0 46' E.$, on the east bank of the P\u0101rbati. Population (1901), 5,534. The site\nis traditionally said to be a very old one, but the present town was built in the fifteenth century. In Akbar\u2019s time it was the head-quarters of a mah\u0101l in the S\u0101rangpur sark\u0101r of the S\u016bbah of M\u0101lw\u0101. The town is surrounded by a fortified wall, and contains a small fort built by Dost Muhammad Kh\u0101n in 1716; both wall and fort are now in a dilapidated condition. In 1745 Ashta was seized by the Mar\u0101th\u0101s, but was restored to Bhop\u0101l under the treaty of 1817. A mosque built in 1602 stands in the town. In 1837 Naw\u0101b Jah\u0101ng\u012br Muhammad Kh\u0101n was besieged in Ashta by the forces of Kudsia Begam. The chief industries are weaving, dyeing, and printing of cotton cloth. A considerable trade in opium is carried on here; and the town contains a primary school, a dispensary, British and State post offices, and an inspection bungalow.\n\nAshtagr\u0101m (\u2018the eight townships\u2019).\u2014The country on both banks of the Cauvery near Seringapatam, Mysore State, bestowed by the Hoysala king Vishnuvardhana, early in the twelfth century, on the Vaishnava reformer R\u0101m\u0101nuja, by whom he had been converted from the Jain faith. The reformer appointed Br\u0101hmans to administer the tract, under the designation of Hebb\u0101rs and Prabhus, settling them in eight towns. The chiefs of N\u0101gamangala, probably descended from these, were put down at the end of the fifteenth century by the Vijaya-nagar king Narasinga, who took possession of Seringapatam. Under the Mysore kings the tract was formed into the Patna Ashtagr\u0101m and Mais\u016br Ashtagr\u0101m t\u0101luks, the former to the north of the river and the latter to the south. In 1863 Mysore and Hassan Districts were constituted the Ashtagr\u0101m Division, which was abolished in 1880.\n\nAshtami.\u2014Village included within the municipal limits of Roh\u0101 Town, Kol\u0101ba District, Bombay.\n\nAshti.\u2014Town in the Arv\u012b tahsil of Wardh\u0101 District, Central Provinces, situated in 21\u00b0 12' N. and 78\u00b0 11' E., 39 miles from Pulgaon station. Population (1901), 5,237. Ashti was the seat of government of part of Wardh\u0101 and Ber\u0101r under the Mughal empire, and two handsome mausoleums built over the graves of Afgh\u0101n nobles who administered these territories during the reign of Jah\u0101ng\u012br are still standing. A cotton-ginning and pressing factory was erected in 1894. Ashti possesses an English middle school, and a town fund is raised for purposes of sanitation.\n\nAshti.\u2014South-western t\u0101luk of Bh\u012br District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, with an area of 614 square miles. The population in 1901, including j\u0101g\u012brs, was 54,181, compared with 70,059 in 1891, the decrease being due to the famines of 1897 and 1899\u20131900. The t\u0101luk contains 127 villages, of which five are j\u0101g\u012br, and Ashti (population, 4,019) is the headquarters. The land revenue in 1901 was 1\u00b79 lakhs. The t\u0101luk adjoins the Ahmadnagar District of Bombay.\nAs\u012bnd.\u2014Principal town of an estate of the same name in the north of the State of Udaipur, R\u0101jput\u0101na, situated in $25^\\circ 44' N.$ and $74^\\circ 19' E.$, on the left bank of the Kh\u0101ri river, a tributary of the Ban\u0101s, about 90 miles north-east of Udaipur city. Population (1901), 2,237. The estate, which is held by one of the first-class nobles of Mew\u0101r, who is styled R\u0101wat, consists of 72 villages. The income is about Rs. 80,000, and a tribute of about Rs. 1,040 is paid to the Darb\u0101r. The R\u0101wat of As\u012bnd belongs to the Chond\u0101wat family of the Sesodia clan of R\u0101jputs; and the founder of this particular house, Th\u0101kur Ajit Singh, signed, on behalf of the Mah\u0101r\u0101n\u0101, the treaty of 1818 with the British Government.\n\nAs\u012brgarh.\u2014Hill fort in the Burh\u0101npur tahsil of Nim\u0101r District, Central Provinces, situated in $21^\\circ 28' N.$ and $76^\\circ 18' E.$, 29 miles from Khandw\u0101, and 7 miles from Ch\u0101ndni station on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway. The fort was held until recently by a small detachment of native infantry from Mhow, but this was removed in 1904. It is situated on an outlying spur of the S\u0101tpur\u0101 range, 850 feet high from the base and 2,283 above sea-level, and formerly commanded the main road from Hindust\u0101n to the Deccan. The area of the fort crowning the hill is about 60 acres, and except in two places it is surrounded by a sheer scarp 80 to 120 feet in depth. The two points of access are defended by ramparts, through one of which a narrow ascent of stone steps passes through five gateways to the fort. An outer line of works, called the lower fort, embraces an inferior branch of the hill immediately above the village. A sally-port has been constructed through the underlying rock at the south-eastern corner. In the foundations of the fort are many vaulted chambers, probably old granaries. Firishta derived the name of As\u012brgarh from As\u0101 Ab\u012br, to whom he attributes the foundation of the fort; but this is probably incorrect, as the name As\u012br is repeatedly mentioned by the R\u0101jput poet Ch\u0101nd. It may come from the Asi or Haihaya kings who ruled the Narbad\u0101 valley from Mahesw\u0101ra. In 1295 As\u012brgarh was a stronghold of the Chauh\u0101n R\u0101jputs, and was stormed by Al\u0101-ud-din Khilj\u012b on his return from raiding the Deccan, the whole garrison being put to the sword except one boy. It was subsequently held by the last of the F\u0101r\u016bki kings of Kh\u0101ndesh, and taken by Akbar after a long siege in 1600. An inscription cut in the rock records this event. The main gateway was built in the reign of Jah\u0101ng\u012br, and the mosque (subsequently used as a barrack) in the reign of Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n. A great bronze gun which was cast at Burh\u0101npur in 1665 formerly stood on the western bastion, but has recently been removed to Government House, N\u0101gpur. In 1803 As\u012brgarh was held by the Mar\u0101th\u0101s, and was taken by a detachment of General Wellesley\u2019s army shortly after the battle of Assaye, but was restored on the conclusion of peace. It was again besieged by\na British force in 1819, and taken after a siege of twenty days, during which there was a considerable amount of fighting, and the British lost a hundred native soldiers by an accidental explosion in a battery.\n\n**Asiwan.**\u2014Town in the Moh\u0101n tahsil of Unao District, United Provinces, situated in $26^\\circ 48' N.$ and $80^\\circ 28' E.$, on the bank of a fine lake 20 miles north of Unao town. Population (1901), 6,153. It is said to have been founded in the eleventh century by a dhobi or washerman, named Asun, but has no history. Asiwan contains a number of mosques and temples, and a fine masonry sarai built early in the nineteenth century. There is a small manufacture of coarse cotton cloth, and a market is held twice a week. A school has about 98 pupils.\n\n**Aska Tahsil.**\u2014Zam\u012bnd\u0101r\u012b tahsil in the interior of Ganj\u0101m District, Madras, lying between $19^\\circ 15' \\text{ and } 19^\\circ 45' N.$ and $84^\\circ 18' \\text{ and } 84^\\circ 45' E.$, with an area of 407 square miles. It consists of the zam\u012bnd\u0101ris of Dh\u0101r\u0101kota, Serugada, and Chinnakimedi, and the proprietary estates of Aska, Kurla, and Devabh\u016bmi. The population in 1901 was 115,883, compared with 108,920 in 1891. They live in 368 villages. The demand for land revenue and cesses in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 1,25,000. The land is fertile and well irrigated by the Rushikulya Project and other sources. Rice is widely cultivated, and sugar-cane is extensively grown and made into sugar in a factory at Aska, the head-quarters.\n\n**Aska Village.**\u2014Head-quarters of the tahsil of the same name in Ganj\u0101m District, Madras, situated in $19^\\circ 36' N.$ and $84^\\circ 40' E.$, midway on the road from Berhampur to Russellkonda, immediately above the confluence of the Rushikulya and Mah\u0101n\u0101di rivers. Population (1901), 4,031. It is chiefly known for its sugar factory and distillery, which belong to Mr. F. J. V. Minchin, and in 1903 employed an average of 393 hands daily. The principal feature of its operations is the extraction of sugar direct from the cane by the diffusion process. This is worked by a battery imported from Austria, and it is stated that 25 per cent. more sugar can thus be extracted than by powerful cane mills driven by steam. In 1903 the out-turn of sugar was valued at Rs. 1,71,000, and that of spirit at Rs. 79,000. The sugar is chiefly disposed of in the Berhampur market, and the spirit is supplied to the excise tracts of the District under a monopoly contract with the Government. The season for sugar manufacture is from January to the end of March. Besides country spirit, other alcoholic liquors are manufactured in the works and also aerated waters. Aska is the head-quarters of a District Munsif and the residence of the proprietors of the Aska, Kurla, and Devabh\u016bmi estates. It possesses a town hall, the gift of Mr. Minchin, and a fine native chattram (resthouse) constructed from public subscriptions. A park is being laid out to commemorate the coronation of His Majesty the present King-Emperor.\nAskot.\u2014Estate in Almor\u0101 District, United Provinces, situated along the K\u0101li river, comprising 142 villages with an area of 400 square miles. The land revenue payable to Government is Rs. 1,450, and the cesses amount to Rs. 232, while the rent-roll is about Rs. 4,200. The estate belongs to a Surajbansi R\u0101jput, claiming descent from a younger branch of the Katy\u016bri R\u0101j\u0101s who once ruled Kumaun, and the head of the family bears the title of Rajw\u0101r. The Rajw\u0101rs of Askot were conquered by the Chands, but were left in possession of their estate on payment of tribute. In 1845 the estate was settled with the village occupants as a zam\u012bnd\u0101r\u012b in the plains; but subsequently the whole estate was settled with the Rajw\u0101r, who may now extend cultivation to his own profit, but cannot interfere with the possessions of the permanent tenants, as recorded in the village papers.\n\nAssam\u00b9.\u2014The Province of Assam, which lies on the north-eastern border of Bengal, and is one of the frontier Provinces of the Indian Empire, is situated between 22\u00b0 19\u2032 and 28\u00b0 16\u2032 N. and 89\u00b0 42\u2032 and 97\u00b0 12\u2032 E. It is bounded on the north by the eastern section of the great Him\u0101layan range, the frontier tribes from west to east being successively the Bhoti\u0101s of Bhut\u0101n, the Bhoti\u0101s of Towang\u2014a province subject to Lh\u0101sa\u2014Ak\u0101s, Dafl\u0101s, M\u012bris, Abors, and Mishmis; on the north-east by the Mishmi Hills, which sweep round the head of the Brahmaputra Valley; on the east by the mountains which are inhabited by Khamtis, Singphos, and various N\u0101g\u0101 tribes, and by the Burmese frontier where it marches with that of the State of Manipur; on the south by the Chin Hills, the Chittagong Hill Tracts, and the State of Hill Tippera; and on the west by the Bengal Districts of Tippera, Mymensingh, and Rangpur, the State of Cooch Beh\u0101r, and Jalpaiguri District. The total area of the Province, including the Native State of Manipur (8,456 square miles), is 61,682 square miles.\n\nThe name \u2018Assam\u2019 is, according to some, derived from the Sanskrit asama, which means \u2018peerless\u2019 or \u2018unequalled.\u2019 It has been suggested that this title was applied to the Shan invaders, now called Ahoms, and was transferred from them to the country that they conquered. This derivation is, however, open to the serious objection that in Assamese s is softened into h, as in the name of the tribe; and there is no apparent reason why it should have been retained in the name of the country.\n\n\u00b9 Since the following article was written the small Province of Assam has ceased to exist as a separate unit, and has been amalgamated with fifteen Districts of Northern and Eastern Bengal to form the larger Province of Eastern Bengal and Assam, which is ruled by a Lieutenant-Governor, with a Legislative Council. The account of the general administrative staff, the various departments, and the system of legislation is thus obsolete; and the arrangements which are now in force will be found described in the article on Eastern Bengal and Assam. The remainder of the article affords a generally correct account of that portion of the new Province which was once known as Assam.\nIt is doubtful also whether either the Ahoms themselves, or the tribes they found in occupation of the country, would use a Sanskrit term to denote the dominant race.\n\nThe Province falls into three natural divisions: the valley of the Surm\u0101 or Bar\u0101k, the valley of the Brahmaputra or Assam proper, and the intervening range of hills. The Native State of Manipur, which lies east of C\u0101ch\u0101r, is under the control of the Local Administration, and the hills to the south of that District inhabited by the Lushais have recently been brought under British rule.\n\nThe Surm\u0101 Valley is a flat plain about 125 miles long by 60 wide, shut in on three sides by ranges of hills. The river from which the valley takes its name rises on the southern slopes of the mountain ranges on the borders of the N\u0101g\u0101 Hills District, and flows south through the Manipur hills. At Tipaimukh, it turns sharply to the north and takes a tortuous course, with a generally westward direction, through C\u0101ch\u0101r District. On the western boundary of C\u0101ch\u0101r it divides into two branches, the northern of which, known as the Surm\u0101, flows near the Kh\u0101si Hills past Sylhet and Chh\u0101tak, till it turns south at Sun\u0101mganj. The southern branch, called at first the Kusiy\u0101r\u0101, again divides into two streams, known as the Bar\u0101k and the Bibiy\u0101n\u0101, or K\u0101lni, but both branches rejoin the Surm\u0101 on the western boundary of the Province. The chief tributaries of the river on the north, after it enters British territory, are the J\u012bri and J\u0101ting\u0101 from the North C\u0101ch\u0101r Hills, and the Bogap\u0101ni and J\u0101duk\u0101ta from the Kh\u0101si and Jainti\u0101 Hills. On the south it receives from the Lushai Hills the Sonai, the Dhaleswari with its second channel the K\u0101t\u0101kh\u0101l, and the Singl\u0101; and the Langai, Manu, and Khowai from Hill Tippera.\n\nThe western end of the valley lies very low, and at Sylhet the low-water level of the Surm\u0101 is only 22\u00b77 feet above the sea. The banks of the rivers are raised by deposits of silt above the level of the surrounding country, and are lined with villages, which in the rainy season appear to be standing in a huge lake. Farther east the country rises, and fields covered with sail (transplanted winter rice) take the place of swamps, in which only the longest-stemmed varieties of paddy can be grown; but even here there are numerous depressions, or haors as they are called, in the lowest parts of which water remains during the dry season, and which can be used only for grazing or the growth of winter crops. In western Sylhet the houses of the villagers are crowded together, gardens and fruit trees are scarce, and the scenery at all seasons of the year is tame and uninteresting. C\u0101ch\u0101r and the eastern portion of Sylhet have, on the other hand, much to please the eye. Blue hills bound the view on almost every side, the villages are buried in groves of slender palms, feathery bamboos, and broad-leaved plan-\ntains, and even in the dry season the country looks fresh and green. The level of the plain is broken by low ranges and isolated hills, and here and there beds of reeds and marshes lend variety to the scene. Little or no forest exists in Sylhet, but there are extensive Reserves in the south and east of Cachar District.\n\nThe Brahmaputra Valley is an alluvial plain about 450 miles in length, with an average breadth of about 50 miles, shut in, like the Surma Valley, by hills on every side except the west. In its lower portion it lies almost east and west, but in its upper half it trends somewhat towards the north-east. The Brahmaputra flows through the centre of this plain, and receives in its course the drainage of the Himalayas on the north, and the Assam Range on the south. The principal tributaries on the north bank are the Dibang, Dihang, Subansiri, Bhareli, Dhansiri, Barnad\u012b, Manas with its tributary the Ai, the Champamati, Saralebhanga, and Sankosh; on the south, the greater affluents are the Noa, Buri Dihing, Disang, Dikho, Jhanzi, and another Dhansiri. A short distance below the junction with this Dhansiri a considerable body of water separates itself from the Brahmaputra, and, under the name of the Kalang, flows with a tortuous course through Nowgong District, rejoining the main stream about 10 miles above Gauhati. The Kalang receives the Kapili, which brings to it a large part of the drainage of the Mikir, the North Cachar, and the Jaintia Hills, and the Digru from the Khasi Hills. Below Gauhati the most considerable affluents on the south bank are the Kulsi and Jinjiram.\n\nThe valley, as a whole, is a plain of fairly uniform breadth, except in the centre, where the Mikir Hills project from the main mass of the Assam Range, almost up to the southern bank of the Brahmaputra. Between Tezpur and Dhubri there are outcrops of gneissic rock above the alluvium, even on the north bank of the river, and the central portion of Goalpara District is much broken by ranges of low hills; but elsewhere there is little to interrupt the even level of the plain.\n\nThe Brahmaputra, through the greater part of its course, is bounded on either side by stretches of marsh land covered with thick grass jungle, interspersed here and there with patches of mustard and summer rice. Farther inland the level rises, and there is a belt, usually of considerable breadth, of permanent cultivation. The plain is covered with rice-fields and dotted over with clumps of bamboos, palms, and fruit trees, in which are buried the houses of the cultivators. In most parts of the valley this belt supports a fairly dense population; but near the hills cultivation again falls off, and grassy plains and forests stretch to their feet. Even here, however, rice is grown on fields irrigated from the hill streams, and European enterprise has in many places felled the forests and opened prosperous tea gardens. Little of this is seen by the\ntraveller on the river steamer, and he is apt to receive the impression that Assam is a wilderness of impenetrable jungle, the home of nothing but wild beasts. This view is but partially correct. There are still large areas of waste land, swamps, forests, and hills; but in parts of the valley the population is beginning to press upon the soil, and little good land remains available for settlement. Few places in the Brahma putra Valley would not appeal to a lover of the picturesque. On a clear day the view to both the north and south is bounded by hills, while behind the lower ranges of the Him\u0101layas snowy peaks glisten in the sun. The rice-fields are interspersed with groves of feathery bamboos, on every side are pools, rivers, and woods, and in the wilder parts nature is seen freed from the restraining hand of man. The slopes of the lower hills are clothed with forest, and the rivers that debouch upon the plain issue through gorges of exceptional beauty.\n\nThe range of mountains which separates these two valleys projects at right angles from the Burmese system, and lies almost due east and west. At its western end it attains a height of more than 4,600 feet in the peak of Nokrek, above the station of Tur\u0101. The hills are here broken up into sharply-serrated ridges and deep valleys, all alike covered with forest. Farther east, in the Shillong peak, they reach a height of 6,450 feet; but this is only the highest point in a table-land hardly any part of which falls much below 6,000 feet. The denser forest growth has here disappeared, and there are wide stretches of rolling down, dotted with clumps of oak and pine. On their southern face the hills rise like a level wall abruptly from the plain, with occasionally a deep ravine, which the rivers, fed by the heavy rainfall of that region, have cut through the plateau. Towards the Jainti\u0101 and North Cach\u0101r Hills the level falls; but the Barail Range, which commences on the south-east margin of the Kh\u0101si-Jainti\u0101 plateau, rises by sudden leaps to a considerable height, and among the hills bordering the J\u0101ting\u0101 valley summits of from 5,000 to 6,000 feet are found. Farther east, the highest point in the Province is reached in J\u0101pvo, on the border of the N\u0101g\u0101 Hills District. The hills here are all of the serrated type, and their sides are clothed with forest or, on the sites of fallowing jh\u016bms\u00b9, with dense bamboo or grass jungle. The Lushai Hills, which divide Burma from Assam, run at right angles to the Assam Range in parallel ridges. They are for the most part covered with bamboo jungle and rank undergrowth, but in the eastern portion open grass-covered slopes are found, with groves of oak and pine, interspersed with rhododendron. The State of Manipur consists of a fertile valley, covering an area of about 650 square miles, surrounded by ranges of hills.\n\nNumerous swamps and jh\u016bls are found in both valleys, and during the rains the western portion of Sylhet lies under water; but in British\n\n\u00b9 A jh\u016bm is a piece of land which has been cleared and cultivated for two or three seasons and then allowed a rest for several years, see p. 55.\nterritory there are no lakes of any considerable importance during the dry season. In Manipur the Loktak, a sheet of water covering about 27 square miles, lies to the south of Imphal, the capital town. The only island of any size is the Majuli, a tract of land covering 485 square miles in Sibsagar District, which is surrounded by the waters of the Brahmaputra and the Subansiri.\n\nThe Surma Valley is an alluvial tract, in which the process of deltaic formation has not proceeded so rapidly as in the rest of the Gangetic plain. Disastrous floods were more common at the end of the eighteenth century than they are at the present day, and it seems possible that the general level may have been appreciably raised within the last hundred years, by the silting up of depressions and the sediment deposited by the rivers in their annual inundations. Low ranges of hills, which for the most part consist of Upper Tertiary sandstones, project into the valley from the south; and its surface is dotted with isolated hills called tilas, from 50 to 200 feet high, composed of layers of sand, clay, and gravel, often highly indurated with ferruginous cement. In the centre of the Assam Valley the soil consists of a light layer of clay superimposed upon beds of sand. Farther back from the Brahmaputra the alluvium is more consolidated, and here and there are to be found the remains of an older alluvium of a closer and heavier texture, which corresponds to the high land of the Gangetic plain. Outliers of gneissic rock from the Assam Range are common between Goalpara and Gauhati, and are found as far east as Tezpur.\n\n1 The basis of the Assam Range is a gneissic rock. At its western end sandstones and conglomerates, which are referable to the Cretaceous system, are superimposed upon the gneiss, and are themselves overlaid by limestone and sandstone of the Nummulitic age. Farther eastwards what is known as the Shillong plateau rises steeply from the Surma Valley, but on its northern face falls away in a series of low hills towards the Brahmaputra. The gneiss is here succeeded by the Shillong or transition series, which consists of quartzites, conglomerates, phyllites, and schists, through which appear granite and dioritic rocks. Upon this series have been superimposed sandstones and conglomerates of the Cretaceous age, which contain occasional coal seams, and which are in their turn overlaid by beds of the Nummulitic or Lower Tertiary period, consisting of limestone and sandstone with interstratified shales and coal deposits. Along the southern edge of the plateau in the neighbourhood of Cherrapunji, a group of bedded basaltic rocks, known as the Sylhet trap, has been forced up between the Cretaceous and the older formations. The Mymensingh border is\n\n1 This section has been compiled from notes furnished by Mr. P. N. Bose, of the Geological Survey of India, and from an account of Assam by Sir Charles Lyall, published in the General Administration Report of the Province for 1882-3.\nfringed by low ranges of hills of Upper Tertiary formation; and though this series has been almost entirely removed by denudation below the southern scarp of the Kh\u0101si Hills, they appear again east of Jaintiapur, and their soft, massive, greenish sandstones rise rapidly from this point into the Barail range. This range appears to have thrust the Nummulitic and older formations in a north-easterly direction; but west of C\u0101ch\u0101r it curves to the north-east, and finally merges into the Burmese mountain system, of which it forms a part. Little is known of the eastern extremity of the Assam Range; but it appears that the Upper Tertiary sandstones are succeeded by a series of hard sandstones, slates, and shales with quartzose beds, while still farther east serpentine dikes, identical in composition with those of Burma, run north and south. Upper Tertiary rocks are believed to constitute the P\u0101tkai range, and are found again capping the hills which look down upon the Chindwin valley, but between these two points there intervenes a belt of pre-Tertiary beds about 100 miles in width. The hills containing the coal measures of Sibs\u0101gar and Lakhimpur consist of an enormous thickness of sandstones, the upper series of which are topped with conglomerates and clay. The Himalayas north of the Brahmaputra have never been properly explored, but there is reason to suppose that they are composed of great thicknesses of soft massive sandstones, of Tertiary age and fresh-water origin. The economic aspect of the geology of the Province is referred to in the section on Mines and Minerals.\n\nThe uncultivated portions of the Assam Valley are usually covered with forest, or with grass and reeds which are sometimes nearly 20 feet in height. The three commonest varieties are ikra (Saccharum arundinaceum), nal (Phragmites Roxburghii), and khagari (Saccharum spontaneum). At the western end the prevalent tree is s\u0101l (Shorea robusta); but farther east the forests are evergreen, the chief constituents being species of Amoora, Michelia, Magnolia, Stereospermum, Quercus, Castanopsis, Ficus, and Mesua. Various kinds of palms, canes, tree-ferns, bamboos, and plantain-trees are common. The vegetation of Sylhet and C\u0101ch\u0101r does not differ materially from that of Eastern Bengal. There is comparatively little forest, but in the swampy parts numerous species of reeds and aquatic plants are found. The greater part of the Assam Range is covered with dense tree forest or bamboo jungle, but the Kh\u0101si plateau is a fine succession of rolling downs dotted with groves of oak and pine. The flora of this tract is extremely rich, and upwards of 2,000 flowering plants were collected by Dr. Hooker within ten miles of Cherrapunji, while various kinds of orchids and balsams, rhododendrons, azaleas, and wild roses are found on every side. The N\u0101g\u0101 and Manipur Hills have a flora in many respects similar to that of the Kh\u0101si Hills, but in addition possess a distinct Sikkim element, while the Lushai Hills are botanically part of the Burmese system.\nThe most noteworthy wild animals are elephants, rhinoceros, tigers, leopards, bears, wild dogs, wild hog, deer, buffaloes, and bison (*Bos gaurus*). The *mithan* or *gay\u0101l* (*Bos frontalis*) has been domesticated by the wild tribes, but it is doubtful whether it is now found in Assam in a wild state. Rhinoceros are of three kinds: the large variety (*unicornis*), which lives in the swamps that fringe the Brahmaputra; the smaller variety (*sondaicus*), which is occasionally met with in the same locality; and the small two-horned rhinoceros (*sumatrensis*), which is now and again seen in the hills south of the Surm\u0101 Valley, though its ordinary habitat is Sumatra, Borneo, and the Malay Peninsula. The ordinary varieties of deer found in the Province are the *s\u0101mbhar* (*Cervus unicolor*), the *b\u0101rasingha* or swamp deer (*Cervus duvauceli*), the hog deer (*Cervus porcinus*), and the barking-deer (*Cervus muntjac*). Goat-antelopes (*Nemorhaedus bubalinus* and *Cemas goral*) are occasionally met with on the higher hills, but are scarce and shy. Elephants are found in considerable numbers in the Assam Valley and in the lower slopes of the Assam Range. They are also occasionally hunted with success in South C\u0101ch\u0101r and in South-eastern Sylhet. Extensive operations have been undertaken by the Government Khedda department; and *mah\u0101ls*, or the right of hunting within certain areas not reserved for that department, are leased by auction sale to the highest bidder, who pays a royalty of Rs. 100 on each animal captured. During the period when the Government *kheddas* were working in the G\u0101ro Hills about 400 elephants were annually captured in the Province. Small game include florican, partridges, pheasants, pea- and jungle-fowl, wild geese and ducks, snipe, and hares. Excellent mahseer fishing is also obtained in some of the rivers.\n\nThe climate of Assam is characterized by coolness and extreme humidity, the natural result of the great water surface and extensive forests over which evaporation and condensation proceed, and the close proximity of the hill ranges, on which an excessive precipitation takes place. Its most distinguishing feature is the copious rainfall between March and May, at a time when precipitation over Upper India is at its minimum. The year is thus roughly divided into two seasons, the cold season and the rains, the hot season of the rest of India being completely absent. From the beginning of November till the end of February the climate is cool and extremely pleasant, and at no period of the year is the heat excessive. Table I, appended to this article, shows the mean temperature and diurnal range in January, May, July, and November at Silchar, Sibs\u0101gar, and Dhubri, the only stations in the Province at which observations have been systematically recorded for any considerable period. Except in the height of the rains, the mean temperature is appreciably lower at Sibs\u0101gar than at Dhubri.\nThis is partly due to the heavy fogs, which in the cold season frequently hang over the upper part of the Brahmaputra Valley till a late hour of the day, and prevent the country from being warmed by the rays of the sun. In the Surm\u0101 Valley the thermometer in the winter is from five to six degrees higher than in Upper Assam, but during the remainder of the year the climate of Sylhet is fairly cool. C\u0101ch\u0101r has a higher mean temperature for the year than any other District in the Province. On the Shillong plateau the thermometer seldom rises above $80^\\circ$ in the shade at the hottest season of the year, and ice forms on shallow pools in the winter nights. Fogs occur in the Surm\u0101 Valley, but not so commonly as in Central and Upper Assam, where at certain seasons of the year they are a serious impediment to steamer traffic. In the Surm\u0101 Valley the prevailing wind is from the south-west, except in the months of April and May, when it has a north-north-east direction. In the Brahmaputra Valley the wind is usually from the north-east. During July and August the wind blows from the south-west in Assam proper and from the south-east in Go\u0101lp\u0101ra District.\n\nThe total amount of rain that falls in Assam during the year is always abundant, but is sometimes unfavourably distributed. In the Surm\u0101 Valley, the average rainfall is 157 inches at Sylhet, and 124 at Silchar. To the south of the valley precipitation is less pronounced, but deluges of rain fall on the southern slopes of the Kh\u0101si Hills, and pour down into the valley. The annual rainfall at Cher-rapunji averages 458 inches, and 905 inches are said to have fallen in 1861, of which 503 inches were recorded in the months of June and July. Go\u0101lp\u0101ra and Lakhimpur, at the two ends of the Assam Valley, receive about 115 inches of rain during the year. K\u0101mr\u016bp, Nowgong, and Darrang are to some extent protected by the high plateaux of the Kh\u0101si Hills, and the rainfall of these Districts ranges from 71 to 77 inches. At Lank\u0101, in the Kapili valley in Nowgong, the average fall is less than 43 inches; but a little to the east the level of the hills that separate the Brahmaputra and Surm\u0101 Valleys drops, and the rainfall in Sibs\u0101gar rises to 85 inches. The percentage of variability on the average annual fall is 70 in the Surm\u0101 and 68 in the Assam Valley. The rainfall in the Hill Districts is ample; but at the few stations at which observations have been recorded its character is largely determined by local conditions, and the average rainfall of this region is probably larger than the figures would suggest. Statistics of monthly rainfall are shown in Table II, appended to this article.\n\nStorms often occur in the spring months, generally accompanied by high winds and heavy local rainfall, but seldom take the form of destructive cyclones. Two such, however, visited the country at the foot of the G\u0101ro Hills in 1900, destroying everything in their path, and\nkilling forty-four people. The Province has always suffered more from floods than from a failure of the water-supply. The rainfall, which is everywhere heavy, is in places enormous, and the rivers are frequently unable to carry off the torrents of water suddenly precipitated on their catchment areas. In Mughal times the country in the neighbourhood of the upper portion of the Bar\u0101k was protected by an embankment; but at the western end of the Surm\u0101 Valley it has always been impossible to restrain the torrential floods, and the whole surface of the plain goes under water. In 1781 a sudden rise of the rivers wrought such utter desolation that, in spite of the efforts of Government, nearly one-third of the population died of famine; but, though inundations annually occur, no such calamities have been known in recent years. In the Assam Valley floods were always one of the chief obstacles to the Muhammadan invaders; and the rivers in Sibs\u0101gar, where there was a large Ahom population, were protected by strong embankments. With the disappearance of the native system of compulsory labour, these works were allowed to fall into disrepair, but steps have recently been taken for the restoration of the more important among them. Except in a few places, where the high bank comes down to the water\u2019s edge, the floods of the Brahmaputra render a broad belt of land on either side of the river unfit for ordinary cultivation in the rains, and a considerable amount of local damage is sometimes done by the spill water of its tributaries. The earthquake of 1897 in some way affected the drainage channels and levels of the country, and since that date the floods, especially in Lower Assam, have been of greater duration and intensity. Large tracts, which used formerly to bear rich crops of mustard, now remain too long under water to admit of seed being sown; and special works have been rendered necessary for the protection of Go\u0101lp\u0101ra and Barpet\u0101, as after the earthquake these towns were found to be below flood-level. The condition of Barpet\u0101 in particular has been much improved by drainage works, in which the people co-operated without payment.\n\nAssam has always been subject to earthquakes. In A.D. 1607 hills are said to have been rent asunder and swallowed up: and M'Cosh, writing in 1837, reports that, some twenty years before, a village standing on a knoll near Go\u0101lp\u0101ra completely disappeared, a pool of water appearing in its place. Severe shocks were felt at Silchar in 1869 and 1882, and in 1875 some damage was done to houses in Shillong and Gauh\u0101ti. All previous seismic disturbances were, however, completely eclipsed by the earthquake of June 12, 1897, which was the most severe and disastrous of which there is any record in Assam. The station of Shillong was levelled with the ground; and women and children were for several days exposed to drenching rain, with no better shelter than could be obtained from a few tents, tumbledown stables, and sheds\nwithout floors or walls. Nearly all masonry buildings in Gauh\u0101ti and Sylhet were completely wrecked, and much damage was done in Go\u0101lp\u0101ra, Nowgong, and Darrang. Two Europeans and 1,540 natives lost their lives, the majority of the latter being killed by landslips in the hills and by the falling in of river banks in Sylhet. Roads and bridges were destroyed, and the drainage of the country was seriously affected by the silting-up of streams and watercourses. The total cost incurred on special repairs to public works necessitated by the earthquake exceeded 37 lakhs, but, even with this sum, it was impossible to restore them to their former condition. Of the damage done to private property it is difficult to form an estimate.\n\nThe early history of the Province is very obscure. In the two great river valleys, especially in that of the Surm\u0101, the population contains a certain admixture of Dravidian blood; but, in the main, Assam has drawn its inhabitants from the vast hive of the Mongolian race in Western China, which in very ancient times threw off a series of swarms that afterwards found their way into the frontier lands of India\u2014some to the west, ascending the Tsan-po or upper course of the Brahmaputra, and so along the northern slopes of the Him\u0101layas; some to the south, down the courses of the Chindwin, Irrawaddy, Salween, Menam, and Mekong rivers, peopling Burma, Siam, and the adjoining countries; and some to the south-west, descending the Brahmaputra to Assam and thence far into Bengal. It is with these last that we are here concerned. Their main line of movement was probably along the banks of the Brahmaputra; and as each swarm was forced to yield to the pressure from behind, it either moved on westwards or turned aside into the hills of the Assam Range.\n\nThe first mention of the country which we now call Assam is found in the epics and religious legends of Gangetic India, but it is not yet possible to unravel the slender thread of real fact from the tangled skein of fable, invention, and poetical exaggeration. Aryan priests and warriors undoubtedly found their way thither in very early times, but they were wanting in the historical instinct, and have left no trustworthy record behind them. Various places mentioned in the story of Krishna and in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata are now identified with sites in the Province; but many of them are also claimed, probably with better reason, by other parts of India. Among much that is vague or dubious one fact stands out clearly. There is no doubt that the temple of Sakti, Siva\u2019s consort, at K\u0101makhy\u0101 near Gauh\u0101ti, was famous in very ancient times, and that it was a great centre of the bloody and sensual form of worship inculcated in the Tantras, which probably had its origin there. The K\u0101lik\u0101 Pur\u0101na and Jogini Tantra preserve the names of several kings, whose titles, D\u0101vana and Asura, betray their aboriginal descent, and\nwho were followed by Naraka, the reputed founder of the ancient and famous city of Pr\u0101gjyotishapura, the modern Gauh\u0101ti. According to tradition, Naraka ruled from the Karatoy\u0101 river to the extreme east of the Brahmaputra Valley, and met his death at the hands of Krishna. He was succeeded by his son Bhagadatta, whose name finds frequent mention in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata as the Lord of Pr\u0101gjyotisha and the powerful ally of Duryodhana: he had, it is narrated, a great army of Chinas and Kir\u0101tas, but was defeated and slain by Arjuna on the fatal field of Kurukshetra.\n\nReliable history is first reached in the narrative of the Chinese pilgrim Hiuen Tsiang, who visited the country then known as K\u0101mar\u016bpa, about A.D. 640, and found it occupied by a race with a dark yellow complexion, small in stature and fierce in appearance, but upright and studious. Their king was Kum\u0101ra Bh\u0101skara Varman\u00b9, and they followed the Br\u0101hmanical religion.\n\nOf the next few centuries our knowledge is very slight; but the gloom is to some extent dispelled by the recent discovery of several inscribed copperplates\u00b2, which appear to have been prepared between the latter part of the tenth and the middle of the twelfth century. The primary object of these inscriptions was to recite the grant of land to Br\u0101hmans; but to us their most interesting part is the preamble, wherein some account is given of the chief by whom each grant was made and of his ancestry. It would seem that, soon after Hiuen Tsiang's departure, the country fell into the hands of a line of aboriginal chiefs who were subsequently converted to Hinduism. Then followed a dynasty founded by one Pralambha, who killed or banished all the members of the previous ruling family. The sixth in descent from him was Bala Varman, in whose reign the first of the copperplate documents above referred to was executed. These kings were worshippers of Siva; their capital was at a place called H\u0101ruppeswara, but they still called themselves Lords of Pr\u0101gjyotisha. Early in the eleventh century they were succeeded by a fresh line of kings, who, like their predecessors, claimed descent from the mythical Naraka. The third prince of this family was Ratnap\u0101la, 'the mighty crusher of his enemies, who studded the earth with whitewashed temples and the skies with the smoke of his burnt offerings.' He got much wealth from his copper mines (in Bhut\u0101n?); and he erected, it is alleged, pillar monuments of his victories, and built a new capital, which became the home of many wealthy merchants, learned men, priests, and poets. Some time later\n\n\u00b9 Varman is a Kshattriya title, but it is often assumed by aristocratic converts to Hinduism.\n\u00b2 Dr. Hoernle's readings of some of these plates, which were obtained by Mr. F. A. Gait and sent to him for decipherment, will be found in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal for 1897.\nthe country seems to have been conquered, first by the Sen kings of Bengal, and then by their rivals, the well-known P\u0101l dynasty, whose vassal, Tishya Deva, rebelled about 1133 and was defeated by the P\u0101l general Vaidyadeva, who in his turn seems to have made himself practically independent. The area ruled by these different kings varied greatly from time to time. Sometimes it stretched as far west as the Karatoy\u0101 river and, if their panegyrists can be believed, as far south as the sea-coast, including within its limits the Surm\u0101 Valley, Eastern Bengal, and, occasionally, Bhut\u0101n; at other times, it did not even comprise the whole of what is now known as the Brahmaputra Valley; sometimes again, and perhaps this was the more usual condition, the country was split up into a number of petty principalities each under its own chief. The Surm\u0101 Valley, at any rate, was usually independent of the kings of K\u0101mar\u016bpa. The early history of this tract is even more obscure than that of the Brahmaputra Valley. We know, however, from copperplate inscriptions that in the first half of the thirteenth century it was ruled by a king named Govinda Deva, and subsequently by his son Is\u0101na Deva; but we possess little information regarding them beyond the fact that they were Hindus.\n\nAccording to the traditions of the Mah\u0101purushias, Lower Assam and the adjacent part of Bengal subsequently formed a kingdom called K\u0101mat\u0101, and its ruler at the beginning of the fourteenth century was named Durlabh N\u0101r\u0101yan. In the fifteenth century a line of Khen kings rose to power in the same tract of the country. The third and last of this line, Nil\u0101mbar, was overthrown in 1498 by Husain Sh\u0101h, the Muhammadan king of Bengal, who, after a long siege, took the capital, K\u0101matapur, by a stratagem.\n\nA few years later Biswa Singh laid the foundation of the Koch kingdom, and, after defeating the local chiefs, built himself a capital in Cooch Beh\u0101r. The Koch tribe, though now in parts much intermixed with Dravidian stock, was probably at that time purely Mongolian and spoke a language closely allied to those of the Kach\u0101ris, Tipperas, Lalungs, Chutiy\u0101s, and G\u0101ros. Biswa Singh was succeeded by his son Nar N\u0101r\u0101yan, who extended his kingdom in all directions. He defeated, among others, the chiefs of Dimaru\u0101, Jainti\u0101, Khairam, C\u0101ch\u0101r, and Tippera, and also the Ahom R\u0101j\u0101, whose capital he occupied until pacified by presents, hostages, and a promise of tribute. He met his match, however, in Isa Kh\u0101n, the Muhammadan chief or Bhuiya of Son\u0101rgaon in Eastern Bengal, who defeated his army and took prisoner his brother Sukladhwaj, to whose military genius he had been mainly indebted for his successes elsewhere. In 1581 the latter's son, Raghu, having rebelled, was given the country east of the Sankosh, Nar N\u0101r\u0101yan retaining for himself the portion west of that river, where he was succeeded, on his death in 1584, by his son Lakshmi N\u0101r\u0101yan.\nThis dismemberment of the kingdom quickly led to its dissolution, but we must first deal with the state of things in other parts of the Brahmaputra Valley.\n\nEarly in the thirteenth century an event occurred at the eastern extremity of the valley which was destined to change the whole course of Assam history. This was the invasion of the Ahoms, a Shan tribe from the ancient kingdom of Mungmau or Pong, which was situated in the upper portion of the Irrawaddy valley\\(^1\\). A quarrel as to the right of succession to the throne is said to have been the cause of the secession of Sukapha, one of the rival claimants, who, after wandering about the country between the Irrawaddy and the P\u0101tkai mountains for some years, crossed the range in 1228 with a small following and entered the tract which now forms the southern part of Lakhimpur District and the south-east of Sibs\u0101gar. It was at that time inhabited by petty tribes of Bodo affinities (Morans and Borahis), who were easily subdued: the country round Sadiy\u0101, the northern part of the headquarters subdivision of Lakhimpur and the north-eastern part of Sibs\u0101gar as far as the Dis\u0101ng river, which had previously been governed by a line of P\u0101l kings, were then under the rule of the Chutiy\u0101s, who had established a kingdom of considerable power; while the Kach\u0101ris occupied the western part of Sibs\u0101gar, the valley of the Dhansiri, and the greater part of Nowgong. Sukapha, finding his further progress barred, settled down among the Morans and Borahis, who were gradually absorbed into the Ahom community, a process that was accelerated by frequent intermarriages due to the paucity of Ahom women. In this way, aided probably by fresh streams of immigration from Pong, the Ahoms increased rapidly in numbers and power. Early in the fourteenth century there is a vague reference to a war with a R\u0101j\u0101 of K\u0101mata, who, it is said, was forced to sue for peace. A few years later the Ahoms became involved in a war with the Chutiy\u0101s. In 1376 the latter pretended to make peace, and then treacherously murdered the Ahom king, Sutupha, at a regatta on the Safrai river, held to celebrate the cessation of hostilities. This led to a renewal of the war; the Chutiy\u0101s were worsted, but their final overthrow did not take place until 1523, when Suhunmung, otherwise known as the Dihingia R\u0101j\u0101, who reigned from 1497 to 1539, utterly defeated them with heavy slaughter and annexed their country, which he placed in charge of an Ahom viceroy called the Sadiy\u0101-khowa Gohain. A number of Ahoms from Gargaon were settled at Sadiy\u0101, while the leading families of the Chutiy\u0101s were deported to a place not far from Tezpur, and many of\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The account here given of the Ahom kings is based mainly on manuscript buranjis, or histories written in the Ahom language and character on strips of bark of the s\u0101chi or agar tree (*Aquilaria Agallocha*). In former times all the leading families had their own buranjis, which were written up from time to time; many of these have disappeared, but a number still survive, and translations of these have been prepared.\ntheir artisans were brought to the Ahom capital. Meanwhile, there had been numerous expeditions against various N\u0101g\u0101 tribes, which were generally successful; and in 1490 the first war occurred with the Kach\u0101ris, by whom the Ahoms were defeated on the banks of the Dikho river. This set-back was, however, only temporary; and little more than thirty years afterwards we find the Dihingia R\u0101j\u0101, whose victory over the Chutiy\u0101s has just been mentioned, fighting with the Kach\u0101ris on the bank of the Dhansiri. The Kach\u0101ris won a few minor successes, but in the end they were utterly vanquished. Their king was deposed and a new ruler named Detsung installed in his place. In 1536 hostilities again broke out; Detsung was taken and killed; his capital at Dimapur was sacked; and the Kach\u0101ris were shorn of all their possessions in the valley of the Dhansiri and north of the Kalang river in Nowgong.\n\nThe Dihingia R\u0101j\u0101, like so many Ahom kings, met his death at the hands of an assassin, who was instigated, it is said, by his own son. His reign is memorable, not only for the extirpation of Chutiy\u0101 and Kach\u0101ri rule from the valley of the Brahmaputra and (it is alleged) for the acknowledgement of his supremacy by the Koch king Biswa Singh, but also for the repulse of two Muhammadan expeditions. The second of these, in 1532, was led by a commander named Turbak, who worsted the Ahoms in several engagements, but was at last utterly defeated on the bank of the Bhareli river. He himself was slain with large numbers of his followers, and many were taken prisoners and settled in the Ahom country: these are reputed to be the ancestors of the Mori\u0101s. The use of fire-arms by the Ahoms dates from the close of this war. These two expeditions, though the first in which the Muhammadans are recorded to have come into collision with the Ahoms, were not by any means the earliest invasions by them of country now included within the Province of Assam. In 1384 they had conquered and annexed Sylhet, excluding the submontane tracts in the north and south, which were held by Jainti\u0101s and Tipperas, and at an even earlier date they had begun to harry the lower portion of the Brahmaputra Valley; but here, though their superior arms and discipline generally brought them a temporary success, their expeditions all ended in failure, induced by disease, ignorance of the country, the difficulty of communications, especially during the rainy season, and the impossibility of bringing up reinforcements to repair losses.\n\nThe power of the Ahoms continued to grow and their dominions to expand, and there was almost constant warfare between them and one or other of their neighbours\u2014Nar\u0101s\u00b9, N\u0101g\u0101s, Kach\u0101ris, and Kochs.\n\n\u00b9 The Nar\u0101s occupied the country round Mogaung on the other side of the P\u0101tkai. They are commonly regarded as Shams, but Ney Elias thought that they included in their composition a large aboriginal element.\nThey were nearly always successful; but they sustained a crushing defeat at the hands of the Koch king, Nar N\u0101r\u0101yan, whose capture of the Ahom capital has already been referred to. Their recovery from this reverse was, however, extraordinarily rapid, and a fresh turn in the wheel of fortune soon gave them their revenge.\n\nNar N\u0101r\u0101yan was succeeded in the Western Koch kingdom by his son Lakshmi N\u0101r\u0101yan, who soon became embroiled with Par\u012bkshit, the son of Raghu and his successor in the eastern kingdom. Being unable to hold his own, Lakshmi N\u0101r\u0101yan invoked the aid of the Muhammadans, who took Parikshit's fort at Dhubri and soon afterwards invested his capital at Barnagar on the Man\u0101s. Parikshit held out there for a time, but was at last forced to surrender and was sent a prisoner to Delhi, while his brother Bali N\u0101r\u0101yan fled to the Ahom king, Prat\u0101p Singh, who refused to give him up.\n\nThe Muhammadans, therefore, invaded the Ahom country with a force of from 10,000 to 12,000 horse and foot and 400 large ships. They gained a victory near the mouth of the Bhareli river, but were soon afterwards annihilated in a night attack. Prat\u0101p Singh thereupon installed Bali N\u0101r\u0101yan as successor to Parikshit, and advanced and took Pandu near Gauh\u0101ti, which he fortified. He next laid siege to H\u00e1jo, but was driven back. The war dragged on in Lower Assam for some years with varying success, but in 1637 the governor of Dacca determined to take more vigorous measures, and he dispatched what was practically a new army. This measure met with immediate success. The Ahoms were driven out of K\u0101mr\u016bp, Bali N\u0101r\u0101yan was killed, and a treaty was made by which the Barnadi was taken as the boundary between Ahom and Muhammadan territory.\n\nThe Koch kings continued to rule west of the Sankosh as vassals of the Muhammadans; but when the Mughal emperor Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n fell sick in 1658, Pr\u0101n N\u0101r\u0101yan, who was then on the throne, took advantage of the confusion ensuing on the wars of succession to throw off his allegiance, and defeated the Muhammadan fanjdar of Go\u0101lp\u0101ra. The latter retreated to Gauh\u0101ti, but was driven thence by the Ahom king, Jayadhwaj Singh. Pr\u0101n N\u0101r\u0101yan proposed to the latter a friendly division of Lower Assam, but his overtures were rejected and he was soon compelled to retreat beyond the Sankosh. The whole of the Brahmaputra Valley thus fell into the hands of the Ahoms.\n\nWhen order was restored in Bengal, and M\u012br Jumla became governor at Dacca, he first attacked and defeated Pr\u0101n N\u0101r\u0101yan, and then advanced against the Ahoms, with an army, according to their writers, of 12,000 horse and 30,000 foot and a powerful fleet. The Ahoms were worsted on both land and water, and were gradually driven back. In spite of the great difficulty of locomotion due to the numerous water-courses and the vast expanse of dense jungle, M\u012br Jumla marched\nsteadily up the south bank of the Brahmaputra, his fleet keeping pace with his army, and at last occupied Gargaon, the Ahom capital, where he halted for the wet season, which was now close at hand. The rains set in with unexampled severity, and the country soon became a quagmire. Supplies were hard to get and the Ahoms harassed the Mughals by repeated night attacks, and destroyed some outlying garrisons and isolated detachments. As the rains progressed, the position of the Muhammadans became more and more trying; and to the terrors of a persistent but unseen enemy were added severe epidemics of disease, especially dysentery. Mir Jumla himself did not escape. Broken in health, he found himself unable to resist the clamour of his troops to be led back to Bengal; early in the cold season a treaty was patched up, and he hurried back to Dacca, where he died soon afterwards. The Muhammadan historians have left on record an interesting account of their opponents. Their resources were considerable, and in the course of the expedition the Musalm\u0101ns captured more than 1,000 war sloops from the enemy, many of which could accommodate from three to four score sailors. They also took nearly 700 guns, some of them of considerable size. Extensive fortifications had been erected on both sides of the river near Tezpur, and the country between Kali\u0101bar and Gargaon was said to be well cultivated and adorned with gardens and orchards. Gargaon itself was a town of considerable size, and the historian waxes enthusiastic over the splendours of the R\u0101j\u0101's palace. The genuine Ahoms are described as keen and fearless soldiers, but their number was not large, and the Kalit\u0101 levies were of very small account. The Ahoms lost no time in retaking the country they had lost; and two years later we find them in undisputed possession of the whole of K\u0101mr\u016bp, and the advance guard of the Mughals located at Rang\u0101m\u0101ti in Go\u0101lp\u0101ra\u00b9. For a time, however, internal troubles and a long series of conspiracies threatened to do what external aggression had failed to effect, and in the brief space of eleven years there were no less than seven Ahom kings, not one of whom died a natural death. The Muhammadans took advantage of these disturbances to recover possession of Gauh\u0101ti, but they were finally driven out in the reign of Gadadhar Singh, who ascended the throne in 1681.\n\nThe next king, Rudra Singh, being free from all fear of Muhammadan invasion and secure in his possession of K\u0101mr\u016bp, began to extend his kingdom in other directions. He took the south of Nowgong from the Kach\u0101ris and occupied Maibang in the North Cach\u0101r Hills, whither they had removed their capital on being ousted from Dim\u0101pur.\n\n\u00b9 Not the least interesting of the relics of this period is a cannon now at Dikom bearing two inscriptions, the one in Persian stating that it had been made for use in the conquest of Assam, and the other in Sanskrit recording the fact that the Ahoms had taken it from the Muhammadans in battle.\nHe also contemplated an invasion of their dominions in the Cach\u0101r plains, which one of their R\u0101j\u0101s had obtained as a gift from a Tippera king on the occasion of his marriage with the latter's daughter; but his troops suffered so much from sickness during the rainy season that he was obliged to desist. Meanwhile, the Kach\u0101ri king, Tamradhwaj, had invoked the aid of the Jainti\u0101s, a section of the Kh\u0101si tribe, inhabiting the eastern part of the Kh\u0101si and Jainti\u0101 Hills, who at this time also held the country between the foot of the hills and the Surm\u0101 river, and whose king, R\u0101m Singh, had his head-quarters at Jaintiapur in the same tract. On learning of the departure of the Ahoms, Tamradhwaj informed R\u0101m Singh that his help was no longer needed, but the latter treacherously seized him and annexed his territory. Tamradhwaj managed to send word to Rudra Singh begging for help, and the latter dispatched two armies to Jaintiapur, one across the Jainti\u0101 Hills and the other through the Kach\u0101ri country. Both reached their destination; Jaintiapur was taken without difficulty; but when Rudra Singh's intention to bring them permanently under his yoke became known, the Jainti\u0101s rose to a man, and his generals, finding their position untenable, were forced to beat a retreat.\n\nRudra Singh's reign is memorable for the final triumph of Hinduism over the national religion of the Ahoms. Many of his predecessors had taken Hindu, as well as Ahom, names, and had shown great respect for the Br\u0101hmans; but Rudra Singh was the first to announce publicly his intention to become the disciple of a Hindu priest. His son and successor, Sib Singh, was completely in the hands of Br\u0101hmans of the S\u0101kta sect; and he allowed his wife, Phuleswari, at their instigation, to insult the S\u016bdra mahant of the Vaishnava sect of Moamarias, who had now become very numerous, by causing his forehead to be smeared with the blood of an animal that had been sacrificed to Durg\u0101. The common people soon followed the lead of their king; and in a few years the Deodhais and Bailongs, the tribal priests and astrologers, alone remained true to the ancient faith of the Ahoms. The change was\n\n1 The Ahoms were not mere Animists of the type commonly found among the aboriginal tribes of India, but had a regular pantheon of which the leading members were, in later times at least, identified with Hindu gods and goddesses. An account of the Ahom story of the Creation will be found in a paper contributed by Mr. E. A. Gait to the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal for 1894, and a translation of their cosmogony, with the Ahom text, is given by Dr. G. A. Grierson in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society for 1904.\n\n2 The Moamarias are a Vaishnavite sect, most of whose members are drawn from the lower Hindu castes and are residents of Upper Assam. Three explanations of the origin of the name are current. According to one, the original founder lived near the Moamari bil in Nowgong; according to another, the people were called Moamaria in contempt, because they were in the habit of catching and eating the moa fish; while others say that the original Gosain Aniruddha convinced the Ahom king of the truth of the new religion by a display of magic maya.\ndisastrous: it involved the loss of the old martial spirit and pride of race with which the Ahoms had till then been animated; their patriotic feelings thenceforth became more and more subordinated to sectarian animosities and internal dissensions and intrigues, and their power soon began to decay. In 1766 we read, for the first time, of Ahom nobles declining the proffered command of a military expedition.\n\nIn 1769, soon after the accession of Lakshmi Singh, the Vaishnava Moamarias, enraged by fresh insults, rose in rebellion, seized the person of the king, and placed the son of a Matak chief on the throne. For a time the rebels seemed to have overborne all opposition, but the report that their leader was contemplating the execution of all the old officers of state incited the royalists to renewed efforts. The Moamaria commander was killed in a night attack, and many of his chief supporters were put to death. Deprived of their leaders, the rebels offered but a feeble resistance, and they were easily dispersed. Lakshmi Singh died in 1780, and the accession of his son, Gaurin\u0101th Singh, was the signal for renewed persecutions. These led to fresh risings, and at last, in 1786, the rebels defeated the royal troops in several encounters and took the capital by storm. Gaurin\u0101th fled to Gauh\u0101ti; but resistance was continued by one of his ministers, known as the Bura Gohain, and for several years the war dragged on with varying success. A general state of anarchy supervened; the country-side was devastated by bands of armed men, and petty chiefs in all directions began to proclaim themselves independent. Among the latter was Krishna N\u0101r\u0101yan, a descendant of the Koch kings, who seized Darrang and the northern part of K\u0101mr\u016bp and threatened Gauh\u0101ti. The Moamarias also were advancing nearer and nearer.\n\nGaurin\u0101th now sought aid from the British, who had succeeded to the Mughals in Sylhet and Go\u0101lp\u0101ra, and urged that his plight was due largely to the fact that Krishna N\u0101r\u0101yan had been allowed to recruit men for his army in Rangpur District. Lord Cornwallis recognized the obligation, and in September, 1792, sent Captain Welsh with a small force to the Ahom king\u2019s relief. A little below Gauh\u0101ti he was met by Gaurin\u0101th, who had fled from the city before a mob of Doms led by a Bair\u0101gi. Welsh had no difficulty in driving them out, and he then crossed the Brahmaputra with 250 sepoys and defeated Krishna N\u0101r\u0101yan\u2019s army of 3,000 men. After some further reverses the latter surrendered, and his Bengal clubmen were deported. In his efforts to conciliate Gaurin\u0101th\u2019s numerous enemies, Welsh found himself thwarted by the cruel and sanguinary conduct of the Raj\u0101, and by the intrigues and covert opposition of some of his ministers. He\n\n---\n\n1 The Mataks were the inhabitants of Lakhimpur, and were so called because the raiding Singphos found them matak \u2018or strong,\u2019 in contradistinction to the mullong or \u2018weak\u2019 people farther east.\nreplaced the latter by others of a more humane disposition, caused a general amnesty to be proclaimed, and took such other steps as seemed needed to restore confidence and ensure good government. He spent the rainy season of 1793 at Gauh\u0101ti, and in January, 1794, after pacifying Mangaldai and Nowgong, advanced to Kali\u0101bar. Jorh\u0101t, where the Bura Gohain was still holding out against the Moamarias, was relieved by a small force; and a decisive victory was gained about 12 miles from Rangpur, which was occupied in March. Sir John Shore had now succeeded Lord Cornwallis as Governor-General, and one of his first acts was to recall Captain Welsh, in spite of the vigorous protests of the Ahom king. The latter, when left once more to his own devices, dismissed most of the officials who had been appointed on Welsh's recommendation, renewed the persecution of the Moamarias, and wreaked his vengeance on his old enemies who had made their submission under a promise of pardon; and for a time it seemed likely that Assam would once more relapse into anarchy. This was prevented by the energy of the Bura Gohain, who organized a body of troops disciplined on the English model, and, with their aid, the Moamarias and other malcontents were held in check.\n\nShortly after the accession of Chandra Kanta\\(^1\\), in 1810, the Ahom governor at Gauh\u0101ti fell into disgrace, and fled for safety to Bengal. After seeking in vain the assistance of the British, he gained the friendship of the Burmese envoy then at Calcutta and went with him to Amarapura, where he persuaded the Burmese king to send an expedition to Assam. In 1816\u20137 an army of 8,000 men was dispatched from Burma, which, having crossed the P\u0101tkai and gained fresh adherents among the hill chiefs, entered Assam, occupied the whole country as far as Jorh\u0101t, and reinstated the Gauh\u0101ti governor. The force then returned to Burma. They had barely departed when fresh dissensions took place; the governor, who had invoked the aid of the Burmese, was assassinated; Chandra Kanta was deposed, and Purandar Singh, a direct descendant of R\u0101j\u0101 R\u0101jeswar Singh, was installed in his place. The friends of the late governor appealed to the Burmese, who once\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Gaurin\u0101th was followed by a very distant connexion named Kamaleswar, a descendant of Gadadhar Singh; and Chandra Kanta, the next king, was Kamaleswar's brother. In the early days of Ahom rule the succession devolved from father to son with great regularity; but in later times brothers often succeeded to the exclusion of sons, and sometimes, as in the case of Kamaleswar, even very distant relations did so. Much depended on the wishes of the previous king, much on the action of the great nobles, with whom, in theory at least, the choice seems to have rested, and much on the personal influence of the rival candidates. The one essential qualification was that they must be of the royal blood. The person of the monarch was sacred and any marked blemish, even the scar of a carbuncle, operated as a disqualification. Hence arose the practice, often followed by the Ahom kings, of mutilating all likely rivals. Mutilation was usually effected by slitting the ear.\nmore appeared on the scene and reinstated Chandra Kanta, but on this occasion it soon became clear that they meant to stay. Chandra Kanta made a vain effort to throw off their yoke and fled to British territory, where Purandar Singh had frequently taken refuge. The Burmese during their occupation of the country treated the unfortunate inhabitants with extreme barbarity. The villages were plundered and burnt, and the inhabitants were driven into the jungle to live as best they could.\n\nThe gradual decline of the Ahom power had caused a relaxation of their pressure on the Kach\u0101ri kings, whose capital was now at Kh\u0101spur in the plains of C\u0101ch\u0101r; but the latter soon found a fresh enemy on their eastern frontier, where the Manipuris became so threatening that, from 1817 onwards, constant appeals for help were made to the British. These were rejected until early in 1824, when intelligence of a projected invasion of C\u0101ch\u0101r and Jainti\u0101 by the Burmese induced the British Government, which had received great provocation from Burma in other quarters, to intervene. The first collision with Burmese troops occurred on the C\u0101ch\u0101r frontier; but the scene of the main operations in Assam was in the Brahmaputra Valley, where a British force of 3,000 men advanced without much opposition as far as Kali\u0101bar. On the approach of the rainy season the troops returned to Gauh\u0101ti, and the Burmese reoccupied Nowgong, where they committed terrible atrocities on the helpless inhabitants. Many were put to death and many fled for their lives into the hills to the south; of the latter, the majority died of starvation, and only a small remnant lived to reach the plains of the Surm\u0101 Valley. When the rains were over, the British again advanced; and the Burmese were driven out of the Province after a few fainthearted and ineffectual attempts at resistance, but in the course of their retreat they carried off as slaves upwards of 30,000 Assamese.\n\nBy the Treaty of Yandabo in 1826 the Burmese ceded Assam to the East India Company, and Mr. Scott, the Commissioner of Rangpur, was appointed to administer the country. The Moamarias in the south of Lakhimpur District were left under their own ruler, the Bor Sen\u0101pati; and the Sadiy\u0101-khowa Gohain or Khamti chief of Sadiy\u0101, who had dispossessed the Ahoms there during the Moamaria rebellions, was confirmed as the Company\u2019s feudatory in that tract, while, in 1833, the rest of Lakhimpur District and Sibs\u0101gar were restored to Purandar Singh. These arrangements, however, did not last long. In 1838 Purandar Singh declared himself unable to carry on the administration, and his territory was taken over. In 1835 the Sadiy\u0101-khowa Gohain was removed from his post; but the local Khamti chiefs were allowed to manage their own internal affairs till 1839, when, without any warning, they made a night attack on the garrison of Sadiy\u0101, and killed\nColonel White, the officer in command, and a number of his sepoys. The Khamtis were then deported to places lower down the river, and the power of their chiefs was finally extinguished. In 1842 the Bor Senapati died, and on his son declining to accept the terms of settlement offered to him, his country also was annexed.\n\nIn Cachar the Raj\u0101 was replaced on the throne, but was soon forced to relinquish the northern portion of his domains to a rebel named Tula R\u0101m. The Raj\u0101 was assassinated in 1830 and, in the absence of any lawful heir, the Cachar plains were annexed to British territory. Five years later Tula R\u0101m ceded a considerable tract, and the rest of his country was taken over soon after his death in 1850, as his sons had proved unable to manage it. In 1835 the Raj\u0101 of Jaintia was dispossessed of his estate in the plains, in consequence of the repeated abduction of British subjects who were sacrificed to K\u0101li, the tutelary goddess of his family. He then declared himself unwilling to continue in possession of his hill territory, over which he had but little control, and it also was included in the Company\u2019s dominions. The Kh\u0101si Hills to the west were conquered in 1833, as the result of an attack made on a party engaged in constructing a road through the hills; but the people were left in a state of quasi-independence under their own chiefs, with the exception of a few villages which were acquired for special reasons, either at the time of the conquest or at some subsequent date: among the latter may be mentioned the site of Shillong, the capital of the Province as now constituted. The occupation of the N\u0101g\u0101 Hills has been a gradual process, due to the necessity of protecting British subjects from N\u0101ga raids. It commenced in 1866, when a frontier District was formed, with head-quarters at S\u0101maguting, and the last addition was made in 1904, when the Eastern Ang\u0101mi country was formally annexed. Theoretically, the G\u0101ro Hills always formed part of Go\u0101lp\u0101ra District; but for many years British control over the G\u0101ros was limited to ineffectual efforts to suppress their constant raids on the adjoining plains, by means of punitive expeditions or by forbidding them to trade in the plains. In 1869 the tract was formed into a separate District, with head-quarters at Tur\u0101, and order was instantly established in all but the more remote villages. The inhabitants of the latter, having perpetrated fresh raids, were brought under subjection in 1872\u20133 with the aid of a few small detachments of police, who met with no serious opposition. Prior to 1890, the history of British relations with the Lushais was one of constant raids by the latter, followed by infructuous punitive expeditions. In that year, after one of these expeditions, it was decided to try the expedient of establishing military outposts in their midst. A treacherous attack on two of these outposts led to fresh operations and to the permanent annexation of the Lushai Hills,\nwhich are now in charge of a Superintendent, with head-quarters at Aijal.\n\nThe State of Manipur has a fairly ancient history; but the present r\u00e9gime dates only from 1714, when the reigning chief adopted Hinduism, which has now gained a remarkably strong hold on the people. By the Treaty of Yandabo, the Burmese agreed to the restoration to the throne of R\u0101j\u0101 Gambh\u012br Singh, whom they had ousted. He and his descendants enjoyed a large measure of independence, and the British Government rarely interfered in local affairs except in the case of risings or disputes regarding the succession. In 1890, in the course of one of these risings, the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 was driven from his palace and abdicated in favour of the Jubr\u0101j, but he subsequently repudiated his abdication. The Government of India decided to confirm the Jubr\u0101j as R\u0101j\u0101, but directed the Chief Commissioner to arrest and deport the Sen\u0101pati, who had been the ringleader in the plot. He proceeded to Manipur and called on the Sen\u0101pati to surrender, but the latter refused and resisted the troops sent to seize him. The Chief Commissioner and four other officers were then induced, under a promise of safe-conduct, to attend, alone and unarmed, a darbar in the palace. The discussion was fruitless, and they started to return, but a crowd of Manipuris closed in on them and two of them were wounded with spears. One died of his wound, and all the other officers, after a short detention, were cruelly murdered. This led to a military expedition. Manipur was occupied by British troops; the ringleaders were punished; the new R\u0101j\u0101 was deposed, and a scion of a collateral line was raised to the throne. Since this time a large measure of control has been vested in the resident British officer, who is now designated Political Agent and Superintendent of the State.\n\nUntil 1874, Assam was administered as part of Bengal, but in that year it was formed into a separate Province under a Chief Commissioner. The officers who have held this appointment since that date are as follows:\n\n| Officer                                      | Year |\n|----------------------------------------------|------|\n| Colonel R.

The natives of the Province have little aptitude for handicrafts, and\nmany of the temples that exist were probably constructed by artisans from Hindustan. The shrine of Sh\u0101h Jal\u0101l, situated in a mosque at Sylhet, is still in an excellent state of preservation, and there are some interesting ruins at Jaintiapur. K\u0101mr\u016bp has many temples, but most of them are small and have fallen into disrepair, the two best known being the temple to K\u0101makhy\u0101 on Nil\u0101ch\u0101l hill near Gauh\u0101ti, and the temple of Hayagriva M\u0101dhava at H\u00e1jo. There are also the remains of an interesting stone bridge in the Sil\u0101 Sindurighop\u0101 mauza, said to have been constructed by Bakhtiar Khilji when he invaded Assam at the beginning of the thirteenth century. Near Tezpur are the ruins of what must have been a magnificent temple; but not one stone is left standing upon another, and its builder and designer are alike unknown. Dimapur, in the extreme south-western corner of Sibs\u0101gar District, was once the capital of the Kach\u0101ri dynasty, and was evidently a place of considerable importance, though it is now situated in the midst of an enormous forest. Sibs\u0101gar has numerous temples built by the Ahom kings. They are made of thin bricks of excellent quality, and are generally ornamented with bas-reliefs; but the fact that figures of camels not unfrequently appear suggests that they were erected under the direction of foreign artisans, as camels must always have been very scarce in a damp and marshy country like Assam. These temples were generally built on the side of large tanks, whose construction must have entailed an enormous expenditure of labour. The largest tank, at Sibs\u0101gar, covers an area of 114 acres. Immense tanks, with temples on their banks, were also constructed at Gauris\u0101gar, Rudras\u0101gar, and Jays\u0101gar, all within a few miles of the Sibs\u0101gar tank. At Gargaon near N\u0101zir\u0101 are the ruins of one of the Ahom capitals. That the native rulers of Assam extended their frontiers right up to the Him\u0101layas is shown by the remains of a fort at Bh\u0101lukp\u0101ng in the gorge of the Bhareli, and of two large forts some distance north of Sadiy\u0101. Another interesting ruin near that place is the small temple at which a human victim was annually offered for many centuries by the Chutiy\u0101 priests. Scattered about the valley are the remains of great roads and fortifications which evidently protected the capital of some local prince. The Baidargarh in K\u0101mr\u016bp, which is said to have been constructed by king Arimatta about the thirteenth century, and his son Jangal\u2019s fort in Nowgong, deserve special mention, as also the remains of extensive earthworks at Prat\u0101pgarh, near Bishn\u0101th, in Darrang District.\n\nThe population of Assam, including the Native State of Manipur, returned at the Census of 1901, amounted to 6,126,343 persons, living in 19 towns and 22,326 villages. It can be most conveniently considered with reference to the three natural divisions into which the Province falls.\n\nOver the greater part of the Surm\u0101 Valley there is no longer any\nscarcity of population. In the Cachar plains the density is only 201 persons per square mile; but the country is much broken by hills and marshes, and of recent years it has become necessary to throw open considerable areas of 'reserved' forest to meet the demand for cultivable land. The neighbouring District of Sylhet is fully peopled, and in the Habiganj subdivision the density rises to 583 persons per square mile, which for a purely rural population must be considered high. In the Brahmaputra Valley the condition of affairs is very different. Though three times the size of the valley of the Surma, it supports a slightly smaller population, and the density in its Districts varies from 68 persons per square mile in Nowgong to 153 in Kamrup. A considerable portion of the unsettled area consists of steep jungle-covered hills, and of marshes that could only grow cold-season crops or the longest-stemmed varieties of rice; but much good land awaits settlement, and there is probably room for two or three million more inhabitants. There are, however, places where the population is already fairly dense, and in certain rural tracts in the centre of Kamrup and Sibsagar it exceeds 600 persons per square mile. The Hill Districts are very sparsely peopled; but the area of land suited for permanent cultivation is small, and large tracts of waste are required for the support of tribes that live by shifting cultivation.\n\nThe population of Assam is almost entirely rural. Excluding Manipur, less than 2 per cent. of the people enumerated in 1901 were living in urban areas. The largest towns are Sylhet (13,893), Gauhati (11,661), Dibrugarh (11,227), Silchar (9,256), Barpeta (8,747), and Shillong, the head-quarters of the Administration (8,384). Many of the towns are little more than large villages, and the average population of eighteen places dignified with the name was only 6,315. Imphal, the capital of Manipur, had a population of 67,093; but the rural character of the place is illustrated by the fact that more than half of the working males residing there were agriculturists by profession. Except in the Naga, North Cachar, and Lushai Hills, the boundaries of a village are not clearly defined, and the cottages are scattered over a considerable area. This tendency is particularly marked in the Assam Valley. Rice is grown on broad plains, often several miles in length, dotted over with clumps of bamboos and fruit trees, in which are buried the houses of the cultivators. A village, in the sense of a compact block of houses set in the midst of its fields at a considerable distance from any other centre of population, is the exception rather than the rule in the plains of Assam; and for census purposes a village was taken to be the area so designated by the cadastral survey. In many cases, however, the cadastral village is little more than a tract of land which can conveniently be surveyed on one sheet of the map, and this fact has to be borne in mind when examining the statistics.\nshowing their average size. In Sylhet there is so little highland that the people are compelled to live in fairly close proximity, but all over the Province there is a marked preference for small hamlets. In 1901, 56 per cent. of the population were living in villages of less than 500 inhabitants; 38 per cent. in those ranging from 500 to 2,000, and less than 5 per cent. in those containing from 2,000 to 5,000.\n\nThe first regular Census, which was taken in 1872, disclosed a population of 4,150,769. Manipur and the Lushai Hills were not included, and the figures for the Hill Districts were only estimates. In 1881 the population, including Manipur, was 5,128,862; and in the plains alone there was an increase of over 18 per cent., a fact which threw grave doubts on the accuracy of the former enumeration. In 1891 Manipur again dropped out, the census schedules having been destroyed in the rising, but the Lushai Hills appeared for the first time, and the population was returned at 5,477,302. The population of the plains increased by nearly 11 per cent., but part of this increase was no doubt due to the greater accuracy of the enumeration in 1891. In the last intercensal period the increase was 649,041, or 12 per cent., but this was largely due to the inclusion of the figures for Manipur and the South Lushai Hills; and in the plains the increase was less than 6 per cent. The year 1897 was very unhealthy, and in Central and Lower Assam an abnormal mortality was not confined to that year alone. The population of Kamrup decreased by over 7 per cent.; and, though there was an increase in Darrang, it was entirely due to immigration, and the indigenous inhabitants are believed to have decreased by 8 per cent. The lowest depth was, however, reached in Nowgong, where the people were more than decimated by a peculiarly malignant form of malarial fever known as kal\u0101-azar. The population of the District as a whole fell by nearly one-fourth, and it was calculated that the indigenous inhabitants had decreased by over 30 per cent. In Upper Assam there was a satisfactory growth of the indigenous population, and an enormous development of immigration during the decade. The population of Sibs\u0101gar increased by nearly one-fourth, and that of Lakhimpur by almost a half. The best indication of the natural growth of the people is, however, obtained by excluding the figures for Manipur and the Lushai Hills, and comparing the figures for those born and enumerated in the Province in 1891 and 1901. Among this class it appears that the increase during the last intercensal period was only a little more than one per cent.\n\nThere was, however, a great growth of the immigrant population, which increased by more than one-half, and in 1901 exceeded three-quarters of a million, or nearly 13 per cent. of the total population of the Province. The great majority of these foreigners are coolies brought up to the tea gardens, though a certain amount of movement\ntakes place across the frontier where Assam marches with Bengal. More than half a million people came from that Province, a quarter of a million of whom had been born in the Division of Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur. About 109,000 persons came from the United Provinces, and 84,000 from the Central Provinces. The preponderance of the foreign-born element in the population was most pronounced in Lakhimpur, where they formed 41 per cent. of the whole, and in Darrang and Sibs\u0101gar (25 per cent.). C\u0101ch\u0101r (plains) was close behind, with 24 per cent. In Sylhet, on the other hand, though the total number of foreigners was considerable, they formed only 7 per cent. of the population. There is very little emigration, and only 51,000 persons born in Assam were found in other parts of India. The great majority of these persons had merely crossed the frontier from Go\u0101lp\u0101ra and Sylhet into Bengal.\n\nLittle reliance can be placed upon the age statistics, as only a small proportion of the population have even an approximate idea of the number of years which they have lived, and though the mistakes made tend to some extent to neutralize one another, there is a marked tendency to select multiples of five. Inaccurate though the figures are, they show that the exceptional unhealthiness which prevailed between 1891 and 1901 affected the fecundity of the people; and the decrease in the proportion of children was especially pronounced in Districts like Nowgong and the Kh\u0101si Hills, where the death-rate was exceptionally high. The most prolific section of the people includes the animistic tribes, and it seems possible that the system of early marriage may have a prejudicial effect upon the reproductive powers of Hindu women.\n\nThe registration of vital statistics is compulsory only on tea gardens, and in the District and subdivisional head-quarters stations in the plains (population in 1901, 765,000), but attempts are made to collect information in all the plains Districts and in a small portion of the hills. In Go\u0101lp\u0101ra the returns are submitted in writing by the village panch\u0101yats and are fairly correct. In the Surm\u0101 Valley vital statistics are reported by the paid village chaukid\u0101rs, but their accuracy leaves much to be desired. In Assam proper they are collected by the gaonburas or village headmen, and are extremely incomplete. The mean annual birth-rate registered in the plains Districts during the five years ending with 1902 was only 33 per 1,000, varying from 42 in Go\u0101lp\u0101ra, where public health had been bad, to 25 in Sibs\u0101gar and Lakhimpur, where it had been good. The mean death-rate registered was 30 per 1,000, varying from 41 in Nowgong to 21 in Sibs\u0101gar. The returns have thus but little absolute value, though, as the amount of error is fairly constant, they afford some clue to the comparative unhealthiness of different years. The sanitary conditions of Assam are\nfar from satisfactory. The tract at the foot of the hills and the valleys running up into them are excessively malarious; and as the Province practically consists of two valleys with the intervening range, the proportion of this feverish tarai land is higher than in other parts of India. On the other hand, the open country is fairly healthy, and though the climate is damp it is also cool. The most prevalent diseases are fever, bowel complaints, pulmonary affections, cholera, worms, small-pox, various cutaneous disorders, and, in some localities, goitre. Leprosy is by no means uncommon, and in 1901 more than 5,000 persons were said to be afflicted with this disease. The birth and death rates in 1881 and subsequent years, and the mortality ascribed to the principal diseases, are shown in the following table:\n\n| Year | Population under registration | Ratio of registered births per 1,000 | Ratio of registered deaths per 1,000 | Deaths per 1,000 from |\n|------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------|\n|      |                               | Cholera.                            | Small-pox.                          | Fever.               |\n| 1881 | 4,438,705                     | 19                                  | 16                                  | 1                    |\n| 1891 | 5,021,084                     | 29                                  | 30                                  | 5                    |\n| 1901 | 5,275,706                     | 34                                  | 28                                  | 1                    |\n| 1903 | 5,275,706                     | 36                                  | 27                                  | 2                    |\n\n* This is the population among whom deaths were registered. Births were registered only among a population of 2,225,271.\n\nThese rates do not represent the actual mortality due to these different ailments, but give a fairly correct idea of their comparative importance.\n\nThe most important factor in the medical history of the Province during the last twenty years has been kal\u0101-\u0101z\u0101r. This disease was known as far back as 1869, when an intense form of malarial fever was reported to be inducing a high rate of mortality in the low and densely wooded G\u0101ro Hills; but it first came into prominence in 1883, when it entered that portion of Go\u0101lp\u0101ra District which lies south of the river. In 1888 it spread to K\u0101mr\u016bp, and thence to Nowgong and to Mangaldai on the north bank of the Brahmaputra, and of recent years it has reached Sylhet. The virulence of the epidemic is now gradually abating, and it has as yet failed to effect a lodgement in Upper Assam, but it has been the cause of terrible mortality in the Districts it attacked. Between 1881 and 1891 the population of the Go\u0101lp\u0101ra subdivision decreased by 18 per cent.; and the population recorded in K\u0101mr\u016bp in 1891 was estimated to have been less by 75,000 people than it would have been had there been no deaths from kal\u0101-\u0101z\u0101r. During the next decade the population of K\u0101mr\u016bp decreased by 7 per cent., that of the Mangaldai subdivision of Darrang by 9 per cent., of Nowgong District by 25 per cent., and of the North Sylhet subdivision by 4 per cent.; and the excessive mortality indicated by these figures\nwas, at any rate in the Assam Valley, chiefly due to this disease. Its nature is still a cause of speculation to the medical world. In all essentials it seemed to be a form of malarial fever, but the suggestion that malarial fever could be infectious was till recently opposed to all accepted theories on the subject. Subsequently, it was thought that kal\u0101-\u0101z\u0101r was only an acute form of malarial poisoning, the difference between it and ordinary fever lying in the rapidity with which it produces a condition of severe cachexia, the small proportion of recoveries, and the ease with which it can be communicated from the sick to the healthy. Quite recently, the malarial theory of origin has been again assailed, and the whole question is still involved in uncertainty. Persons attacked seldom died in less than three months, and often lingered for two years; and isolation and segregation were thus impossible, once the disease had obtained a foothold. Plague did not appear in Assam till the rainy season of 1903, when it broke out among the foreign grain merchants in Dibrugarh. The disease was quickly stamped out, and only twenty-eight deaths occurred. The age statistics recorded at the Census and the vital statistics supplied by the collecting agency are so inaccurate that it is impossible to place any reliance on the recorded death-rate for infants under one year of age. It is, however, generally supposed to be about 218 per mille.\n\nEvery Census in Assam has disclosed a deficiency of women, and in 1901 there were only 949 females to every 1,000 males. This deficiency is to some extent due to the disproportion between the sexes among immigrants; for those born and enumerated in the Province there are 977 women to every 1,000 men. Among the animistic tribes women usually predominate, and, taking those born in the Hill Districts and enumerated in the Province, the proportion was 1,061 females to 1,000 males. This phenomenon is probably due in part to the practice of adult marriage, and in part to the good position usually assigned to women in the hills. In Nowgong it appears that there was some truth in the popular idea that kal\u0101-\u0101z\u0101r spared the female members of the family, as at the last Census, among those born and enumerated in the District, the women exceeded the men in numbers. The deficiency of women was most pronounced in Sibs\u0101gar and Lakhimpur, where there were only 886 and 862 females to every 1,000 males. This is partly due to an actual deficiency of women among the indigenous inhabitants, partly to the large foreign element in the population.\n\nIn Assam, as in other parts of India, wedlock is taken as a matter of course, and in 1901 more than half the population were either married, or had at any rate performed the ceremony at some period of their lives. Child-marriage is common among both Hindus and Muhammadans in the Surm\u0101 Valley and in Go\u0101lp\u0101ra; but in Assam proper, Br\u0101hmans and Ganaks alone adhere rigidly to this rule, and\nthe lower castes usually defer marriage till the girl is of an age to be able to enter on her duties as wife and mother. Where adult marriage prevails, anti-nuptial chastity is not invariably demanded; and in Assam proper the marriage ceremony often consists of little more than a public acknowledgement of union, which does not receive the sanction of any priestly blessing. The purchase of a bride by service is also not uncommon, and during the time that the man is serving in the house of his prospective father-in-law, he is usually allowed free access to the girl of his choice. There is, however, a curious survival among the Kukis which points to a time when this permission was not accorded. Here pregnancy entails no disgrace, but on no account must a girl give birth to a living child in her father's house. At the seventh month the baby's head is crushed in the womb, and premature delivery is brought on, in spite of the fact that the process is attended with much risk to the young mother. The age of marriage among men depends largely upon the cost of the bride; and notwithstanding the easiness of the hill girl's morals, men marry early among the animistic tribes, as women are fairly numerous and therefore cheap. When the knot is once tied, the hill woman usually settles down and becomes an exemplary wife and mother, except among the Kh\u00e2sis, where divorces can be obtained on almost any pretext, and women not unfrequently change their husbands more than once. Such laxity in the marriage laws is bound to be accompanied by uncertainty as to the paternity of the children born, and it is perhaps for this reason that the Kh\u00e2si husband is not master in his own house, and that inheritance goes through the female line. Polygamy is nowhere common, as few men can afford the luxury of a second wife. Divorce is recognized by Muhammadans and the animistic tribes, and, in practice, by the lower castes of Hindus, unless the marriage has been contracted by the hom pura rite, which is looked upon as indissoluble.\n\nThe joint family system is far from prevalent in Assam proper, and even among the upper classes seldom extends beyond the second generation. In the Surm\u00e2 Valley also it is the exception rather than the rule, and among the middle classes generally ends with the third generation.\n\nThe distribution of population by civil condition in 1891 and 1901 (for British territory only, excluding Manipur) is shown in the following table:\n\n| Civil condition | 1891 | 1901 |\n|-----------------|------|------|\n|                 | Persons | Males | Females | Persons | Males | Females |\n| Unmarried       | 2,604,494 | 1,573,539 | 1,090,955 | 2,827,613 | 1,666,963 | 1,160,650 |\n| Married         | 2,207,826 | 1,110,525 | 1,097,301 | 2,366,952 | 1,194,774 | 1,172,178 |\n| Widowed         | 502,923  | 114,844  | 388,079  | 647,313  | 142,323  | 504,990  |\nThe two main indigenous languages of the Province are Bengali, which was spoken by 48 per cent. of the population in 1901, and Assamese, which was returned by 22 per cent. Bengali is the common vernacular of the Surm\u0101 Valley, where it is used by 87 out of every 100 people, and of Go\u0101lp\u0101ra (69 per cent.). Assamese is used by 83 per cent. of the inhabitants of K\u0101mr\u016bp; but in the tea Districts the proportion of foreigners is very large, and in Darrang Assamese was returned by little more than half the population, and in Lakhimpur by only 39 per cent. In addition to the two main vernaculars, there are a large number of languages peculiar to Assam, most of which belong to the Tibeto-Burman stock, and which, though gradually giving place to Assamese, are still largely used. The most important are: Bodo or plains Kach\u0101ri, Kh\u0101si, Synteng, the various forms of N\u0101g\u0101 dialects, G\u0101ro, Manipuri, Lushai, Kuki, Mikir, and Miri. The principal foreign languages are: Hindust\u0101ni, Mund\u0101ri, Sant\u0101li, and Oriy\u0101. The number of persons in British territory (excluding Manipur) who returned these different forms of speech in 1891 and 1901 is shown in the following table. Altogether, no less than 167 different languages were returned in Assam in 1901.\n\n| Language spoken                  | 1891       | 1901       |\n|----------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Bengali                          | 2,741,947  | 2,947,916  |\n| Assamese                         | 1,414,285  | 1,349,694  |\n| Eastern Hindi, Western Hindi, and Hindust\u0101ni | 229,456*   | 351,908    |\n| Bodo, Dimasa, and Mech           | 269,346    | 237,982    |\n| Other languages                  | 780,209    | 954,378\u2020   |\n\n* Figures for Hindi.\n\u2020 Includes 123,481 Kh\u0101si, 54,253 Synteng, 106,035 N\u0101g\u0101, 133,411 G\u0101ro, 72,011 Lushai, 82,283 Mikir, 40,472 Miri, 37,411 Mund\u0101ri, 30,128 Sant\u0101li, and 23,755 Oriy\u0101.\n\nThe earliest inhabitants of Assam were probably the various offshoots of the great Indo-Chinese hordes, whose head-quarters are supposed to have been on the upper waters of the Yang-tse-Kiang and Ho-ang-ho. At the same time, the Assam Valley must have been colonized by Hindus from the west at a very early date; and Hindu princes were reigning at the eastern end near Sadiy\u0101 at the time of the invasion of the Chutiy\u0101s, a tribe of Bodo origin, about a thousand years ago. The Chutiy\u0101s overthrew the Hindus, but in their turn gave way before the Ahoms, a Shan tribe who crossed the P\u0101tkai from the kingdom of Pong in the thirteenth century, and gradually extended their sway over the whole valley. In the course of their expansion they overthrew the Koch kings, a dynasty of Bodo origin who had attained to considerable power in North-Eastern Bengal; and they repulsed the Muhammadans, who had made several attempts upon the valley and succeeded in holding for a considerable time the two lower Districts of Go\u0101lp\u0101ra and K\u0101mr\u016bp. The last wave of immigration was not one of either con-\nquerors or colonists in the ordinary sense of the term, but of tea-garden coolies, who are now beginning to form an important element in the population of the upper Districts of the Brahmaputra Valley.\n\nThe various tribes of Indo-Chinese origin fall into several groups. The first are the Kh\u0101sis, who are believed to be an isolated remnant of one of the earliest waves of migration from the north-east. They differ in many ways from all their neighbours, and on linguistic grounds it has been suggested that they may be connected with the Palaungs and Was in Upper Burma. The second great division includes the Dimasa or hill Kach\u0101ri, the Bodo or plains Kach\u0101ri, who are called Mech in Go\u0101lp\u0101ra, the Rabh\u0101s, the G\u0101ros, the Lalungs, and the eastern sub-Him\u0101layan group consisting of the Dafl\u0101s, Miris, Abors, and Mishmis. The Tipperas who occupy the hills south of Sylhet are also of Bodo stock, and there are good reasons for supposing that some of the earliest inhabitants of the Surm\u0101 Valley were members of this race. Another group comprises the Lushais and K\u016bkis, who have migrated from the south, and seem to be connected with the Manipuris; and the N\u0101g\u0101s, whose extraordinary ferocity differentiates them in some degree from the other hill tribes of the Province. The Mikirs are a peaceful tribe, whose language is akin to both Bodo and N\u0101g\u0101; but language is by no means a certain test of ethnical affinity. The Kach\u0101ris, Rabh\u0101s, and Mechs live on the high grassy plains at the foot of the Him\u0101layas, but most of the remainder occupy the hills of the Province. They are all of sturdy physique, and of a marked Mongolian type. They place few restrictions upon their natural appetites, and the warlike and aggressive spirit of the G\u0101ros, N\u0101g\u0101s, and Lushais for many years gave trouble to the Government. At the present day, many of the N\u0101g\u0101 tribes beyond the British frontier are still blood-thirsty and naked savages. Another division of the Indo-Chinese inhabitants is a branch of the great Tai race, to which belong the Siamese and the Shans of Upper Burma. It includes the Ahoms, who have now to all intents and purposes become a Hindu caste, and several small colonies of Shans who have migrated into Assam in comparatively recent times. The strength of the principal tribes in 1901 was: Kach\u0101ris, 240,000; G\u0101ros, 128,000; Rabh\u0101s, 67,000; Mechs, 75,000; Mikirs, 87,000; Lalungs, 36,000; Lushais, 63,000; K\u016bkis, 56,000; Manipuris, 256,000; N\u0101g\u0101s, 162,000; Kh\u0101sis, 178,000; and Miris, 47,000.\n\nThe natural result of the various changes outlined in the preceding paragraphs is that Hinduism in general, and caste in particular, are much less rigid in Assam than in Bengal. The first Hindu immigrants seem to have entered the valley of the Brahmaputra at a time when the boundary lines between one caste and another were not very clearly defined, and the presence of a large non-Hindu population, sections of\nwhich from time to time attained to sovereignty, made it impossible for them to affect too strict a standard of religious purity. The higher castes are thus somewhat lax in the observance of the ceremonial details of their religion; while castes which in Bengal are of a comparatively low rank enjoy in Assam a much more respectable position. Br\u0101hmans and K\u0101yasths are found in both valleys, but the most characteristic caste of Assam proper is the Kalit\u0101. Various explanations have been put forward to account for the origin of this caste, which is almost peculiar to Assam, but it is now generally thought that they are the remains of a Hindu colony who settled in the Province at a time when the functional castes were still unknown. The Kalit\u0101s are divided into two main subdivisions, Bar and Saru, who do not usually intermarry, and there are various functional subdivisions which occupy a slightly lower position than the Bar Kalit\u0101. The names Kewat and Kaibartta are used more or less indiscriminately for the same caste in Assam. Owing to the comparative scarcity of the higher castes, the cultivating Kewats occupy a higher position in this Province than in Bengal; but some of them have taken to styling themselves M\u0101hisya Vaisya, as they resent the attempt on the part of the Nadiy\u0101ls or Doms to assume the name Kaibartta. The Kochs were originally a tribe of Mongolian origin, who were the masters of Lower Assam and North-Eastern Bengal, till overthrown by the Muhammadans and Ahoms about the beginning of the seventeenth century. They are now, in Lower Assam, a caste into which all converts to Hinduism are admitted. In Go\u0101lp\u0101ra the term Koch has been abandoned for the more honourable title R\u0101jbansi\u2014'men of royal race.' The S\u0101loi are a respectable caste in K\u0101mr\u016bp, who are believed to be connected with the Halwais, or confectioners; and the Pati\u0101s, most of whom are found in Nowgong, are theoretically mat-makers. Both of these castes have abandoned their traditional occupation and taken to agriculture. Of castes from whose hands water is not taken by Br\u0101hmans, the principal is the Ahom. They were originally a Shan tribe, who entered Assam in the thirteenth century and settled in Sibs\u0101gar District. They overthrew successively the Chutiy\u0101 and the Koch, and eventually became masters of the Brahmaputra Valley. But they never colonized Lower Assam, and the majority of the Chutiy\u0101s and Ahoms are still found in Sibs\u0101gar and Lakhimpur Districts. In the seventeenth century they were converted to Hinduism, and shortly afterwards the power of the tribe began to decline. The Jugis are theoretically weavers by profession, but most of them have taken to agriculture. The Nadiy\u0101ls or Doms are a fishing caste, and in Assam have never performed any of the degrading offices assigned to them in Bengal. They are cleanly in their persons, and great purists in the ceremonies of their religion. The Bori\u0101, or S\u016bt, are a caste peculiar to the Brahmaputra Valley. They are said to be\nthe descendants of Br\u0101hman widows and other persons who have contracted alliances not recognized by customary law.\n\nThe characteristic castes of the Surm\u0101 Valley differ from those in Assam, though many are common to the two valleys. The great cultivating class of Sylhet are the Das (121,000), who often use the prefix S\u016bdra and Halw\u0101. The S\u016bdras (46,000) are many of them members of the Das caste; but there is in Sylhet a genuine caste, that has no other name, composed of people who were formerly the slaves of Br\u0101hmans (109,000) and K\u0101yasths (87,000). The members of the Navas\u0101kha, or respectable profession castes, most strongly represented, are the Telis, or oil-pressers (39,000), the Go\u0101l\u0101s, or cowherds (38,000), the N\u0101pits, or barbers (32,000), the Baruis, or betel-leaf growers (18,000), the Kumh\u0101rs, or potters (27,000), and the Kam\u0101rs, or blacksmiths (34,000). The Baidyas (5,000) are theoretically doctors, and socially occupy a position immediately below the Br\u0101hmans. The Sh\u0101h\u0101s (51,000) are by tradition liquor-sellers, but in Sylhet they are the chief trading caste, and many of them have amassed considerable wealth; in the Brahmaputra Valley they are ordinary cultivators, and Br\u0101hmans take water from their hands. The Namas\u016bdras, or Chand\u0101ls (170,000), are a fishing and boating caste.\n\nThe foreign castes in Assam most numerous in 1901 were Baur\u012bs (42,000), Bhuiy\u0101s (49,000), Bhumij (34,000), Cham\u0101rs (44,000), Gh\u0101tw\u0101ls (22,000), Kurmis (21,000), Mund\u0101s (81,000), Oraons (24,000), and Sant\u0101ls (78,000). Nearly all of these persons had originally been brought into Assam to work on tea gardens. The following castes are also numerically strong: Kochs (222,000), R\u0101jbarsis (120,000), Kalit\u0101s (203,000), Nadiy\u0101ls (195,000), Ahoms (178,000), Jugis (161,000), Kewats (149,000), and Chutiy\u0101s (86,000).\n\nOf the total population of the Province, 3,429,099 persons, or 56 per cent., were returned in 1901 as Hindus, more than half of whom profess the mild tenets of Vaishnavism. This form of Hinduism is especially prevalent in the Assam Valley, where its gosains, or principal priests, occupy positions of great influence and dignity. The gosain generally lives in a sattra or college, surrounded by his bhokots, or resident disciples. In some of the smaller sattras celibacy is not enforced, but in the larger colleges neither the gosain nor the bhokots are allowed to marry. The sattras are not educational institutions like the Buddhist monasteries of Burma, nor do the inmates wander abroad into the neighbouring villages to solicit alms. The more important sattras hold grants of revenue-free land, which in some cases amount to several thousand acres, and all the non-resident disciples make an annual contribution towards their maintenance. The gosain of a large sattra is the spiritual head of a wealthy and powerful college, and is looked up to as the ultimate authority in religious and social matters by thousands of\nvillagers, many of whom live miles away. In most of the larger satras the presiding gosain is a Br\u0101hman, but in some of the smaller institutions he is a Kalit\u0101 or K\u0101yasth. These priests are the great proselytizing agency in Assam; they exercise a civilizing influence on the aboriginal tribes, and have always been distinguished by their loyalty to Government and by enlightenment and liberality of thought. A special form of Vaishnavism found in the Assam Valley is the Mah\u0101purushia faith, founded by a K\u0101yasth named Sankar Deb about the end of the fifteenth century, which represents a revolt against the pretensions of the Br\u0101hmans and the licentious rites of corrupted forms of Saktism. Its followers pay little attention to caste, are willing to accept a Sudra as their gosain, are uncompromising in their hostility to idols, and worship God, in the form of Krishna, with hymns and prayers only. Sankar Deb himself was a vegetarian; but he was unable to impose this rule upon his followers, who were for the most part men of low caste, and they are allowed to eat the flesh of wild but not of domesticated animals. The sect has a following of about 400,000, but the returns have to be accepted with a certain degree of caution.\n\nNearly one-fifth of the Hindu population described themselves as followers of Sakt\u012b or K\u0101li, who represents the procreative force as manifested in the female. The temple of K\u0101makhy\u0101 in K\u0101mr\u016bp is a special object of veneration to the devotees of this creed, as it is said to cover the place where the pudenda of Sakti fell, when her body was cut in pieces by Vishnu; but Saktism, as a rule, is not popular with the inhabitants of Assam, and many of the so-called Saktists were merely garden coolies and rough tribesmen, who had not yet learned sufficient self-restraint to abandon meat and liquor. The devotees of Siva, who is the male counterpart of Sakt\u012b, are comparatively few in number. Most of them are found in the Surm\u0101 Valley. Another small sect remarkable for the peculiarity of its tenets is the Sahaj Bhajan. Each worshipper endeavours to secure salvation by taking a woman as a spiritual guide, but it is said that at their midnight meetings there is much sexual licence under the cloak of religion. It is, however, possible that these charges are merely the calumnies with which a new creed is usually assailed by the supporters of the established order.\n\nThe standard form of Hindu temple is a dome-shaped structure enclosing the shrine, approached by a short nave. It is usually built of thin flat bricks, with a fine glaze, and enriched with bas-reliefs; but there are comparatively few of these masonry buildings in the Province. Almost every village in Assam proper contains, however, a large barn-like structure, called the namghor, in which the people assemble for prayer and worship. In the Surm\u0101 Valley there are few temples or places of this kind, and the ordinary Hindu performs his devotions in a part of his house specially reserved for that purpose.\nAbout one-fourth of the population of the Province, or 1,581,317 persons, returned themselves as Muhammadans in 1901. Nearly three-fourths of them were found in the District of Sylhet, which was conquered at the end of the fourteenth century by Sikandar Gh\u0101zi, who was largely assisted in his enterprise by the famous Muhammadan fakir Sh\u0101h Jal\u0101l. This man was a native of Yemen in Arabia, who had been sent by his uncle to Hindust\u0101n with a handful of earth, and orders to settle in the place where the earth was similar to the sample he took with him. The ground of Sylhet proved to be of the quality desired, and Sh\u0101h Jal\u0101l settled in the newly conquered territory. A fine mosque, which is held to be of peculiar sanctity, has been built over his tomb, and a monthly grant is allowed by Government for its support. The tombs of the 360 disciples of the fakir are to be seen in almost every portion of the town. Muhammadans are also fairly numerous in C\u0101ch\u0101r, which for many years has acted as an outlet for the surplus population of Sylhet, and in Go\u0101lp\u0101ra, where they form more than a fourth of the population. The Brahmaputra Valley was invaded by the Muhammadans on several occasions, and one general is said to have penetrated as far as Sadiy\u0101; but Go\u0101lp\u0101ra was the only District which they held for any length of time, and the influences of the faith were not largely felt at the eastern end of the valley. In the hills less than 3 per cent. of the population professed Isl\u0101m, the majority of whom were working on the railway in North C\u0101ch\u0101r, or living in the tarai at the foot of the G\u0101ro Hills. Only 2,724 persons were returned as Shiahs, and 47 as members of the strict reforming sect known as Ahl-i-hadis, or Wahh\u0101bis. The remainder, so far as they returned any sect at all, were Sunnis. The Mori\u0101s are a small sect of degraded Muhammadans, who are said to be descended from the followers of Turbak, a Path\u0101n who invaded Assam in the sixteenth century, and was there defeated and killed. They were employed by their captors in various capacities, for which they showed themselves to be totally unfitted, and were ultimately made braziers. They are looked down upon by their neighbours, and the number of persons who admit that they are Mori\u0101s naturally does not tend to increase. Muhammadan mosques are usually small brick structures, consisting of an open quadrangle with a covered arcade at the west end, but in some of the remoter parts of the Province service is held in a thatched hut.\n\nNo less than 1,068,334 persons, or 17 per cent. of the population, still profess those various forms of primitive belief which are usually described as animistic. The main feature of this religion is the desire to propitiate the devils who are ever on the alert to injure man, though most tribes recognize the existence of kindly spirits and the possibility of a future life. The number of unconverted tribesmen living in the Surm\u0101 Valley is very small, but in the four lower Districts of the valley\nof the Brahmaputra the proportion varies from 31 per cent. in Nowgong to 21 per cent. in K\u0101mr\u016bp. In Sibs\u0101gar the animistic tribes form only 7 per cent., and in Lakhimpur 5 per cent. of the total population. In the Hill Districts they form 85 per cent. of the whole. The tribesmen have no special preference for their own forms of religion, and take fairly readily to Hinduism in the plains, and to Christianity in the hills. Conversion would, in fact, proceed rapidly, were it not for the natural reluctance of these primitive people to abandon pork, liquor, and the freedom of intercourse between the sexes permitted by their own religion. Apart from Christianity, the only other religious bodies requiring mention are the Buddhists (8,911), the majority of whom are found in Lakhimpur and Sibs\u0101gar, and the Jains (1,797), who are usually M\u0101rw\u0101ri merchants from R\u0101jput\u0101na.\n\nThe total number of Christians in Assam in 1901 was:\u2014Europeans and allied races, 2,099; Eurasians, 275; natives, 33,595. Between 1891 and 1901 the number of native Christians increased by 128 per cent. The chief proselytizing agency in the Province is the Welsh Presbyterian Mission, whose head-quarters are in the Kh\u0101si and Jainti\u0101 Hills. This mission was started in 1841, and in 1903 gave employment to 36 missionaries, of whom 13 were stationed in the Surm\u0101 Valley and 2 in the Lushai Hills. There is no caste system or social prejudice among the Kh\u0101sis to act as an obstacle to conversion; they come but little under the influence of Hinduism, and their readiness to accept the Christian faith can be judged from the fact that in 1901 nearly 9 per cent. of the population of the District returned themselves under this head. The Baptist Mission has also met with a large measure of success, the numbers of this sect having risen from 3,767 in 1891 to 10,045 at the last Census. The mission was first started at Sadiy\u0101 in Lakhimpur District in 1836, and in 1903 had 21 missionaries. Their main centres are in the G\u0101r\u014d Hills, Go\u0101lp\u0101ra, K\u0101mr\u016bp, and Sibs\u0101gar Districts. Both the Anglican and Roman Catholic churches are included in the diocese of Calcutta.\n\nThe number of persons in British territory (excluding Manipur) returned under the main religions at the last two enumerations is shown below:\n\n| Religions | 1891 | 1901 |\n|-----------|------|------|\n| Hindus    | 2,997,072 | 3,258,522 |\n| Animists  | 928,175  | 965,027  |\n| Musalm\u0101ns | 1,433,974 | 1,570,934 |\n| Christians |       |       |\n| Native    | 14,762  | 33,587  |\n| Others    | 2,082   | 2,337   |\n| Buddhists | 7,697   | 8,766   |\n| Others    | 1,481   | 2,705   |\n\nThe economic organization of the Province is of a very simple\ncharacter, and the great majority of the population are supported by agriculture. In the hills and the Assam Valley there is very little subdivision of function: the ordinary cultivator builds and repairs his own house, makes his own agricultural implements, has his clothes woven at home, and in fact supplies almost all his own simple wants. The occupations returned in 1901 were divided into eight main classes. The number of persons supported by each class and the percentage they form of the total population were as follows: Government service, 34,791, or 0.6 per cent.; agriculture and pasture, 5,172,228, or 84.5 per cent.; personal services, 75,395, or 1.2 per cent.; preparation and supply of material substances, 479,358, or 7.8 per cent.; commerce, transport, and storage, 86,497, or 1.4 per cent.; professions, 84,971, or 1.4 per cent.; unskilled labour other than agricultural, 111,401, or 1.8 per cent.; means of subsistence independent of occupation, 81,702, or 1.3 per cent. The number of actual workers was almost exactly equal to the number of persons who were supported by others. Of the total number of workers, 1,073,776, or 35 per cent., were women, the great majority of whom take an active share in the cultivation of the land, for, though a woman may not touch the plough, she is very frequently employed to transplant paddy seedlings or reap the crop when ripe.\n\nThe staple food of the people is boiled rice, eaten with pulse, spices, and fish or vegetable curry. Among the well-to-do, pigeon or duck occasionally takes the place of fish; but fish is a very common article of diet in the plains, and is said to be a substitute for ghi, which is not very largely used. Goat's flesh is eaten by Muhammadans and Hindus alike, while venison is always acceptable, and in parts of the Assam Valley by no means rare. The restrictions on the eating of flesh are not so stringent as in Upper India, and even respectable Br\u0101hmans take duck, pigeon, and goat. Fowls (like beef) are debarred to the Hindu, and so are sheep, though in parts of Sylhet ram's flesh is eaten even by the higher castes. An orthodox Br\u0101hman in that District will take food only once between sunrise and sunset, but this rule is not observed in the Assam Valley. Domesticated pork is of course forbidden to both Hindu and Muhammadan, but the lower Hindu castes will sometimes eat wild hog. Tea-drinking is very common, especially in the early morning. Sweetmeats usually consist of powdered grain mixed with milk, sugar, and ghi. The hillmen and the aboriginal tribes eat flesh of all kinds, even when nearly putrid. Dog is generally considered a luxury by them, and lizards, snakes, and insects are appreciated, but milk is very seldom taken.\n\nThe ordinary form of dress for a villager is a cotton dhoti or waist-cloth, with a big shawl or wrapper, and sometimes a cotton coat or waistcoat. Women in Assam wear a petticoat, a scarf tied round the\nbust, and a shawl. In the Assam Valley these clothes are generally home-made, and in the case of women, and of the large wraps used in the cold season by men, are frequently of silk. A curious article of dress is a large flat hat, called *jhapi*, made of leaves and split bamboo and decorated with coloured cloth, which serves as a protection against the sun and the rain. These hats are circular in shape, and range from 2 to 4 feet in diameter, but those of the larger size are more often carried than worn. In the Surm\u0101 Valley women wear a *sari*, a piece of cloth about 15 feet long and nearly 4 feet broad; this is fastened round the waist to form a petticoat, and then brought over the head and shoulders so as to cover the rest of the body. Chemises and bodices are also sometimes used. In this part of the Province there is very little home-made cloth. Manchester piece-goods are in great request, and machine-made coats and shirts are largely worn. The dress of the middle classes does not differ materially from that of the ordinary villager, but a superior material is employed, and shirts are usually worn. In the Assam Valley beautiful silk and cotton cloths are woven by the wives and daughters of the well-to-do, and fine embroidered cloths are produced in Manipur. Boots and shoes are the exception, and in their own homes even the richer people wear wooden clogs. Wooden sandals are also used by villagers in the Assam Valley when travelling or working in jungle ground, where there are tufts of sharp-pointed grass. In the hills several fashions are in vogue. Beyond the frontier, some of the N\u0101g\u0101 tribes go absolutely naked, and even in British territory N\u0101g\u0101 men and women are often content with the very minimum of apparel. The state dress of the Kh\u0101sis, on the other hand, consists of a silk waistcoat and richly-embroidered tunic, set off with much handsome jewellery; and an Ang\u0101m\u012b N\u0101g\u0101 in his war-paint is a distinctly impressive sight.\n\nThe house of the ordinary villager consists of three or four small and ill-ventilated rooms, built round three sides of a court-yard. The walls are usually made of reeds plastered over with mud, the roof of thatch supported on bamboos, the floor of mud. In the Assam Valley the materials required for the construction of a house do not, as a rule, cost the proprietor anything but the labour of procuring them, but the houses are small and generally badly built. In the Surm\u0101 Valley the villagers take more trouble; the cottages are raised on high plinths, are well thatched, and have an arched roof-tree to resist the storms. Brick houses are very rare, and the dwellings of the middle class are in the same style, but larger and of better quality than the cottage of the peasant. The furniture of the cultivating classes is simple, and consists of a few boxes and wicker-work stools, brass and bell-metal cooking utensils, earthen pots and pans, baskets, and bottles, and in the Assam Valley a loom. The villager sometimes sleeps on a small bamboo\nmach\u0101n or platform, and sometimes on a mat on the floor, but the middle classes have beds, tables, and chairs in their houses. The animistic tribes usually build on piles, the floor being raised a few feet above the ground. The house consists of one long building, divided into cubicles by a few partitions. Among certain tribes this building is enlarged to meet the wants of the growing family, and sometimes as many as sixty persons reside in one barrack.\n\nHindus burn and Muhammadans bury their dead. Some animistic tribes follow the Hindu custom, unless the death has been due to an infectious disease, when they are afraid of the infection being carried in the smoke of the funeral pyre; others bury, while a few tribes simply throw dead bodies into the jungle. Some tribes preserve the corpses of their wealthier men for several months after death. They are placed in wooden coffins inside the house, and the liquid matter is carried off through a bamboo. The Paithes, who live in the Lushai Hills, smear a greasy preparation over the corpse, which preserves and hardens the skin. It is then dressed in its best clothes, and in the evening is brought outside the house, and rice beer is poured down its throat. This disgusting performance is sometimes continued for several weeks.\n\nDice, cards, and chess are played by the well-to-do; and the cultivators in the Assam Valley amuse themselves with simple theatrical performances, music, singing, dancing, buffalo and cock-fights, and in places with a game in which two eggs are banged together, a forfeit being paid for the one that is broken. The ordinary Hindu festivals, such as the Holi, Rath J\u0101tra, Janmashtami, K\u0101li, and Durg\u0101 p\u016bj\u0101s, are observed. Special celebrations are the Bishori p\u016bj\u0101 in honour of the goddess of snakes and the K\u0101rtik p\u016bj\u0101 in Sylhet, and the M\u0101gh and Bais\u0101kh Bihus in Assam. The M\u0101gh Bihu is the harvest home. The cultivators feast after having gathered in their crops, bathe at dawn, and then warm themselves at bonfires of rice straw, which have been prepared several weeks beforehand, and which form a conspicuous feature in the rural landscape towards the end of December. The Bais\u0101kh Bihu, which ushers in the new year, lasts for a week, and is an occasion of some licence. Boys and girls join in songs and dances of a somewhat unrestrained character, and lapses from chastity are considered venial. This festival not unfrequently gives rise to suits for abduction against lovers who have induced the object of their affections to elope with them, instead of paying the usual bride price to the parents of the girl. The anniversaries of the deaths of the two Vaishnavite reformers, Sankar Deb and M\u0101dhbab Deb, are also observed by the Assamese. In the Surm\u0101 Valley the villagers indulge in boat-races in long canoes, manned by from fifteen to twenty pairs of paddlers, who keep time to the songs of a man who dances in the centre of the vessel and beats a pair of cymbals. The Kh\u0101sis are much addicted\nto archery competitions, and are very skilful with the bow; and the N\u0101g\u0101s amuse themselves by putting the weight, leaping, and exercises on the horizontal bar.\n\nThe best-known game of all is, however, polo, which is supposed by some to have been introduced to European players from Manipur, and which is still played by the natives of that State with the greatest enthusiasm. A good Manipuri pony, though seldom over twelve hands high, has, for its size, remarkable speed, courage, and endurance. There are usually from five to seven players on each side, there are often no goal posts, and no attention is paid to the rules prohibiting crossing, fouling, or reckless use of the stick. The rush of a Manipuri team thus suggests a cavalry regiment practising shock tactics, and were it not for the small size of the ponies serious accidents would frequently occur. The pony\u2019s bridle is covered with large brightly-coloured balls of wool, the rider\u2019s legs are protected by curious leather shields, and while the upper part of his body is clothed in gay attire, and his calves covered with gaiters, his thighs are almost naked. The general effect is most striking. The men possess a wonderful command over the ball, and hit it from almost any position in any direction.\n\nHindus of the higher castes usually have two names, one corresponding to the Christian name of Europe, the other a family name. The number of family names is, however, so small that they do not give much clue to the individuality of the bearer. A caste name, such as Sarm\u0101 for Br\u0101hmans, Gupta for Baidyas, and Das for all castes other than these two, is sometimes added. Titles, such as Rai, Chowdhury, Mazumdar, Gohain, Phukan, Baruah, are, however, in common use, especially in the Assam Valley. Proper names are often of a grandiloquent character, such as \u2018Lord of the earth and moon,\u2019 \u2018Delight of women\u2019; but children are sometimes called after the day of the week or the month in which they were born. Women usually bear the names of goddesses or flowers. Among the poorer people, names like Fedela, \u2018The dirty one,\u2019 are sometimes given with the idea of averting the jealousy of the gods. The Kh\u0101sis attach the male prefix U and the female prefix Ka to all proper names. Common affixes of place names are ganj in the Surm\u0101 Valley, which indicates a market; pur, a town; and in Assam garh, a fort and embankment; gao, a village; dai, water; and ranga, red, referring to the colour of the soil.\n\nThe Province of Assam consists, as has been already mentioned, of two great alluvial plains, surrounded on three sides by mountains. The soil formation thus falls into two main classes: that of the hill tracts, which are being denuded; and that of the valleys, which are being formed by the same process. There is a further distinction between the conditions prevailing in the two valleys, due to the difference in their elevation above sea-level. During\nthe rainy season there is usually a strong current in the Brahmaputra and the other rivers of the Assam Valley; and where the current is swift it is only the heavier portion of the matter held in suspension\u2014that is, the sand\u2014which is deposited. In the Surm\u0101 Valley, where there is very little fall, the rivers are sluggish, and when they overflow enrich the fields with silt. Silt is also deposited in the Assam Valley in slack water away from the main current, and the soil of that Division consists of a mixture of clay and sand in varying proportions, which ranges from pure sand to clay so stiff as to be hardly fit for cultivation.\n\nThe land best adapted for the growth of rice, the staple food-crop of the Province, is a deep, soft, clayey loam, which has been rendered light and friable by the action of worms. Where there is too much sand, the soil is too light to retain the water necessary for the development of the crop. Where the clay is too stiff, it is impervious to air and water, and difficult to plough, and the roots of the plant are likely to be choked. The fertility of the soil is also largely affected by the quantity of organic matter it contains. This humus, or vegetable mould, is formed by the decomposition of vegetable matter, and is most abundant in land that has long remained under jungle. It contains nitrogen, which is one of the most important elements of plant food, and is useful alike to clayey and sandy soils. The former it renders less clinging and less liable to bake into hard clods, while to the latter it gives more adhesion and greater capacity to retain water. A further advantage is to be found in its solvent action on the iron in the earth. By this means it tends to check the formation of the hard red pan, which often underlies thin poor soils, and injures the crop by interfering with the growth of the roots. The suitability of land for rice depends, however, chiefly upon its elevation, and its capacity for retaining moisture.\n\nGenerally speaking, the country on either side of the Brahmaputra falls into four classes. The first is the chapari, or land in the immediate neighbourhood of the river, which is heavily flooded during the rains. It is, as a rule, covered with high grass jungle, which has to be cut down and burned before it can be brought under cultivation; but, when the floods do not rise too soon, it yields excellent crops of \u0101hu, or summer rice. The seed is sown in March or April and reaped in June or July, and is followed by a crop of mustard or pulse, which is sown when the river falls in October and November, and gathered about three months later. When the land is first cleared of jungle it is free from weeds, but they spring up with great rapidity in the second and third year of cropping, and it is then abandoned for from eight to ten years to allow the high jungle time to kill them out. Behind the chapari comes a belt of low-lying land, in which bao, a long-stemmed variety of rice, is grown. It is usually sown in April or May and reaped in November and\nDecember. Summer rice is sometimes mixed with bao, in the hope of getting a crop before the river rises. The water drains off slowly from this belt, and the land is left too cold and damp for winter crops. The level of the country then gradually rises above the reach of ordinary floods, and s\u0101li, or transplanted winter rice, becomes the staple crop. The grain is sown in nursery beds, the seedlings are transplanted in June or July, when they are about two months old, and the harvest is reaped in November and December. S\u0101li is divided into two main varieties, bar and lahi. The former gives a heavier yield, but ripens later and requires more water than lahi, and is therefore usually planted on lower land. This belt of land is a broad one, containing most of the permanent cultivation and the majority of the agricultural population. Beyond this again comes the submontane tract. The level of the land here is higher, and the fields are often irrigated from hill streams. The chief crop is s\u0101li, or a transplanted form of \u0101hu known as kharma. This land is practically free from all risk of flood, and artificial irrigation renders the harvest particularly secure.\n\nThese four belts are not, however, found in all parts of the valley. Very little bao is grown in the Districts of Darrang, Sibs\u0101gar, and Lakhimpur; and though, as a rule, chapari is found on both sides of the Brahmaputra, there are places where the margin of permanent cultivation comes down almost to the river bank. Sugar-cane is usually planted on high land near the village site in the broad belt of permanent cultivation.\n\nThe conditions of the Surm\u0101 Valley are somewhat different. There is no chapari, and the banks of the rivers are the highest and the most fertile part. In C\u0101ch\u0101r and the eastern part of Sylhet the bulk of the land resembles that found in the broad belt of permanent cultivation in Assam, and the staple crops are sail and aus, which correspond to the s\u0101li and \u0101hu of the other valley. The western portion of Sylhet becomes one great swamp in the rains, and is fit only for the cultivation of \u0101man, a form of long-stemmed rice. A fourth kind of rice called sailbura is grown in the large haors or basins to which reference has been already made. It is sown at the end of the rains and harvested about May, and gives an exceptionally large yield per acre. Sugar-cane is often grown on low land, and mustard on old high land near the village site, where it gives a poorer out-turn than on the fertile river banks of Assam.\n\nThe majority of the hill tribes cultivate on the jh\u016bm system. A patch of land is cleared with axe and fire, the soil is hoed up, and the seeds of hill rice, chillies, cotton, millets, gourds, and other vegetables dibbled in among the ashes. The same plot is seldom cropped for more than two or three years in succession. After this time the weeds spring up in great luxuriance, and further cultivation would destroy the roots of\nikra or bamboo jungle, upon the growth of which the land depends for its fertility. Jhums are left fallow for as long a time as possible. The shortest period is four years, but this is generally extended to eight or ten. In the Kh\u0101si Hills rice is grown in terraced and irrigated fields in the valleys, but other crops, such as potatoes and millet, are raised on the bare hill-side. The Tankul and Ang\u0101m\u012b country lies too high for the successful cultivation of jhum rice, and there is not sufficient land to permit the people to rely on this system of cultivation. The villages of these tribes are surrounded by admirably constructed terraced rice-fields, built up with stone retaining-walls at different levels, and irrigated by skilfully designed channels, which distribute the water over each step in the series.\n\nThe agricultural implements are all of a very primitive character. They include a wooden plough with an iron-tipped share, wooden rakes and mallets, a rough bamboo harrow, sickles, bill-hooks, knives, and baskets. In Assam proper sugar-cane is pressed between two grooved logs of wood, turned by a pole, and the iron mill, though more expeditious and economical, is little used. Winter rice is sown in carefully-manured beds near the homestead, which at the commencement of the rains form brilliant patches of green in the landscape. While the shoots are growing, the cultivator ploughs his fields some four or five times, reducing the soil to a fine puddle of clay, and repairs the low mounds intended to retain the water. In Assam proper the seedlings are planted out in handfuls by the women, who can be seen up to their knees in mud, stooping for hours together under the burning summer sun. The distance at which the clumps are placed depends upon the quality of the soil, varying from 8 inches to 3 feet. As the crop grows, it covers the plain with a rich carpet of green, turning towards the end of the year to a fine yellow. When ripe, the grain is cut off near the head, tied in bundles, and carried, slung from bamboos, to the homestead, where it is threshed out by cattle as occasion requires. Bao or \u0101man and \u0101hu are sown broadcast, but the yield is usually smaller, and the quality of the grain is not so fine. Mustard requires four or five ploughings; and when new land is broken up, the cultivators have to press down the high grass jungle and wait till it is sufficiently withered to catch fire. Sugar-cane is a crop which, though yielding good returns, entails a considerable amount of labour. The land is generally ploughed twice for pulse, but the seed is sometimes sown broadcast over fields that have just yielded a crop of rice. The plants are pulled up when ripe, left to dry for a week or ten days, and brought in at the leisure of the cultivator.\n\nAssam is a purely rural country, with no large towns, and in 1901 no less than 84 per cent. of the population returned agriculture as their means of livelihood. The proportion of agriculturists in the different\nDistricts was highest in the G\u0101r\u014d, N\u0101g\u0101, and Lushai Hills, and in Darrang, Nowgong, and Sibs\u0101gar. It was lowest in K\u0101mr\u016bp and Sylhet, where there were large numbers of fishermen and priests.\n\nThe area under different crops in the five upper Districts of the Brahmaputra Valley is returned by the local revenue officials. The figures may be accepted as fairly accurate, but do not, as a rule, include the comparatively small area occupied by tribes not assessed to land revenue. The principal crops raised are rice, pulse, tea, sugar-cane, and rape and mustard. The area under these crops will be found in Table IV, appended to this article; but this table gives a very imperfect idea of the cultivated area of the Province, as it does not include the Hill Districts, Sylhet, and Go\u0101lp\u0101ra, for the greater part of which there are no returns, or C\u0101ch\u0101r, the figures for which have become available only in recent years. As a matter of fact, there are probably at least four million acres under rice in Assam, and over a quarter of a million under mustard.\n\nWheat is sown in Go\u0101lp\u0101ra, where it is believed that there are about 10,000 acres under this crop; elsewhere both wheat and barley are raised only in small patches by foreigners. Jute is grown on a commercial scale in Go\u0101lp\u0101ra and Sylhet, and is gradually extending into K\u0101mr\u016bp; but in the rest of the Province the villagers plant only enough to supply the home demand. The estimated area under jute in 1903-4 was 39,000 acres. Linseed is largely grown in Sylhet, but is not common elsewhere. Garden crops include tobacco, several kinds of plantain, vegetables, p\u0101n or betel-leaf, the areca palm, pepper, and various kinds of spices. In the Surm\u0101 Valley p\u0101n is grown in the orthodox way by Baruis in neatly fenced gardens, completely covered with the tendrils of the plant; but in Assam it is usually trained up the stem of the areca palm. Plantains of different kinds are found near every house; and in the Assam Valley the ash is largely used as a substitute for salt, the people still clinging to the customs which prevailed in the days of native rule, when mineral salt could not easily be obtained. Pepper is mentioned in Welsh\u2019s Report on Assam, in 1794, as a plant that throve well, but, though the cultivation would be most lucrative, only a small quantity is grown. The Kh\u0101s\u012bs export potatoes, oranges, pineapples, and the leaves of the bay-tree; and cotton is grown by most of the hill tribes. It has a very short and somewhat harsh staple, but it is useful to mix with wool and the proportion of seed is unusually low.\n\nIn C\u0101ch\u0101r the rice crop is usually distributed under the three chief varieties of the grain in the following proportions: sail or s\u0101l\u012b, 70 per cent.; aus or \u0101hu, 22 per cent.; \u0101man or bao, 8 per cent. For the Assam Valley the proportion is s\u0101l\u012b, 70 per cent.; \u0101hu, 22 per cent.; and bao, 8 per cent. \u0100hu and bao are grown chiefly in Lower Assam; in Darrang, Sibs\u0101gar, and Lakhimpur there is not much \u0101hu and hardly\nany bao. The normal yield of sali rice is about 9 cwt. of cleaned grain per acre, and that of ahu and bao about a cwt. less. Mustard gives about 5 cwt. of seed, and sugar-cane about a ton of raw molasses per acre. These figures represent only a rough general standard; the actual crop obtained is often considerably in excess or defect of the mean.\n\nCow-dung and the sweepings of the courtyard are used to manure garden crops, sugar-cane, jute, and the nurseries in which rice seedlings are grown; and in the more congested parts of the Province cow-dung is sometimes spread on the rice-fields themselves. The chapari and the shifting cultivation of the hill tribes are enriched by the ashes of the jungle with which the land was originally covered. Exhausted tea land is top-dressed with richer soil, and on some gardens the use of oilcake and farm-yard manure is coming into favour. The Kh\u0101s\u012bs fully appreciate the value of cow-dung as a fertilizer, but all over the Province immense quantities of this excellent manure are allowed to go to waste. There is practically no rotation of crops, apart from the system under which summer rice is followed by pulse or mustard, while pulse is usually sown on the rice-seedling bed, as it is thought to benefit the soil.\n\nIt is impossible to obtain accurate figures showing the extension of cultivation in the Province as a whole. No statistics are available for the hills, or the permanently settled estates of Sylhet and Go\u0101lp\u0101ra, and there is a considerable difference between the conditions prevailing in the two valleys. In Assam proper and in the Eastern Du\u0101rs the extension of cultivation is best measured by the growth of the area settled at full rates, excluding the land held by planters. The area so settled in 1881\u20132 was 1,335,000 acres. During the next ten years there was an increase of 15 per cent., which was, however, partly due to the operations of the cadstral survey, and to greater strictness in the measurement of land. Then ensued a period of extreme depression in Lower and Central Assam, and by 1902\u20133 the area settled in this way had increased by only 63,000 acres, or 4 per cent. more than the total for 1891\u20132. This slow rate of increase, in a Division where there are enormous tracts of cultivable waste available for settlement, was due to exceptional mortality which seriously reduced the indigenous population, and to the damage done by the earthquake of 1897, which interfered with the natural drainage in Lower Assam.\n\nThe settled area of C\u0101ch\u0101r has increased rapidly since it came under British rule. In 1843, when the first settlement was made, the area covered by the operations was only 97,900 acres. In 1903 the settled area of the District was 607,000 acres. The cultivated area held on ordinary tenure increased by 24 per cent. between 1883\u20134 and 1896\u20137. It is impossible to ascertain the extent to which cultivation has extended in Sylhet District as a whole, but in the Jainti\u0101 parganas the cropped\narea increased by 22 per cent. during the currency of the last settlement, which was for a period of fifteen years.\n\nThe great obstacle to the extension of cultivation is the absence of a labouring class. In the Surm\u0101 Valley, K\u0101mr\u016bp, and Go\u0101lp\u0101ra agricultural labourers are extremely scarce, and in Central and Upper Assam they are practically non-existent. The climate of the country in the rains is not calculated to stimulate the inhabitants to prolonged physical exertion; and ryots, who are compelled to plough, plant, and reap with their own hands, are not likely to cultivate more land than is absolutely necessary for their maintenance.\n\nThe villagers usually select the best heads of rice for seed grain, but are not very prompt to adopt new varieties. The cultivation of jute on the commercial scale is slowly spreading up the Assam Valley, and the ras and balam varieties of rice have recently been tried. Potatoes were introduced into the Kh\u0101si Hills by Mr. Scott in 1830, and are now extensively cultivated in that District. Of recent years the plants have been attacked by disease, but fresh varieties, imported by Government, have been much appreciated by the villagers. An experimental farm is maintained near Shillong, and scientific farming has been undertaken on a small scale by Europeans and Bengalis in Darrang. Efforts have been made by the Agricultural department from time to time to introduce new and improved varieties of seed, but the results produced have been inconsiderable. In 1903 a garden of European fruit trees was opened near Shillong, as the Kh\u0101sis can be relied upon to adopt without delay any forms of fruit culture that seem likely to prove remunerative.\n\nGenerally speaking, there is not much serious indebtedness among the cultivators of the Province, and the creditors themselves are often agriculturists. In Assam there is no rich upper or middle class, and few natives other than the M\u0101rw\u0101ris are possessed of any capital. The rate of interest is in consequence extremely high, varying from $37\\frac{1}{2}$ to 75 per cent. per annum. In parts of the Assam Valley it is the custom for the poorer villagers to take advances from traders on the standing crop, which is subsequently sold at a price below that ruling in the open market. This is especially the case with mustard, which cannot always be removed till the rivers rise in the rains. In the Surm\u0101 Valley the producer often deals direct with the trader from Bengal, and the practice of giving advances is not so common. In Sylhet it is said that the indebtedness of the cultivators is increasing. New wants have arisen, but the villagers do not care to make the additional exertions required to provide the means to gratify them. Wages, however, still rule high, so that there cannot be much poverty, and it is seldom necessary for Government to make loans to agriculturists. The total amount so advanced in 1903-4 was less than Rs. 24,000.\nThe cattle of Assam are a peculiarly degenerate breed. Their degeneracy is largely due to a complete disregard of all the laws of breeding, to overwork, and to absolute neglect. The Valley of the Brahmaputra is exceptionally well supplied with grazing-grounds, and there are few places even in the more densely settled tracts where pasture cannot be obtained within 5 miles of the village site. The grazing near the village is, however, usually poor, and far inferior to the rich grass that grows in the cold season on the marshes that fringe the banks of the Brahmaputra and its tributaries. Where grazing is not readily obtainable, rice straw is used for fodder. In the Surm\u0101 Valley the haors, or great depressions, to which reference has been already made, afford excellent grazing in the cold season, but during the rains the cattle are almost entirely stall-fed on straw, or on grass dragged from the bottom of the flooded tracts. The villagers pay very little attention to the comfort of their animals, and their condition is not much better than that of the cattle in Assam proper. In the hills the cattle, though small, are fat and sturdy, and, where milked, give a small but very rich supply. The buffaloes in the valley of the Brahmaputra are particularly fine animals, but they have been largely supplemented by the smaller breed imported from Bengal. There is no indigenous breed of sheep, or, except in Manipur, of ponies. The Manipuri pony is a very hardy little animal, but unfortunately the breed has nearly died out. Cart-bullocks are imported from Upper India, and ponies and sheep from Bhutan. The average prices of farm stock are: for a buffalo, Rs. 50 to Rs. 70; for a plough bullock, Rs. 15 to Rs. 25; for a cow, Rs. 8 to Rs. 15; and for a goat, Rs. 2\u20138 to Rs. 4. Serious loss is caused by rinderpest, foot-and-mouth disease, diarrhoea and dysentery, and other forms of cattle disease. There is only one veterinary surgeon in the Province, who has been engaged by the local boards of Sibs\u0101gar District.\n\nNo irrigation works have been constructed by Government, and no distinction has hitherto been drawn by the Agricultural department or the Settlement Officer between irrigated and unirrigated land. Irrigation is, however, freely resorted to by the Kach\u0101ris and Mechs, who live near the foot of the Him\u0101layas in the Assam Valley. The villagers combine to construct small channels, sometimes of considerable length, through which they convey the water of the hill streams to their fields. The abundance and certainty of the crop fully repay them for the labour expended on the work. In Sylhet the water in the cold season is dammed up in the lowest part of the haors and thence diverted on to the boro rice crop. Mention has already been made of the irrigation works of the Kh\u0101sis and Ang\u0101mi N\u0101g\u0101s. In normal years, however, the rainfall in every part of the Province is so abundant that the crops seldom suffer from want of moisture, and the chief danger\nto cultivation arises from flood. The system of forced labour which prevailed under the Ahom R\u0101j\u0101s enabled them to construct embankments along the Brahmaputra and many of its tributaries, some of which are still kept in repair. These works were especially numerous in Sibs\u0101gar District in the neighbourhood of the Ahom capital, where the country was protected from the floods of the Brahmaputra, the Dis\u0101ng, the Dikho, the Dihing, and the Darik\u0101. A considerable sum of money has already been expended by the British Government on the maintenance of these embankments, and a scheme is under consideration for the reclamation of a large area now exposed to flood. Raised roads along the banks of rivers are also common in Lower Assam.\n\nFrom the commercial point of view tea is the most important crop raised in Assam. The first discovery of the tea-plant growing wild in Upper Assam, in 1821, is generally assigned to Mr. Robert Bruce, who had proceeded thither on a mercantile exploration. The country then formed part of the Burmese dominions. But the first Burmese War shortly afterwards broke out; and a brother of the discoverer, having been appointed in 1826 to the command of a flotilla of gunboats, followed up the subject, and obtained several hundred plants and a quantity of seed. Some specimens were ultimately forwarded to the Superintendent of the Botanic Gardens at Calcutta. In 1832 Captain Jenkins was deputed by Lord William Bentinck, the Governor-General, to report upon the resources of Assam, and the tea-plant was specially brought to his notice by Mr. Bruce. In 1834 Lord William Bentinck recorded a minute, stating that his attention had been called to the subject previous to his having left England, and he appointed a committee to prosecute inquiries, and to promote the cultivation of the plant. Communications were opened with China with a view to obtain fresh plants and seeds; and a deputation, composed of gentlemen versed in botanical studies, was dispatched to Assam. Seed was obtained from China; but it was ascertained that the tea-plant was indigenous in Assam, and might be multiplied to any extent. Another result of the Chinese mission, the procuring of persons skilled in the cultivation and manufacture of black tea, was of more material benefit. Subsequently, under Lord Auckland, a further supply of Chinese cultivators and manufacturers was obtained, who were well acquainted with the processes necessary for the production of green tea. The experimental introduction of tea-planting into Assam was undertaken by Government. In 1835 the first tea garden was opened at Lakhimpur. In 1838 the first twelve chests of tea from Assam were received in England. They had been injured in some degree on the passage; but on samples being submitted to brokers, the reports were highly favourable. It was, however, the intention of Government not to carry on the trade, but to\nresign it to private enterprise as soon as the experimental cultivation proved successful. Mercantile associations for the planting and manufacture of tea in Assam began to be formed in 1839; and in 1840 Government made over its experimental establishment to the Assam Tea Company. In 1851 the crop of this company was estimated at 280,000 pounds. In 1854 gardens were opened in Darrang and K\u0101mr\u016bp; and in 1855 the plant was discovered growing wild in C\u0101ch\u0101r. During the next ten years, capital flowed into the business from all quarters. Land was recklessly taken up, to be sold to speculators in England for extravagant sums; and tea-growing for a time fell into the hands of stockjobbers and bubble companies. The crash came in 1866; and for the next few years this promising industry lay in a condition of extreme depression.\n\nAbout 1869, matters began to amend, and during the last thirty years there has been a great development of the industry. The returns for 1871 showed (in round figures) that 11,000,000 pounds of tea were manufactured in the Province. For 1881 the figures were 37,000,000 pounds; for 1891, 90,000,000 pounds; and for 1900, 141,000,000 pounds. The supply had by this time begun to show signs of exceeding the demand, and attempts were made to restrict the output by the introduction of a system of finer plucking. This was, however, but a temporary check, and in 1903 the output exceeded 145,000,000 pounds. There were in that year 764 gardens, which gave employment to 846 Europeans and 409,000 natives. The average out-turn was 445 pounds per acre, and the crop was valued at wholesale prices in Calcutta at more than 3\u00bd millions sterling. The capital invested in tea is probably about \u00a330 for every acre under cultivation; and as 338,000 acres were planted out in 1903, the capital value of the gardens in Assam may be estimated at nearly 10\u00bd millions sterling. About four-fifths of the capital employed by companies is owned by companies whose head offices are situated in England.\n\nThe want of labour has always been one of the most serious obstacles to the development of the industry. The mass of the population of the Province are above the necessity of working for wages, and nearly all the coolies employed on the plantations have to be imported from other parts of India. Assam is, however, unpopular among the labouring classes; the journey from the recruiting districts is troublesome and expensive, the class of persons capable of working successfully in the damp climate of the Province is limited, and of recent years the supply of labour available has not been sufficient to satisfy the\n\n---\n\n1 A considerable proportion of this tea property is held by private owners. The capital value of gardens owned by public companies appears to be about \u00a340 per acre, and this estimate, if applied to the total acreage, would show a capital value of 13\u00bd millions sterling.\nrequirements of the planters. Special Acts have been passed to regulate\nthe relations between the employers and their labour force. Careful\nprovision is made for the welfare of the cooly. He is housed in neat\nand comfortable lines; he is provided with an excellent water-supply,\ngenerally drawn from masonry wells; and when sick he is cared for\nin a comfortable hospital by a native doctor working under the super-\nvision of a European medical man. The provision of all these comforts\nand the importation of the labourers themselves cost large sums of\nmoney, which no one would be willing to expend without some guarantee\nthat the coolies when imported would consent to remain on the planta-\ntion. This protection is afforded by the law, which lays down that\na labourer, provided that he is well treated, must not leave the garden\nto which he is indentured before the expiry of his contract, unless\nhe chooses to redeem it by a money payment. During the ten years\nending with June 30, 1903, the total number of persons brought up to\nthe tea gardens was 543,800.\n\nThe land best suited for the plant in the Brahmaputra Valley is the\nvirgin soil of the dense forests at the foot of the hills, where the climate\nis hot and moist. In the Surm\u0101 Valley the most productive gardens\nare those planted on the low ranges of hills in the south of Sylhet\nDistrict, or on reclaimed marsh land. The yield in the Surm\u0101 Valley\nis higher than in Assam proper, but the cost of production and the\nprice obtained for the manufactured tea are alike lower. Indigenous\nseed gives the best results, and after this a hybrid of indigenous and\nChina. It is many years since China seed was planted out in new\nclearances, and considerable areas covered by this plant have been\nabandoned. The most important tea Districts and their area under\nthe plant in 1903 were: Sibs\u0101gar, 78,500 acres; Sylhet, 73,500 acres;\nLakhimpur, 69,300 acres; and Cach\u0101r, 60,000 acres.\n\nThe following is a short account of the system of cultivation and\nmanufacture usually followed. The seed is allowed to germinate\nbefore being sown in carefully-selected nursery beds. When the\nplants are about 12 inches high, they are planted out at distances\nof from 4 to 5 feet apart. As the bush grows it is pruned, in order to\nremove decayed or injured wood, to encourage the production of new\nshoots, and to form as large a surface for the latter purpose as possible.\nThe wild tea-tree grows to as much as 50 feet in height, whereas a well-\npruned bush does not exceed 3 or 4 feet. When the plant is about\nthree years old it is fit for plucking. The usual practice is to pick off\nthe top of each young shoot, removing either two or three leaves and\nthe bud. The shoot then germinates again, and the plant thus yields\neleven or twelve 'flushes,' as they are called, during the season.\n\nWhen the leaf has been taken to the tea-house it is spread out in thin\nlayers and allowed to wither, and then placed in the rolling machines.\nThe object of rolling is to break up the cellular matter and liberate the juices, and to give a twist to the leaf. After the leaf has been rolled, it is spread out in a cool room to allow oxidation to take place. As soon as this process is complete, it is placed in the firing machines until the last trace of moisture has been expelled and the tea is crisp to the touch. It is then sifted, sorted, fired again, and finally packed in lead-lined boxes while still warm.\n\nIn most of the Districts of Assam the actual cultivators of the soil usually hold direct from the State, and the area of land on which rent is paid is inconsiderable. A large part of Go\u0101lp\u0101ra and of the more densely populated portions of Sylhet was, however, included in the permanent settlement of Bengal; and the system of land tenure in C\u0101ch\u0101r, and the existence of large estates on privileged rates of revenue in K\u0101mr\u016bp, have tended to produce a tenant class, which at the last Census amounted to more than one-third of the total number of persons supported by agriculture. The amount of waste land still available in the Province is, however, so enormous, that there is little risk of landlords exacting too large a proportion of the profits of the soil, and Sylhet and Go\u0101lp\u0101ra are the only two Districts in which a tenancy law (Bengal Act VIII of 1869) is in force. In Sylhet, the rents charged vary from Rs. 12 to 12 annas for an acre of rice land, but the ordinary rate is about Rs. 3. There is a certain amount of competition among the cultivators to obtain land; but if the owner takes advantage of their necessities to raise the rates to an unreasonable pitch, he experiences great difficulty in realizing the demand. In Go\u0101lp\u0101ra, which is very sparsely peopled, rents vary from Rs. 6 to 12 annas an acre, the average rent paid by the cultivators for an acre of rice land being between Rs. 2 and Rs. 3. In Assam proper there is very little subletting, except in K\u0101mr\u016bp. The rent usually charged is the amount assessed by Government at full rates on land of a similar class, but occasionally it is as much as Rs. 6 for an acre of good rice land. In Upper Assam rents of Rs. 9 an acre are sometimes paid for rice-fields which are exceptionally fertile or have some special advantages of site; but the total area sublet is small, and in a large number of cases the tenant merely pays the Government revenue assessed upon the holding. In C\u0101ch\u0101r the average rent is about Rs. 6 per acre, varying from Rs. 7\u20138 to Rs. 4\u20138.\n\nIn place of cash rent the landlord occasionally receives a portion of the produce. In Sylhet the amount demanded is usually $3\\frac{1}{4}$ cwt. of unhulled rice per acre, but tenants prefer, as a rule, to pay in cash. In Assam proper the standard form of produce rent is the adhi, or half-share system. The owner of the land usually gives half the seed and pays the revenue; the tenant, as a rule, does the actual cultivation, but the crop can be divided at any stage, according to the terms of the\nagreement. The tenant's responsibilities sometimes cease when the land has been reduced to puddle, and the landlord has to transplant his seedlings and reap, carry, and thresh his share of the crop. At the other extreme come the cases where the tenant is required to thresh the grain before it is divided.\n\nOver the greater part of the Province, the supply of local labour is extremely limited; and although in most Districts the wages of unskilled labour are said to be 6 annas a day, it would be impossible to procure any considerable body of persons even for a larger sum. Hired labour is not much used for cultivation; but when a labourer is employed he receives from 4 to 5 annas a day, grain being often given in lieu of cash. In Lower Assam it is usually the practice to give a servant a large advance, which is gradually worked off; but in some cases the work done is set against the interest of the loan, so that the debt itself is never liquidated, and the debtor cannot succeed in freeing himself from his obligations. It is, however, to the interest of the employer to treat his servants well, as he has little hope of recovering the loan if they choose to leave him, and they are generally well fed and clothed, and treated almost as members of the family. In Sylhet, the prejudice against working for hire is not so strong as in Assam proper, where the feeling appears to be partly due to a revulsion from the system of forced labour which prevailed under the Ahom R\u0101j\u0101s. The ordinary wage paid to farm-labourers is 4 annas a day, but at harvest time they often receive double that sum. Assam, however, practically depends for its labour supply upon other parts of India. Railways are built, roads are made, and gardens are worked by imported coolies. Male coolies on gardens usually earn from Rs. 4 to Rs. 5 a month, and women about a rupee less; but they receive in addition substantial concessions in the shape of houses, water-supply, and medical comforts. Artisans are usually foreigners, and are said to earn from Rs. 15 to Rs. 30 a month.\n\nPrices in Assam are still liable to strongly marked fluctuations, and vary considerably in different parts of the Province. As a rule, they range higher in Upper Assam, where there is a large foreign population to be fed, but are fairly low in Lower Assam and Sylhet. Since 1893, there has been a general tendency towards a rise, due partly to bad harvests in the Province, partly to famine in other parts of India, and partly to a large increase in the foreign population. In good seasons, however, rice is still by no means dear. In 1899 and 1900 the average price for the Province was nearly 15 seers for a rupee (= about 45 lb. for 2 shillings), as compared with an average for the six years ending with 1879 of 13\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) seers (= about 49\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) lb. for 2 shillings). Such extensions of cultivation as have taken place do not tend to reduce the price of rice, as their effect is more than counterbalanced by\nthe increase in the foreign population. The same cause has, to a great extent, nullified the effect produced by the improvement of communications, though in 1900, when there was a bad harvest in Cachar, the stringency was relieved by the importation of large stocks of grain by the Assam-Bengal Railway. Generally speaking, the chief characteristic of Assam is sharp variations from year to year and also from place to place, a distance of a few miles being sometimes enough to double the price of grain. The average number of seers of rice to be purchased for a rupee during the five years ending with 1901 were: in Sylhet, 13 (= about 39 lb. for 2 shillings); in Kamrup, 12 (= about 36 lb. for 2 shillings); and in Lakhimpur, 10\u00bd (= about 31\u00bd lb. for 2 shillings). These five years include two when the harvest was bad, and two when it was distinctly good, and can thus be taken as fairly typical of present rates. Averages for earlier years for the Province will be found in Table V, appended to this article.\n\nThe ordinary Assamese peasant usually wears home-made articles of dress; the actual cash cost is small, and a woman could probably dress fairly well on Rs. 10 and a man on Rs. 5 per annum. The price of silk clothing is of course considerably higher. A Government orderly spends from Rs. 4 to Rs. 5 a month on his food, including oil, tobacco, spices, salt, and fish. A clerk who shares expenses with one or two friends need not spend more than Rs. 10 a month on food, including a share of the servants' wages, while the messing charge at the Hindu Hotel at Gauhati is only Rs. 6 a month. The villagers can, as a rule, obtain nearly all the materials required for their houses free of charge; but if payment must be made, a house costs from Rs. 25 to Rs. 50 to construct.\n\nThe material condition of the people is satisfactory. There is not much serious debt, the great mass of the population are above the necessity of working for daily wages, and the number of people who are in actual want is very small. In Upper Assam silk might almost be described as the everyday attire of the women, and there are few houses in which gold ornaments cannot be found. The standard of comfort is not high; but, on the other hand, the villagers are able to satisfy their simple wants with the minimum of toil and trouble. The condition of the clerical class is not so satisfactory, and those who have no land sometimes find difficulty in suiting their expenditure to their income. The class of landless day-labourers is very poorly represented in Assam; and a large number of those who returned themselves under this head at the Census were the younger sons of cultivating families, who take service for short periods in order to earn a little ready money. Their manner of life does not materially differ from that of the poor cultivator, and the two classes merge into one another.\nAs might be expected from the character of its surface and climate, the area of forest in Assam is very extensive. Government forests are divided into two classes, 'reserved' and 'unclassed state forests,' the latter being the term applied to all land at the disposal of the state, although a very large proportion of this is bare of timber. On June 30, 1904, the area of the Reserves was 3,778 square miles, and of the Unclassed state forests 18,509 square miles, excluding most of the Government waste in the Kh\u0101si and Jainti\u0101, Lushai, and N\u0101g\u0101 Hills.\n\nThe 'reserved' forests of Upper and Central Assam have not been thoroughly explored, and it is possible that they include tracts in which the tree growth is of an inferior character; but the area of Government waste is so large that the need for deforestation has not yet arisen. In the Surm\u0101 Valley the conditions are different. There is a keen demand for land for cultivation, and the people are beginning to press upon the soil. To meet this demand, 28 square miles were recently deforested in C\u0101ch\u0101r and 67 square miles in Sylhet, as the land contained little valuable timber. In the hills there is less good forest than might be expected, though there is no lack of wooded country. The habits of the hill races do not permit the growth of valuable timber, except in isolated spots to which their shifting cultivation has not extended; and this cultivation and forest fires have denuded the interior of the hills, where the people chiefly live. The most valuable forests are those of Go\u0101lp\u0101ra, where a large area is covered with s\u0101l (Shorea robusta). This tree is also found in the G\u0101ro Hills, K\u0101mr\u016bp, Nowgong, and Darrang.\n\nOutside Go\u0101lp\u0101ra and Sylhet, all Districts contain extensive areas of mixed and evergreen forest. Here, besides s\u0101l, the most valuable timber trees are tita sapa (Michelia Champaca), jarul or ajhar (Lagerstroemia Flos reginae), nahor (Mesua ferrea), sam (Artocarpus Chaplasha), gomari (Gmelina arborea), khair (Acacia Catechu), sissu (Dalbergia Sissoo), and gunserai (Cinnamomum glanduliferum). Nahor does not grow in the western end of the Assam Valley, though common in the evergreen forests of the G\u0101ro and Kh\u0101si Hills; and sissu is not found east of the Man\u0101s river.\n\nThe Go\u0101lp\u0101ra forests were formerly overworked, under a wasteful system of levying royalty on the number of axes employed; and when they came under regular management the stock of exploitable timber was found to be nearly exhausted, though there was still a large supply of young trees. A regular working-plan has now been introduced. Permits are issued to private persons to fell trees, and a certain quantity of timber is extracted by departmental agency. The forests are situated in the north of the District, and some difficulty is experienced in bringing the logs to market, as the rivers are suitable\nfor transport only at certain seasons of the year. This difficulty has, to some extent, been overcome by the purchase of a portable tramway 6 miles in length. There is also a considerable trade in timber from the permanently settled estates of the District, which lie along both sides of the Brahmaputra, and are thus more favourably situated for purposes of export. The s\u0101l forests of the G\u0101ro Hills are valuable, but inaccessible, and it has hitherto been found impossible to work them at a profit on a commercial scale; but there is a considerable trade in canoes hollowed out from large trees which are floated down the Someswari river into Bengal.\n\nIn other Districts the only trees of importance as articles of export are s\u0101l, sam, and ajhar, which are floated down the Brahmaputra into Bengal, and from C\u0101ch\u0101r into Sylhet, and are chiefly used for boat-building. The exploitation of the C\u0101ch\u0101r forests for the service of Sylhet has always been active, and is extending, while that of the forests in Go\u0101lp\u0101ra and K\u0101mr\u016bp does not show any marked advance. The upper part of the Assam Valley is remote from any market, and its Reserves are hardly touched. Such trade as exists is chiefly in large trees, which are hollowed out and converted into canoes, but of recent years the Assam-Bengal Railway Company have obtained their sleepers from the N\u0101mbar Reserve. Simul (Bombax malabaricum) and other kinds of soft wood are largely used in both valleys for the manufacture of tea boxes.\n\nIn the Assam Valley trees extracted for sale are felled under a permit specifying their number and name. In C\u0101ch\u0101r and Sylhet permits are issued without specifying the quantity or nature of the timber, and royalty is paid at check stations on the river. The trees selected are usually felled early in the year, and the trunk is cut into logs from 6 to 7 feet in length, which are carefully dressed with the axe. They are then rolled along to river banks, where they remain till floating is possible, which is usually near the close of the rains, when no danger from flood is anticipated. Where large logs are extracted, elephants are employed to drag them to stacking stations. The heavier kinds of timber, such as s\u0101l and nahor, are brought down attached to the sides of canoes. All persons holding land direct from Government are permitted to remove from Unclassed state forests, without payment, inferior kinds of timber, bamboos, and other forest produce sufficient for their own requirements. The ordinary royalty is levied on forest produce removed for sale. Free grazing is also allowed in Unclassed state forests to all cattle that are not kept for dairy or breeding purposes or for sale. The area of Government waste is so extensive that the villagers have no difficulty in satisfying all their wants, and few causes of friction arise. An officer of the Forest department is stationed in nearly every District, who acts as the Deputy-Commissioner's assistant.\nin forest matters. The management of Unclassed state forests in the Assam Valley is in the immediate charge of the subordinate revenue officers, who issue permits for the removal of forest produce. In the Surm\u0101 Valley it is entrusted to the subordinate officers of the Forest department. Attempts to protect the forest from fire are restricted to 'reserved' areas and, generally speaking, to forests of s\u0101l and other deciduous trees. In 1903-4 special measures were taken with regard to 996.5 square miles, all but 5.3 square miles of which were successfully protected at a cost of Rs. 7,737. In addition, 196 square miles were partially protected; no fires occurred in this area during the year.\n\nThe most important minor products are bamboos, canes, reeds, thatching-grass, lac, and rubber. The rubber tree (Ficus elastica) is indigenous in Darrang, Nowgong, and Lakhimpur Districts, but it has been, to a great extent, killed out by excessive and improper tapping. Duty is levied on rubber collected in Government forests, as well as on that brought into Assam from beyond the frontier. The total amount realized on account of rubber in 1901 was Rs. 93,000. Artificial plantations of Ficus elastica have been started at Kulsi in K\u0101mr\u016bp and at Chardu\u0101r in the north of Darrang. Opinions still differ as to the comparative advantages of dense and sparse planting; but in the Kulsi plantation, where there are as many as twenty-seven trees to the acre, the average yield per tree exceeds one pound of rubber.\n\nLac is not only collected from the forests, but a considerable quantity is cultivated by artificial propagation. The chief seat of the industry is in K\u0101mr\u016bp, the Kh\u0101si and Jainti\u0101, and the G\u0101ro Hills. The lac insect is reared on several species of the Ficus family, and the bulk of the produce is exported in the form of stick lac: that is, the small twigs surrounded by deposits of translucent orange yellow gum in which the insect is embedded. Occasionally the gummy matter is scraped from the twigs and separated from the dead bodies of the insects, which are strained off and sold as red dye. The gum is then melted, cleaned, and sold as shellac or button lac.\n\nThe financial results of the Forest department during the past twenty-three years are shown below:\n\n| Year       | Revenue   | Expenditure | Surplus |\n|------------|-----------|-------------|---------|\n| Average for 1881-90 | 2,334,87 | 1,994,88 | 33,999 |\n| ,, , 1891-1900 | 4,276,10 | 2,905,57 | 1,310,53 |\n| 1900-1     | 5,634,00 | 3,429,63 | 2,204,37 |\n| 1903-4     | 6,769,44 | 4,518,87 | 2,250,57 |\n\nThe only minerals in Assam worked on a commercial scale are coal, limestone, and petroleum oil. The most extensive coal measures are those to the south of Lakhimpur and Sibs\u0101gar Districts, which stretch\nfor a distance of about 110 miles along the north-west face of the N\u0101g\u0101 Hills. There are five separate fields, which, running from east to west, are named the M\u0101kum, Jaipur, N\u0101zir\u0101, Jh\u0101nzi, and Disai. The M\u0101kum fields were leased to the Assam Railways and Trading Company in 1881, and a railway was constructed from the Brahmaputra at Dibrugarh to the coal measures on the Dihing. These measures consist of beds of alternating shales, coal, and sandstones. There are altogether five mines worked by the company, which in 1903 employed 1,238 men under the supervision of 9 Europeans. No labour is obtainable locally, and the labour force has to be imported from other parts of India. The ordinary rate of wages is Rs. 7 a month for a man and Rs. 6 for a woman. Work is carried on in galleries run into the side of the cliff, the system employed being that known as the \u2018square or panel.\u2019 The bulk of the coal is taken by the India General and Rivers Steam Navigation Companies for use on their steamers, and a small quantity is sold locally to tea gardens; very little goes to Calcutta. The coal is fairly hard and compact, but after extraction and exposure to the air it breaks up into small pieces. The capital invested in these collieries in 1903 was \u00a3357,000. The total output in that year was 239,000 tons, as compared with 147,000 tons in 1891. Small quantities of coal have been extracted from the fields to the south of Sibs\u0101gar District by the Assam and Singlo Companies for use in their own factories, but not for sale. Coal has also been found in the G\u0101ro and the Kh\u0101si and Jainti\u0101 Hills. The deposits in the G\u0101ro Hills are of Cretaceous origin. The principal fields are at Umblay, Rongrengiri, and Darangiri; and for the last-mentioned field a syndicate has taken out a prospecting licence. Cretaceous coal has been found in the Kh\u0101si Hills near Maoflang, about 20 miles south of Shillong, and at L\u0101ngrin, on the J\u0101duk\u0101ta river. The Maoflang field is worked in a primitive way by the villagers for the supply of the Shillong station. Deposits of Tertiary coal have been found in the Nummulitic limestone of the Southern Kh\u0101si Hills at Cherrapunji, L\u0101k\u0101dong, Thanjinath, Lynkerdem, Maolong, and Mustoh. The Maolong field, which is estimated to contain 15,000,000 tons of coal, has lately been taken on lease by a company. Coal-beds have recently been discovered in the vicinity of the Shillong-Gauh\u0101ti road about 11 miles north of Shillong; and there are deposits at Langlei and on the N\u0101mbar river in the Mik\u012br Hills, but the coal is of poor quality and would hardly pay to work.\n\nNext in importance to coal are the vast stores of limestone which exist on the southern face of the Kh\u0101si and Jainti\u0101 Hills. It is found from the exit of the Someswari river in the G\u0101ro Hills to that of the H\u0101ri river in Jainti\u0101, but can be commercially worked only where special facilities exist for its transport from the quarries to the kiln.\nThere are altogether thirty-four tracts which are treated as quarries in the Kh\u0101si and Jainti\u0101 Hills, one in Sylhet, and one in the G\u0101r\u014d Hills. The most important are those situated on the J\u0101d\u016bk\u0101ta and Pan\u0101t\u012brtha rivers, which debouch near Laur in Sylhet, the Dw\u0101r\u0101 quarries to the east of these, the Shell\u0101 quarries on the Bog\u0101p\u0101ni, the quarries which lie immediately under Cherrapunji, and the Utma quarries a little to the east on an affluent of the Piyain. The earthquake of 1897 added considerably to the difficulties that had been previously experienced in transporting the stone to a part of the Surm\u0101 river navigable by steamers, and in 1903 only eight quarries were working. The principals are private individuals, the actual quarrymen Kh\u0101s\u012bs and other local labourers, and no information is available with regard to either the capital invested or the rate of wages paid. The total output in 1903 was 88,675 tons. Limestone is also found in the Mishmi and Mik\u012br Hills, and in the bed of the Doigrung, a tributary of the Dhansiri, a few miles south of Gol\u0101gh\u0101t.\n\nPetroleum is worked only on the M\u0101kum fields in Lakhimpur. As early as 1868 a considerable amount of oil was extracted, but no attempt was made to convert the raw product till a small experimental refinery was erected in 1893. In April, 1899, the Assam Oil Company was formed with a capital of \u00a3310,000, and a large refinery was erected at Digboi, which in 1903 gave employment to 10 Europeans and 509 natives. In all, 42 wells have been sunk, of which 22 have been abandoned. They vary in depth from 600 to 1,833 feet. The most productive well is said to yield about 50,000 gallons a month. The oil is a crude petroleum, rich in paraffin; and the chief products are light naphthas, kerosene, and wax. The total output in 1903 was 63 tons of candles, 573 tons of paraffin wax, 1,200,000 gallons of kerosene oil, and 89,000 gallons of other oil. The oil finds a ready sale locally, but most of the wax goes to England. Petroleum has also been found in C\u0101ch\u0101r District at M\u0101simpur and Badarpur on the bank of the Bar\u0101k, and near the Laranga a little to the north of K\u0101lain. At Kh\u0101sim\u0101ra, on the southern slopes of the Kh\u0101si Hills, springs yield oil which recent analysis has shown to be singularly free from wax and of high lubricating power.\n\nIron is still worked, but to a very small extent, in the Kh\u0101si Hills. It is derived from the minute crystals of titaniferous iron ore, which are found in the decomposed granite on the surface of the central dike of that rock, near the highest portion of the plateau. The iron is of excellent quality, and the industry was formerly one of considerable importance, the metal being exported to the Surm\u0101 and Brahmaputra Valleys. Large quantities of iron ore used to be extracted from the coal measures in Upper Assam under native rule, and iron abounds in the Mik\u012br Hills. In the time of the Ahom R\u0101j\u0101s, gold was regularly\nwashed from many of the rivers in the Assam Valley, but the industry died out with the disappearance of the native system of compulsory labour. In 1894 a syndicate was formed and a considerable sum of money expended on the exploration of the rivers of Lakhimpur District, but gold was not found anywhere in paying quantities, and no return was obtained on the capital embarked in the venture. Salt springs are found in the Upper Assam coal area, and in Cachar and Manipur.\n\nPlatinum has been found in the sands of the Dihing river, and lead and silver in the Khamti Hills. Corundum occurs in the Kh\u0101si Hills, and kaolin in the G\u0101ro and Jainti\u0101 Hills, and also near the Brahmakund at the eastern end of the Assam Valley.\n\nApart from tea, of which an account has been already given in the section dealing with Agriculture, the Province contains few manufactures of importance. In the Assam Valley and the hills the economic organization of society is of a very simple character. There is no indigenous class of artisans, no specialization of function, and handicrafts which in other parts of India are confined to special castes are practised as household industries. The Surm\u0101 Valley has passed beyond the stage in which the wants of the household are all supplied by the different members of the family; but artisans are scarce, and manufactured products are, as a rule, imported from beyond the frontier. Such as they are, the industries of most importance are the burning of limestone, the weaving of cotton and silk cloth, the preparation of molasses and mustard oil, the making of boats, canoes, and tea boxes, the refining of crude petroleum, and the manufacture of metal and earthen vessels, of rough iron implements, and of native jewellery.\n\nThe weaving of cotton cloth is still largely practised by the natives of Assam proper. The work is carried on entirely by women, and in almost every house is to be found a loom, on which most of the clothes worn by the members of the family are prepared; but these articles are chiefly intended for home use, and only an insignificant quantity is produced for sale. Weaving forms one of the most essential parts of a girl's education, and skill in this art does much to enhance the value of a bride. Among the well-to-do, home-made cotton cloths are being displaced by imported goods, and the ladies of the family confine themselves to the production of fine cloths, embroidered and enriched with borders of silk or gold and silver thread. In the Surm\u0101 Valley weaving was never a home industry, and was confined to the professional weaving castes; but most of these have now abandoned their traditional occupation for agriculture, and the great mass of the population are clothed in imported fabrics. The hillman's clothing, on the other hand, is usually home made, and the cloths, though rough,\nare generally dyed a rich blue or red, the necessary ingredients being readily obtained from the surrounding jungle.\n\nA more characteristic industry of the Assam Valley is the rearing of silkworms and the manufacture of cloth from their thread. There are four varieties of domesticated worm. The smaller or multivoltine p\u0101t worm (*Bombyx croesi*) and the larger or univoltine worm of the same name (*Bombyx textor*) are both fed on the mulberry, and produce a fine white thread. The m\u016bg\u0101 worm (*Antheroea assamoea*) is usually reared on the sum tree (*Machilus odoratissima*), and yields a yellowish buff silk with a rich gloss; but if fed on the chapa (*Magnolia Griffithii*) and the mezankuri (*Tetrantha polyantha*), it spins a very white cocoon. The eri worm (*Attacus ricini*) is so called from its attachment to the castor-oil plant (*Ricinus communis*), though it also feeds on various other trees. The matrix of eri silk is extremely gummy, and the thread has to be spun from the cocoon. The white cloth made of p\u0101t silk is an article of luxury, and is not easily procured; but m\u016bg\u0101 silk is largely used by the women of all classes of society in Upper and Central Assam, and as a holiday dress by men. It is also exported to the Hill Districts, where it is much appreciated by the Kh\u0101sis, G\u0101ros, and other tribes. Eri cloth is of a drab colour, and, though often coarse in texture, is very durable. It is light but warm, and the ordinary cold-season wrap of the Assamese villager is generally made of this silk. The manufacture of both m\u016bg\u0101 and eri cloth is purely domestic. There are no large filatures, nor any system of breeding the worms on an extensive scale, and all attempts made so far to practise sericulture as a commercial business have ended in failure. The villager rears silkworms enough to yield him a few ounces of thread, which he either gets his women folk to weave or sells at the village fair.\n\nIn Upper Assam there is not much trade in silk, but in the western Districts the animistic tribe often obtain the cash required for their land revenue by selling eri cloth to the Bhoti\u0101s and other tribes inhabiting the lower ranges of the Him\u0101layas, or to M\u0101rw\u0101ri merchants for export to Calcutta. Proposals have recently been made for the development of the silk industry among the Kh\u0101sis and in Manipur.\n\nThe jewellery made in the Province does not, as a rule, possess much merit; but really artistic necklaces of gold filigree work are produced at Barpet\u0101, and the enamelled lockets and ear ornaments of Jorh\u0101t are not unpleasing. The enamel, which is usually a rich green or blue, is laid on between thin gold wire on a basis of lac, and is set with cheap garnets and false rubies. The Kh\u0101sis wear bracelets, necklaces, and coronets of silver and gold. They are handsome articles, but somewhat heavy in design. The industry is not of any\n\n---\n\n1 For further details see *Monograph on the Cotton Fabrics of Assam* (Calcutta, 1897).\ngreat importance, and is followed by only a few persons, most of whom have some other means of livelihood.\n\nOther manufactures include brass and bell-metal utensils, iron-work, and rough pottery. The articles produced possess no artistic merit, and the local supply has to be supplemented by importation from Bengal. Bell-metal utensils are cast in moulds. Brass vessels are hammered out of thin sheets of that metal. The industry in the Assam Valley is largely in the hands of the Mori\u0101s, a class of degraded Muhammadans, who are said to be the descendants of prisoners captured by the Ahoms when Turbak was defeated in A.D. 1532. Under native rule the smelting of iron ore was a considerable industry. The chronicles of the Muhammadan invasions frequently refer to the large numbers of cannon possessed by the enemy, and these guns, some of them of great weight and size, are found scattered over the Assam Valley at the present day. Buchanan Hamilton, writing at the beginning of the last century, makes mention of a valuable iron-mine south of Jorh\u0101t, and the remains of iron workings are to be seen all over the Kh\u0101si Hills. Iron working, however, like other industries, has died out since the pressure of necessity has been removed, though the Kh\u0101sis still smelt small quantities of ore, which they convert into bill-hooks and other implements of agriculture. Other blacksmiths are usually foreigners, who work with imported metal, which they forge into bill-hooks, sickles, and ploughshares, but the industry has few followers and is of little importance. Pottery, which is of the simplest kind, is either made by Kumh\u0101rs on the wheel, or by Hiras, who beat out the clay to a thin sheet, and lay one strip upon another till the vessel is complete.\n\nThe most important manufacture of Sylhet, after tea, is lime, which is burnt on the banks of the Surm\u0101 river. Other specialities of the District are mats made of bamboo and reeds, boxes and furniture made of reeds, leaf umbrellas, bracelets of shell and lac, agar or attar, a perfume distilled from the resinous sap of the agar tree, children's toys, fish oil, dried fish, and boats. Ironwork inlaid with brass, lac inlaid with feathers and talc, and ivory fans and chessmen used formerly to be manufactured; but these arts are now in a very languishing condition.\n\nOf recent years there has been some extension of the mustard-oil and sugar industries in the Province. At Gauh\u0101ti two mills, worked by steam, are capable of turning out over 3 tons of oil a day; but oilmen are generally foreigners, who use the ordinary bullock-mill of Upper India. Sugar-cane is still, as a rule, crushed between two wooden rollers, in spite of the superior advantages of the Bihiy\u0101 mill, and the juice is converted into raw molasses. Boat-building is carried on in Sylhet, and more than a hundred years ago the Collector of\nthat District built a ship of 400 tons burthen, drawing 17 feet when fully loaded. In the Assam Valley canoes are manufactured out of trees, which are hollowed out till only an outer skin about one inch and a quarter in thickness remains. If a large boat is required, the shell is plastered over with mud and steamed over a fire, and the sides are then distended by the insertion of thwarts.\n\nThe arts of carving in ivory and wood are almost extinct. Wood-carvers are generally carpenters by profession, and even their best work is usually very rough; carved ivory can only be obtained, on order, at Jorh\u0101t, Barpet\u0101, and Sylhet.\n\nApart from tea and petroleum, to which reference has been already made, the only industries in which European capital is embarked are saw-mills and the brick and pottery works at Ledo in Lakhimpur District. There were altogether eleven saw-mills in 1903, giving employment to 1,205 persons. The bulk of the output consists of tea boxes, which are generally made from the wood of the simul tree (Bombax malabaricum). In spite of the large local demand for this commodity, the industry is in a somewhat stagnant condition, as foreign-made boxes are much in favour with the agents in Calcutta. In 1903 the number of persons employed in the pottery works was 149.\n\nThe first mention of the trade of Sylhet is to be found in the memoirs of Mr. Lindsay, who was appointed Collector of that District in 1778. The principal exports at that time were lime, elephants, iron, silk, coarse muslins, ivory, honey, gums, drugs, and oranges. For the Assam Valley records are fuller, thanks to the Muhammadan invaders. In the seventeenth century the Ahom rulers seem to have adopted a policy of isolation, and forbade people either to enter or leave their territories; and trade was carried on by a caravan, which proceeded once a year to Gauh\u0101ti with gold, musk, agar, pepper, and silk, and exchanged these products for salt, saltpetre, sulphur, and other articles. At the end of the eighteenth century the trade of the valley was in the hands of two men, who farmed the customs and established a monopoly at Hadira, on the north bank of the Brahmaputra, nearly opposite Go\u0101lp\u0101ra. On the British side there was a colony of European merchants, who had forcibly seized the monopoly of the trade from Bengal; and unsatisfactory though these arrangements were, the volume of business declined, on the occupation of the Province, owing to the abolition of the monopoly and the bad faith of the individual Assamese merchants. The imports, which consisted almost entirely of salt, were valued at $2\\frac{1}{4}$ lakhs of rupees; the exports at $4\\frac{1}{2}$ lakhs, three-fourths of which represented the price of lac, and the greater part of the remainder that of silk, mustard seed, and cotton.\n\nAt the present day, the trade of Assam is carried on in two different directions: first and chiefly with the neighbouring Province of Bengal;\nand secondly with the tribes on the northern and eastern frontier. The economic organization of the Province is still very undeveloped; and, apart from tea, the bulk of the exports consists of raw products. The imports include manufactured goods; but as Assam does not produce enough grain to feed its large foreign population, there is also a large admixture of food-stuffs. The principal imports are cotton piece-goods and twist, husked rice, salt, sugar, kerosene, mustard and other oils, gram and pulse, tobacco, and metals. The chief exports are tea, unhusked rice, oilseeds, coal and lime, timber, jute, raw cotton, lac, hides, oranges, and rubber. The backward condition of the Province is illustrated by the fact that it exports unhusked rice and oilseeds and imports husked rice and mustard oil. Nearly all the rice exported goes from the Surm\u0101 Valley, which in normal years produces more than is required for local consumption. The imported rice goes to Upper Assam, where the proportion of garden coolies is very large.\n\nThe most important permanent centres of trade are Go\u0101lp\u0101ra, Barpet\u0101, Gauh\u0101ti, Tezpur, Nowgong, Golaghat, Jorh\u0101t, Dibrugarh, and Sadiy\u0101, in the Assam Valley; and Habiganj, Ajmiriganj, Sun\u0101mganj, Chh\u0101tak, B\u0101l\u0101ganj, Sylhet, and Silchar in the valley of the Surm\u0101.\n\nNone of these places is, however, of great importance, as the tea industry has a very decentralizing effect upon the internal commerce of Assam. All over the Province weekly markets are held on stated days, where buyers and sellers meet, and most of the business is done. The classes who conduct the trade differ in the two valleys. In both, tea, the great export of Assam, is consigned straight from the gardens where it is produced to Calcutta, either to be sold there or shipped to England for sale, though a small but increasing proportion of the crop is now exported from Chittagong, whither it is conveyed by the Assam-Bengal Railway. A considerable share of the export trade in mustard from the Assam Valley is in the hands of a class of traders who are natives of K\u0101mr\u016bp District; but almost all the rest of the export traffic, and nearly the whole of the import traffic of the valley, is carried on by M\u0101rw\u0101ri traders from R\u0101jput\u0101na, who are usually known as Kayahs. There are in addition a few Bengali Muhammadans in the larger towns, who sell furniture, haberdashery, and oilman's stores; but the Kayahs monopolize the banking and wholesale business of the valley, and their shops are to be found not only in the business centres, but on every tea garden and on the paths by which the hillmen bring down their cotton, rubber, lac, and other products. The Assamese have no commercial aptitude, and have thus allowed the whole of the profits of the trade of their country to pass into the hands of foreigners. In the Surm\u0101 Valley the conditions are somewhat different. The native population contains a large trading element, and merchants from Dacca are more numerous\nthan in Assam proper. A fair number of Marw\u0101ris are found, but in no sense do they dominate the trade of the valley.\n\nExcept among the Kh\u0101sis and a few of the N\u0101g\u0101 tribes, the number of hillmen who are entirely dependent upon trade for their support is small. Most tribes, however, grow articles like cotton, chillies, and lac for export, and bring them to the markets at the foot of the hills, where they exchange them for rice, salt, dried fish, cloth, and petty oilman's stores. This trade is largely carried on by barter. The tricks of the petty shopkeeper are not unknown; the cotton is often watered to increase its weight, and stones are embedded in the rubber. The Kh\u0101sis and Ang\u0101m\u012b N\u0101g\u0101s are keen and energetic traders, and sometimes go as far afield as Calcutta in search of goods. Manipur exports rice, timber, and bamboos, and till recently also tea-seed and cattle. Timber and other forest produce are floated down the rivers into C\u0101ch\u0101r, but grain and other goods go by cart-road to Dim\u0101pur, a station on the Assam-Bengal Railway.\n\nAlmost the whole of the trade of Assam with other parts of India is carried on with Bengal, principally with Calcutta, that with other Provinces being less than one per cent. of the whole. The principal exports and imports have already been mentioned above, and statistics showing their value will be found in Table VI, appended to this article. The great bulk of the goods is still carried by river, though in the Surm\u0101 Valley the traffic of the Assam-Bengal Railway is increasing year by year. River-borne trade from the Assam Valley goes chiefly by steamer; but in the Surm\u0101 Valley, and especially in Sylhet, country boats are largely employed. There is very little road traffic between Assam and Bengal, and the only commodities brought into the Province by road are cattle, ponies, sheep, and other live-stock.\n\nForeign trade is carried on with Bhut\u0101n, Towang, and the tribes inhabiting the Lower Him\u0101layan hills and the eastern end of the Assam Range. The Bhoti\u0101s of Bhut\u0101n and Towang bring down their goods on sturdy little ponies to fairs held at Darrang\u0101 and Subankh\u0101t\u0101 in the north of K\u0101mr\u016bp, and at Udalguri and Gh\u0101gr\u0101p\u0101ra in Darrang. The trade is largely carried on by barter, and the statistics which are collected by the local police and revenue officials must be received with caution. The tribes to the east export little but rubber, which is carried down by coolies, the chief markets being Tezpur, North Lakhimpur, and Sadiy\u0101. Elsewhere the principal imports are rubber, wax, and ponies; the exports, cotton cloth and yarn, and silk. The total foreign trade is, however, worth only about 4 lakhs of rupees per annum.\n\nThe principal railway of Assam is the Assam-Bengal Railway, which runs from the port of Chittagong to Silchar at the eastern end of the Surm\u0101 Valley. A second branch of the same line runs along the\nsouth of the Assam Valley from Gauh\u0101ti to Tinsukia, a station on the Dibru-Sadiy\u0101 Railway, and is connected with the Surm\u0101 Valley branch by a line that pierces the North C\u0101ch\u0101r Hills, the points of junction being Lumding in the northern and Badarpur in the southern valley. Work was begun on this railway in 1891, and five years later a length of about 115 miles from Ch\u0101ndur\u0101 to Badarpur was opened to traffic; but the hill section presented difficulties of an exceptional character, and was not finally completed till the end of 1903. This section runs for the most part through shale of the worst description, often intermixed with bands of kaolinite, which swells when exposed and causes heavy slips, or exerts immense pressure on the sides of tunnels. To counteract this pressure, very heavy masonry was required, cuttings had to be arched in, and special measures taken to allow the drainage to escape. Though the hill section is only 113 miles in length, it contains 24 tunnels, 7 covered ways, and 74 major bridges, the longest being 650 feet, and the highest 113 feet above the river-bed; while many of the banks and cuttings approach 100 feet in height and depth respectively. Apart from the special engineering difficulties, great inconvenience was experienced owing to the absence of local labour and food-supplies, and to the unhealthiness of the country traversed. At one time, in addition to the railway material, food for more than 25,000 men had to be carried into the hills on elephants, bullocks, ponies, and other pack animals. The result is that the cost of construction of the hill section has been extremely heavy. The principal engineering difficulties in the plains were the bridge, 500 yards in length, which crosses the Kapili and the marshes which fringe its banks; and the bridge over the Bar\u0101k at Badarpur, which, though shorter, was even more costly, as its foundations had to be carried 80 feet below the river-bed. The line, which is on the metre gauge, has a total length within the Province of 571 miles, and has been constructed by a company working under a Government guarantee. The greater part of the capital has, however, been found by Government.\n\nA small line of great commercial importance is that running from the steamer port at Dibrugarh to M\u0101rgherit\u0101, with a branch to T\u0101l\u0101p. The total length is only 78 miles; but it taps a large number of flourishing tea gardens, and affords an outlet for the coal and oil of M\u0101kum to the Brahmaputra. It was constructed on the metre-gauge system by a private company, assisted with a Government guarantee, and was opened in 1885. The same year saw the completion of a small state railway in Sibs\u0101gar District, running from Kakil\u0101mukh on the Brahmaputra to Mari\u0101ni and Tit\u0101bar, which was originally built for the convenience of the numerous tea gardens in the neighbourhood, as the unmetalled road to the river became almost impassable to wheeled traffic in the rains.\nThe total length is 30 miles, and the gauge 2 feet. Similar considerations led to the construction of a light railway, on the 2 feet 6 inches gauge, from Tezpur gh\u0101\u1e6d in Darrang District to Balip\u0101ra, a distance of 20 miles. The line was built in 1895 by a private company, but receives a small subsidy from the District board. The only other open line in the Province is the branch of the Eastern Bengal State Railway, which connects Dhubri with the Bengal system, and was opened for traffic in 1902. Fifteen miles of this line, which is on the metre gauge, lie within the boundaries of Assam.\n\nSufficient time has not yet elapsed for the effects produced by the completion of the Assam-Bengal Railway to be fully seen. Silchar, which was formerly extremely inaccessible in the dry season, has been brought within thirty-three hours of Calcutta; and it is hoped that population may pass by the hill section from the densely peopled plains of Sylhet to the extensive tracts of good land now lying waste in the Assam Valley. A line from Golakganj near Dhubri to Gauh\u0101\u1e6di is under construction, and there will soon be through railway communication between the eastern end of the Brahmaputra Valley and the more densely populated parts of India from which the Province draws its labour. A light railway is also under construction from Div\u0101r\u0101 Bazar on the Surm\u0101 river to the Maolong coal-field in the Kh\u0101si Hills.\n\nIn 1891 only 114 miles of railway were open in the Province; by 1903 the figure had risen to 715 miles, of which 617 miles represented state lines. The total capital which by 1903 had been expended on the minor railways, the whole of which lie within the boundaries of the Province\u2014the Dibru-Sadiy\u0101, Tezpur-B\u0101lip\u0101ra, and Jorh\u0101\u1e6d Railways\u2014was Rs. 94,69,000. In that year 567,000 passengers and 317,000 tons of goods and minerals were carried by these railways: the gross working expenses were Rs. 5,95,000, and the net revenue yielded 5 per cent. on the capital employed.\n\nThe excellence of its water communications makes Assam less dependent upon its roads than other parts of India, and it was not till 1865 that steps were taken to construct a road through the whole length of the Brahmaputra Valley. This road runs along the south bank of the river from Sadiy\u0101 at the eastern end to a point opposite Dhubri, where it is connected by a steam ferry with the road system of Go\u0101lp\u0101ra and Northern Bengal. At Gauh\u0101\u1e6di it is joined by an excellent metalled road running to Shillong. Shillong is connected via Cherrapunji, Therri\u0101gh\u0101\u1e6d, Companyganj, and Sylhet with C\u0101ch\u0101r, though for a distance of about 8 miles down the face of the Kh\u0101si Hills, which here rise very sharply from the plains, the track is not fit for wheeled traffic. From C\u0101ch\u0101r a bridle-path leads to Manipur, and from there a cart-road to the Brahmaputra, passing through Kohm\u0101, Dim\u0101pur (a station on the Assam-Bengal Railway), and Go\u0101gh\u0101\u1e6d. A second\nmain road runs along the north bank of the Brahmaputra, but through the greater part of its length does not carry much traffic. The principal arteries of trade are, however, the rivers, and since recently the Assam-Bengal Railway, and the most important roads are those leading to the steamer gh\u0101ts or railway stations. Numerous roads have also been made in the tea Districts, connecting the various plantations with one another and with the main lines of communication, whether water, road, or railway. Apart from the trunk roads, the most important routes are: the road from Tur\u0101 in the G\u0101ro Hills to the Brahmaputra, the road that runs north from opposite Gauh\u0101ti to Darrang\u0101 at the foot of the Bhut\u0101n Hills, the roads from Rang\u0101m\u0101tigh\u0101t to the north of the Mangaldai subdivision, the road from Sibs\u0101gar to Dis\u0101ngmukh on the Brahmaputra, and the Dhodar Ali, which runs along the south-east of Sibs\u0101gar District. In the Surm\u0101 Valley two important roads are those from Sylhet to Fenchuganj, and thence to Kulaur\u0101 railway station, and from Silchar up the Hail\u0101k\u0101ndi valley.\n\nGenerally speaking, there has not been much change during the past ten years, but the route to Manipur was first made passable for carts after the outbreak of 1891. The ordinary bullock-carts of Upper India are in common use in the Assam Valley, but here and there carts are still to be found whose wheels consist of solid disks of wood. In the Surm\u0101 Valley carts are very scarce, and heavy goods are chiefly carried by boat and to some extent by pack-bullock. A primitive form of wheelless sledge is sometimes used for the transport of agricultural produce. In 1890-1 there were 293 miles of Imperial, 2,119 of Provincial, and 3,095 of Local fund roads; and the cost of maintenance was Rs. 4,70,000. In 1903-4 the figure for Provincial roads was 1,625 miles and for Local fund roads 4,483 miles, and the cost of maintenance was Rs. 8,87,000. Inspection bungalows are provided at intervals of 10 or 12 miles along all the main roads; but they contain nothing but a few tables and chairs and bedsteads, and the occupant must provide servants, food, and cooking utensils. The cost of metalling in Assam is very heavy. This is partly due to the high rate of wages prevailing, partly to the difficulty experienced in obtaining material. In 1903-4 there were only 144 miles of metalled road, most of which lay in the hills. Avenues of trees are not planted along the roads.\n\nThe chief means of communication in Assam are still its waterways. The Brahmaputra, which is navigable by large steamers to within a few miles of Dibrugarh, carries most of the trade of the Assam Valley. During the rains tea and other produce are brought down the tributaries that flow into it on either side, though the river ports are always connected by roads with the interior. The Surm\u0101 Valley is a network of streams, and during the rainy season the western part of Sylhet District\nlies almost entirely under water. A large fleet of steamers maintained by the India General Steam Navigation Company and the Rivers Steam Navigation Company plies on the rivers of both valleys. A daily service of passenger boats runs from Goalundo to Dibrugarh. Since the construction of the Assam-Bengal Railway the timing has been accelerated, and the journey up is now performed in four and a half and that down in three and a quarter days; but in the cold season fogs are sometimes a serious obstacle to traffic. A considerable amount of cargo is carried in these vessels, but special cargo steamers with large flats also run, to carry goods the bulk of which renders them unsuitable for carriage by the smaller and more speedy passenger boats. In the Surm\u0101 Valley large steamers run to Silchar during the rainy season, but in the cold season cannot proceed beyond Fenchuganj. Small feeder steamers ply on the minor rivers in both valleys. Ordinary native boats, which, when the wind is not favourable, are generally towed upstream, are largely used in the Surm\u0101 Valley and to some extent in Lower Assam. The typical Assamese craft consists, however, of a canoe hollowed out of a large trunk of wood. Steam ferries are maintained on the Brahmaputra at Dhubri and Gauh\u0101ti. Elsewhere, the river is crossed in canoes, or rafts made by fastening two or three canoes side by side and laying planks across them, and in the rains the passage sometimes occupies more than twelve hours. Most of the minor streams on the important roads are bridged, but a large number of ferries have still to be maintained.\n\nFor postal purposes the Province has been formed into a circle under a Deputy-Postmaster-General. The following statistics show the advance in postal business since 1880-1:\n\n|                                | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|--------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Number of post offices         | 145    | 276    | 344    | 344    |\n| Number of letter-boxes         | 107    | 195    | 423    | 452    |\n| Number of miles of postal communication | 2,221  | 3,843  | 4,230  | 4,576  |\n| Total number of postal articles delivered\u2014 |        |        |        |        |\n| Letters                        | 2,115,436 | 2,991,462 | 4,979,070 | 5,044,936 |\n| Postcards                      | 249,895 | 1,284,826 | 3,006,531 | 3,437,122 |\n| Packets                        | 52,638  | 338,876  | 965,711* | 872,586  |\n| Newspapers                     | 417,742 | 755,785  | 1,049,453\u2020 | 943,254  |\n| Parcels                        | 37,256  | 74,903   | 130,400 | 173,994  |\n| Value of stamps sold to the public | Rs.     | Rs.     | Rs.     | Rs.     |\n|                                | 82,869 | 2,04,478 | 2,44,198 | 2,58,583 |\n| Value of money orders issued   | 13,46,130 | 52,11,700 | 98,76,590 | 92,98,498 |\n| Total amount of savings bank deposits | ...    | 13,99,347 | 30,74,356 | 36,28,721 |\n\n* Including unregistered newspapers. \u2020 Registered as newspapers in the Post Office.\nThe figures given above relate to both the Imperial post and the local or District post. The latter system was maintained by Local boards to provide postal communication between the head-quarters of Districts and subdivisions and revenue and police stations in the interior, in cases where the maintenance of the necessary lines of communication would not be warranted by the commercial principles of the Post Office. The expenditure from Local funds averaged Rs. 48,000 per annum during the five years ending with 1902-3. The number of District post offices on March 31, 1904, was 58, and the total length of District post mail lines 1,387 miles. In 1906 the whole of this system was transferred to the Imperial post.\n\nThe administration of the Province is entrusted to a Chief Commissioner, acting immediately under the orders of the Government of India. His general executive staff consists of (1) the Administration. Assam Commission, which has a sanctioned strength of 41, and is composed of members of the Covenanted Civil Service, with a certain proportion of officers deputed from the Indian Army; (2) the Provincial Service, which has a sanctioned strength of 36, and is a body of subordinate magistrates recruited in India, most of whom are natives of that country; (3) the Subordinate Civil Service, which has a sanctioned strength of 52, and consists of native officers, most of whom are employed in the land revenue department.\n\nAs in other parts of India, the unit of administration is the District, the area in charge of a District Magistrate, or Deputy-Commissioner as he is here called, who is responsible for the collection of the revenue, the administration of justice, the preservation of order, and the harmonious working of all the departments of Government within its boundaries. There are altogether twelve Districts in the Province, with an average area of 4,435 square miles and an average population of 486,823. The six Districts in the Assam Valley have been formed into a Division under the general control of a Commissioner, but elsewhere the Chief Commissioner performs the functions of Commissioner of Division. The District is again divided into subdivisions, of which there are twenty-seven, including two Districts which have none, the average area of each subdivision being 1,971 square miles, and the average population 216,366. The District Magistrate, who is allowed one or more Assistants, holds direct charge of the head-quarters subdivision, and each outlying subdivision is entrusted to a magistrate, who is usually a European, subordinate to the Deputy-Commissioner. This magistrate is, however, invested with a considerable measure of responsibility, as within his jurisdiction he exercises, subject to the control of the Deputy-Commissioner, most of the functions of that officer.\n\nFor the changes made in 1905 in this and the following section, see Eastern Bengal and Assam.\nsmallest unit of administration in the Assam Valley was originally the mauza, an area for which an officer called the m\u0101uzad\u0101r contracted to pay the revenue. Between 1883 and 1896 the majority of these mauzas were formed into tahsils, which were placed in charge of salaried officers of higher rank, and which have an average area of 211 square miles and an average population of 47,000. Economy was the principal motive of this change, but experience showed that the reduction in expenditure was not so great as had originally been anticipated. The m\u0101uzad\u0101ri system is popular with the villagers, and has the additional advantage of creating a body of men who, while accepted by the people as their leaders, are bound to Government by the facts of their position. It has accordingly been decided to abolish gradually the existing tahsils, and again entrust the duty of collection to the m\u0101uzad\u0101r. In the temporarily settled tracts the tahsild\u0101r or m\u0101uzad\u0101r represents the Government in its most direct and visible form to the mass of the people. Elsewhere in the plains the police are brought most closely into contact with the villagers in rural areas.\n\nIn the two valleys the houses of the cultivators are scattered over a wide area, and the village organization was never very strong. Some authority was, however, exercised by the rural council (mel or panchayat), and, though not recognized by our courts, its decisions are often accepted as binding by the parties concerned. In the hills the authority of the village headmen is greater; they are held responsible for the preservation of law and order, and are empowered to dispose of petty criminal and civil cases. The persons entrusted with the duty of collecting the house-tax, which takes the place of land revenue in the hills, are called laskars in the G\u0101ro Hills, dollois and sard\u0101rs in the Kh\u0101si and Jainti\u0101 Hills, and lambard\u0101rs among the N\u0101g\u0101s.\n\nThe Chief Commissioner is further assisted in the administration of the Province by selected officers, who are responsible to him for the various departments committed to their charge. The appointments of Inspector-General of Police, Prisons, and Registration, and Superintendent of Stamps are held by a member of the Assam Commission of the standing of a Deputy-Commissioner. Till recently he was also Commissioner of Excise; but the charge of this department has now been transferred to the Commissioner in the Assam Valley, and to the Chief Commissioner in the Surm\u0101 Valley and hill Districts. Another officer of the standing of a Deputy-Commissioner is in charge of the department of Land Records and Agriculture. Public Works are entrusted to a Superintending Engineer, who also acts as Secretary to the Chief Commissioner in that department, and has under him a staff of Executive and Assistant Engineers and native subordinates. The Educational department is managed by a Director of Public Instruction, who is assisted by 2 Inspectors, 19 Deputy, and 15 Sub-Inspectors of\nSchools. The Medical department consists of a Sanitary Commissioner, who is also the Principal Medical Officer of the Assam garrison, 9 Civil Surgeons belonging to the Indian Medical Service, and a certain number of Military or Civil Assistant Surgeons. The Forest department is under the control of a Conservator, assisted by a suitable staff. The civil accounts of the Province are in charge of a Comptroller, who is directly subordinate to the Financial Department of the Government of India. The Post Office is administered by a Deputy-Postmaster-General, and the Telegraph department by a Superintendent. These two officers are not, however, under the orders of the Chief Commissioner.\n\nThe only Native State of any importance under the control of the Assam Administration is Manipur. After the outbreak of 1891, a young boy, who was a member of a collateral line, was placed upon the throne; and during his minority the administration has been conducted by a member of the Assam Commission, who acts as Political Agent and Superintendent of the State. Advantage has been taken of this opportunity to introduce various reforms, and the system of administration has been in some ways assimilated to that prevailing in British territory. The native courts have, however, been retained, and the arrangements for the assessment and collection of land revenue are necessarily of a simple character. The States in the Khasi Hills are of no importance, and the system of administration does not differ materially from that in force in other Hill Districts.\n\nThe ordinary method by which measures of legislation are brought into force in the Province is that common to other parts of India, by which Acts are passed after full debate in the Council of the Governor-General for making Laws and Regulations, which apply to Assam as well as to other parts of the Indian Empire. Provision has also been made for the enactment of Regulations suited to the peculiar necessities of the Province, and the Chief Commissioner is empowered to propose to the Governor-General-in-Council drafts of any such Regulations as seem to him to be required. These Regulations, after they have been approved by the executive Council of the Governor-General, and have received his personal assent, are published in the Gazette of India, and thereupon have the force of law. The Chief Commissioner has also power, with the previous assent of the Governor-General-in-Council, to extend to the Province any measures passed by other local Legislatures which appear to him to be suited to its requirements.\n\nThe most important Acts of the Governor-General-in-Council which have come into force in Assam since 1880 are the following:\u2014the Vaccination Act, XIII of 1880; the Labour Immigration Act, I of 1882, which was superseded by Act VI of 1901; and the Civil Courts\nAct, XII of 1887. The Regulations proposed by the Chief Commissioner which have received the assent of the Governor-General-in-Council are:\u2014the Frontier Tracts Regulation, II of 1880; the Assam Land and Revenue Regulation, I of 1886; the Assam Military Police Regulation, IV of 1890; the Sylhet Jhum Regulation, III of 1891; and the Assam Forest Regulation, VII of 1891. The following important Acts of the Bengal Council have also been extended to Assam:\u2014the Public Demands Recovery Act, VII of 1880; the Municipal Act, III of 1884; and the Private Fisheries Act, II of 1889.\n\nStipendiary magistrates are the foundation of the system of criminal administration in the plains, for, though a few honorary magistrates have been appointed, the total amount of work done by them is inconsiderable. Appeals from their decisions lie to the Sessions Judge, except in the case of Magistrates with second and third class powers, from whom there is an appeal to the Deputy-Commissioner. In both valleys there is a Sessions Judge, from whom appeals lie to the High Court at Calcutta. Petty civil cases in the Assam Valley are heard by Assistant or Extra Assistant Commissioners, who exercise the powers of Munsifs. Above them come the District Magistrates, who act as Subordinate Judges, while the Sessions Judge is also the Civil Judge of the valley. In Cachar, the same system is in force, the powers of the District Judge of Cachar being vested in the District Judge of Sylhet. In the latter District, civil work is in charge of the District and Sessions Judge, assisted by two Subordinate Judges and a staff of Munsifs. In the Hill Districts and certain frontier tracts the High Court has no jurisdiction except in criminal matters over European British subjects, and the Chief Commissioner is himself the highest appellate authority in criminal and civil cases. The Deputy-Commissioner exercises the combined powers of District and Sessions Judge and Magistrate of a District, and the Assistant Commissioners and Extra Assistant Commissioners the powers of Magistrates and Munsifs. Judicial powers are also exercised by the local chiefs in the Khasi and Lushai Hills.\n\nTable VII, appended to this article, shows the amount of work done by the civil and criminal courts of the Province during recent years. The increase in criminal work is principally due to an increase in the number of cases under special Acts, such as the Labour Acts, XIII of 1859 and I of 1882, the Cattle Trespass Act, the Excise Act, the Municipal Act, and the Police Act. Appeals were preferred in 1903 by rather more than 36 per cent. of the persons on whom appealable sentences were passed in the criminal courts; and 74 per cent. of the appeals to the Sessions Court and 59 per cent. of those to District Magistrates were unsuccessful.\n\nThere has been little increase in civil business, except under the head of title and other suits, and rent suits in Sylhet. The great majority of\nsuits are for small sums, and in 1903 the value of about 84 per cent. of the total number instituted did not exceed Rs. 100. It is seldom, moreover, that the claim is disputed, and 79 per cent. of the cases were either withdrawn or compromised, or decided *ex parte*. Appeals were preferred in 1903 against 33 per cent. of the appealable decrees passed by Subordinate Judges and 28 per cent. of those passed by Munsifs, but in only 15 per cent. of the cases heard was the order of the lower court reversed. The readiness of the people to assert their rights can be judged from the fact that 21 per cent. of the appeals to the High Court at Calcutta were for amounts valued at less than Rs. 50.\n\nThe Inspector-General of Police and Prisons is also Inspector-General of Registration, and he holds besides the offices of Registrar of Joint Stock Companies under the Companies Act, and of Registrar-General of Births, Deaths, and Marriages under Act VI of 1886. All Deputy-Commissioners are registrars in their respective Districts. In the Brahmaputra Valley the sub-registrars are magistrates subordinate to the Deputy-Commissioner, who do this work in addition to their own duties. In the Surm\u0101 Valley there are special sub-registrars at the head-quarters of all subdivisions and rural sub-registrars at various centres. The Registration Act is not in force in the hills. The number of documents registered in 1881\u201390 (average) was 19,700; in 1891\u20131900 (average), 36,500; and in 1903, 55,400. The number of offices open in the last year was 29. Between 1881 and 1890 the average number open was 21.\n\nLittle is known about the system of taxation in force in Sylhet under native rule. It is said that in A.D. 1582 the revenue was assessed at nearly 1\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) lakhs of rupees\\(^1\\); but Mr. Lindsay, who was Collector there in 1778, reported that under Mughal rule the District yielded little revenue beyond a few elephants, spices, and wood, and most of the local receipts seem to have been devoted to the up-keep of a military establishment to protect the frontier\\(^2\\). In 1776 Mr. Holland settled the District for 2\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) lakhs, which was paid in cowries at the rate of 5,120 to the rupee; but great difficulty was experienced in realizing this assessment. The rates of land revenue assessed in Cachar before it lapsed to the Company varied from 10 annas to Rs. 1\u20134\u20130 per acre; and in addition to this the cultivators were expected to provide the labour required for the R\u0101j\u0101\u2019s works, while trade was hampered by customs, monopolies, and market dues. The Ahom government was based upon a system of organized forced labour. Each free male above sixteen years of age was styled a *paik*. The *paiks* were grouped in bodies of three or four, termed *gots*, one of whom\n\n---\n\n1 Principal Heads of the History and Statistics of the Dacca Division, p. 292 (Calcutta, 1868).\n2 Lives of the Lindsays, p. 163 (1849).\nwas always supposed to be engaged on public duty, and was supported while so employed by the remaining members of his got. Over each hundred gots there was an officer called saikya, and over every ten saikyas a haz\u0101ri. The whole population was thus organized either for military or industrial enterprise, and this supply of disciplined labour enabled the R\u0101j\u0101s to construct the great public works which remain to be the wonder of an age when coolies can only be procured with great expense and difficulty. Groups of paiks were also assigned to the various industries then practised in the Province. The wants of the royal household were supplied by guilds of farmers, silk-weavers, gold-washers, oil-pressers, fishermen, and other artisans. The ministers and the Br\u0101hmans received allotments of land and of peasants to cultivate it, and all adult males were liable to compulsory military service. The people supplied the government and the chief families with everything they required free of cost; and there was thus little necessity for a money tax, though sums were collected in the shape of poll-tax and revenue for land occupied by the peasants in excess of the free grant given to them in return for their service to the state.\n\nThe system of Provincial contracts was first introduced in 1871, when Assam formed part of Bengal, and in 1878 the contract with Assam was revised, as it was found necessary to provide funds to meet growing expenditure. The Province received the whole of the revenue from excise, Provincial rates, stamps, registration, law and justice, police, education, and a few minor heads, together with 20 per cent. of the land revenue; while it undertook entire responsibility for the charges pertaining to these departments, and for charges connected with administration and Provincial public works.\n\nIn the next settlement\u2014that of 1882\u2014the receipts and charges under excise, stamps, and registration, which had formerly been entirely Provincial, were equally divided between Provincial and Imperial, and similar treatment was accorded to the Forest budget. Sixty-three per cent. of the land revenue receipts was allotted to Provincial, together with a corresponding liability for the charges. The Provincial receipts were estimated to amount to Rs. 44,77,000 per annum, and the normal expenditure to Rs. 43,68,000. A margin was thus left for the growing needs of the administration. During the currency of this contract there was a satisfactory expansion of the revenue, and the additional funds which were thus rendered available enabled the administration to increase the efficiency of nearly every department. Considerable expenditure was incurred on surveys, and on the improvement of the frontier police force. New dispensaries were opened, the construction of the Jorh\u0101t and Cherra-Companyganj State Railways was taken in hand, and a subsidy of a lakh of rupees per annum guaranteed to a company which undertook to build a line between M\u0101rgher\u012bt\u0101 and\nDibrugarh. Large sums were also spent on the improvement of existing roads, the construction of bridges, and the opening out of new lines of communication.\n\nIn 1887 the Provincial share of receipts from stamps and excise was altered from 50 per cent. to 75 per cent. and 25 per cent., respectively, an arrangement which was not to the advantage of the Province. On the other hand, Assam received the whole of the land revenue, subject to the deduction of a fixed sum for Imperial needs, and half the revenue obtained under the head of assessed taxes. Grants were, moreover, made by the Supreme Government of Rs. 1,82,500 on account of capital expenditure on the Jorhat and Cherra-Companyganj State Railways, and of Rs. 6,15,600, which represented the cost of quelling the Lushai outbreak of 1890-1. The settlement provided for an estimated expenditure of 49 lakhs per annum, and the revenues made over were calculated to bring in exactly this amount. This contract was not favourable to the Assam Administration. There was a fair expansion of revenue under land and forests, but other heads showed a want of elasticity, and in some cases the average receipts fell considerably short of the estimates. The development of the Province was thus hampered by want of funds.\n\nThe settlement that came into force in 1892-3 was a consolidated one, and not a collection of separate contracts for each Provincial head. The single contribution to Imperial revenues was fixed at Rs. 11,27,000, and the whole of the land revenue receipts were at first allowed to remain Provincial, though the Supreme Government subsequently appropriated a share of the increase derived from the resettlement of the Assam Valley. During the period of this settlement Assam enjoyed considerable financial prosperity. The revenue was elastic, and no difficulty was experienced in providing for the growing wants of the Province. A special battalion of military police was organized for the Lushai Hills, and considerable sums were spent on the construction of permanent bridges and the improvement of communications.\n\nThe chief feature of the settlement which came into force in 1897 and was extended to March 31, 1904, was the assignment of two-thirds of the land revenue to Provincial needs. The gross ordinary expenditure of the Province was estimated at Rs. 65,29,000, and the receipts at Rs. 66,43,000, the surplus being a set-off against the necessary development of expenditure in a backward Province. The earthquake of June 12, 1897, completely disorganized this settlement. The cost of the damage done was estimated at between 40 and 50 lakhs, to meet which the Supreme Government made a grant of 26 lakhs. The whole resources of the Administration were devoted to the restoration of the Province to the position in which it stood prior to the earthquake, and all thought of progress had, for the time being, to be laid aside.\nIt was, however, found possible to give effect to schemes, which had been for a long time under consideration, for the improvement of the position of the members of the Assam Commission, and of the civil police force.\n\nA new settlement was introduced on April 1, 1904, and was intended to remain in force until it became unfair either to the Government of India or to the Province. Its principal features are that Assam retains one-half of the revenue from land, stamps, excise, assessed taxes, forests, and registration, and is responsible for half the expenditure under these heads. The Province is also debited with the whole of the expenditure on general administration, courts of law, jails, police, medical, education, political superannuation charges, stationery, and printing, and various minor heads, receiving in turn such revenue as is obtained from these departments. The receipts and expenditure under the heads of civil works and railways also remain Provincial, except in those cases in which railway expenditure is specially provided from Imperial funds. An allotment of 20 lakhs was added to the balance remaining over from the former contract, and, in addition to the shares of revenue assigned, a fixed grant of 12 lakhs is annually made to the Provincial income. Further grants have since been made for the reform of the Police and Education departments. The expenditure at the commencement of the contract was estimated to amount to Rs. 72,07,000.\n\nStatistics showing the principal heads of revenue and expenditure will be found in Tables VIII and VIIIa, appended to this article.\n\nThe ordinary land tenures in Assam vary considerably in different parts of the Province; and different systems are in force in Sylhet and Go\u0101lp\u0101ra, two Districts in which a large proportion of the area is permanently settled, C\u0101ch\u0101r, Assam proper, and the Hill Districts. An account of the revenue system peculiar to C\u0101ch\u0101r, Sylhet, and Go\u0101lp\u0101ra will be found in the articles on those Districts; and the following paragraphs deal only with Assam proper and the hills, and with conditions which are more or less common to the Province as a whole.\n\nThe distinguishing features of the agricultural system of Assam proper are the large areas of unsettled waste land, and the system under which in certain tracts land is cultivated for two or three years and then resigned. These two conditions necessitate a simple system of land revenue administration; and, as a matter of fact, the ryot, provided that he pays his land revenue, is subjected to no harassing restrictions. He holds an annual or decennial lease from Government, and is free to relinquish the whole or any part of his holding, provided that notice is given to the revenue officers at the proper time. Decennial leases\n\n---\n\n1 These arrangements have been modified in consequence of the formation of a new Province. See Eastern Bengal and Assam.\nconfer a right of resettlement and a heritable and transferable title. Annual leases merely authorize the occupation of the land covered by them for a single year, though in practice the holder can always obtain resettlement if the land is not required by Government. Any unoccupied waste land may also be taken up for cultivation without notice or application, and, when so taken up, is settled with the occupant, but a prior claim to resettlement may be secured by filing an application for it. Large areas of land are annually relinquished and taken up in this way in those parts of the valley where fluctuating cultivation is practised.\n\nA strong revenue staff is maintained in each District, whose principal functions are to survey and issue leases for the land newly taken up, to test the applications filed for relinquishment, to correct the revenue roll, to record the areas under different crops, and to assist in the collection of the land revenue. The country is divided into circles, as the charge of the local accountant or mandal is called, which comprise, as a rule, about 5,000 acres. Over every 20 or 25 mandals there is an officer known as a Supervisor k\u0101nungeo, who is continually testing their operations in the field, and supervising their work when they come in to head-quarters, while above the Supervisor k\u0101nungeo comes the Sub-Deputy-Collector, who, under the existing rules, is required to be a graduate of a University, and to have a good practical knowledge of surveying. Most of the tahsils, or units for the collection of land revenue, are now in charge of officers of this class; and there are in addition one or two in each subdivision who are in general charge of settlement work, but have no concern with the land revenue collection.\n\nThe organization of the Assamese into small bodies, or gots, consisting of three or four individuals styled paiks, one of whom was always employed on the service of the State, has already been described on page 86. Each paik was allowed sufficient land for his homestead, and \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) acres of rice land free of revenue, but was required to pay 12 annas an acre for anything taken up in excess of this quantity, in addition to a poll-tax of one rupee. The revenue was farmed to chaudhuris, and the nominal rate assessed was only Rs. 2 a 'plough,' an area which, according to Buchanan Hamilton, produced about 56 cwt. of 'rough rice' and 11 cwt. of mustard-seed. Little control was, however, exercised over the revenue farmers, and their exactions raised the rate to about Rs. 7 per 'plough'; while north of the Brahmaputra the demands of the hill tribes, who, with the break up of the Ahom system of administration, established a sort of right to the levy of blackmail, deprived the villagers of the whole of the profits of cultivation.\n\nAs soon as the British took possession of the country the system of forced labour was abolished, but the poll-tax was raised to Rs. 3 per head, subsequently commuted to a land revenue assessment. The rates varied at different times and in different portions of the\nvalley, but in 1853 they ranged from Rs. 130 to 10 annas per acre of cultivated land\\(^1\\). In 1870 the rates per acre were fixed as follows: homestead, which includes the garden surrounding the house, Rs. 3; transplanted rice land, Rs. 1-14-0; and other land, Rs. 1-8-0. The next settlement was made in 1893 for a term of ten years. The three-fold classification of land was retained, but the villages were roughly divided into four classes, and the revenue assessed on each of the three kinds of land depended upon the class in which the village fell. The main consideration taken into account in fixing the class of the village was the demand for land, as shown by the density of population and the proportion of settled to total area. No distinction was drawn between the good and inferior land of the same class in a village, and the assessment never pretended to anything like scientific accuracy.\n\nThe rates assessed per acre were: homestead, Rs. 4-2-0 in first-class villages to Rs. 3 in villages of the fourth class; transplanted rice land, Rs. 3 to Rs. 1-14-0; and other land, Rs. 2-4-0 to Rs. 1-8-0. The proportion of villages placed in the lowest class was very small, and full revenue is paid on all settled land whether cultivated or not, except in the case of land held on half rates. A detailed resettlement of two Districts, on principles similar to those which are followed in other parts of India, was commenced in 1902. The village has been abandoned as the unit of assessment, and steps are being taken to distribute the revenue more closely in accordance with the value of the actual field.\n\nA considerable area of land is held either revenue-free or at half full rates. These estates represent grants made by the Ahom R\u0101j\u0101s for religious and other purposes. In 1903\u20134 the total settled area of Assam proper was 2,562,000 acres, the area of land held at half rates being 189,000 acres, and of land held revenue-free 81,000 acres.\n\nThe tea industry has played a large part in the development of Assam, and from time to time different rules have been in force to govern the grant of land for the cultivation of this plant. The earliest rules, those of 1838, applied only to Assam proper. One-fourth of the grant was to be held revenue-free in perpetuity, and a revenue-free period of from five to twenty years was allowed on the remaining three-fourths, according as the land was under grass, reeds, or timber, after which light but progressive rates were imposed. The rules of 1854, which were extended to the Surm\u0101 Valley, introduced certain modifications, but the bulk of the land taken up when they were in force was subsequently acquired in fee-simple, when the fee-simple rules were introduced in 1862. Under these rules the land was sold free of all revenue demand, the price charged varying from Rs. 2-8-0 to Rs. 10 an acre. There are now 332,000 acres of land in the Assam Valley\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) *Report on the Province of Assam*, by A. J. Moffatt Mills; Darrang, p. xiii; Lakhimpur, p. 1 (Calcutta, 1854).\nheld on this tenure. The existing rules came into force in 1876. An upset price of R. 1 an acre is charged, and for two years the land is allowed to remain revenue-free. The rates gradually rise to 8 annas an acre in the eleventh and R. 1 in the twenty-first year. The lease runs for thirty years, and when it expires the land is liable to reassessment.\n\nIn the Assam Valley the issue of leases on favourable terms has never been allowed when the land is required for the cultivation of the ordinary staples of the Province. In Cachar this restriction was not in force, and waste land was let out at progressive rates with a revenue-free term, for ordinary as well as for special cultivation. The rules varied from time to time, but the leases were granted for twenty or thirty years, with a revenue-free period of from two to three years. The maximum revenue assessed during the concluding portion of the lease varied from 12 annas to Rs. 1\u20138\u20130 an acre. These rules are no longer in force, and waste land taken up for ordinary cultivation during the currency of the settlement in Cachar is assessed at the rates levied on similar land in the neighbourhood.\n\nThe ordinary form of taxation in the Hill Districts is a tax of Rs. 2 or Rs. 3 on each house, and no attempt is usually made to measure up the area of land actually occupied.\n\nIn Upper Assam the villagers find a ready market for their produce in the numerous tea gardens situated in this portion of the valley, and here the assessment made in 1893 is paid without much difficulty. In Lower and Central Assam the tea industry is of small importance, and the people suffered severely from the earthquake of 1897 and the floods which followed it, and from the terrible mortality caused by kal\u0101-\u0101z\u0101r. The Government of India accordingly directed in 1901 that the land revenue demand in this portion of the valley should be reduced by Rs. 1,80,000. Widespread famine or scarcity is unknown, but floods sometimes cause considerable local damage, and rules for the remission of land revenue have been introduced to afford the relief which is rendered necessary by such visitations. The area of waste land in the Province is so large that no necessity has yet arisen for checking the freedom of the ryot to transfer his land. The receipts under the head of land revenue will be found in Table VIII, appended to this article.\n\nThe original system of land revenue collection in Assam was one under which an individual of some wealth and local standing, called a mauzadar, entered into a contract with Government to pay the land revenue of one or more mauzas, or fiscal divisions. The contract was formerly made for a term of years, and the mauzadar enjoyed such profits as accrued from the extension, and made good any loss due to the decrease, of cultivation; but for the last fifty years the settlement has been revised annually, and the revenue collector has been rewarded by a liberal commission, which is supposed to compensate him for bad\ndebts and other expenses. Of recent years mauzas have in many cases been grouped together to form tahsils, in which about a lakh of rupees is realized direct from the ryots by a Government officer who receives a fixed salary, and pays into the treasury only the amount he actually collects. Difficulties have, however, been experienced in dealing direct with such large bodies of cultivators, and it has been decided gradually to abolish tahsils, and to entrust the duty of collection once more to the mauzadar. The cost of collection is equivalent to about 5 per cent. of the demand in tahsils, and 7 per cent. in mauzas. If a cultivator fails to pay on the appointed date, a notice of demand is served upon him. This, as a rule, has the desired effect, but in cases of recusancy the movable property of the defaulter, and even the land itself, can be attached and sold. The amount of revenue for which such extreme measures are taken is, however, less than one per cent. of the Government demand.\n\nThe cultivation of opium is said to have been introduced into Assam in the reign of Lakshm\u012b Singh, about 1770\\(^1\\). If this was so, the practice of opium-eating must have spread with great rapidity, as from Buchanan Hamilton's memoir it appears that in 1808 the drug was freely used by the Assamese. Consumption was unduly stimulated by the ease with which opium could be obtained, the effect upon the people was far from satisfactory, and in 1860 the cultivation of the poppy was prohibited. Supplies of opium are now received from the Board of Revenue, Bengal, and issued to licensed vendors from the Government treasuries. Opium is still largely consumed in Assam proper, more particularly in the two Districts of Sibs\u0101gar and Lakhimpur, which in 1903\u20134 took considerably more than half the total amount used in the Province; but the restrictive policy of the Government has had a most marked effect upon consumption. The original duty levied in 1860 was Rs. 14 per seer; but this was raised by successive enhancements till in 1890 it was fixed at Rs. 37 a seer, at which it now stands. In addition to raising the price of the drug, which is often sold retail for as much as 10 annas a tola (about 2s. an ounce), the Government has reduced the number of shops at which it can be obtained from 5,070 in 1873\u20134 to 752 in 1903\u20134. A further tax is placed upon the trade in the shape of licence fees. Prior to 1874, licences for retail vend were issued free of duty. In 1903\u20134 the amount paid to Government on account of licence fees alone was no less than Rs. 3,44,000. This heavy increase in the cost of the drug, combined with an increase in the land revenue and a growing taste for imported goods, which tends to relieve the ryot of his surplus cash, has produced a remarkable\n\n\\(^1\\) Report on the Province of Assam, by A. J. Moffat Mills; Sibsagar, p. 75 (Calcutta, 1854).\ndecrease in consumption. In 1864-5 the total amount used in the Assam Valley was 1,939 maunds; in 1903-4 it was only 1,266 maunds. The revenue obtained from this head of excise is large. Between 1881 and 1890 it averaged Rs. 16,56,000 annually, rising in the next decade to an average of Rs. 18,75,000. In 1903-4 it was Rs. 18,65,000. In addition to imposing a high rate of duty, the Government attempts to restrict consumption by prohibiting the sale of more than five tolas (2 ounces) at a time to one individual, and by forbidding the vendor to give the drug in exchange for rice or other goods.\n\nThe revenue from country spirits is raised on the out-still system. The sites of the shops are fixed by Government, and the right to manufacture and sell country spirits at these places is put up to auction. Local opinion is consulted before a new shop is opened, and existing stills are closed if it is shown that they offer undue temptations to the drink-consuming classes. It has, however, been proved that the mere abolition of shops does not put a stop to drinking, but merely substitutes home-made for excise liquor, and the Government in its efforts to restrict consumption has constantly to bear this fact in mind. With the object of improving the excise administration, efforts are being made to introduce the central distillery system, which enables some supervision to be exercised over the quality of liquor produced. The limit of retail sale is 3 quarts; and a minimum price has been fixed of 6 annas a quart, except in the Kh\u0101si Hills, where it is 8 annas. Country spirits are chiefly consumed by imported coolies, and the receipts under this head are highest in those Districts where imported coolies are most numerous. The average annual revenue rose from 2 lakhs in the period 1881-90 to 4.8 lakhs in the following decade; in 1903-4 the receipts were 7.08 lakhs. The expansion of the revenue is due to the growth of the foreign population, and to greater vigilance and efficiency in the excise administration. The hillmen and unconverted tribes and many of the garden coolies consume large quantities of home-made rice-beer, but no attempt is made to levy duty on this liquor.\n\nG\u0101nya is imported from R\u0101jsh\u0101hi District in Eastern Bengal, under bond by warehouse keepers, and is issued from their stores, on payment of duty, to the persons who have purchased the right of retail vend. The revenue has expanded pari passu with the growth of the foreign population; the receipts averaging 2.2 lakhs between 1881 and 1890, and 3.3 lakhs during the next ten years. In 1903-4 the income under this head was 4.28 lakhs. The drug is in little favour among the Assamese, and the great majority of the consumers are either foreigners or natives of the Surm\u0101 Valley.\n\nIn comparison with other sources of revenue, the receipts from imported liquors are inconsiderable, amounting to only Rs. 18,869\nin 1903\u20134. The use of spirituous liquors is believed to be spreading among the more advanced sections of the native community; but the total quantity consumed by them is small, and country-made liquor still holds its own among the mass of the drinking population. The incidence of excise revenue per head of population was: in 1880\u20131, 6 annas 4 pies; in 1890\u20131, 7 annas 2 pies; and in 1903\u20134, 8 annas 5 pies.\n\nThe following abstract shows the average net receipts under the head of judicial and non-judicial stamps and income-tax, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                      | Average, 1881\u201390 | Average, 1891\u20131900 | 1903\u20134 |\n|----------------------|------------------|--------------------|--------|\n| Judicial stamps      | 5.17             | 6.07               | 7.09   |\n| Non-judicial stamps  | 1.97             | 2.33               | 2.74   |\n| Income-tax*          | 2.09             | 2.73               | 2.48   |\n\n* From 1887 only.\n\nThere has been a considerable development in the stamp revenue; and this is generally considered to be an indication of the prosperity of the people, as they are only too prone to spend their surplus resources in litigation. An increase in the sale of non-judicial stamps is a sign of prosperity or the reverse, according as a recourse to borrowing is regarded as the result of the extension of trade or of straitened circumstances. The greater part of the income-tax is realized from the salaries paid to Government servants or to the managers and assistants on tea gardens. The incidence of the tax per head of population in 1903\u20134 was 8 pies, and the number of assesseees per 1,000 0.6.\n\nPrior to 1879, the only funds expended under local control in Assam were certain Provincial grants, and in the Districts of Sylhet and Go\u00e1l-p\u0101ra the rates levied under the Bengal Road Cess and Zam\u012bnd\u0101ri D\u0101k Acts. These allotments were managed by the District Magistrate, with the assistance, in the case of roads and education, of special road fund and education committees. In 1879 a Regulation was passed, providing for the levy of a local rate, and the appointment of a committee in each District to control the expenditure on roads, primary education, and the District post. Three years later the District committees were abolished by executive order, and their place was taken by boards established in each subdivision, which are the local authorities in existence at the present day. The Deputy-Commissioner is chairman of the board of the headquarters subdivision, and each of the other boards in the District is presided over by the subdivisional officer. The Local boards are entrusted with the maintenance of all roads within their jurisdiction, except a few main lines of communication, the provision and main-\ntenance of staging bungalows and dispensaries, and the supervision of village sanitation and vaccination. They are also in charge of primary education, subject to the general control of the Educational department, and are empowered to make grants-in-aid to schools of higher grade, subject to certain rules. For these purposes, they have placed at their disposal the rate which is levied under the Assam Local Rates Regulation of 1879, at the rate of one anna per rupee on the annual value of lands, as well as the surplus income of pounds and ferries, and some minor receipts. This income is in most cases supplemented by an annual grant from Provincial funds, the amount of which is fixed for a term of years. The principal heads of income and expenditure are shown in Table IX, appended to this article. The annual budgets of the boards are submitted to the Chief Commissioner for sanction. The estimates for all works costing Rs. 500 or more must be approved by the Public Works department, and important works, requiring much professional skill, are made over for execution to that department. Less important works are entrusted to the board overseers, and in the tea Districts much assistance is usually rendered by planters in the repair of roads and bridges.\n\nIn 1903\u20134 there were 19 Local boards in the Province, consisting of 364 members, of whom 60 were ex officio, 171 nominated, and 133 elected. In Districts where the tea industry is of importance, a certain proportion of the members are planters, who are elected by the planting community. Under a system recently introduced, the majority of the native members will also be elected. In 1903\u20134 of the members of the various boards, 132 were Europeans; and the existence of this strong European element and the comparatively small area entrusted to their charge imparts to the Local boards of Assam a degree of vitality not always found in the self-governing institutions of other parts of India. Some of the largest works constructed by them during the past ten years were as follows: bridge over the Disai river on the Dhodar Ali in the Jorhat subdivision, cost (in round figures) Rs. 67,000; Gauripur-Rah\u0101 road in Go\u0101lp\u0101ra District, cost Rs. 2,23,000; Sylhet-Muktapurgh\u0101t road in North Sylhet subdivision, cost Rs. 1,09,000; Sun\u0101mganj-Pagl\u0101 road in the Sun\u0101mganj subdivision, cost Rs. 1,04,000. Large sums in the aggregate have also been spent on the improvement and repair of the existing lines of communication, the construction of bridges, wells, and roads of less importance than those mentioned, and the maintenance of charitable dispensaries. Serious failure of the harvest occurs so seldom in Assam that Local boards are hardly ever called upon to administer relief, but a small sum was distributed in Sylhet in 1902.\n\nOnly fourteen urban areas in Assam are administered under some form of municipal law, and the average population of each of these places at the Census of 1901 was only 6,784, ranging from 16,893 in\nSylhet to 2,359 in Gol\u0101gh\u0101t. (Bengal) Act III of 1884 is in force in Sylhet, Gauh\u0101ti, and Dibrugarh, the only towns in the Province which contain more than 10,000 inhabitants within municipal limits, and in the small town of Dhubri. The remainder are administered under (Bengal) Act V of 1876, an Act which is also in force in two 'stations' and three 'unions.' The total strength of the fourteen committees in 1903\u20134 was 141 members, of whom 47 were elected, while 70 were nominated and 24 held office ex officio. Fifty of the total number were officials and thirty Europeans. The Deputy-Commissioner or subdivisional officer is chairman of the municipality at head-quarters, except in the case of Sylhet town, but the vice-chairmen are elected by the commissioners and are usually non-officials. The little towns in Assam are often of great extent, and include semi-urban and almost rural areas. Conservancy, water-supply, and drainage are thus difficult and expensive, and the length of the roads necessitates a large expenditure, especially where metalling is involved. Generally speaking, however, a reasonable standard of efficiency is maintained. The incidence of municipal taxation in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 1\u20134 per head, but the towns receive substantial grants from Government, and the average income per head was more than double this amount.\n\nThe most important public works in municipal areas are the waterworks at Gauh\u0101ti and Shillong. At Gauh\u0101ti water is pumped from the Brahmaputra to the top of a hill, and thence distributed all over the town. Since these works were completed in 1887, there has been a marked improvement in the health of the place. In Shillong the water of the hill streams is distributed in pipes over the station.\n\nStatistics showing the principal items of municipal income and expenditure will be found in Table X, appended to this article.\n\nThe Public Works department in Assam is directed by a Chief or Superintending Engineer, who is also Secretary to the Chief Commissioner, aided by an under-secretary. The executive staff comprises twelve Executive and Assistant Engineers and two temporary Engineers. Public works in the Lushai Hills are in charge of a District Engineer, who is an upper subordinate of the Public Works department, and works under the orders of the Superintendent of the Lushai Hills. The accounts of Imperial, Provincial, and Local works are examined and audited by an Examiner. All Provincial works, such as the construction and maintenance of the main lines of communication, and the erection and repair of all Government buildings of any size and importance, are directly under the department. As has already been explained, Local works involving much engineering skill are usually made over to the Executive Engineer for execution, and estimates exceeding Rs. 500 in value are submitted for professional approval.\nThe principal works completed by the department prior to 1890 were: the south trunk road from Dhubri to Sadiy\u0101, 456 miles, completed in 1877; the north trunk road from Dhubri to North Lakhimpur, 326 miles; metalled road from Gauh\u0101ti to Shillong and from Shillong to Cherrapunji, 97 miles; road from Sylhet to C\u0101ch\u0101r, 67 miles; road from Gol\u0101gh\u0101t to Nichuguard, at the foot of the N\u0101g\u0101 Hills, 63 miles; Jorh\u0101t State Railway, 30 miles; and Companyganj-Therri\u0101gh\u0101t State Railway, 8 miles. It was originally intended to carry this line up the face of the hill to Cherrapunji, but the cost was found to be prohibitive. It was wrecked by the earthquake of 1897, and has since been abandoned.\n\nThe principal works constructed since 1890 have been the Nichuguard-Manipur road, constructed from Imperial revenues at a cost of 28\u00bd lakhs; and the Companyganj-Salutikar road, a section 9 miles long of the line of communication between Sylhet and Shillong. The latter runs across the line of drainage of the country, and, as the rainfall in this part of the District is extremely heavy, its construction was attended with serious difficulties. The cost of the road embankment was Rs. 1,41,000, and of the bridges Rs. 1,37,000; they were, however, seriously damaged by the earthquake and by flood, and have been reconstructed at a cost of Rs. 1,88,000. Considerable sums have also been spent on the Aijal-Silchar and Aijal-Lungleh roads, and the Maulavi Bazar-Manumukh road. Some of the largest bridges constructed by the Public Works department are those over the Krishnai and Singr\u0101 rivers on the south trunk road, and over the Digru between Shillong and Gauh\u0101ti. The cost of each was between three-quarters of a lakh and a lakh of rupees. Since 1897, the resources of the Province have been largely devoted to the restoration of buildings destroyed by the earthquake. The most expensive have been: The Secretariat Press, cost Rs. 1,27,000; Government House, Shillong, cost Rs. 1,91,000; Sylhet Collectorate, cost Rs. 1,68,000; and Sylhet Jail, cost Rs. 1,86,000. Other important works have been the Aijal water-works, cost Rs. 1,36,000; and the Manipur cantonments, estimate Rs. 6,56,000.\n\nAssam is comprised in the Lucknow division of the Eastern Command. The military stations in 1904 were: Dibrugarh, Koh\u012bm\u0101, Manipur, Sadiy\u0101, and Shillong. The total strength of the British and Native army stationed within the Province on June 1, 1903, was 2,227, of whom 58 were British.\n\nThere are volunteer corps, with head-quarters at Silchar, Dibrugarh, Lumding, and Shillong; their strength in 1903 was 731, of whom 637 were light horse or mounted rifles. In the Assam Valley separate volunteer corps were originally started in each District, the first to be enrolled being the Lakhimpur corps in 1882. In 1891 the mounted infantry in the four upper Districts of the valley were formed into\none corps under the designation of the Assam Valley Mounted Rifles, and five years later were converted into a body of Light Horse, which in 1903\u20134 had an efficient strength of 349. A volunteer corps was started in Sylhet in 1880 and in Cachar in 1883, and the two were subsequently amalgamated into the Surma Valley Light Horse, which in 1903\u20134 had an efficient strength of 270.\n\nThe police force of the Province consists of civil police, rural police or village chaukidars, and military police. Under native rule there seems to have been no police administration, as we understand the term, and even in 1853 the total force employed in the Assam Valley was only 547 men. The numbers were, however, rapidly increased; and in 1874, when Assam was separated from Bengal, the civil police consisted of 3,452 men. The development of the military police rendered it possible to reduce the other arm of the force, which in 1903 consisted of 384 officers and 2,289 men, showing one policeman engaged on the prevention and detection of crime to every 20 square miles and every 2,185 persons. The corresponding figures for rural police in the three Districts in which alone they are employed were 2 and 458 respectively. The present sanctioned scale of superior officers is 6 District Superintendents and 11 Assistant Superintendents. Under the revised scale there will be 10 of the former and 5 of the latter.\n\nFor ordinary constables strong young men between 18 and 25, who are able to read and write, are selected as recruits. If required for the armed police, the selection is generally restricted to up-countrymen or members of the aboriginal tribes. Appointments to the grade of sub-inspector are occasionally made from the rank and file of the force, but the usual procedure is to select probationers from the list of approved candidates, who are drawn from a superior social position. Head constables and constables are trained by their immediate superiors; probationary sub-inspectors are placed under the orders of a selected inspector, and are not confirmed until a satisfactory report has been received of their conduct and capacity. The rural policeman is required to report all serious crime to the officer in charge of the police station within which his village is situated, to arrest persons committing such crimes in his presence, to collect vital statistics, to observe the movement of bad characters, and generally to inform his official superiors of anything likely to affect the peace and good administration of the District. Rural police are not employed in Assam proper, as there is little serious crime in that portion of the Province, and the gaonbura, or village elder, gives such assistance as is necessary. Educated natives used formerly to object to taking service in the department. The position and the moral tone of the police have, however, been improved of recent years, and the competition for minis-\nterial appointments is now so keen that young men of good family are glad to accept nominations to the sub-inspector grade. The pay of the ordinary constable is not, however, sufficient to attract or retain a good class of recruit, and the readiness with which the men resign is a serious obstacle to the efficient management of the force.\n\nA system of anthropometry was introduced into Assam in 1893, but was superseded in 1898 by the system of identification from fingerprints. The civil police are at present armed with smooth-bore Snider carbines, but bored-out Martini-Henry rifles will shortly be issued in their place. The strength of the civil and military police force is shown in detail in Table XI (p. 118). The average number of criminal charges dealt with by the police during the five years ending 1901 may be classified as follows: Investigated, 9,971; tried in court, 5,251; ending in acquittal or discharge, 993; ending in conviction, 4,052.\n\nPrior to 1878, there were three separate bodies of quasi-military police in the N\u0101g\u0101 and G\u0101ro Hills and in the Surm\u0101 Valley; but in 1878 the frontier police were formed into a separate force, and detachments stationed in each District. In 1882 the Assam Military Police Regulation came into force; and in 1903 the force consisted of five battalions, with a strength of 2,870 officers and men. The headquarters of the battalions are at Aijal in the Lushai Hills, Silchar, Koh\u012bm\u0101 in the N\u0101g\u0101 Hills, Tur\u0101 in the G\u0101ro Hills, and Dibrugarh; but during the cold season the military police hold thirty-six outposts, the majority of which are intended to keep in check the hill tribes on the frontier. The force has recently been rearmed with Martini-Henry rifles, and the officers commanding the four battalions at Silchar, Aijal, Koh\u012bm\u0101, and Dibrugarh are all military men. The military police form a valuable fighting force, and have taken part in the Manipur, Lushai, Abor, Apa Tanang, and Mishmi expeditions, where they served with credit. Railway police are employed only on the Assam-Bengal Railway and the Jorh\u0101t State Railway. The total strength on these two lines consists of 3 officers and 51 head-constables and men.\n\nThe jails at Shillong and at the head-quarters of six plains Districts are District jails, as distinguished from the subsidiary jails at all the plains subdivisions except Hail\u0101k\u0101ndi and Barpet\u0101, and at Dhubri, Nowgong, Kohim\u0101, Tur\u0101, and Aijal. Of the former class there were 7 in 1903, of the latter 17. The largest jails are those at Sylhet, which had a daily average population of 414; Tezpur, daily average 210; Gauh\u0101ti, daily average 249; and Dibrugarh, daily average 110. European prisoners can be confined in these jails, provided that the term of imprisonment does not exceed one month. Prisoners are not, as a rule, confined for more than six months in subsidiary jails, and convicts sentenced for longer terms are generally transferred to a District jail. The jail mortality has usually been high in the Assam\nValley, but in this respect it has not differed from that which prevails in the Province as a whole. The most prevalent diseases are dysentery, diarrhoea, and fever, and there are occasional outbreaks of cholera. The jail industries are not of great importance. They include the making of cane and basket-work furniture, the weaving of prison clothing and rough cloth, rice-husking, pressing of mustard oil, and gardening. At one time prisoners were largely employed on extra-mural labour; but this system has been, to a great extent, abandoned of recent years, as it tends to a relaxation of discipline. The larger jails are in charge of the civil medical officers of the Districts in which they are situated. The chief statistics with regard to the jails of the Province are shown in Table XII, appended to this article.\n\nUnder native rule very little attention was paid to education, and it is said that in 1838 there were barely thirty educated people in the District of Nowgong\\(^1\\). The Province was subsequently incorporated in the charge of an Inspector, Mr. Robinson, who in 1841 reported\\(^2\\) that the state of education in the Brahmaputra Valley was \u2018deplorable in the extreme,\u2019 while fifteen years later he calculated that in the whole of his division, which included several Districts of Bengal, there were only 13,300 boys under tuition out of 1,262,000 children of school-going age. By 1856 English schools had been established at Sylhet and Gauh\u0101ti, 7 Anglo-vernacular schools in Sylhet, all of which were closed in the following year, 3 in C\u0101ch\u0101r, and 1 in Go\u0101lp\u0101ra, and a Government vernacular school at the head-quarters of each of the five Districts of Assam proper. In the Brahmaputra Valley these were supplemented by schools in the villages, which had nearly 4,000 pupils, though the system of tuition was far from satisfactory; but even as late as 1868 less than 1,500 children were under instruction in the Surm\u0101 Valley\\(^3\\), though the total population must have been about two millions. The earliest year for which it is possible to obtain statistics for the Province as a whole is 1875. By that time the system initiated by Sir George Campbell of encouraging indigenous institutions by the offer of grants-in-aid had begun to take effect, and the number of schools had risen to 1,193 and of scholars to 30,000. In 1903\u20134, 3,232 educational institutions existed, and 106,000 persons were under instruction. The department is now under the control of a Director of Public Instruction, an officer recruited from England, who is assisted by a staff of Inspectors, Deputy-Inspectors, and Sub-Inspectors of Schools.\n\nAfter the closing of college classes at Gauh\u0101ti in 1876 the Province\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) *Report on the Province of Assam*, by A. J. Moffatt Mills, p. 26 (Calcutta, 1854).\n\n\\(^2\\) *A Descriptive Account of Assam*, by W. Robinson, p. 277 (Calcutta, 1841).\n\n\\(^3\\) *Principal Heads of the History and Statistics of the Dacca Division*, pp. 326 and 365 (Calcutta, 1868).\nwas without any form of University education, and to meet this defect thirty-six scholarships for sums varying from Rs. 25 to Rs. 10 a month were allotted to boys who passed the Entrance examination with most credit. These scholarships were tenable for two years at any of the affiliated colleges in Bengal, and were extended for a further period if the holders passed the First Arts Examination satisfactorily. In 1892 the Mur\u0101ri Chand second-grade unaided college was opened at Sylhet. It was founded and is maintained by a zam\u012bnd\u0101r of that District, R\u0101j\u0101 Girish Chandra Roy, and teaches up to the First Arts standard, the full college course occupying two years. In 1901 a Government second-grade college, called the Cotton College, was opened at Gauh\u0101ti. The buildings have been designed on liberal lines, and include an excellent library and laboratory, and separate hostels for Hindus and Muhammadans. During the twelve years ending 1900 the degree of B.A. of the Calcutta University was obtained by 68 natives of the Surm\u0101 Valley, 29 of the Brahmaputra Valley, and 2 of the Hill Districts. In the same period 21 persons educated in Assam obtained the M.A. degree.\n\nSecondary education is imparted in high and middle schools, which are again subdivided into middle English and middle vernacular. High schools are those institutions which are recognized by the Calcutta University as capable of affording suitable preparation for the Entrance examination. The boys are taught from the earliest stage of their education up to the Entrance course as prescribed by the University of Calcutta, but may leave school without completing the course. Till recently English was taught in all the classes. The younger boys no longer learn that language, but the standard of instruction is higher than that prevailing in lower secondary (middle) schools. English is the medium of instruction in the first four classes of high schools; in the lower classes and in other schools the vernacular is employed. In 1903\u20134, 10 high schools in the Province were under Government management, 9 were aided\u2014that is to say, institutions under private management towards which Government makes a fixed contribution\u2014and 7 were unaided. The course of instruction at middle English and middle vernacular schools is the same, with the exception that English is taught in the former and not in the latter. The following are the subjects taught in the middle vernacular course: Bengali or Assamese, comprising literature, grammar and composition, history of India, geography, arithmetic, Euclid (Book I), mensuration of plane surfaces and surveying, and elementary natural and sanitary science. In 1903\u20134 there were 75 middle English and 42 middle vernacular schools for boys. Of the middle schools, 78 were under private management, but received grants from Government or Local and municipal funds; 18 were entirely unaided. Grants are made only to those\nschools which meet a recognized want, and are likely to be properly maintained; and they do not, as a rule, exceed the amount provided from fees and other sources. Three per cent. of the male population of school-going age were under secondary instruction in 1903-4.\n\nPrimary education is again divided into upper and lower; but the proportion of boys in upper primary schools is less than 5 per cent. of the total number, and this class of school is slowly dying out. The course of study in lower primary schools includes reading, writing, dictation, simple arithmetic, and the geography of Assam; but in 1903-4, 60 per cent. of the pupils were classed as illiterate, as they were unable to read and write. In upper primary schools the course is somewhat more advanced, including part of the first book of Euclid, mensuration, and a little history. Primary schools are usually managed by local boards or municipalities, and very few are managed by Government. The standard of instruction given still leaves much to be desired, but efforts have recently been made to improve it, by raising the rates of pay given to the masters. Fixed pay is now awarded at average rates of Rs. 8 a month for certificated and Rs. 5 for uncertificated teachers, supplemented by capitation grants at rates ranging from 3 annas to 6 annas for pupils in the three highest classes. Under the system formerly in force rewards were granted on the results of examinations, and there was thus some risk that the master might concentrate his attention on his brighter pupils and neglect the more backward scholars. These examinations have in consequence been abolished, except in so far as they are required for the grant of scholarships. Seventeen per cent. of the boys of school-going age were under primary instruction in 1903-4. The largest proportion of boys of school-going age attending school is found in the Kh\u0101si and Jainti\u0101 Hills, where in 1903-4 it was 33 per cent. K\u0101mr\u016bp (29 per cent.) had the highest proportion in the plains, but in Darrang and Lakhimpur it was less than 17 per cent.\n\nAltogether, 150 girls' schools were maintained in the Province in 1903-4, the proportion of girls actually under instruction to those of school-going age being 15 per 1,000, as compared with 12 and 5 in 1891 and 1881. The majority of the schools are of the lower primary class, and under the management of the Local boards; but in the Kh\u0101si Hills there is a good secondary school maintained by the Welsh Mission, and the success that has attended their efforts can be judged from the fact that 34 per 1,000 of the female population of the District were returned in 1901 as literate, as compared with 4 per 1,000 in the Province as a whole. Elsewhere, the children are withdrawn from school before they have time to make much progress, and the condition of female education cannot be considered satisfactory. The subjects taught include sewing, in addition to those prescribed for\nthe ordinary lower primary course. In the Kh\u0101si and Jainti\u0101 Hills 15 per cent. of the girls of school-going age attended school in 1903\u20134; but in the plains no District had a larger proportion than Go\u0101lp\u0101ra, and there it was only 1 per cent.\n\nThe only forms of special schools in the Province are those for training teachers, a medical and an engineering school, and law classes. Only two training schools are now maintained, but arrangements have been made to train teachers at selected secondary schools. A medical school was established at Dibrugarh in 1900 with the help of a legacy left by the late Brigade-Surgeon Berry-White. It is maintained by Government, and teaches up to the civil Hospital Assistant standard, the course occupying four years. There were 101 students on its rolls in 1903\u20134. An engineering school at Dibrugarh was maintained from the proceeds of a fund left by the late Mr. Williamson, a tea-planter of the Sibs\u0101gar District. This school taught up to the sub-overseer standard; but its working was not satisfactory, and it was recently closed, the funds thus set free being devoted to the establishment of scholarships tenable at an efficient engineering college elsewhere. Law classes are held at Gauh\u0101ti, Sibs\u0101gar, Sylhet, and Silchar.\n\nThe only educational institution for European and Eurasian children in the Province is the middle school at Shillong. It was opened in 1881, closed after the earthquake of 1897, which destroyed the building, and reopened three years later. The number of pupils on the rolls in 1903\u20134 was twenty-nine.\n\nMuhammadans are not as alive to the advantages of education as Hindus, and in 1901 the proportion of literate persons among them was less than half that prevailing among the Hindus. This is partly due to the fact that the immense majority of the upper and middle classes are Hindus, Isl\u0101m having obtained most of its converts in Assam from the lower Hindu castes. The proportion of Muhammadans in high schools is barely a third of that of Hindus, and in middle and primary schools it is little over one-half. Special consideration is given to the claims of educated Muhammadans when making appointments to Government service, and efforts have been made to improve the character of instruction in their private schools.\n\nThe proportion of children under instruction to those of a school-going age has risen from 57 per 1,000 in 1880\u20131 to 90 in 1890\u20131, and to 121 in 1903\u20134. According to the Census of 1901, 36 persons per 1,000 were able to read and write. Education has made most progress in the Surm\u0101 Valley; and in the C\u0101ch\u0101r plains 91 and in Sylhet 81 out of every 1,000 males were classed as literate. In the valley of the Brahmaputra the ratio varied from 68 in K\u0101mr\u016bp to 49 in Go\u0101lp\u0101ra. The proportion in the Hill Districts was 50, but this high rate is partly due to the presence of a considerable foreign literate population in the hills.\nExcept among the Kh\u0101sis, the number of women who could read and write was inconsiderable. The best-educated sections of the community are the higher Hindu castes, such as the Br\u0101hman, K\u0101yasth, Ganak, and Baidya. A considerable proportion of native Christians and Sh\u0101h\u0101s are also literate; but few of the aboriginal tribes, except the Kh\u0101sis, G\u0101ros, and Lushais, have mastered even the elements, though schools have in many cases been opened for their special benefit. The fees charged cannot be considered prohibitive. In the upper classes of high schools boys pay from Rs. 2 to Rs. 3 a month, but education in lower primary schools is free, though presents are sometimes made to the teachers.\n\nThe following table classifies according to sources the direct expenditure incurred on various grades of schools in 1903-4:\n\n|                          | Provincial revenues | District and municipal funds | Fees | Other sources | Total |\n|--------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------|------|---------------|-------|\n| Arts colleges            | Rs. 8,496           | Rs. 6,604                     | Rs. 3,404 | Rs. 18,564    |\n| Training and special schools | Rs. 28,560         | Rs. 5,714                     | Rs. 5,159 | Rs. 9,738     | Rs. 49,171 |\n| Secondary boys' schools   | Rs. 37,983          | Rs. 33,273                    | Rs. 1,321,08 | Rs. 36,881 | Rs. 2,40,245 |\n| Primary boys' schools     | Rs. 16,525          | Rs. 2,14,015                  | Rs. 20,222 | Rs. 60,883    | Rs. 3,11,645 |\n| Girls' schools            | Rs. 4,604           | Rs. 10,968                    | Rs. 1,135 | Rs. 5,797     | Rs. 22,504 |\n| **Total**                 | Rs. 96,168          | Rs. 2,63,970                  | Rs. 1,65,228 | Rs. 1,16,763 | Rs. 6,42,129 |\n\nIn 1903-4 the number of newspapers published in Assam was 9, of which 3 were in English, 2 in Bengali, 1 in Assamese, and 3 in Kh\u0101si. None of these papers was issued oftener than once a week, and not one had as many as 1,200 subscribers, the average circulation being about 750. Only nine books were published in 1903-4, most of which were small treatises of an educational character or works on religious subjects.\n\nThere is no large medical institution in the Province, but 135 dispensaries are maintained, of which 35 have accommodation for in-patients. The largest hospitals are those at Dibrugarh (98 beds), Dhubri (37 beds), Tezpur (40 beds), and Nowgong (38 beds). One of these institutions has been opened at the head-quarters of each District and subdivision, and of recent years there has been a large increase in the number of rural or village dispensaries. The marked development in the number of dispensaries and in the extent to which they have been used by the people during the last twenty-three years is shown in the table on the next page.\n\nBetween 1881 and 1901 the population of the Province increased by 19 per cent.; but the number of cases treated in 1903 was nearly sixteen times the number in 1881, and more than eight operations were performed for every one carried out in the earlier year.\nof the people in the Assam Valley are, however, still indifferent to the advantages to be obtained from European methods. The majority of cases treated at the dispensaries are of a very simple character, and the operations performed are for the most part unimportant. A leper asylum has recently been opened at Sylhet. The total number of lepers treated in 1903 was 48.\n\n| Number of civil hospitals and dispensaries | 1881 | 1891 | 1901 | 1903 |\n|-------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|\n| Average daily number of\u2014                  |      |      |      |      |\n| (a) In-patients                           | 161  | 212  | 361  | 374  |\n| (b) Out-patients                          | 448  | 1,490| 3,460| 3,829|\n| Income from\u2014                              |      |      |      |      |\n| (a) Government                            | Rs. 16,105 | 35,237 | 75,371 | 81,788 |\n| (b) Local and municipal funds             | Rs. 8,593  | 52,278 | 94,964 | 94,259 |\n| (c) Fees, endowments, and other sources   | Rs. 15,007 | 51,562 | 85,257 | 81,511 |\n| Expenditure on\u2014                           |      |      |      |      |\n| (a) Establishment                         | Rs. 18,026 | 45,054 | 84,475 | 96,069 |\n| (b) Medicines, diet, buildings, &c.       | Rs. 19,516 | 92,020 | 1,67,539 | 1,11,675 |\n\nThere is a lunatic asylum at Tezpur, to which insane persons are sent from the Hill Districts and the Assam Valley. Lunatics from the Surm\u0101 Valley are sent to the Dacca asylum.\n\nThe chief statistics of the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum are shown in the following table:\n\n| Average daily number of\u2014                  | 1881 | 1891 | 1901 | 1903 |\n|-------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|\n| (a) Criminal lunatics                     | 18   | 30   | 37   | 54   |\n| (b) Other lunatics                        | 34   | 90   | 82   | 101  |\n| Income from\u2014                              |      |      |      |      |\n| (a) Government                            | Rs. 7,454 | 8,729 | 12,761 | 14,987 |\n| (b) Fees and other sources                | Rs. 030  | 150  | 1,672 | 686  |\n| Expenditure on\u2014                           |      |      |      |      |\n| (a) Establishment                         | Rs. 3,786 | 3,973 | 4,499 | 5,265 |\n| (b) Diet, buildings, &c.                  | Rs. 4,268 | 5,564 | 8,922 | 0,479 |\n\nDuring the ten years ending 1901 there were 350 admissions. In 232 cases the cause of insanity was unknown; in 45 cases ganja was said to have been the predisposing cause, in 16 epilepsy, in 12 fever, in 10 spirit-drinking, in 2 heredity, and in 9 opium.\n\nInoculation is still practised in different parts of the Province. The virus is obtained from persons whose small-pox eruptions are about eight days old, and after it has been diluted with water it is applied to small incisions which have been made in the arm of the patient. An attack of small-pox supervenes, and if the patient recovers his\nchances of contracting the disease in the ordinary way are very slight. Unfortunately, in many cases the person inoculated dies, and under any circumstances he is a dangerous source of infection to his neighbours. Inoculators seldom take service in the vaccination department, though preference is given to them before other candidates.\n\nVaccination is compulsory only in the larger towns, which in 1901 had a total population of 79,845; but, except among the Mah\u0101puru-shias, a somewhat bigoted sect of Vaishnavites, whose head-quarters are at Barpet\u0101 in K\u0101mr\u016bp, its advantages are generally recognized. In 1903 the number of vaccinators employed was 263. Further information is given in the following table:\n\n|                  | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Population among whom vaccination was carried on | *      | 5,422,745 | 6,126,343 | 6,126,343 |\n| Number of successful operations | 21,170 | 161,157 | 257,336 | 271,295 |\n| Ratio per 1,000 of population | 27     | 42     | 44     |        |\n| Total expenditure on vaccination | Rs.    | 15,841-0-0 | 22,833-0-0 | 24,381-0-0 |\n| Cost per successful case | Rs.    | 0-1-9   | 0-1-8   | 0-1-9   |\n\n* Information not available.\n\nThe system of selling pice packets of quinine at post offices was first brought into full working in 1896. In that year 67,000 packets were sold through the agency of the postal department, and 33,000 by missionaries in the Kh\u0101si and Jainti\u0101 Hills. In 1903-4 the number of packets sold was 105,000; but in 1898, which was a very unhealthy year, more than double this quantity was disposed of.\n\nThe sanitation of rural areas is in a condition far from satisfactory. There are no conservancy arrangements, and the water-supply is usually drawn from sluggish rivers and tanks exposed to every form of pollution, or from shallow wells. A considerable number of masonry wells have been constructed at central sites by the local authorities, but unfortunately the Assamese often decline to use them. In 1896 a system of sanitary inspection books was inaugurated in 110 villages, but it is doubtful whether any practical advantages have accrued. In the hills the villages are, as a rule, built on sites which are fairly free from jungle, and, though often very dirty, are exposed to the purifying influences of the sun and air.\n\nThe following account of the surveys of the Province is taken from the General Administration Report for 1902-3:\n\n'The professional revenue survey of the plains Districts of the Province was undertaken while these Districts formed part of Bengal, and was brought to a conclusion shortly after the formation of the Chief Commissionership. In this survey village boundaries, where they existed, and the boundaries of certain tea grants and revenue-free estates, as well as the geographical and topographical\nfeatures of the country, were mapped, usually on the scale of 4 inches to a mile; but, except in the Jaintia Parganas and Cachar, no field survey was made, and the results were of little practical use for revenue purposes. In the permanently settled portion of Sylhet, the survey was preceded in the years 1859-65 by a demarcation of the boundaries of villages and estates by non-professional agency, in the course of which maps of the estates were prepared by chain and compass on the scale of 16 inches to a mile; and these maps, inaccurate though they are in many respects, afford the most recent record of the boundaries of estates in that area. A cadastral survey, based on a regular professional traverse of the portions of the Assam Valley where most cultivation was to be found, was commenced in 1883 and completed in 1893, and similar cadastral surveys of the ryotwari portions of Sylhet and Cachar have been effected for resettlement purposes in subsequent years. The field maps of these surveys are on the scale of 16 inches to a mile. While the cadastral survey of a portion of the Assam Valley Districts was in progress, the opportunity was taken to train the local mandals in surveying with the plane table; and after the professional party had left the valley, certain additional areas were surveyed cadastrally by local agency on the basis of plane-table traverses in successive years. It was subsequently decided that all such extension surveys should be made on the basis of theodolite traverses; and since 1899 a permanent professional survey detachment has been maintained in the Province, which is charged with the duty of preparing traverses for further cadastral survey which the extension of cultivation may necessitate, as well as with correcting and bringing up to date the topographical details in the standard District maps, and with minor survey operations undertaken in the Province which require professional skill. Wherever an area has been brought under cadastral survey, arrangements have been made for having the maps and other records kept up to date as far as possible, and the permanent marks looked after by the agency of mandals in the Brahmaputra Valley and patwiris in the Surma Valley. The Garo, Khasi and Jaintia and Naga Hills, and a portion of the Lushai Hills have been surveyed by the Topographical Branch of the Imperial Survey Department.\n\nA full bibliography of writings dealing with Assam will be found in the Report on the Progress of Historical Research in Assam (Shillong, 1897).

 | 101,931  |\nAssam Range.\u2014A range of hills lying between $24^\\circ 58'$ and $26^\\circ 48'$ N. and $89^\\circ 49'$ and $94^\\circ 50'$ E., which runs almost due east and west between the valleys of the Brahmaputra and Surm\u0101. It consists of the G\u0101ro, Kh\u0101si and Jainti\u0101, North Cach\u0101r, and N\u0101g\u0101 Hills, and at its eastern end trends towards the north and is joined by the Patkai to the Himalayan system, and by the mountains of Manipur to the Arakan Yoma. The general elevation is from 3,000 to 6,000 feet, but at J\u0101pvo in the N\u0101g\u0101 Hills a height of nearly 10,000 feet is attained. The Shillong peak (6,450 feet) is the highest point in the Kh\u0101si Hills. Geologically, the range falls into two groups. The G\u0101ro, Kh\u0101si, and Jainti\u0101 Hills and part of North Cach\u0101r are known as the Shillong plateau, and consist for the most part of a great mass of gneiss. The eastern portion is mainly composed of sandstones of Tertiary age. Coal is found in the G\u0101ro and Kh\u0101si Hills, and in the hills south of Lakhimpur, and lime on the face of the Kh\u0101si Hills overlooking the plains of Sylhet. Through the greater part of their length the hills take the form of sharply serrated ridges covered with dense forest, but the central portion of the Kh\u0101si Hills is an elevated plateau consisting of rolling downs covered with short grass.\n\nAssam Valley.\u2014A Division in Eastern Bengal and Assam, consisting of the valley of the Brahmaputra between $25^\\circ 28'$ and $27^\\circ 52'$ N. and $89^\\circ 42'$ and $96^\\circ 5'$ E., shut in between the Himalayas on the north and the Assam Range on the south. The head-quarters of the Commissioner are at Gauh\u0101ti Town. The population of the Division at the last four enumerations was: (1872) 1,884,046, (1881) 2,252,003, (1891) 2,476,481, and (1901) 2,619,077. The slow rate of increase during the last decade is due to the exceptional unhealthiness that prevailed in the central portion of the valley. The total area is 24,605 square miles, and the density of population 106 persons per square mile, which is rather above that of Assam as a whole. In 1901 Hindus numbered 72 per cent. of the population, animistic tribes 18 per cent., and Musalm\u0101ns 10 per cent. Other religions included Jains (1,600), Buddhists (7,940), and Christians (12,526), of whom 11,151 were natives. The Division contains six Districts, as shown below:\n\n| Area in square miles | Population, 1901 | Land revenue and cesses (1903-4), in thousands of rupees |\n|----------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| Go\u0101lp\u0101ra             | 3,961            | 462,052                                                | 1,80 |\n| K\u0101mr\u016bp              | 3,858            | 589,187                                                | 13,51 |\n| Darrang             | 3,418            | 337,313                                                | 7,82 |\n| Nowgong             | 3,843            | 261,160                                                | 5,10 |\n| Sibs\u0101gar            | 4,996            | 597,969                                                | 15,63 |\n| Lakhimpur           | 4,529            | 371,396                                                | 6,49 |\n| **Total**           | **24,605**       | **2,619,077**                                          | **50,35** |\nThe greater part of the Division consists of a level plain, lying on both sides of the Brahmaputra. In the centre is a tract of hilly country known as the Mikir Hills, which is cut off from the main mass of the Assam Range by the valleys of the Dhansiri and the L\u00e4ngpher. The Division contains 10 towns, rather more than half the total number in Assam, and 8,801 villages.\n\nThe largest towns are Gauh\u0101ti (11,661) and Dibrugarh (11,227). The chief centres of trade are Go\u0101lp\u0101ra, Barpet\u0101, Gauh\u0101ti, Tezpur, and Dibrugarh. The Assamese have, however, no commercial aptitude; and the fact that tea is the principal industry of the Division prevents the formation of business centres, each large garden serving as a nucleus for local trade. K\u0101makhy\u0101 and H\u0101jo in K\u0101mr\u016bp, and the pool of Brahmakund at the eastern end of the valley, are places of pilgrimage to which devout Hindus come from all parts of India. Gauh\u0101ti is locally identified with a town mentioned in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, and Tezpur possesses interesting archaeological remains. Sibs\u0101gar and N\u0101zir\u0101 were the capitals of the Ahom kingdom.\n\nAssaye.\u2014Village in the Bhokardan t\u0101luk of Aurang\u0101bad District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, situated in 20\u00b0 15' N. and 75\u00b0 54' E. Population (1901), 302. It is famous for the battle fought in 1803, when Sir Arthur Wellesley with only 4,500 men defeated the Mar\u0101th\u0101s, who numbered 50,000. The battle-field is best visited from Sillod, which is 11 miles north-west of the village.\n\nAssia.\u2014Range of hills in the J\u0101jpur subdivision of Cuttack District, Bengal, lying between 20\u00b0 35' and 20\u00b0 41' N. and 86\u00b0 14' and 86\u00b0 17' E., and containing interesting Buddhist, Muhammadan, and Hindu remains. The principal hills are Alamg\u012br, Udayagiri, Baradihi, Naltigiri, and the outlying peak of Amr\u0101vati or Chati\u0101.\n\nAtagada.\u2014Zamind\u0101ri estate in Ganj\u0101m District, Madras. See Kallikota and Atagada.\n\nAtak.\u2014District, tahsil, and town in the Punjab. See Attock.\n\nAt\u0101ri.\u2014Village in the Kabirw\u0101la tahsil of Mult\u0101n District, Punjab, situated in 30\u00b0 26' N. and 72\u00b0 1' E., 20 miles south-west of Talamba. It is at present an insignificant hamlet, but contains a ruined fortress, once evidently of great strength, and is identified by Cunningham with the city of the Br\u0101hmans, the third city taken by Alexander in his invasion of India. The citadel is 750 feet square and 35 feet high, surrounded by a ditch now almost undistinguishable, and having a central tower 50 feet in height. On two sides stretch the remains of an ancient town, forming a massive mound covered with huge bricks, whose size attests their great antiquity. No tradition exists as to the origin or history of these remains, and the name of the old city is unknown. The adjacent village of At\u0101ri is quite modern.\n\nAthgarh.\u2014One of the Tributary States of Orissa, Bengal, lying\nbetween $20^\\circ 26'$ and $20^\\circ 41'$ N., and $84^\\circ 32'$ and $85^\\circ 52'$ E., with an area of 168 square miles. It is bounded on the north by the State of Dhenk\u0101n\u0101l; on the east and south by Cuttack District; and on the west by the States of Tigiri\u0101 and Dhenk\u0101n\u0101l. The country is level, low-lying, and very subject to inundation. The soil is fertile, and the cultivation consists chiefly of rice, with an occasional crop of sugar-cane, pulses, and millets.\n\nThe founder of the State was Sri Karan Niladri Baw\u0101rta Patnaik, who belonged to the Karan caste. It is said that he was the Baw\u0101rta or minister of the Pur\u012b R\u0101j\u0101, who conferred on him the title of R\u0101j\u0101 and gave him Athgarh as a reward for his services, or, according to another account, as a dowry on marrying the R\u0101j\u0101's sister. The present chief, Sri Karan Biswan\u0101th Baw\u0101rta Patnaik, is the thirteenth in descent. The State has an estimated revenue of Rs. 50,000, and pays a tribute of Rs. 2,800 to the British Government. The population increased from 36,603 in 1891 to 43,784 in 1901; of the latter number all but 2,643 are Hindus. The most numerous castes are the Ch\u0101sas (10,000), Sahars (6,000), and Khandaitis and P\u0101ns (5,000 each). The average density is 260 persons per square mile. The number of villages is 192, of which the principal is Athgarh, the residence of the R\u0101j\u0101. A small Christian colony is settled in three hamlets near Chag\u0101n village. The State is traversed by the old high road from Cuttack to Sambalpur and by the newly opened Cuttack-Angul-Sambalpur road. The Mah\u0101nadi river, which runs along the southern boundary, is navigable by boats. There is some trade in grain, and fuel and charcoal are largely exported to Cuttack. The State maintains a charitable dispensary, a middle English school, an upper primary school, 75 lower primary schools, and one Sanskrit tol.\n\nAsthmallik.\u2014One of the Tributary States of Orissa, Bengal, lying between $20^\\circ 37'$ and $21^\\circ 5'$ N. and $84^\\circ 16'$ and $84^\\circ 48'$ E., with an area of 730 square miles. It is bounded on the north by the State of Rair\u0101khol; on the east by Angul District; on the south by the Mah\u0101nadi river, which separates it from Baud; and on the west by Sonpur and Rair\u0101khol. The country is for the most part covered with dense jungle, and a long range of forest-clad hills runs along its southern side parallel with the course of the Mah\u0101nadi. The origin of the State is obscure. According to tradition, the founder of the family, Prat\u0101p Deo, came to Pur\u012b and quarrelled with the R\u0101j\u0101, who put to death two of his seven brothers. The survivors fled to Bonai, and established themselves there. Prat\u0101p Deo next proceeded to Baud and thence to Asthmallik, of which he took possession after killing the Dom chief. Official records, however, show that till lately the State had no separate existence, and in the treaty engagement of 1804 it is mentioned as a tributary of Baud. It was treated as a separate State in the sanad granted to the chief in 1894,\nthe terms of which were identical with those contained in the sanads of the other Orissa chiefs. The State has an estimated revenue of Rs. 71,000, and pays a tribute of Rs. 480 to the British Government. The population increased from 31,605 in 1891 to 40,753 in 1901, part of the gain being due to immigration from Baud and the Central Provinces. A great extension of cultivation has taken place in recent years, and the population is now nearly double what it was in 1881; but Athmallik is still, with the exception of P\u0101l Lahar\u0101, the most sparsely populated of all the Orissa States, the density being only 56 persons per square mile. Of the total population, all but 100 are Hindus. The most numerous castes are Ch\u0101sas (8,000), Gours (6,000), and Gonds, P\u0101ns, and Sudh\u0101s (4,000 each). There are 460 villages, the principal being Kaintira, the residence of the chief. The trade in timber, rice, and oilseeds is carried on pack-bullocks and by boats. The forests contain good timber, but they have not been systematically worked. The State maintains a charitable dispensary, one middle English school, one upper school, and 32 lower primary schools.\n\nAthni T\u0101luka.\u2014North-eastern t\u0101luka of Belgaum District, Bombay, lying between 16\u00b0 27' and 16\u00b0 58' N. and 74\u00b0 40' and 75\u00b0 25' E., with an area of 816 square miles. It contains one town, Athni (population, 11,107), the head-quarters, and 82 villages, including Kudchi (5,879). The population in 1901 was 113,077, compared with 123,438 in 1891. The density, 139 persons per square mile, is much below the District average. The demand for land revenue in 1903\u20134 was 2\u00b73 lakhs, and for cesses Rs. 19,000. Most of the lands of Athni are bare and treeless. The t\u0101luka is divided by a range of hills into two very similar tracts of level country. The climate is generally dry and healthy, the average rainfall being only 23 inches. The southern portion, which is crossed by the winding Kistna, is an open plain of fine black soil with many small rich villages.\n\nAthni Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the t\u0101luka of the same name in Belgaum District, Bombay, situated in 16\u00b0 44' N. and 75\u00b0 4' E. Population (1901), 11,107. The municipality, established in 1853, had an income averaging Rs. 16,600 during the decade ending 1901. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 16,600. Athni is a place of importance as a local centre of trade. Its wheelwrights are known as excellent workmen; and it has manufactures of coarse cotton cloth, blankets, and salt-petre, as well as factories for pressing and cleaning cotton. It is the chief rural market in the District, sending cotton and grain westwards to Mir\u0101j (24 miles), and receiving from the sea-coast through Mir\u0101j rice, coco-nuts, and dried fish. The French traveller Mandelslo in 1639 noticed 'Atteny city' as one of the chief markets between Bij\u0101pur and Goa. About 1670 the English geographer Ogilby mentioned 'Attany' as a great trading town. In 1679 this mart was taken from Sivaji by\nthe Mughal Dil\u0101war Kh\u0101n, who sacked it. Dil\u0101war Kh\u0101n wished to sell the people as slaves. Sambh\u0101j\u012b, the son of Sivaji, who some time before had rebelled against his father and joined Dil\u0101war Kh\u0101n, opposed the suggestion, and, on Dil\u0101war Kh\u0101n ignoring his remonstrances, left the camp and became reconciled with his father. About 1720 Athni was seized by the Niz\u0101m, who made it over to the chief of Kolhapur, by whom it was given to R\u0101j\u0101 S\u0101hu of S\u0101t\u0101ra in 1730. Athni lapsed to the British Government in 1839, on the death of the Nip\u0101ni chief. The town contains a Subordinate Judge\u2019s court, a dispensary, a municipal middle school, and four other schools, one of which is for girls.\n\n**Atmak\u016br Subdivision.**\u2014Subdivision of Nellore District, Madras, consisting of the Atmak\u016br and Udayagiri taluks.\n\n**Atmak\u016br Taluk.**\u2014Inland taluk of Nellore District, Madras, lying between 14\u00b0 26\u2032 and 14\u00b0 49\u2032 N. and 79\u00b0 15\u2032 and 79\u00b0 49\u2032 E., with an area of 640 square miles. The population in 1901 was 110,906, compared with 101,154 in 1891. The number of villages is 112, of which Atmak\u016br is the head-quarters. The demand on account of land revenue and cesses amounted in 1903\u20134 to Rs. 3,04,000. The taluk is generally flat, though studded with isolated hills; the Velikonda range runs along its western border. There are no true forests, but the western hills are \u2018reserved\u2019 and low scrub jungle abounds. Two rivers, the Penner and Boggeru, aided by two smaller streams, the Keta Manneru and Biraperu, drain the taluk. The climate is dry, with a rainfall of only 18 inches, but the soil is fairly productive. Cholam, rice, r\u0101gi, aruga, cambu, and horse-gram are the chief crops, cholam occupying 57 per cent. of the cultivated \u2018dry\u2019 area. Indigo and cotton are also raised to some extent. The river Penner, forcing its way through the Velikondas from Cuddapah District, enters the taluk at Somasila and runs through it for a distance of 35 miles, dividing it into two unequal portions. It contains 83 Government irrigation tanks, two of which (one at Anantas\u0101garam and the other at Kaluv\u0101ya) are good examples of ancient Hindu engineering.\n\n**Atmak\u016br State.**\u2014Samasth\u0101n or tributary estate in Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State. See AMARCHINTA.\n\n**Atp\u0101di (Athp\u0101di).**\u2014Village in the State of Aundh, Bombay, situated in 17\u00b0 25\u2032 N. and 74\u00b0 59\u2032 E. Population (1901), 5,027. It is famous for its cattle of the Khilar breed, reared by Dhangars. In consequence of its situation on a loop-road connecting the Kar\u0101d-Pandharpur and Kar\u0101d-N\u0101g\u0101r roads, the town is much visited by pilgrims to Pandharpur. About 12 miles distant is the well-known temple of N\u0101th at Kharsumdi, largely frequented by pilgrims, at which a cattle fair is held twice a year. Country blankets and coarse cloth are manufactured at Atp\u0101di and exported to the Konkan. The village contains a post office, a dispensary, and a school teaching elementary English.\nAtr\u0101f-i-balda (= \u2018Suburbs of the city\u2019).\u2014District of Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, lying almost in the centre of the State. It is situated between the Districts of Medak and Elgandal on the north, Mahb\u016bbnagar on the south, Nalgonda on the east, Gulbarga on the west, and B\u012bdar on the north-west. Owing to its villages being interspersed with those of the surrounding districts, its spherical values cannot be accurately given, but the limits are approximately between $16^\\circ 30'$ and $18^\\circ 20'$ N. and $77^\\circ 30'$ and $79^\\circ 30'$ E. It is a Sarf-i-kh\u0101s or \u2018crown\u2019 district, and has a total area of 3,399 square miles, including the city of Hyder\u0101b\u0101d (26 square miles). The area of the \u2018crown\u2019 lands is 2,040 square miles, the rest being j\u0101g\u012br. The country is mostly hilly; and thickly wooded hills, known as the R\u0101jkonda range, stretch from Pipalp\u0101d in the Ambarpet t\u0101luk in a south-easterly direction, and enter Nalgonda District. The Anantagiri range, which begins in Mahb\u016bbnagar District, enters the Patl\u016br t\u0101luk, and, cutting across the Niz\u0101m\u2019s State Railway and passing north of it, runs almost parallel to the line from Vik\u0101r\u0101b\u0101d as far as Dh\u0101r\u016br. A large portion of this range is composed of high-level laterite. Isolated granite hills are seen everywhere; and the city of Hyder\u0101b\u0101d is surrounded by rocky eminences, from 200 to 300 feet in height, among which may be mentioned the Maul\u0101 Al\u012b, the Golconda rock, and the black rock at Trimulgherry. The slope of country is from west to east and south-east.\n\nThe most important river is the M\u00fcsi, which passes through three t\u0101luks of the District. It rises in the Anantagiri hills near Sivareddipet, and flows almost due east, passing between Hyder\u0101b\u0101d city and its northern suburbs or Ch\u0101dargh\u0101t into Nalgonda District. The M\u0101njra just touches two of the villages of the Asafnagar t\u0101luk in the north-west of the District. Other smaller streams are the S\u0101kalv\u0101ni in the west, a tributary of the M\u00fcsi; the Haldi or Paspaver in the north, a tributary of the M\u0101njra; and the Deo stream in the J\u016bkal sub-t\u0101luk, which is also a tributary of the M\u0101njra.\n\nThe geological formation is the Archaean gneiss. Around Hyder\u0101b\u0101d, and stretching as far west as Lingampalli, 15 miles from the city, tors and boulders of fantastic shapes are seen everywhere, composed of basalt and granite piled up in picturesque confusion.\n\nLow scrubby jungles give cover to leopards, bears, hyenas, and occasionally tigers, while in the more open plains antelope abound. The Niz\u0101m\u2019s preserves, extending about 24 miles east of the city, are stocked with them. Partridges, quails, and wild pigeons are very common, and in the tanks and rice-fields wild duck, teal, and snipe are plentiful in the cold season.\n\nThe numerous tanks and streams make the climate damp, and malarial fevers are common in the rainy season. From October to the end of March, the District is generally very healthy.\nThe annual rainfall during the twenty-one years ending 1901 averaged 33 inches. The amounts received in 1892, 1893, and 1894 were much above the normal, being 46, 55, and 50 inches, while in 1899 only 19 inches fell.\n\nThe District formed part of the territory of the K\u0101katiyas of Warangal (1150\u20131325), but has been under Muhammadan rule since the conquest of the Deccan in the fourteenth century. During the reign of Sult\u0101n Mahm\u016bd Sh\u0101h Bahmani, the governor of the Teling\u0101na districts declared his independence, and in 1512 assumed royal dignity under the title of Sult\u0101n Kuli Kutb Sh\u0101h. The Kutb Sh\u0101his reigned until the conquest of the Deccan by Aurangzeb, who incorporated their kingdom in the empire of Delhi, from which it was again separated on the foundation of the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State early in the eighteenth century.\n\nAmong the places of archaeological interest, the following deserve mention. The fort of Golconda, also known as Muhammadnagar, 5 miles west of Hyder\u0101b\u0101d, was once the capital of the Kutb Sh\u0101hi kings. Outside the fort, to the north, are the tombs of these kings, which rank among the most remarkable Musalm\u0101n sepulchres in the Deccan. Most of the tombstones are of black polished basalt with beautifully engraved inscriptions. At Maisaram, 10 miles south of Hyder\u0101b\u0101d, are the remains of some Hindu temples destroyed by Aurangzeb after the fall of Golconda. A mosque built from the materials of a large temple 200 years ago is still standing. The buildings in the city and its suburbs are comparatively modern, and are described in the article on Hyder\u0101b\u0101d City.\n\nThe number of villages in the District, including j\u0101girs, is 847. The population (excluding the city) at the last three enumerations was:\n\n- (1881) 355,787,\n- (1891) 389,784,\n- (1901) 420,702.\n\nThe District is divided into five t\u0101luks and one sub-t\u0101luk, statistics of which, according to the Census of 1901, are given below:\n\n| Taluk          | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|----------------|----------------------|----------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Medchal        | 279                  | 61             | 33,544   | 120        | -11.8                     |                                                             | Not available                          |\n| Ambarpet       | 560                  | 124            | 81,535   | 145        | +13.0                     |                                                             |                                        |\n| Sh\u0101hab\u0101d       | 302                  | 65             | 41,384   | 137        | +4.9                      |                                                             |                                        |\n| Asafnagar      | 290                  | 64             | 47,217   | 162        | +20.4                     |                                                             |                                        |\n| Patl\u016br         | 522                  | 115            | 45,006   | 86         | -2.0                      |                                                             |                                        |\n| J\u0101kal (sub-t\u0101luk) | 87                | 22             | 15,789   | 181        | +45.1                     |                                                             |                                        |\n| J\u0101girs, &c.    | 1,333                | 396            | 156,227  | 117        | +6.6                      |                                                             |                                        |\n| District total | 3,373                | 847            | 420,702  | 128        | +7.9                      |                                                             | 14,745                                 |\nMore than 87 per cent. of the population are Hindus, and about 86 per cent. speak Telugu.\n\nThe most numerous caste is that of the agriculturist K\u0101pus, who number 75,774, or more than 18 per cent. of the total. Br\u0101hmans number as many as 39,600; Komatis or trading castes, 13,400; Gollas or shepherds, 32,900; Gaundlas or toddy-drawers, 23,500; and S\u0101las or weavers, 17,500. Of the lower castes, the Dhers or village menials number 26,000, and the Cham\u0101rs or leather-workers 49,800. The population engaged in agriculture forms nearly 33 per cent. of the total.\n\nThe District is situated in the granitic region, and most of its soil is chalka or sandy, derived from the disintegration of granite, with patches of regar or black soil interspersed here and there. In the Patl\u016br and J\u016bkal t\u0101luks regar prevails to a greater extent, and in the former a large area of laterite or ferruginous clay exists, both these soils being very fertile. The chalka soil is chiefly suitable for kharif or rainy season cultivation, such as yellow jow\u0101r, b\u0101jra, r\u0101gi, and maize; while rabi crops, such as white jow\u0101r, cotton, and linseed, are raised on the regar and lateritic soils. The red soil or laterite is well suited for garden produce, wherever water is available. The soils in the river valleys and at the foot of the hills are particularly fertile.\n\nThe tenure of lands is mainly ryotw\u0101ri. Excluding j\u0101girs, 393 square miles were cultivated in 1901, out of a total of 2,040. Forests and land not available for cultivation occupied 1,480 square miles, and cultivable waste and fallows 167 square miles. The staple food-crops are jow\u0101r, b\u0101jra, and rice, grown on 123, 48, and 34 square miles, or 32, 12, and 9 per cent. of the net area cropped. Oilseeds, such as sesamum, linseed, and castor, are cultivated in all parts, the aggregate area occupied by them being 81 square miles, while gram covered 24 square miles.\n\nThe District possesses no characteristic breed of cattle, and the ponies are of the commonest description. Sheep and goats of the ordinary kind are reared by shepherds. Near Golconda, a stud farm exists for the supply of horses to the State troops.\n\nThis being a Teleng\u0101na district, \u2018wet\u2019 cultivation is largely practised. Numerous dams have been constructed in the M\u016bsi, the channels being used as feeders to large tanks, such as the Husain S\u0101gar, and also directly for irrigating lands through which they pass. Water is also supplied from 139 large and 310 small tanks or kuntas, and from 2,253 wells. The total area irrigated in 1901 was 40 square miles.\n\nIn two forest tracts, one in the Patl\u016br and the other in the Sh\u0101h\u0101b\u0101d t\u0101luk, certain kinds of timber are protected, including teak (Tectona grandis), ebony, and nall\u0101maddi (Terminalia tomentosa). The produce\nof these forests is, however, of small size. Unprotected forest tracts exist in all parts, consisting of ghairi or common wood used as fuel, and also for thatching and wattling.\n\nNo minerals of any economic value are found, except kankar or nodular limestone, basalt, and granite. Crude carbonate of soda is collected at Chandur and K\u0101parti in the Ambarpet t\u0101luk, by lixiviating saline earth. In the Patl\u016br t\u0101luk laminated limestone known as Sh\u0101h\u0101b\u0101d stone, red ochre, and ironstone occur, the last being smelted for local use.\n\nAt Chand\u016br s\u0101ris and handkerchiefs are made, and at Asafnagar brass and copper vessels of a superior kind. The Cham\u0101rs cure leather in a primitive way for manufacture into water-buckets and sandals.\n\nThe chief exports are jouvar, rice and other food-grains, cotton, ghi, oilseeds, chillies, sheep and cattle, bones, jaggery, tobacco, hides and skins, and tarvar bark for tanning. The principal imports are salt, salted fish, opium, spices, gold and silver, copper and brass utensils, refined sugar, iron, sulphur, kerosene oil, raw silk, and silk and cotton cloths of every description. The city of Hyder\u0101b\u0101d is the chief centre of trade; but weekly fairs are held at several places, such as at Chintalcher\u016b, Krishnareddipet, Kankt\u016br, Dilavarganj, T\u016bpr\u0101n, and Dh\u0101r\u016br. The principal trading castes are the Komatis and a few M\u0101rw\u0101ris.\n\nThe District is well favoured as regards railways. The Niz\u0101m\u2019s State Railway crosses it from east to west, with six stations, and the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d-God\u0101vari Valley line starting from Hyder\u0101b\u0101d has one station within its limits. The total length of railways is about 98 miles.\n\nThere are six roads: namely, from Hyder\u0101b\u0101d via Shams\u0101b\u0101d to Mahb\u016bbnagar, 45 miles; Hyder\u0101b\u0101d to Nalgonda, 80 miles; Hyder\u0101b\u0101d via Bibinagar to Bhongir, 28 miles; Hyder\u0101b\u0101d to Medchal, 34 miles; Hyder\u0101b\u0101d to Patancher\u016b via Lingampalli, 16 miles; and Dh\u0101r\u016br to Kohir in Bidar District, 24 miles: making a total of 227 miles. The first, second, and fourth are portions of the military roads leading to Raich\u016br, Masulipatam, and N\u0101gpur respectively.\n\nThe District generally escapes famine, but it suffered severely from drought owing to scanty and unseasonable rain in 1896, 1897, 1899, 1901, and 1902. In the first two years no fodder was obtainable, and large numbers of cattle died.\n\nThere are three subdivisions: one consisting of the Medchal and J\u016bkal t\u0101luks, under a Second T\u0101lukd\u0101r; the second, comprising the Patl\u016br and Asafnagar t\u0101luks, under the Third T\u0101lukd\u0101r; and the remaining two t\u0101luks of Ambarpet and Sh\u0101h\u0101b\u0101d are managed by the First T\u0101lukd\u0101r, who also exercises a general supervision over all his subordinates. Each t\u0101luk is under a tahsild\u0101r, while the sub-t\u0101luk of J\u016bkal has a naib-tahsild\u0101r.\nThe District civil court is presided over by the Judicial Assistant to the First T\u0101lukd\u0101r, the latter being also the Nazim-i-Diwan\u012b or Civil Judge. Cases decided or inquired into by the Assistant are submitted to the First T\u0101lukd\u0101r for confirmation or decision. The subordinate civil courts are those of the tahsild\u0101rs. The First T\u0101lukd\u0101r is the chief magistrate of the District, and his Judicial Assistant is also a joint magistrate, who exercises powers as such during the absence of the First T\u0101lukd\u0101r from head-quarters. The Second and Third T\u0101lukd\u0101rs exercise magisterial powers of the second, and the tahsild\u0101rs powers of the third class. Serious crime is not heavy.\n\nVery little is known of the revenue history before the introduction of District administration in 1866; but the management was based on the farming of groups of villages or t\u0101luks to revenue contractors for fixed sums, the farmers receiving 1\u00bd annas per rupee for collection. In 1866 the present t\u0101luks were formed, except the sub-t\u0101luk of J\u016bkal, which was a j\u0101gir resumed on the death of the j\u0101gird\u0101r in 1895 without heirs. The District has not been surveyed. The average rate of assessment on \u2018wet\u2019 land is Rs. 12 per acre (maximum, Rs. 47; minimum, Rs. 8), and on \u2018dry\u2019 land Rs. 1\u20133\u20130 (maximum, Rs. 4; minimum, R. 0\u20136\u20130).\n\nThe land revenue and total revenue for a series of years are given below, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|        | 1881 | 1891 | 1901 | 1903 |\n|--------|------|------|------|------|\n| Land revenue | 6,08 | 7,06 | 8,02 | 6,06 |\n| Total revenue | 9,36 | 11,30 | 11,34 | 10,12 |\n\nThe ordinary one anna cess is not in force here, but an old tax known as the r\u0101sta-patti or \u2018road tax\u2019 is levied at the rate of 1 per cent. on the land revenue collected, yielding about Rs. 6,800 annually. No local boards have been established; but at the head-quarters of the t\u0101luks, as well as at Maul\u0101 Ali, Sur\u016brnagar, Golconda, and Maisaram, conservancy establishments are maintained, the cost of which is paid from the Sarf-i-kh\u0101s treasury, the general supervision being under the First T\u0101lukd\u0101r\u2019s Assistant in the irrigation branch.\n\nThe First T\u0101lukd\u0101r is the head of the police, with a Mohtamim or Superintendent as his executive deputy. Under the latter are 6 inspectors, 115 subordinate officers, 696 constables, and 25 mounted police. These are distributed among 48 police stations. In addition, 1,179 rural police are under the police p\u0101tels of the villages.\n\nThe District has no jail, prisoners being sent to the Central jail at Hyder\u0101b\u0101d. At the outlying tahsil offices, excluding Asafnagar and Ambarpet, there are small lock-ups.\n\nThe District takes a high place in the State as regards the literacy\nof its population, of whom 3.5 per cent. (6.3 males and 0.6 females) were able to read and write in 1901. There are, however, only 9 schools, of which 8 are primary schools, and one is a middle school. The number of pupils under instruction in 1881, 1891, 1901, and 1903 was 321, 461, 511, and 667 respectively. The total expenditure on education in 1901 amounted to Rs. 4,100, towards which fees contributed Rs. 484.\n\nTwo dispensaries are maintained, with accommodation for 40 in-patients. The total number of in-patients treated in 1901 was 33, and of out-patients 9,317. The operations performed numbered 280, and the total expenditure was Rs. 6,124.\n\nThe number of persons successfully vaccinated in 1901 was only 543, or 1.08 per 1,000 of population.\n\n**Atrauli Tahsil.**\u2014North-eastern tahsil of Aligarh District, United Provinces, comprising the parganas of Atrauli and Gangiri, and lying between 27\u00b0 48' and 28\u00b0 9' N. and 78\u00b0 12' and 78\u00b0 38' E., with an area of 343 square miles. The population rose from 164,073 in 1891 to 198,034 in 1901. There are 289 villages and 4 towns, the largest of which is Atrauli (population, 16,561), the tahsil head-quarters. The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was Rs. 3,77,000, and for cesses Rs. 61,000. The Ganges forms part of the northern boundary, and the Kali Nadi skirts the tahsil on the west and south. The Nim Nadi and its tributary the Chhoiya flow through the middle. Between the Ganges and Nim Nadi the soil is naturally sandy, except in the Ganges khadar, which is a rich alluvial deposit. The rest of the tahsil is a good loam tract, except where patches of usar land are found. In 1903-4 the area under cultivation was 266 square miles, of which 123 were irrigated. Irrigation is provided by the Anupshahr branch of the Upper Ganges Canal.\n\n**Atrauli Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of the tahsil of the same name, in Aligarh District, United Provinces, situated in 28\u00b0 2' N. and 78\u00b0 18' E., on a metalled road from Aligarh town. Population (1901), 16,561. The town was founded about the twelfth century, but little is known of its early history. It was a centre of local disaffection during the Mutiny. The Muhammadan inhabitants, who are chiefly descended from converted Hindus, have always had a bad reputation for turbulence; and during the rebellion the town was in the hands of the insurgents from June till September, 1857, when order was restored. The chief public buildings are the tahsil, which was once a fort, the town hall, a dispensary, and a school. Atrauli has been a municipality since 1865. During the ten years ending 1901 the income and expenditure averaged Rs. 11,000. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 17,000, chiefly derived from octroi (Rs. 13,000); and the expenditure was Rs. 17,000. The trade is largely local, and includes grain, sugar,\ncotton, cloth, and metals. There is one cotton gin, which employed 192 hands in 1903. Four schools contain 600 pupils.\n\n**Attap\u0101di Valley** ('Valley of leeches').\u2014A tract in the Walavan\u0101\u1e0d taluk of Malabar District, Madras, lying between 10\u00b0 54' and 11\u00b0 14' N. and 76\u00b0 27' and 76\u00b0 48' E. It is about 250 square miles in extent, and lies behind the ridge of the Western Gh\u0101ts which stretches from the Kundahs south-west to the P\u0101lgh\u0101t Gap. The valley contains the source of the Bhav\u0101ni river and is mainly covered with thick forests, though grain is cultivated in parts by the Irulas who inhabit it. It is very malarious for most of the year.\n\n**Attingal.**\u2014Village on the banks of the V\u0101manapuram or Attingal river, in the Chirayinkil taluk of Travancore State, Madras, on the high road from Trivandrum to Quilon, situated in 8\u00b0 40' N. and 76\u00b0 48' E. Population (1901), 3,889. It is the chief place in the Attingal proverti, the hereditary estate of the R\u0101nis of Travancore. Captain Nieuhoff, who gives almost the earliest description of it, observed in 1664 that 'the ancient race of the kings of Travancore owed its origin to Attingen.' The senior princess of the Travancore royal family is known as the Attingal M\u016btta Tampur\u0101n. The installation of the R\u0101nis takes place here, and the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 pays a state visit to the village every January.\n\n**Attock District** (*Atak*).\u2014District in the R\u0101walpindi Division of the Punjab, lying between 32\u00b0 34' and 34\u00b0 0' N. and 71\u00b0 42' and 73\u00b0 1' E., with an area of 4,022 square miles. It is bounded on the west and north-west by the Indus, which separates it from the Districts of Koh\u0101t and Pesh\u0101war in the North-West Frontier Province; and on the north-east by the Haz\u0101ra District of the same Province; while it adjoins the Punjab Districts of R\u0101walpindi on the east, Jhelum on the south-east, Sh\u0101hpur on the south, and Mi\u0101nw\u0101li on the south-west. In shape an irregular oval, its northern extremity falls into two zones, the northern comprising the fertile Chach plain, the southern a dry, sandy, and stony tract which rises to the Kal\u0101-Chitta Pah\u0101r or 'black and white range,' which separates it from the central portion. The Chach plain and the western half of the dry, sandy zone form the tahsil of Attock. The central portion consists of a wide plain, stretching across the District from east to west and also containing two distinct zones: the northern of poor and stony soil; the southern fertilized by the waters of the eastern and the western Sil, two streams which run into the Soh\u0101n river. The fertility of this zone decreases from east to west, its south-west corner comprising the wild and barren ravines round Narrara and Makhad. The Fatahjang tahsil comprises the eastern half of this central portion with the eastern half of the dry zone north of the Kal\u0101-Chitta Pah\u0101r, the western half forming the Pindi Gheb tahsil. South of the Soh\u0101n lies the high plateau of the Talagang tahsil, which rising to the Salt\nRange, here parallel to the Soh\u0101n, is scoured by the deep mountain torrents that descend from the range into that river.\n\nThe District lies entirely on Tertiary rocks, with the exception of a band of Nummulitic limestone forming the Khairi-M\u016brat ridge. The oldest of these are the Murree beds, which run as a narrow band across the northern part of the District. They are composed of red and purple clays, with grey and purplish sandstones, and are probably of miocene age. These are succeeded to the south by a great spread of lower Siw\u0101lik sandstone, which covers the greater part of the District and contains a rich mammalian fauna of pliocene age. It is overlain by the upper Siw\u0101lik conglomerates and sandstones, which occur at Makhad on the Indus and other localities. Still farther south the lower Siw\u0101lik sandstone is continuous with the similar beds of the Salt Range\u00b9.\n\nThe flora is scanty, except where there are springs or watercourses, as at Hassan Abd\u0101l; but the proportion of West Asian types is considerable, and a few species, hardly found farther eastwards, except at high altitudes, occur here at low elevation. In the actual valley of the Indus the clove pink has been observed, and on low hills Scilla and Iris are not uncommon, with the curious Boucerosia, a fleshy Asclepiad, like the South African Stapelias, the leaves of which are cooked or pickled as a relish. Timber and fruit trees are practically unknown except in gardens, or in that portion of the Salt Range which has been allotted to the newly formed District.\n\nA few urial are found in the Narrara hills, and throughout the southwest of the Pindi Gheb t\u0101hs\u012bl. Sometimes stray ones from the Salt Range are seen in Talagang. \u2018Ravine deer\u2019 (Indian gazelle) are occasionally found in the Attock t\u0101hs\u012bl. Mahseer, bachiva, and other fish are caught in the Haro, Soh\u0101n, and Indus.\n\nThe temperature differs little from that of the Punjab plains, though the Talagang plateau, lying 1,200 feet above sea-level, is cooler than the rest of the District. Among the rocks of Attock, the sandy slopes of Jand\u0101l, and the low hills of Narrara and Makhad the heat in summer is intense, hot winds prevail, and the glare of the sun, reflected by white sand and hot rocks, is terrific. The people suffer from tape-worm and guinea-worm owing to the badness of the water, but are otherwise robust and healthy. The annual rainfall varies from 17 inches at Pindi Gheb to 24 at Fatahjang, but is very uncertain.\n\nThe history of the District is practically the same as that of R\u0101wal-pindi District. Hassan Abd\u0101l, the chief relic of the Buddhist period, was one of the towns subordinate to the capital of Taxila, and under the Gakhars, Mughals,\n\n\u00b9 Wynne, \u2018Tertiary Zone and Underlying Rocks in N.-W. Punjab,\u2019 Records, Geological Survey of India, vol. x, pt. iii.\nand Sikhs the District followed the fortunes of R\u0101walpindi. The chief historical events recorded are the defeat of Anand P\u0101l near Ohind by Mahm\u016bd of Ghazni, the foundation of Attock by Akbar, and its vicissitudes in the Sikh Wars. The District was constituted in 1904, the tahsils of Attock, Pindi Gheb, and Fatahjang being transferred from R\u0101walpindi District, and that of Talagang from Jhelum.\n\nThe antiquities of the District are described in the articles on Attock Town and Hassan Abd\u0101l.\n\nThe population of the District at the last three enumerations was: (1881) 444,307, (1891) 448,420, and (1901) 464,430, dwelling in 4 towns and 614 villages. It increased by 3.6 per cent. during the last decade, every tahsil showing an increase except Talagang, while the increase in Fatahjang was only nominal. The Census of 1901 was taken during a season of drought, which had driven many of the men to migrate to the canal-irrigated tracts in the Punjab plains or to seek work on the M\u0101ri-Attock railway, then under construction. The District is divided into the four tahsils of Attock, Fatahjang, Pindi Gheb, and Talagang, the head-quarters of each being at the place from which it is named, but the head-quarters of the Attock tahsil will shortly be transferred to Campbellpore. The towns are the municipalities of Pindi Gheb and Hazro, the cantonment of Campbellpore, the head-quarters of the District, and the fort of Attock. The following table gives the chief statistics of population in 1901:\n\n| Tahsil     | Area in square miles | Number of | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|------------|----------------------|-----------|------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Attock     | 651                  | 3         | 191        | 150,550                   | 231.3                                                    | 5,969                                  |\n| Fatahjang  | 856                  | ...       | 203        | 114,849                   | 134.2                                                    | 3,666                                  |\n| Pindi Gheb | 1,498                | 1         | 134        | 109,437                   | 71.2                                                     | 3,796                                  |\n| Talagang   | 1,199                | ...       | 86         | 92,594                    | 77.2                                                     | 3,087                                  |\n| District total | 4,022            | 4         | 614        | 464,430                   | 115.5                                                    | 16,518                                 |\n\nNote.\u2014The figures for the areas of tahsils are taken from revenue returns. The total District area is that given in the Census Report.\n\nMuhammadans number 419,730, or over 90 per cent. of the total; Hindus, 37,052; and Sikhs, 6,991. The density of the population is very low. Various dialects of Western Punjabi are spoken in the District, but the Path\u0101ns of the Chach plain in the Attock tahsil and those round Makhad in the south-west corner of Pindi Gheb still speak Pasht\u016b.\n\nThe most numerous tribe is that of the agricultural Aw\u0101ns, who are\nstronger here than in any other District, numbering 151,000, or 32 per cent. of the total population. Next to them come the Path\u0101ns (38,000); the Mali\u0101rs, a tribe resembling the Arains of the Punjab proper (37,000); and the R\u0101jputs (26,000). Other important agricultural classes are the G\u016bjars (12,000), Jats (12,000), Mughals (7,000), and Khattars (6,000), the latter being practically confined to this District. Saiyids are strong, numbering 12,000. The most important commercial classes are the Khatris and Aroras, who number 24,000 and 12,000 respectively. Of the artisan classes, the Jul\u0101h\u0101s (weavers, 18,000), Mochis (shoemakers and leather-workers, 13,000), Loh\u0101rs (blacksmiths, 11,000), Tarkh\u0101ns (carpenters, 8,000), Kumh\u0101rs (potters, 8,000), and Telis (oil-pressers, 7,000) are the most important. Less important are the Musallis (sweepers and scavengers, 9,000), Nais (barbers, 8,000), and Dhobis (washermen, 6,000). Kashmiris number 7,000. Of the total population, 65 per cent. are dependent on agriculture, there being no large towns or manufactures.\n\nThere are Roman Catholic missions at Campbellpore and Attock. The District contained only 3 native Christians in 1901.\n\nIn the north of the District the low-lying Chach plain with its numerous wells is exceedingly fertile, the soil being chiefly an alluvial loam. There is also a good deal of fertile land in the villages of the Soh\u0101n and other streams. Elsewhere the District is very poor in natural resources. Wild tracts of arid mountain and rock predominate, and the soil is light and shallow, with stone near the surface, and much broken up by ravines. The District is so sparsely populated that, although it suffers periodically from drought, real famine is unknown.\n\nThe land is mostly held by communities of small peasant proprietors, but there are large zam\u012bnd\u0101r\u012b estates in the Fatahjang, Pindi Gheb, and Attock tahs\u012bls. The following table gives the main agricultural statistics in 1903\u20134, areas being in square miles:\n\n| Tahsil     | Total | Cultivated | Irrigated | Cultivable waste |\n|------------|-------|------------|-----------|------------------|\n| Attock     | 651   | 308        | 33        | 41               |\n| Fatahjang  | 866   | 391        | 11        | 65               |\n| Pindi Gheb | 1,499 | 442        | 7         | 201              |\n| Talagang   | 1,198 | 474        | 5         | 119              |\n| **Total**  | **4,214** | **1,615** | **56**    | **426**          |\n\nNote.\u2014The total area does not agree with that given in the Census Report, but is taken from a later survey.\n\nWheat, the most important product and the staple crop of the spring harvest, occupied 568 square miles in 1903\u20134; gram and oilseeds covered 132 and 125 square miles respectively; and barley only 43 square miles. The chief crop of the autumn harvest is spiked\nmillet, covering 179 square miles, while great millet occupied 35, pulses 41, and maize 32 square miles. Very little cotton or sugar-cane is grown.\n\nThe cattle are small and not of particularly good quality. The District is, however, noted for horse-breeding, especially the tahsils of Fatahjang and Pindi Gheb, where there are large estates whose holders have means to devote to breeding. The Jodhra Maliks of Pindi Gheb and Khunda and the Aw\u0101n Maliks of L\u0101wa are leading breeders. The scarcity of water and consequent absence of fodder is a difficulty, and much of the stock is sold when very young. There is a good breed of donkeys, and numbers of mules are raised. Eleven horse stallions are maintained by the Army Remount department, and four pony stallions by the District board. Large flocks of sheep and goats are kept, but the breed is generally inferior, though the fat-tailed sheep is common in the hills. Good pack-camels are bred in many parts.\n\nOf the total area cultivated in 1903\u20134, 56 square miles, or 3\u00b75 per cent., were classed as irrigated. Of this area, 40 square miles were irrigated from wells, and 15 from canals. In addition, 17 square miles of the cultivated area are subject to inundation from the Indus and other streams. The District had 6,451 masonry wells in 1903\u20134, all worked with Persian wheels by bullocks, besides 808 lever wells, unbricked wells, and water-lifts.\n\nAbout 217 square miles of \u2018reserved\u2019 and 109 of unclassed forests are under the Forest department, and 32 square miles of forest under the Deputy-Commissioner. The most important are the forests of the K\u0101l\u0101-Chitta and Khairi-M\u016brat ranges, which support a scattered growth of olive, khair (Acacia Catechu), and lesser shrubs. Other trees found are the shisham (Dalbergia Sissoo) and dhrek, but on the whole the District is poorly wooded. In 1904\u20135 the revenue from forests under the Forest department was Rs. 26,700, and from those under the Deputy-Commissioner Rs. 2,000.\n\nVeined marble is worked into pestles and ornamental objects at Garkawa in the Attock tahsil. Lignite is occasionally met with in the Khairi-M\u016brat hills, and small quantities of anthracite in the Pindi Gheb tahsil. Coal is found in the K\u0101l\u0101-Chitta range. There are five bore-holes near Fatahjang, from which petroleum is obtained for use in the Rawalpindi gas-works. Gold is washed in small quantities from the sands of the Indus, Soh\u0101n, and other rivers. Limestone and gypsum occur largely.\n\nThere are no arts or manufactures of importance. Country cloth is woven throughout the District, and silk embroidery is produced in the Attock tahsil. Lungis are made at Kamra and Shams\u0101b\u0101d. Lacquered legs for bedsteads are made in a number of villages in the Pindi Gheb tahsil; and iron vessels, locks, stirrups, saddles, shoes, and articles of reed-matting\nare turned out in various villages. Soap is made in several places and snuff at Hazro. Boat-building is carried on at Makhad on the Indus.\n\nThe District possesses very little trade; and the ordinary manufactures described above are exported only to a small extent. A good deal of tobacco and snuff, however, goes from Hazro, the chief centre of trade in the District. Food-grains and oilseeds are, in good seasons, the chief exports. Piece-goods, rice, salt, and hardware are the chief imports.\n\nThe main line of the North-Western Railway traverses the north of the District, crossing the Indus at Attock; and the Khush\u0101lgarh branch, which leaves the main line at Golra in R\u0101walpindi District, runs through the middle of the District to Khush\u0101lgarh on the Indus. The M\u0101ri-Attock branch, leaving the main line at Campbellpore, traverses the west of the District, giving direct communication with Mult\u0101n. The grand trunk road, which follows for the most part the main line of rail, the Hassan Abd\u0101l-Abbott\u0101b\u0101d road, and the R\u0101walpindi-Khush\u0101lgarh road are the only important metalled routes. The unmetalled tracks are fit only for pack animals, and travelling is difficult. The total length of metalled roads is 45 miles, and of unmetalled roads 763 miles. All the metalled and 145 miles of the unmetalled roads are under the Public Works department, and the rest under the District board. There is a good deal of traffic on the Indus below Makhad. The Indus is crossed by the Attock bridge, with a subway for wheeled traffic, by a bridge of boats (now being replaced by a permanent bridge) at Khush\u0101lgarh, and by six ferries.\n\nThe District is divided into the four tahsils of Attock, Pindi Gheb, Fatahjang, and Talagang, each of which is under a tahsild\u0101r and a naib-tahsild\u0101r. The Deputy-Commissioner holds executive charge of the District, aided by three Assistant or Extra Assistant Commissioners, one of whom is in charge of the Pindi Gheb subdivision, and another in charge of the District treasury.\n\nThe Deputy-Commissioner as District Magistrate is responsible for criminal justice. Civil judicial work is under a District Judge, and both officers are subordinate to the Divisional and Sessions Judge of the R\u0101walpindi Civil Division. There is one Mun\u1e63\u012bf, and a Cantonment Magistrate at Campbellpore. Crimes of violence against the person are rife, and in the Attock tahsil a few serious crimes against property are committed annually. In the other tahsils organized crime is uncommon; but the bitter factions into which the whole District is divided lead to violent crime, while the same cause renders detection always difficult. No man will give evidence, if he can possibly avoid doing so, against another member of the clan, except in cases in which the clan is divided against itself.\nThe history of the land revenue of the District up to its constitution in 1904 will be found in the articles on R\u0101walpindi and Jhelum Districts. The Talagang and Attock tahsils were last assessed in 1901-2 and 1901-4 respectively, the demand being 1.6 lakhs and 2 lakhs. The tahsils of Fatahjang and Pindi Gheb were last assessed with the R\u0101walpindi District in 1885, at 2.7 lakhs; but the assessment is now under revision, and the anticipated increase in the land revenue demand is Rs. 33,000. The demand for 1904-5, including cesses, was 6.4 lakhs. The collections of total revenue and of land revenue alone in 1904-5 were Rs. 8,16,000 and Rs. 5,89,000 respectively.\n\nThe District contains two municipalities, Pindi Gheb and Hazro, and one 'notified area,' Attock. Outside these, local affairs are managed by a District board, whose income, mainly derived from a local rate, amounted in 1904-5 to Rs. 65,000. The expenditure was Rs. 41,000, of which education and medical relief formed the largest items.\n\nThe regular police force consists of 442 of all ranks, including 5 cantonment and 23 municipal police. The Superintendent usually has 3 inspectors under him. Village watchmen number 583. There are 11 police stations, 3 outposts, and 3 road-posts. A District jail is being built at Campbellpore.\n\nThe District stands twentieth among the twenty-eight Districts of the Province in respect of the literacy of its population. In 1901 the proportion of literate persons was 3.6 per cent. (6.4 males and 0.4 females). The number of pupils under instruction was 4,752 in 1880-1, and 7,268 in 1904-5. In the latter year the District contained 4 secondary and 46 primary (public) schools, and 11 advanced and 250 elementary (private) schools, with 219 girls in the public and 453 in the private schools. The expenditure on education was Rs. 12,000, the greater part of which was met from District funds.\n\nThe District possesses 7 dispensaries, at which 89,105 out-patients and 1,231 in-patients were treated in 1904, and 4,275 operations were performed. The expenditure was Rs. 9,000.\n\nThe number of successful vaccinations in 1904-5 was 14,345, representing 31.1 per 1,000 of the population. The Vaccination Act is not in force in this District.\n\n[M. S. D Butler, Settlement Report of the Attock Tahsil (1905).]\n\nAttock Tahsil (Atak).\u2014Tahsil of Attock District, Punjab, lying between 33\u00b0 38' and 34\u00b0 0' N. and 72\u00b0 7' and 72\u00b0 50' E., with an area of 651 square miles. The Indus bounds it on the north-west, dividing it from the North-West Frontier Province, while the Haro flows through from east to west. The north-west corner is occupied by the fertile Chach plain. South of this lies a dry sandy plain, beyond which rises the K\u0101l\u0101-Chitta range. The eastern half consists of the tract known\nas the N\u0101l\u0101, which includes, along with a number of low hills and much broken country, a considerable area of fairly good level land, portions of which are irrigated from wells and by cuts from the Haro and other smaller streams. The population in 1901 was 150,550, compared with 141,063 in 1891. It contains the towns of Attock (population, 2,822), its present head-quarters, Hazro (9,799), the cantonment of Campbellpore (5,036), the head-quarters of the District; and 191 villages. The land revenue and cesses amounted in 1903-4 to 1.9 lakhs. Hassan Abd\u0101l is a place of historical interest.\n\nAttock Town (Atak).\u2014Fort and temporary head-quarters of the tahsil of the same name in Attock District, Punjab, situated in 33\u00b0 53' N. and 72\u00b0 15' E., on the North-Western Railway and the grand trunk road; distant by rail 1,505 miles from Calcutta, 1,541 from Bombay, and 882 from Kar\u0101chi. Population (1901), 2,822. The fort rises in three tiers to a commanding height above the Indus, just below the point where it receives the K\u0101bul river. Opposite it a whirlpool eddies between two jutting precipices of black slate, known as Kam\u0101lia and Jal\u0101lia, from the names of two Rosh\u0101nia heretics, who were flung from their summits during the reign of Akbar. The buildings of the town formerly stood within the fort, but have been removed to a site on one side of it. The fort, which commands the passage of the Indus, is garrisoned by two companies of garrison artillery and a detachment of infantry.\n\nAlexander is supposed to have crossed the Indus by a bridge of boats at Ohind, 16 miles above Attock. The fort was built by Akbar in 1581, to protect his empire against the inroads of his brother, Hak\u012bm Mirza, governor of K\u0101bul; and he named it Atak-Ban\u0101ras in contrast to Katak-Ban\u0101ras, the fort which lay in the south-east corner of his empire. Another story goes that Akbar, finding the Indus impassable, named the fortress Atak, 'the obstacle,' and that when he effected a crossing he founded Khair\u0101b\u0101d, 'the abode of safety,' on the western bank of the river. In 1812 Ranjit Singh surprised the fort, which was in the possession of the Wazir of K\u0101bul. In the first Sikh War it was taken by the British, but lost in the second despite a long and gallant defence by Lieutenant Herbert. It returned to British occupation at the end of the second Sikh War. The road and railway bridge over the Indus were completed in 1883. Attock is administered as a 'notified area.' The income and expenditure of cantonment funds during the ten years ending 1902-3 averaged Rs. 249 and Rs. 216 respectively.\n\nAt\u016br T\u0101luk.\u2014T\u0101luk of Salem District, Madras, lying between 11\u00b0 19' and 11\u00b0 53' N. and 78\u00b0 16' and 78\u00b0 51' E., with an area of 841 square miles. The western part is broken by numerous rocks and hills; but the east forms a wide undulating plain, separated by the valleys of the Vasishtanad\u012b and Swetanad\u012b rivers from the mountain\nranges of the Tenandamalai and Kalr\u0101yans on the north and the Kollaimalais and Pachaimalais on the south. The valley irrigated by these rivers is a rich tract of country, and the luxuriant groves of areca palms are a striking feature of the river banks. The population in 1901 was 199,475, compared with 183,209 in 1891. There are 173 villages, and only one town, At\u016br (population, 9,673), the headquarters. The demand for land revenue and cesses in 1903-4 amounted to Rs. 3,17,000.\n\nAt\u016br Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the taluk of the same name in Salem District, Madras, situated in 11\u00b0 35' N. and 78\u00b0 37' E., on the river Vasishtanadi, about 3 miles from the foot of the Kalr\u0101yani Hills. Population (1901), 9,673. North of the town stands the old fort, where the famous eighteenth-century chieftain Ghetti Mudaliy\u0101r is said to have lived in royal state, and where subsequently British troops were in garrison. As commanding the pass from Salem to Ty\u0101ga Drug, this post was of importance in the wars with Haidar Ali. It was captured by the British in 1768, after the surrender of Salem; and during the war with Tip\u016b was again occupied by British troops. Indigo is manufactured, and the place is also known for the carts made here.\n\nAugar.\u2014British cantonment in Gwalior State, Central India. See Agar.\n\nAundh.\u2014Native State in the S\u0101t\u0101ra Political Agency, Bombay. See S\u0101t\u0101ra Agency.\n\nAuni\u0101ti.\u2014Village in Sibs\u0101gar District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, situated in 26\u00b0 53' N. and 94\u00b0 5' E., on the right bank of the Brahmaputra in the Majuli island. It contains the principal Vaishnavite sattra, or priestly college, in Assam, and its Gosain, or head priest, exercises great influence over the Assamese. The Gosains have always been distinguished by their loyalty to Government, and render a real service to the administration by encouraging purity of life and obedience to the authorities. The sattra is said to have been founded in the sixteenth century, and is supported by the offerings of its numerous disciples and by grants of revenue-free land made by the Ahom Rajas and confirmed by the British Government, which cover in all nearly 22,000 acres. The college consists of a large prayer hall, surrounded by lines of barracks inhabited by celibate monks, and contains a printing press. None of the buildings is of masonry.\n\nAur\u0101d.\u2014Former taluk of B\u012bdar District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State. See K\u0101r\u0101mung\u012b.\n\nAuraiy\u0101 Tahsil.\u2014Tahsil of Et\u0101wah District, United Provinces, conterminous with the pargana of the same name, lying between 26\u00b0 22' and 26\u00b0 41' N. and 79\u00b0 3' and 79\u00b0 39' E., with an area of 416 square miles. Population increased from 172,097 in 1891 to 193,333 in 1901. There are 408 villages and two towns: Phaph\u016bnd (population, 7,605)\nand Auraiy\u0101 (7,393), the tahsil head-quarters. The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was Rs. 3,31,000, and for cesses Rs. 53,000. The density of population, 465 persons per square mile, is a little below the District average. The tahsil is divided into four tracts by the rivers Sengar, Jumna, and Chambal. Most of it is included in the gh\u0101r, an area lying between the Sengar and Jumna. This has a light sandy soil, which is, however, fertile where irrigated, and it is crossed by the Bhognipur branch of the Lower Ganges Canal. North of the Sengar the land is richer and is irrigated chiefly from wells. The high land bordering on the Jumna is intersected by ravines and is generally barren, while south of the Jumna the soil is poor and gravelly, except near the rivers, where some good alluvial land is found. In 1903-4 the area under cultivation was 238 square miles, of which 82 were irrigated, almost entirely from canals.\n\nAuraiy\u0101 Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the tahsil of the same name in Etawah District, United Provinces, situated in 26\u00b0 28' N. and 79\u00b0 31' E., 42 miles from Etawah town. It lies on the old imperial road from Agra to Allahabad, at the point where this is crossed by the metalled road from Jalaun to Debiapur-Phaphund station on the East Indian Railway. Population (1901), 7,393. The town is said to have been founded early in the sixteenth century, and contains some Hindu temples dating from a little later, and two mosques built by a Rohilla governor in the eighteenth century. It also possesses some good sarais, a fine market-place called Humeganj, after a former Collector, and a dispensary. It is administered under Act XX of 1856, with an income of about Rs. 2,500. Trade is increasing, especially with Gwalior and Jalaun, and the bazar has recently been extended towards the south. There is one cotton gin, employing 200 hands in 1903, and a second was completed at the end of that year. The town school has about 200 pupils, and an aided primary school 25.\n\nAurang\u0101b\u0101d Division.\u2014North-western Division of the State of Hyder\u0101b\u0101d, lying between 18\u00b0 28' and 20\u00b0 40' N., and 74\u00b0 40' and 78\u00b0 6' E. The head-quarters of the S\u016bbahd\u0101r (Commissioner) are at Aurang\u0101b\u0101d city. The total population of the Division increased from 2,610,247 in 1881 to 2,909,561 in 1891, but decreased to 2,363,114 in 1901, owing to the drought and famine in the two preceding years. The total area is 19,071 square miles; and the density is 124 persons per square mile, compared with 135 for the whole State, this Division being the third largest in area and the fourth in population. In 1901 the population consisted of 89 per cent. Hindus, 10 per cent. Musalm\u0101ns, 2,846 Christians (of whom 2,613 were natives), 12,477 Jains, 256 P\u0101rs\u012bs, 2,563 Sikhs, and 9,380 Animists.\n\nThe number of towns in the Division is 20, or about one-quarter of the total number in the Dominions, and there are 5,490 villages.\nThe largest towns are Aurang\u0101b\u0101d City (population, 36,836 with cantonment) and Jalna (20,270 with cantonment). The chief places of commercial importance are Aurang\u0101b\u0101d, Jalna, K\u0101dir\u0101b\u0101d, N\u0101nder, Bh\u012br, Amba, and Parli. Aurang\u0101b\u0101d is notable as having been the head-quarters of Aurangzeb when he was viceroy of the Deccan. His tomb is at Khuld\u0101b\u0101d (Rauza), whither his body was conveyed after his death at Ahmadnagar in 1707. Khuld\u0101b\u0101d also contains the tombs of Malik Ambar, the famous minister of the Niz\u0101m Sh\u0101hi kings of Ahmadnagar, and of Abul Hasan (T\u0101na Sh\u0101h), the last of the Kutb Sh\u0101hi house, who was made prisoner by Aurangzeb in 1687.\n\nThe territorial changes made in 1905 materially affected two Districts in this Division, Parbhani and N\u0101nder. The following table shows the revised area, population, and land revenue of the four Districts now comprising the Division:\n\n| District     | Area in square miles | Population, 1901 | Land revenue and cesses, 1901, in thousands of rupees |\n|--------------|----------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| Aurang\u0101b\u0101d   | 6,172                | 721,407          | 24,16                                                  |\n| Parbhani     | 5,433                | 696,765          | 23,42                                                  |\n| N\u0101nder       | 3,612                | 550,148          | 15,84                                                  |\n| Bh\u012br         | 4,460                | 492,258          | 15,37                                                  |\n| **Total**    | **19,677**           | **2,460,578**    | **78,79**                                              |\n\nAurang\u0101b\u0101d District.\u2014District in the extreme north-west of the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, lying between 19\u00b0 18' and 20\u00b0 40' N. and 74\u00b0 40' and 76\u00b0 40' E., with an area of 6,172 square miles. It is bounded on the north, west, and south by the Bombay Districts of Kh\u0101ndesh, N\u0101sik, and Ahmadnagar, and by the Bh\u012br District of Hyder\u0101b\u0101d; and on the east by the Buld\u0101na District of Ber\u0101r and the Parbhani District of Hyder\u0101b\u0101d. Aurang\u0101b\u0101d may be divided into the B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t or \u2018uplands\u2019 to the north, and the P\u0101y\u0101ngh\u0101t or \u2018lowlands\u2019 to the south, the latter terminating in the valley of the God\u0101v\u0101ri. The northern hills are a continuation of the B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t of Ber\u0101r, and are named S\u0101t\u0101ra, Ajanta, Kannad, &c., after villages in their proximity. The Mah\u0101deo range, a continuation of the S\u0101t\u0101ras, is 2,772 feet above the sea. All the hills in the District have a terrace-like appearance with flattened summits. One range, about 2,400 feet high, extends from Kh\u0101n\u0101pur to Jalna, passing through Aurang\u0101b\u0101d and Daulat\u0101b\u0101d, being 3,022 feet high near the latter. The Sarpan\u0101th hill in the Baiamah\u0101l range is 3,517 feet above the sea. The Gaot\u0101l\u0101 hills, also known as the Ajanta and S\u0101tm\u0101l\u0101, form the northern limits of the plateau, running east and west for 70 miles.\n\nThe most important river is the God\u0101v\u0101ri, which forms the southern\nboundary for about 127 miles, separating the District from Ahmadnagar and Bh\u012br. Its principal tributaries are the Sina rising in the Kannad hills, the Dhenda rising near Daulat\u0101b\u0101d, and the Dudna flowing from the hills east of Aurang\u0101b\u0101d. The general slope of the country is towards the south and south-east.\n\nThe District is situated within the Deccan trap area. In the valley of the God\u0101v\u0101ri and some of its tributaries the trap is overlaid by gravels and clay beds of upper pliocene or pleistocene age, containing fossil bones of extinct mammalia. The famous caves of Ajanta and Ellora have been carved out of the basalt beds of the Deccan trap.\n\nJungles of the larger vegetation clothe the slopes of the hills surrounding the B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t and the ravines of streams issuing from the highlands. The gorges of the Ajanta and Gaot\u0101l\u0101 gh\u0101ts are well wooded.\n\nThe animals found in the District include antelope, wild hog, bears, wild dogs, and wolves, and occasionally tigers and leopards.\n\nThe climate is generally healthy, but during the rains and part of the cold season it is malarious. The B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t is dry and healthy, its mean temperature for the whole year being 80\u00b0. The pleasantest spot in the District is Rauza or Khuld\u0101b\u0101d, on the hills south-east of the caves of Ellora, where the temperature in the height of the hot season does not exceed 82\u00b0.\n\nThe rainfall during the twenty-one years ending 1901 averaged 25 inches. The District suffered severely from scanty rainfall (12 inches) and famine during 1899-1900.\n\nThe District is of great importance in the early history of the Deccan. Long before the Christian era Paithan was probably an important place. From Ptolemy's account of India it appears that Paithan was the capital of Pulum\u0101yi II, the Andhra king (A.D. 138-170), whose rule extended across the peninsula. With the decay of the Andhra power in the third century a period commences of which nothing is known, but the country must have fallen under the sway of the Ch\u0101lukyas three hundred years later, and was ruled by them for a long period. In the seventh century Hiuen Tsiang visited the caves of Ajanta, Pulikesin II being king at the time. About 760 the Ch\u0101lukyas were conquered by the R\u0101shtrak\u016btas, one of whose rulers, Krishna I, constructed the wonderful rock-cut temple of Kail\u0101s at Ellora. In 973 the R\u0101shtrak\u016btas were overthrown and Ch\u0101lukya power was restored, but not to its former glories. Among the feudatories of the Ch\u0101lukyas were the Y\u0101davas, or perhaps more correctly the Seunas. A long list of chiefs has been collected, commencing from the early part of the ninth century; but the first independent ruler was Bhillama I, who established himself about 1187 in the country between Daulat\u0101b\u0101d and N\u0101sik, with his capital at the former place, then known\nas Deogiri. He died fighting the Hoysala ruler of Mysore in 1191; but his grandson Singhana extended the kingdom from Kh\u00e2ndesh on the north to Mysore on the south, so that it practically included the whole of the Western Ch\u0101lukyan dominions. Singhana also invaded Gujar\u0101t, and claims to have conquered practically the whole of India. In 1294, however, Al\u0101-ud-d\u012bn invaded the Deccan and defeated R\u0101mchandra, the last of the independent Y\u0101davas, close to his capital, securing an enormous booty and the promise of tribute. Owing to default in the payment of the latter, Malik K\u0101f\u016br was dispatched to invade the Deccan again in 1307, and R\u0101mchandra yielded without a struggle. The default of his son and successor led to further expeditions, and in 1318 Harp\u0101l, the last ruler, was flayed alive, and the Y\u0101dava power was finally extinguished. From 1347 the District formed part of the Bahmani kingdom, and in 1499 it was included in Ahmadnagar. In 1600 the Mughals under prince D\u0101niy\u0101l captured Ahmadnagar after the murder of Ch\u0101nd Bibi. Malik Ambar, the Ahmadnagar minister, fought several battles with the Mughals, and in 1610 founded Kharki, the present Aurang\u0101b\u0101d, which he made his capital. After his death in 1626, Ahmadnagar and Aurang\u0101b\u0101d were annexed to the Mughal empire, but the District was separated from it on the foundation of the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State in the beginning of the eighteenth century.\n\nThe most important cave-temples in India are found in the neighbourhood of Ellora, Aurang\u0101b\u0101d, and Ajanta, belonging to the Buddhist, Jain, and Br\u0101hmanical styles of architecture. Those at Ajanta number 29 and contain exquisite paintings, while 11 miles west of Ajanta are the two Ghatotkach caves. North of the city of Aurang\u0101b\u0101d are twelve Buddhist caves. The Ellora series contain some of the largest and most elaborately carved caves, dating from the second century B.C. to the eighth century A.D. The great fort at Daulat\u0101b\u0101d is a remarkable building. Aurang\u0101b\u0101d, Daulat\u0101b\u0101d, and J\u0101lna contain numerous Muhammadan buildings, but none of great importance. The village of Khuld\u0101r\u0101d is marked by the tombs of several historical persons, including the emperor Aurangzeb and Asaf Jah, the founder of the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State.\n\nThe number of towns and villages is 1,831. The population at each Census in the last twenty years was as follows:\u2014(1881) 730,380, (1891) 828,975, and (1901) 721,407. The great famine of 1899\u20131900 is responsible for the decrease of population in the last decade. The District is divided into the ten t\u0101luks of Aurang\u0101b\u0101d, Ambarh, J\u0101lna, Kannad, Bhokardan, Paithan, Gang\u0101pur, Vaij\u0101pur, Sillod, and Khuld\u0101r\u0101d, the last two being sarf-i-kh\u0101s or \u2018crown\u2019 t\u0101luks. The towns are Aurang\u0101b\u0101d, J\u0101lna, K\u0101dir\u0101b\u0101d, Paithan, and Vaij\u0101pur. Nearly 85 per cent. of the population are Hindus and more than 12 per cent. Musalm\u0101ns. About\n79 per cent. of the people speak Mar\u0101th\u012b. The following table shows the distribution of population in 1901:\n\n| Taluk          | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of population variation between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|----------------|----------------------|-----------------|----------|------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Aurang\u0101b\u0101d     | 563                  | 1               | 204      | 99,007     | 175                         | - 8.0                                                  | Not available                           |\n| Sillod         | 216                  | ...             | 46       | 26,966     | 125                         | - 16.0                                                 |                                        |\n| Bhokardan      | 425                  | ...             | 142      | 37,311     | 88                          | - 36.0                                                 |                                        |\n| J\u0101lna          | 618                  | 2               | 167      | 86,750     | 140                         | - 13.0                                                 |                                        |\n| Ambarh         | 866                  | ...             | 218      | 97,271     | 112                         | - 13.0                                                 |                                        |\n| Paithan        | 380                  | 1               | 130      | 52,552     | 138                         | - 0.1                                                  |                                        |\n| Gang\u0101pur       | 453                  | ...             | 175      | 46,959     | 103                         | - 14.0                                                 |                                        |\n| Vaij\u0101pur       | 519                  | 1               | 113      | 43,757     | 84                          | + 2.0                                                  |                                        |\n| Kannad         | 541                  | ...             | 168      | 59,190     | 109                         | + 7.2                                                  |                                        |\n| Khuld\u0101b\u0101d      | 97                   | ...             | 29       | 10,115     | 104                         | - 11.3                                                 |                                        |\n| Jagirs, &c.    | 1,494                | 1               | 433      | 161,529    | 108                         | - 9.6                                                  |                                        |\n| Total          | 6,172                | 6               | 1,825    | 721,407    | 116                         | - 12.9                                                 | 23,171                                 |\n\nIn 1905 a few small transfers were made, by which the area and population of individual taluks have been changed.\n\nThe agricultural castes include the Mar\u0101th\u0101 Kunbis, 257,000, and also Sindes, 15,900; Banj\u0101r\u0101s, 8,900; Kolis, 7,000; and Mar\u0101th\u0101 Holkars, 5,800. The M\u0101lis or gardeners number 18,600. The Mah\u0101rs (village menials) and M\u0101ngs (leather-workers) number 66,800 and 21,500; Dhangars or shepherds, 31,000; Br\u0101hmans, 28,000. V\u0101nis, 4,600, and M\u0101rw\u0101ris, 7,800, are the principal trading castes. About 46 per cent. of the population depend on agriculture.\n\nThe District contained 2,673 Christians in 1901, of whom 2,512 were natives.\n\nThe soils are of three kinds: the regar or black cotton soil, the masab or reddish, and the milwa, a mixture of the other two. Regar is derived from trap, and the sandy or reddish soils from granitic rock. The regar constitutes over 55 per cent. of the total cultivable area, and is very fertile, as also are the soils found at the foot of the hills.\n\nKh\u0101lsa land measured 4,678 square miles in 1901, of which 3,727 were cultivated, 82 were occupied by cultivable waste and fallows, 392 by forests, and 477 were not available for cultivation. The cultivated area in 1903 was 3,732 square miles. Jow\u0101r, bajra, and wheat are the chief food-crops, covering an area of 991, 535, and 258 square miles respectively. Pulses and rice are next in importance, with areas of 497 and 19 square miles. Cotton and oilseeds are largely grown, occupying 384 and 409 square miles respectively. Sugar-cane is grown on about 9 square miles.\nThe cattle are of the ordinary Deccani breed, being small, hardy, and active, and well adapted for agricultural operations. The valley of the God\u0101vari was once famous for its breed of horses, noted for their hardiness and powers of endurance, and said to be the offspring of Arab sires; but the stock is now inferior. The State maintains Arab stallions at Aurang\u0101b\u0101d and Ambarh for improving the breed. The sheep are of the usual black breed. There are two varieties of goats: the Gujar\u0101t short-legged breed, with erect ears, which are good milkers; and the shaggy long-legged breed, with drooping ears.\n\nThe irrigated area in 1901 was 134 square miles, entirely supplied from wells, of which 19,778 are in working order. There are a few small tanks, but they are used only for drinking purposes.\n\nThe forest area is small, comprising only 123 square miles of 'reserved,' and 69 and 200 square miles of protected and unprotected forests respectively. Teak (*Tectona grandis*) is the predominant species among the timber trees, while the *s\u0101dora* (*Terminalia tomentosa*), *dhimora* (*Anogeissus latifolia*), and *m\u0101lanjar* (*Hardwickia binata*) are fairly plentiful. A considerable portion of the forests contains only brushwood and small trees used for fuel, which is given free of charge to the cultivators.\n\nVery few minerals of economic value are met with; those found are jaspers, agate, carnelian, chalcedony, heliotrope, and rock crystals, both white and amethystine. *Kankar* or nodular limestone, basalt, and granite occur all over the country, and are utilized for building purposes.\n\n**Aurang\u0101b\u0101d City** is noted for its silver ware and embroidery, as well as for silver and gold lace and cloth (*kamkhw\u0101b*), and other silk cloths known as *himr\u016b* and *mashr\u016b*, which are largely produced. Valuable silk and cotton *s\u0101ris* and other silk fabrics are made at **Paithan** and **J\u0101lna**.\n\nPaper of several descriptions is manufactured at K\u0101ghazipura, near Daulat\u0101b\u0101d. Saltpetre is produced in small quantities from saline earth gathered near villages and old walls. In 1889 a cotton-spinning and weaving-mill was erected in Aurang\u0101b\u0101d city, which employs 700 hands daily. Since the opening of the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d-God\u0101vari Valley Railway in 1900 several ginning factories have been started. In the J\u0101lna *t\u0101luk* alone there are 9 cotton-ginning factories and 5 cotton-presses, besides two ginning factories at Aurang\u0101b\u0101d and Kannad, and one oil-press at Aurang\u0101b\u0101d. The total number of hands employed in the cotton-presses and ginning factories in 1901 was 1,016.\n\nThe chief exports consist of cotton, food-grains, oilseeds, dyes, livestock, silk stuff, cloth, hides, tobacco, jaggery (raw sugar), *g\u012bh*, paper, silver ware, copper and brass vessels; the principal imports are food-grains, chiefly rice, salt, opium, cloth, English piece-goods, yarn, sugar,\nkerosene oil, fruit, raw silk, spices, copper and brass vessels, iron, silver and gold, jewels, paper, hardware, and sulphur. The principal trade centres are Aurang\u0101b\u0101d city, J\u0101lna (Pett K\u0101dir\u0101b\u0101d) and Paithan. The V\u0101n\u012bs, Bohr\u0101s, Bh\u0101tias, and Memons from Bombay are the chief traders. Internal trade is carried on by means of weekly markets, held at eighty places in different parts of the District.\n\nThe Hyder\u0101b\u0101d-God\u0101vari Valley Railway traverses Aurang\u0101b\u0101d from west to east, for 110 miles, with eleven railway stations within the District.\n\nThe total length of main roads is 392 miles, of which 154 are metalled. The District is also well supplied with numerous fair-weather roads leading to the head-quarters of t\u0101luks, their length being 454 miles, making a total of 846 miles of metalled and fair-weather roads and cart tracks. There are several gh\u0101ts or mountain passes, the chief being those of Ajanta, Upli near Daulat\u0101b\u0101d, and Ellora.\n\nFrom the second quarter of the nineteenth century up to 1872, there were six years of distress and famine in the District, attended by much loss of cattle. In 1876 the rains failed almost completely, the fall in the previous year also having been deficient. In 1878 the kharif crop was damaged by excessive rain, and the rabi crops suffered from rats. In 1897 the number of persons relieved was 267,318, costing Rs. 68,000. The ryots had not recovered from the effects of the distress of 1897 when the great famine of 1899\u20131900 took place. Owing to the scanty rainfall of 1899 and 1900 (12 and 19 inches), both the kharif and rabi crops of these two years failed, and severe distress was felt in all parts. While the famine was raging, cholera supervened and carried off thousands. The District lost 76,000 agricultural and 74,000 non-agricultural cattle, or 38 and 37 per cent. respectively of the total. The total number of units relieved was 19 millions, and the highest attendance in famine camps in one day was about 58,000, the total cost to the State amounting to 17.4 lakhs.\n\nThere are three subdivisions, the first consisting of the t\u0101luks of J\u0101lna, Sillod, Ambarh, and Bhokardan; the second, of Vaij\u0101pur, Gang\u0101pur, Paithan, and Kannad; and the third, of Aurang\u0101b\u0101d and Khuld\u0101b\u0101d. The first two subdivisions are each under a Second T\u0101lukd\u0101r and the third under a Third T\u0101lukd\u0101r, each of the ten t\u0101luks being under a tahsild\u0101r.\n\nThe First T\u0101lukd\u0101r is the chief magistrate, and the N\u0101zim-i-Diw\u0101ni or District Civil Judge is also a joint magistrate, who exercises magisterial powers in the absence of the First T\u0101lukd\u0101r from head-quarters. There are three Munsifs\u2019 courts\u2014at Aurang\u0101b\u0101d, J\u0101lna, and Gang\u0101pur. The Second and Third T\u0101lukd\u0101rs exercise second-class, and the tahsild\u0101rs third-class criminal powers. The N\u0101zim-i-S\u016bbah, or the Judge of the Division, one of the puisne judges of the High Court, holds his court at\nAurang\u0101b\u0101d. Serious crime is not heavy in ordinary years, but has shown a tendency to increase in seasons of scarcity. The Bhils gave much trouble during and immediately after the famine of 1900.\n\nAuthentic records of the revenue history of the district exist from the time of Malik Ambar early in the seventeenth century, who had the whole country surveyed, and fixed the revenue according to the productiveness of the soil in each tract. Prior to 1866, the villages were farmed out, the revenue contractors being allowed 10 per cent. for collection; but on the introduction of administration by Districts in 1866, T\u0101lukd\u0101rs and tahsild\u0101rs were regularly appointed, and the ryotw\u0101ri system with cash payments was introduced. The revenue survey was started in 1876 and completed in 1882, the assessments being fixed for thirty years. The survey showed that the area of holdings was larger by 18 per cent. than that shown in the accounts. The average assessment on \u2018dry\u2019 land is Rs. 1\u201314 (maximum, Rs. 2\u20136; minimum, R. 1), and on \u2018wet\u2019 land Rs. 5 (maximum, Rs. 6; minimum, Rs. 4).\n\nThe land revenue and the total revenue for a series of years are shown below, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1881 | 1891 | 1901 | 1903 |\n|----------------|------|------|------|------|\n| Land revenue   | 16.70| 20.91| 22.61| 22.63|\n| Total revenue  | 18.17| 23.15| 38.70| 25.25|\n\nBoth Aurang\u0101b\u0101d city and the adjoining cantonment are administered as municipalities. The District board, in addition to its own work, manages the city municipality, and also supervises the working of the t\u0101luk boards, and is presided over by the First T\u0101lukd\u0101r. The cantonment municipality is managed by the cantonment authorities. For each of the t\u0101luks, except Aurang\u0101b\u0101d, there is a t\u0101luk board and a small municipal establishment. The principal source of income is the one anna cess, which yielded 1.5 lakhs in 1901, while the total expenditure was 1.8 lakhs, including local works as well as municipal expenditure.\n\nThe First T\u0101lukd\u0101r is the head of the District police, with a Superintendent (Mohtamim) as his executive deputy. Under the latter are 12 inspectors, a frontier assistant, 79 subordinate officers, 738 constables, and 34 mounted police. These are distributed among 37 police stations and 42 outposts (th\u0101nas and chaukis), and also guard the District and t\u0101luk treasuries. Rural police are appointed at the rate of one man to every fifty houses in the villages, and are under the police p\u0101tel and subordinate to the jemadar of the nearest police station.\n\nThere is a Central jail at Aurang\u0101b\u0101d, with accommodation for 2,000 prisoners. It receives convicts sentenced to more than six months, imprisonment from Bh\u012br, Parbhani, and N\u0101nder. Carpets, rugs, cotton\ntweeds and other kinds of cloth, as well as boots, harness, and belts, are made here.\n\nAurang\u0101b\u0101d District takes a comparatively high position as regards the literacy of its population, of whom 3.2 per cent. (6 males and 0.3 females) could read and write in 1901. The total number of pupils under instruction in 1881, 1891, 1901, and 1903 was 1,087, 3,926, 5,648, and 5,954 respectively, including 214 girls in the last year. In 1903 there were 92 primary and 4 middle schools, one high and one industrial or art school, and one college. Of these institutions 11 were private and the remainder State. The total expenditure on education in 1901 was Rs. 44,100, of which Rs. 27,300 was contributed by the State and Rs. 16,800 by Local boards. The fee receipts amounted to Rs. 3,100.\n\nIn 1901 the District contained six dispensaries, including one y\u016bn\u012bni institution, having accommodation for 37 in-patients. The number of out-patients treated in 1901 was 45,827, and of in-patients 242. The operations performed numbered 1,503. The expenditure amounted to Rs. 22,400, of which Rs. 3,800 was contributed from Local funds.\n\nThe number of persons vaccinated in 1901 was only 2,873, or about 4 per 1,000 of the population.\n\n[J. Fardunji, Notes on the Aurang\u0101b\u0101d Agriculturist.]\n\nAurang\u0101b\u0101d T\u0101luk.\u2014Central t\u0101luk of Aurang\u0101b\u0101d District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, with an area, including j\u0101girs, of 786 square miles. The population in 1901 was 121,121, compared with 131,582 in 1891, the decrease being due to the famines of 1897 and 1899\u20131900. The t\u0101luk contains one town, Aurang\u0101b\u0101d City (population, 36,837), the headquarters of the Division, District, and t\u0101luk; and 270 villages, of which 66 are j\u0101gir. The land revenue in 1901 was 2.6 lakhs. The t\u0101luk is hilly in the north, and is composed of black cotton soil. The paig\u0101h t\u0101luk of L\u0101ds\u0101ngvi, with 7 villages and a population of 2,230, lies to the north-east of this t\u0101luk, and has an area of about 19 square miles.\n\nAurang\u0101b\u0101d City.\u2014Head-quarters of the Division, District, and t\u0101luk of the same name in Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, situated in 19\u00b0 53' N. and 75\u00b0 20' E., on the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d-God\u0101vari Valley Railway, near the eastern bank of the river Kaum. In point of historical interest and size it is the second city in the State, and its population at the last three enumerations was as follows: (1881) 30,219, (1891) 33,887, and (1901), 36,837, including cantonments. In 1610 Malik Ambar, minister of the Niz\u0101m Sh\u0101hi kings of Ahmadnagar, founded the city near the village of Kharki, and called it Fatehnagar. The Mughals and the Niz\u0101m Sh\u0101hi troops under Malik Ambar were constantly at war during the early part of the seventeenth century. After the death of Malik Ambar in 1626, the power of the Ahmadnagar rulers declined, and in 1637 their territories were incorporated in the Deccan S\u016bbah.\nof the Mughal empire. Aurangzeb was appointed viceroy of the Deccan in 1635, and again in 1653, and during his residence at Kharki changed its name to Aurang\u0101b\u0101d. It was from here that he directed his earlier campaigns against the Mar\u0101th\u0101s and the Bij\u0101pur and Golconda kingdoms. In 1658 he dethroned and imprisoned his father, Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n. A few years later he undertook the subjugation of the Muhammadan kingdoms of the Deccan, and commenced his wars with the Mar\u0101th\u0101s, in which he was almost continuously engaged until his death, at Ahmadnagar, in 1707. Bij\u0101pur fell in 1686, and Golconda, the Kutb Sh\u0101hi capital, in 1687, these victories being followed by the annexation of the two kingdoms. During the confusion and internal dissension which followed the death of Aurangzeb, Asaf Jah, the first Niz\u0101m, came to Aurang\u0101b\u0101d, and having declared his independence, subsequently made Hyder\u0101b\u0101d his capital.\n\nThe city is bounded on the north and south by the Sichel and S\u0101t\u0101ra ranges. During the reign of Aurangzeb its population is said to have been not less than 200,000, and the ruins still existing bear testimony to its former populousness. The modern city is situated to the east of Old Aurang\u0101b\u0101d, while the cantonment lies to the west, across the Kaum river. The garrison consists of two regiments of native infantry, and one of native cavalry, four squadrons strong, under the command of British officers.\n\nIn 1853 Aurang\u0101b\u0101d was the scene of a sharp conflict between the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d Contingent and a body of Arabs, who were defeated. In the eventful year 1857 some of the troops showed a spirit of disaffection, and an attack was meditated upon the cantonment. The authorities at Hyder\u0101b\u0101d had been apprised of this, and troops from Poona were ordered to march to Aurang\u0101b\u0101d. When the Poona troops arrived under General Woodburn, the disaffected cavalry were summoned to a dismounted parade. On the names of the ringleaders being called out, a jemad\u0101r ordered his men to load their carbines. A scene of wild confusion ensued, and some of the troops profiting by it mounted their horses and fled, and, though pursued by the 14th Dragoons from Poona, they escaped. Two-thirds of the regiment remained loyal; a court martial was held and twenty-one of the condemned were shot, while three were blown away from guns.\n\nAt Aurang\u0101b\u0101d the S\u016bbahd\u0101r (Commissioner), the Nazim-i-S\u016bbah (Divisional Judge), the First T\u0101lukd\u0101r, and other officers hold their courts. The public buildings include a large Central jail, a college, an industrial school, and several smaller schools. The city is an important centre of trade; and silk, gold and silver cloth, and lace of a superior quality are manufactured here and largely exported. A spinning and weaving-mill gives employment to 700 persons, besides an oil-press. The city has suffered severely from plague and from\nthe famines of 1897 and 1900; and but for the opening of the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d-God\u0101vari Valley Railway, the country around would have been depopulated. The increase of population in 1901 is due to the immigration of famine-stricken people from the neighbouring villages. A system of water-supply was introduced by Malik Ambar, and completed by Aurangzeb; and though it has largely fallen into decay, it still yields sufficient water to supply the needs of the people. A new system of water-works was opened in 1892, to supply filtered water to the cantonment.\n\nMany places of interest are situated in the city and its suburbs, among which may be mentioned the makbara or tomb of Aurangzeb's wife, the J\u0101ma Masjid built by Malik Ambar, the ancient palace of the Niz\u0101m near Borapal, and the Kila Ark or citadel, which was Aurangzeb's palace. About 2 miles north of the city are the Aurang\u0101b\u0101d caves, 12 in number. These are of Buddhist origin, and are among the latest known, while they present especially interesting features.\n\n[Archaeological Survey Reports of Western India, vol. iii.]\n\nAurang\u0101b\u0101d Subdivision.\u2014Western subdivision of Gay\u0101 District, Bengal, lying between 24\u00b0 29' and 25\u00b0 7' N. and 84\u00b0 6' and 84\u00b0 44' E., with an area of 1,246 square miles. The north of the subdivision is a level alluvial tract, but the south is undulating and contains numerous hills, the outliers of the Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur plateau. The population in 1901 was 467,675, compared with 472,507 in 1891. The density is 375 persons per square mile, being highest in the north-west where the soil is irrigated by the Son Canals system. It contains two towns, Aurang\u0101b\u0101d (population, 4,685), the head-quarters, and Daudnagar (9,744); and 2,042 villages. Deo, the seat of the Deo family, contains a fine stone-built temple; some other interesting antiquities are referred to in the article on Gay\u0101 District.\n\nAurang\u0101b\u0101d Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the subdivision of the same name in Gay\u0101 District, Bengal, situated in 24\u00b0 45' N. and 84\u00b0 23' E., on the grand trunk road. Population (1901), 4,685. The town contains the usual public offices; the sub-jail has accommodation for fifteen prisoners. The trade consists chiefly of food-grains, oilseeds, leather, and piece-goods.\n\nAurang\u0101b\u0101d Saiyid.\u2014Town in Bulandshahr District, United Provinces, situated in 28\u00b0 22' N. and 78\u00b0 5' E., 9 miles north-east of Bulandshahr town. Population (1901), 5,916. It was founded in 1704 by Saiyid Abdul Az\u012bz, who undertook, with the permission of the emperor Aurangzeb, to eject the turbulent Jaroliy\u0101s of the neighbourhood. His descendants still own the town. The site is low and surrounded by water during the rains. Aurang\u0101b\u0101d is administered under Act XX of 1856, with an income of Rs. 2,000. Trade is entirely local. There is a primary school with 50 pupils.\nAusa.\u2014Taluk and town of Osm\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State. See Owsa.\n\nAva (Burmese, Inwa).\u2014The old capital of Burma, in the Tada-u township of Sagaing District, Upper Burma, situated in $21^\\circ 51' N.$ and $96^\\circ E.$ The remains of the old city lie at the junction of the Myitnge (Dokta-waddy) with the Irrawaddy, the city having been built on a triangular island artificially formed by a channel called the Myittha chaung, which was dug from the Myitnge to the Irrawaddy. The few houses left are now scattered about in more than two dozen hamlets, inhabited by colonies of lacquerers, weavers, and other artisans, some without, some within, the old walls. The city stood at the north-east corner of the island. The outer wall is surrounded by a moat, open towards the Myitnge on the east but closed on the north towards the Irrawaddy. The inner or palace wall has a second similar moat round it. Of the old palace nothing is left but one shaky brick tower, very much out of the perpendicular, and not likely long to remain standing. The walls, both outer and inner, are still very solid and substantial, and give some idea of the aspect that Ava in its palmy days must have presented; but they have now been nearly swamped by a sea of undergrowth. The area between the inner and outer wall is filled with stretches of cultivated land, scattered hamlets, kyaungs, and enormous jungle-clad masses of bricks that were once pagodas. Much of this area and all the space within the inner walls are extremely picturesque. The numberless fine old tamarind-trees of huge size, the level green swards, the profuse vegetation, half hiding the thatched hamlets, the massive old walls and ruined shrines, the cleared vistas, make up a scene which suggests a park rather than the site of an old capital. The view across the river to Sagaing, up stream to Mandalay, and eastwards over the Amarapura plains to the Shan Hills is unequalled on the Irrawaddy.\n\nThe principal pagodas are the Lawkamanaung, the Yatanamanaung, the Zinamanaung, the Tuthamanaung, and the Ngamanaung, built by king Sanemintay\u0101gyi in the year $306$ B.E. (A.D. 944); and the Shwezigon, built by king Mingyizwa Sawke in the year $529$ B.E. (1167).\n\nFounded by king Thadominpay\u0101 in the middle of the fourteenth century, after the final collapse of the Pagan dynasty, Ava was for many years the capital of one of the kingdoms that struggled during the middle ages for the mastery in Burma. During the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the king of Ava was constantly either invading the territory of the Talaings or resisting Peguan attacks on his own kingdom; and more than once during that period Ava saw Shan kings reigning within her gates, and Chinese armies encamped before her walls. In the sixteenth century the Toungoo dynasty rose to power, and in $1554$ Bayin Naung, king of Toungoo, laid siege to and took the Burmese capital. The fortunes of the town were at a low ebb\nduring the last half of the sixteenth and the early years of the seventeenth century, but in 1636 it became the capital of an empire which then included Pegu and the greater part of what is now Burma. The Peguans, however, revolted about the middle of the eighteenth century and shook off the Burmese yoke, and in 1752 Ava was captured by a Talaing army and burnt to the ground. It was not long before Alaungpay\u0101 had turned the tables on the Talaing conquerors; but that monarch made his own capital at Shwebo, and Ava did not become the head-quarters of government again till 1766, when Sinbyushin, one of Alaungpay\u0101's sons, rebuilt the palace and moved his court there. The town did not long remain the capital, however. A few years later Bodawpay\u0101 built a new city at Amarapura, and the court and its following migrated there in 1783. Bagyidaw, Bodawpay\u0101's grandson, moved the seat of government back to Ava in 1822; and the town was the capital of Burma during the first Burmese War, and was the objective of the British troops in their advance up the Irrawaddy in 1826. It was Bagyidaw's successor, Tharrawaddy, who finally abandoned the city as the capital, and established himself at Amarapura, and since 1837 no Burmese monarch has resided in Ava.\n\nPreparations were made at Ava to arrest the advance of the British up the Irrawaddy at the time of the annexation of Upper Burma in 1885; steps were taken by the Burmans to block the channel of the river opposite the town and troops were collected, but the resistance collapsed. Ava was for some time after the annexation the headquarters of a separate District, which was, however, before long absorbed into Sagaing District.\n\n**Avachar.**\u2014Petty State in the D\u0101ngs, Bombay.\n\n**Avani.**\u2014Sacred village and hill in the Mulb\u0101gal taluk of Kol\u0101r District, Mysore, situated in 13\u00b0 6' N. and 78\u00b0 20' E. Population (1901), 949. The region is said to be Av\u0101ntikakshetra, one of the ten places of greatest sanctity in India. V\u0101lmiki is believed to have lived at Avani, and R\u0101ma to have encamped here on his return from Ceylon. Inscriptions call it the 'Gay\u0101 of the South.' There is a group of temples dedicated to R\u0101ma and his brothers, and many old inscriptions have been found. Avani was ruled for forty years to 961 by Tribhuvanakartar-Deva, who built fifty temples and made tanks. It is the residence of a gur\u016b of the Sm\u0101rta sect, and the scene of a great annual festival and fair.\n\n**Avanti.**\u2014Old name of Ujjain, Gwalior State, Central India.\n\n**Av\u0101sgarh.**\u2014Former name of Barw\u0101n\u012b State, Central India.\n\n**Avati.**\u2014Village in the north of the Devanhalli taluk of Bangalore District, Mysore, situated in 13\u00b0 18' N. and 77\u00b0 43' E. Population (1901), 1,226. The name is properly Ahuti. It is of interest as being the original settlement of the seven enterprising farmers of the Morasu\nWokkal tribe, who migrated here from the east about the end of the fourteenth century, and founded States in the east of the Mysore country, tributary to Vijayanagar.\n\n**Awa Estate.**\u2014A large estate situated in the Districts of Etah, Aligarh, Mainpuri, Agra, and Muttra, United Provinces, with an area of 265 square miles. The land revenue payable to Government in 1903\u20134 was 3.3 lakhs, and cesses amounted to Rs. 51,000; the rent-roll was 7.3 lakhs. A small area in Muttra is revenue-free. The family annals commence in the early part of the eighteenth century when Chaturbhuj, a Jadon Rajput, migrated from Chhata in Muttra District to Jalesar, and was employed as physician by the local governor. His son, Bijai Singh, obtained a small military command; and the family gained local influence by assisting the zamindars of adjacent villages, who were involved in pecuniary difficulties. Bakht Singh, son of Bijai Singh, was for a time in the service of Jawahir Singh, Raja of Bharatpur, and obtained a number of villages, the profits from which enabled him to enlist a troop of marauding Mewatis. The Maratha Wars allowed him to build a fort at Awa. During the Maratha Wars the head of the family aided Lord Lake, and in 1803 was confirmed in the estate he held. When the Mutiny broke out in 1857 the District officer made over the pargana of Jalesar to the Raja, and requested him to show his loyalty by maintaining Government authority. The confidence was well repaid; the Raja raised troops, attacked the insurgent villages, collected the revenue, and remitted it to Agra. The present Raja, Balwant Singh, C.I.E., who was for some time a member of the Legislative Council of the United Provinces, takes a keen interest in the management of his estate. Jalesar is the principal town in the estate, and a cotton gin and press, with the latest machinery, have recently been opened there. The Raja's residence is at Awa, a small place in Etah District, 14 miles from Etah town, on a metalled road, with a population (1901) of 2,823. The fort, situated close to the town, is a formidable stronghold, built of mud and brick, and surrounded by a deep moat nearly a mile in circumference. Awa is administered under Act XX of 1856, with an income of about Rs. 900. The town contains a dispensary maintained by the Raja, and a saltpetre refinery is situated close by. The primary school has about 100 pupils.\n\n**Ayyampettai.**\u2014Town in the District and taluk of Tanjore, Madras, situated in 10\u00b0 54' N. and 79\u00b0 12' E., 11 miles north-east of Tanjore city, with a station on the main line of the South Indian Railway. Population (1901), 9,454. It is one of the chief seats of weaving in the District. Silk cloths, carpets of cotton, wool, and silk, and mats made of rushes are largely manufactured, and block-printing of chintz is carried on to a small extent. There is a particular variety of cloth called kuttuni for which Ayyampettai is famous. The number of weavers is, however, very small now as compared with former days.\nAyyankere (or Dodda-Madagkere).\u2014A beautiful lake, surrounded with high hills and studded with islands, situated to the east of the B\u0101b\u0101 Budan range in Mysore. It has been formed by embanking the perennial stream of the Gaurihalla, and its outflowing waters are called the Veda, which unites with the Avati to form the Ved\u0101vati river. (See HAGARI.) The construction of this fine reservoir is attributed to Rukm\u0101ngada R\u0101ya, an ancient king of Sakkarepatna. The embankment, of earth and stone, is about 1,700 feet long, and 300 feet high at the rear slope. The tank is very deep, and contains in many parts 35 feet of water. There is a tradition that the bank was once on the point of breaching, when the danger which threatened the town of Sakkarepatna from inundation was announced by the guardian goddess of the lake to Honbilla, the nirganti or waterman. He obtained from her a promise that the catastrophe should be delayed until he returned with orders what to do from his master the king of Sakkarepatna, and hastening to the town delivered warning of the impending danger. The king sagely but inhumanly thought that, under the conditions of the promise, to prevent the return of the messenger would be to avert the catastrophe forever. He accordingly had him killed on the spot, and the embankment has stood ever since. A shrine has been erected at Sakkarepatna to the memory of the unfortunate man thus sacrificed for its stability, at which worship is still performed. Considerable repairs were made to the embankment in the thirteenth century under the Hoysala kings.\n\nAzam\u0101b\u0101d-i-Tal\u0101wari.\u2014Village in Karn\u0101l District, Punjab. See TIR\u0100WARI.\n\nAzamgarh District.\u2014Southern District of the Gorakhpur Division, United Provinces, lying between 25\u00b0 38' and 26\u00b0 27' N. and 82\u00b0 40' and 83\u00b0 52' E., with an area of 2,207 square miles, of which 52 square miles were added in 1904. It is bounded on the north by Fyzabad and Gorakhpur; on the east by Balli\u0101; on the south by Gh\u0101zipur and Jaunpur; and on the west by Jaunpur and Sult\u0101npur.\n\nPhysical aspects. The greater part forms an elevated plain which lies south of the Gogra. Besides the Gogra, the principal rivers are the Tons and Chhot\u012b Sarj\u016b, the former flowing from west to east across the District, while the Chhoti Sarj\u016b flows south-east from the Gogra. Along the Chhoti Sarj\u016b and Gogra are tracts of low alluvial land. The upland area south of the Tons differs from the area between the Tons and the Gogra. The southern tract is made up of a series of narrow parallel sections of country lying east and west. These are separated by lines of swamps which gradually become definite drainage channels. The whole area contains many depressions, which are filled with water in the rains, but gradually dry up. Nowhere does any long continuous expanse of cultivation occur, marshes and saline plains (usar) interrupting the cropped lands. In the northern portion the water-\ncourses keep more closely to their channels, and swamps are less frequent, the expanses of cultivation more continuous, and hamlets with their attendant groves more thickly scattered. The Gogra, also known as the Great Sarj\u016b, Deoh\u0101, or Dehw\u0101, has a valley varying in width from half a mile to ten miles, and constantly shifts its channel. The Tons after a tortuous course joins the Chhot\u012b Sarj\u016b near the eastern boundary. It is remarkable for the heavy floods which occur in its valley. There are about twenty large lakes or swamps, the principal being the Gamh\u012brban, Kotail, Jamw\u0101wan, Salon\u0101, Pakr\u012b-Pew\u0101, Narj\u0101, and Rato\u012b.\n\nThe District consists entirely of alluvium, and kankar or calcareous lime is the only form of stone. Saline efflorescences are found in many parts.\n\nThe flora is that of the Gangetic valley. Few large areas are covered with trees; but near the Tons and other streams there are some patches in which pal\u0101s or dh\u0101k (Butea frondosa) predominates. In the north mango groves abound; but there are few in the south, especially in the swampy area to the south-west. The alluvial tracts or kachh\u0101r are, however, the barest of trees.\n\nThe wolf, jackal, and fox are common, and wild hog and nilgai are occasionally met with. The rivers and lakes abound in fish, and in the winter are the haunt of geese, duck, and snipe.\n\nThe climate is on the whole healthy, though fever is prevalent during the rains and immediately after. With the commencement of the hot season in April westerly winds spring up; but in May the wind changes to the east and the climate becomes very relaxing.\n\nThe annual rainfall averages 41 inches, the distribution in different parts of the District being fairly uniform. Variations from year to year are, however, considerable. In 1894 the fall was 68 inches, and in 1896 only 18 inches.\n\nTradition points to the Bhars, Soeris, and Cher\u016bs as the aboriginal inhabitants of the District, and asserts that these were superseded first by the R\u0101jputs and then by the Bhuinh\u0101rs. When the tide of Muhammadan conquest flowed eastwards, Azamgarh was included in the great kingdom of Kanauj and passed with the neighbouring country under Delhi rule. In the fifteenth century the Shark\u012b kings of Jaunpur usurped authority over Azamgarh. On the fall of that dynasty, the District was reannexed to the Delhi dominions, and the fort of Sikandarpur was built by, and named after, Sikandar Lodi. In the seventeenth century a family of Gautam R\u0101jputs rose to influence, and before the close of the century they had embraced the faith of Isl\u0101m and possessed themselves of nearly the whole District as feudatory chiefs. About 1731 Mah\u0101bat Kh\u0101n, head of the family, refused payment of revenue; but after some success in resisting the forces of the Oudh government, he was forced to fly. His successors\ngradually lost their estates, and in 1758 Azamgarh became a chakl\u0101 or district of Oudh till its cession in 1801.\n\nOn June 3, 1857, the 17th Regiment of Native Infantry mutinied at Azamgarh, murdered some of their officers, and carried off the Government treasure to Fyz\u0101b\u0101d. The Europeans fled to Gh\u0101z\u012bpur; but on June 16 two planters, Messrs. Venables and Dunne, returned to Azamgarh, and, troops being sent from Gh\u0101z\u012bpur, the town was reoccupied. On July 18 the civil officers returned, and Mr. Venables attacked the rebels, but was forced back on the town; and on July 28, after the mutiny at Dinapore, all the Europeans returned to Gh\u0101z\u012bpur. The Palw\u0101rs held Azamgarh town from August 9 to 25; but they were expelled by the loyal Gurkhas on August 26, and on September 3 the civil officers returned again. On September 20 Beni M\u0101dh\u014d and the Palw\u0101rs were defeated, and British authority to a great extent re-established. The rebels were driven out of Atrauli\u0101 in November; and in January, 1858, the Gurkhas, under Jang Bah\u0101dur, marched from Gorakhpur towards Fyz\u0101b\u0101d, driving the rebels back into Azamgarh. Kuar Singh entered the District in his flight from Lucknow in the middle of February, and was attacked by our troops at Atrauli\u0101; but the latter were repulsed and fell back on Azamgarh, which was besieged by Kuar Singh till the middle of April, when he was defeated by a force under Sir E. Lugard, and the siege raised. Kuar Singh fled, and lost his life in crossing the Ganges; but bands of rebels roamed about attacking the tahsils and th\u016bnas till October, when a force under Colonel Kelly was sent to clear the District.\n\nRuins of numerous forts exist in many parts, which are locally attributed to the Bhars. A copperplate inscription of Harshavardhana of Kanauj, dated in A.D. 631, was found at Madhuban\u00b9, and an inscription on a tank records its construction in 1144. There are few remains of architectural interest, the chief being an old R\u0101jp\u016bt fort at Mehnagar.\n\nIn 1901 the District contained 12 towns and 4,688 villages. Population increased considerably between 1872 and 1891; but during the next decade fell by a larger amount than in any other District in the United Provinces. The numbers at the four enumerations were as follows: (1872) 1,317,626, (1881) 1,604,654, (1891) 1,728,625, (1901) 1,529,785. Fever, emigration, and famine are responsible for the decrease between 1891 and 1901. Up to 1904 there were five tahsils\u2014Deogaon, Azamgarh, M\u0101hul, Sagri, and Muhammad\u0101b\u0101d\u2014each named from its head-quarters, except Sagri and M\u0101hul, the head-quarters of which are at Jianpur and Atrauli\u0101 respectively. A sixth tahsil, named Ghosi, was constituted in 1904. The principal towns are the municipality of Azamgarh, the District headquarters, and Mau and Mubarakpur. The table on the next page gives the chief statistics of population in 1901.\n\n\u00b9 Epigraphia Indica, vol. i, p. 67.\nThe total population has been increased to 1,548,683, by a transfer of 52 square miles from Gorakhpur District in 1904. Details of the alterations will be found in the articles on Sagri, Muhammadabad, and Ghosi tahsils. Nearly 86 per cent. of the population are Hindus and 14 per cent. Muhammadans. The density of population is very high, and the District supplies a large number of emigrants. About 94 per cent. of the population speak Bihari.\n\nThe most numerous Hindu castes are: Chamars (leather-workers and labourers), 257,000; Ahirs (graziers and cultivators), 219,000; Brahmins, 108,000; Rajputs or Chhattris, 99,000; Bhars (labourers), 70,000; Koiris (cultivators), 60,000; Bhuinhars (agriculturists), 56,000; Luniyas (salt-petre workers and labourers), 52,000; and Banias, 38,000. More than half of the Musalmans are included in the two divisions of Julahas (weavers) and Shaikhs, 54,000 each; while Pathans number 27,000. Agriculture supports more than 60 per cent. of the total population, and general labour nearly 12 per cent., while weavers form 3 per cent. Rajputs or Chhattris own about one-third of the land, Brahmins one-tenth, and Bhuinhars one-sixth. The same three castes cultivate one-seventh of the District; Kurmis, Chamars, and Ahirs occupy a large area as tenants, while Koiris are noted for their skill in the cultivation of the most valuable crops.\n\nIn 1901 the District contained 104 native Christians, of whom 48 belonged to the Anglican communion. The Church Missionary Society, which has laboured at Azamgarh since 1818, supports the principal school.\n\nIn the southern portion of the District, which is badly drained, the prevailing soil is clay, chiefly producing rice. In the deeper or central portions of the depressions this becomes almost black from the amount of organic matter which it contains, and the soil is sticky and hard to work. Loam is more common in the northern portion, though clay soil and rice lands are also found there.\n\n---\n\n1 For a grammar of the dialect spoken in Azamgarh, see Settlement Report, by J. R. Reid, Appendix II.\nThere are small ravines along the Tons, the soil in which has suffered from denudation. The kachhar land contains large stretches of light sandy soil along the Chhoti Sarj\u00fc, and sandbanks near the Gogra. These produce but scanty crops, and along the Gogra are often covered with long grass or tamarisk, and are liable to be cut away by the river. Even the more permanent parts of the kachhar are exposed to inundation, and this part of the District is less productive than the rest.\n\nThe District is held on the usual tenures found in the United Provinces; but a large number of mah\u0101ls or revenue units are complex, extending over a number of mauzas or villages. Proprietary rights are very minutely subdivided. In a few villages inferior proprietors are also found, called mushakhkh\u0101s\u012bd\u0101rs. The main agricultural statistics are given below, in square miles:\n\n| Tahsil     | Total | Cultivated | Irrigated | Cultivable waste |\n|------------|-------|------------|-----------|-----------------|\n| Deogaon    | 389   | 182        | 108       | 29              |\n| Azamgarh   | 314   | 185        | 119       | 30              |\n| M\u0101hul      | 436   | 251        | 149       | 59              |\n| Sagri      | 589   | 347        | 218       | 58              |\n| Muhammad\u0101b\u0101d | 427 | 238        | 146       | 60              |\n| **Total**  | **2,155** | **1,203** | **740**   | **236**         |\n\n**Note.\u2014** Owing to settlement operations, these statistics are for various years from 1897 to 1901.\n\nThe staple food-crops are rice (422 square miles) and barley (359). Peas were grown on 181 square miles; and kodon, wheat, arhar, gram, maize, and maru\u0101 are also largely cultivated. Sugar-cane is the most valuable crop (101 square miles); indigo (29) and poppy (10) are also important.\n\nThere has been no extension of the net cultivated area in recent years, and the rice lands are so dependent on rainfall that fluctuations are considerable. The most striking change has been the large increase in the area bearing two crops in the same year, which has nearly doubled within the last thirty years. Advances under the Agriculturists\u2019 and Land Improvement Loans Acts are rarely taken, except in bad seasons. Out of a total of 1\u00b74 lakhs lent during the ten years ending 1900 more than a lakh was advanced in two years, and only Rs. 2,400 has been lent in four years since 1900.\n\nThe cattle bred locally are inferior, and buffaloes are largely used to supply milk. Ponies are also of a poor stamp, and the best are imported. Many of the wealthier zam\u012bnd\u0101rs keep elephants. Sheep are chiefly kept for wool and manure, and goats for milk and flesh.\n\nOut of 740 square miles irrigated, 416 were supplied from wells, 214 from tanks and swamps, and 110 from small streams. The upland area\nrequires much more irrigation than the *kachh\u0101r*, in which even sugar-cane can be grown without irrigation. Artificial tanks number more than 15,000, but all are of small size. The larger rivers are not utilized at all, owing to the cost of raising water; but every natural hollow and swamp which holds water is made use of. The upper courses of the smaller streams are regularly dammed, and embankments are also constructed wherever possible in fields to hold up water for rice. Water is generally raised from swamps and tanks by the swing-basket. In many parts of the District the spring-level is sufficiently high to allow the use of the lever and pot to raise water; but in other places a leathern bucket worked by hand labour, or less commonly by bullocks, takes the place of these. Water is generally sprinkled over the soil instead of being allowed to flood it, except in the case of garden crops.\n\n*Kankar* or nodular limestone is found in many places, and is used for making lime and metalling roads. Where it occurs in block form it is used for building. Saltpetre and carbonate of soda are largely extracted from saline efflorescences called *reh*.\n\nThe most important industries of the District are sugar-refining and the weaving of cotton-cloth, which are carried on in all parts. The cloth-weaving industry has suffered from the competition of European piece-goods and also of the mills of India; but coarse varieties are still made for local use, and finer qualities from imported yarn for export. The District is the most important centre of cotton-weaving as a hand industry in the United Provinces, and about 13,000 looms are at work. Silk and satin are also largely produced. *Mub\u0101rakpur*, *Mau*, and *Kop\u0101ganj* are the chief centres of the weaving industry. The manufacture of indigo was formerly important, but is fast declining under the competition of artificial indigo. Pottery of a rather poor style is produced at Niz\u0101m\u0101b\u0101d.\n\nThe chief imports are grain, European piece-goods and yarn, cotton, silk, tobacco, salt, metals and hardware, and drugs; and the exports are sugar, opium, cloth, oilseeds, indigo, and saltpetre. Grain is largely imported from the country north of the Gogra. The trade routes have been considerably altered by recent railway extensions. Traffic still continues on the Gogra, where *Dohr\u012bgh\u0101t* is the chief emporium, and there is some trade during the rains on the Chhot\u012b Sarj\u016b. Sh\u0101hganj in Jaunpur attracts a good deal of the produce of the west of the District.\n\nThe Oudh and Rohilkhand loop line just touches the extreme west of the District, while the Bengal and North-Western branch from Gorakhpur to Benares traverses the eastern portion. These have now been linked up by a line from Sh\u0101hganj on the former through Azamgarh town to Mau, which crosses the centre of the District. A\nbranch connects Kop\u0101ganj with Dohr\u012bgh\u0101t, and another branch from Kop\u0101ganj to Balli\u0101 has a very short length in the District. Road communications are fairly good. Out of a total length of 708 miles, 193 miles are metalled and are maintained by the Public Works department; but the cost of all but 86 miles is charged to Local funds. The main lines are the roads from Dohr\u012bgh\u0101t to Jaunpur with a branch to Benares, and from the same place to Gh\u0101zipur, but the cross-road from Mau through Azamgarh town to Sh\u0101hganj is also important. Avenues of trees are maintained on 79 miles of road.\n\nFrom the commencement of British rule till almost the close of the nineteenth century, no drought which could be called famine was known in the District. Hailstorms, frost, floods, and drought had occasionally caused scarcity in various parts.\n\nThe early part of the decade 1891-1900 was very unfavourable. Excessive and unseasonable rain damaged the harvests for three consecutive years, and in 1896 drought caused famine. The construction of a branch of the Bengal and North-Western Railway gave employment to 6,000 or 8,000 persons; relief works were also opened and the highest number of workers rose to 11,000. Nearly 4 lakhs of revenue was remitted, and the cost of all kinds of relief amounted to about 4\u00b73 lakhs.\n\nThe Collector is usually assisted by one member of the Indian Civil Service, and by five Deputy-Collectors recruited in India. An officer of the Opium department is stationed in the District, and there is a tahsild\u0101r at the head-quarters of each tahsil.\n\nThere are two District Munsifs and a Sub-Judge for civil work, and the District Judge is also Sessions Judge. Azamgarh is noted for the tension of religious feeling between Hindus and Musalm\u0101ns, which not infrequently causes trouble. In 1893 serious riots accompanied by bloodshed took place over the slaughter of kine. The people are also litigious, and agrarian disputes are not infrequent. Cattle-poisoning by Cham\u0101rs for the sake of hides is perhaps more common in Azamgarh than elsewhere in the United Provinces. Infanticide was formerly suspected, but no measures are now required for its prevention.\n\nAt the cession in 1801, Azamgarh was included in the large District of Gorakhpur then formed. In 1820 part of it was transferred to Jaunpur and part to Gh\u0101zipur. Three years later a Sub-Collectorate of Azamgarh was formed out of the Jaunpur parganas; and in 1832 a separate District of Azamgarh was constituted, to which for many years part of the present Balli\u0101 District was also attached. The early settlements were for short periods and were carried out in Gorakhpur District. Operations were commenced under Regulation VII of 1822, but were never completed; and the first regular settlement was made\nbetween 1834 and 1837 by Mr. Thomason, afterwards Lieutenant-Governor of the North-Western Provinces, and Mr. (afterwards Sir Robert) Montgomery. Land was classified according as it produced only rice or all kinds of crops, and average rates were assumed for each class of soil. The rental 'assets' so calculated were checked by assumed average pargana rates. The proportion taken as revenue varied between 50 and 66 per cent., and the revenue demand was fixed at 12.4 lakhs. This settlement was revised between 1866 and 1875. The land was again classed according to the crops it produced, and the rice land was divided into four or five classes according to its quality, while the ordinary land was subdivided according to its position near the village site or remote from it. Rent rates were selected for each class of soil at inspection, and were applied to the areas of each class, deductions being made in the case of land held by high-caste tenants, who pay lower rates than those of low caste, and in the case of villages where rents were difficult to collect. The revenue fixed amounted to 16.6 lakhs, while the assumed rental 'assets' were 34.8 lakhs. The revenue demand in 1903-4 was 17.8 lakhs, the incidence being Rs. 1.5 per acre, varying in different parganas from R. 1 to Rs. 1.6. This figure includes the revenue of 176 villages which are permanently settled, as they formerly belonged to the Benares province. The District is at present (1906) being resettled.\n\nCollections on account of land revenue and revenue from all sources have been, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 16.59  | 15.53  | 19.17  | 17.78  |\n| Total revenue  | 18.92  | 21.65  | 25.57  | 22.97  |\n\nAzamgarh is the only municipality, but ten towns are administered under Act XX of 1856. Beyond the limits of these, local affairs are managed by the District board, which in 1903-4 had an income of 1.2 lakhs, chiefly derived from local rates. The expenditure was also 1.2 lakhs, and included Rs. 43,000 spent on roads and buildings.\n\nThe District Superintendent of police has a force of 4 inspectors, 110 subordinate officers, and 408 constables, besides 117 municipal and town police, and 2,260 rural and road police. There are 23 police stations. In 1903 the District jail contained a daily average of 239 inmates.\n\nAzamgarh is above the Provincial average as regards the literacy of its inhabitants, of whom 3.3 per cent. (6.8 males and 0.2 females) could read and write in 1901. The number of public schools has risen from 184 with 7,591 pupils in 1880-1 to 224 with 11,183 pupils in 1900-1. In 1903-4 there were 265 such institutions with 14,216 pupils, of whom\nwere girls, besides 114 private schools with 1,285 pupils, including 34 girls. One of the schools is managed by Government, and 133 by the District and municipal boards. Out of a total expenditure on education of Rs. 41,000, Rs. 35,000 was charged to Local funds, and the receipts from fees were Rs. 4,000.\n\nThere are 8 hospitals and dispensaries, with accommodation for 66 in-patients. In 1903 the number of cases treated was 71,000, including 745 in-patients, and 2,559 operations were performed. The expenditure amounted to Rs. 10,000, chiefly met from Local funds.\n\nAbout 42,000 persons were successfully vaccinated in 1903\u20134, representing a proportion of 27 per 1,000 of population. Vaccination is compulsory only in the municipality of Azamgarh.\n\n[J. R. Reid, Settlement Report (1877); District Gazetteer (1883, under revision).]\n\n**Azamgarh Tahsil.**\u2014Head-quarters tahsil of Azamgarh District, United Provinces, conterminous with the pargana of Niz\u0101m\u0101b\u0101d, lying between 25\u00b0 53\u2032 and 26\u00b0 12\u2032 N. and 82\u00b0 52\u2032 and 83\u00b0 16\u2032 E., with an area of 314 square miles. Population decreased from 289,488 in 1891 to 264,114 in 1901, the rate of decrease being the lowest in the District. There are 809 villages and two towns, including Azamgarh, the District and tahsil head-quarters (population, 18,835). The demand for land revenue in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 3,18,000, and for cesses Rs. 51,000. The density of population, 841 persons per square mile, is the highest in the District. Across the centre of the tahsil flows the Tons, while the Mangai traverses the southern portion. In the north a considerable area produces a great variety of crops, but in the south rice is the most important staple. The area under cultivation in 1897\u20138 was 185 square miles, of which 119 were irrigated. Wells supply three-fourths of the irrigated area, and tanks, swamps, and small streams the remainder.\n\n**Azamgarh Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of Azamgarh District and tahsil, United Provinces, situated in 26\u00b0 5\u2032 N. and 83\u00b0 12\u2032 E., on the Tons and on a branch of the Bengal and North-Western Railway. Population (1901), 18,835. The town was founded about 1665 by Azam Kh\u0101n, son of one of the Gautam R\u0101j\u0101s referred to in the history of Azamgarh District. The dilapidated remains of the fort built by Azam Kh\u0101n and a temple erected in the latter part of the eighteenth century are the only buildings of any age. Azamgarh is almost surrounded by a loop of the Tons, which is subject to heavy floods, occasionally causing great damage. Thus in 1894 it was estimated that the loss at Azamgarh was about Rs. 50,000, and the flood of 1871 was still more serious. An embankment was made between 1896 and 1898, which affords protection from floods, at a cost of Rs. 13,000. The chief public buildings are the male and female dispensaries, the town hall, the church,\nthe Mission school, and the National high school. Azamgarh has been a municipality since 1884. During the ten years ending 1901 the income averaged Rs. 17,800 and the expenditure Rs. 17,000. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 19,000, chiefly derived from octroi (Rs. 11,000); and the expenditure was Rs. 22,000. The chief manufactures are sugar-refining and the weaving of cotton cloth. There are two high schools and seven primary schools, with a total attendance of 675.\n\nAzimganj.\u2014Town in the L\u0101lb\u0101gh subdivision of Murshid\u0101b\u0101d District, Bengal, situated in 24\u00b0 15' N. and 88\u00b0 16' E., on the right bank of the Bh\u0101girathi. The population of Azimganj, together with Ji\u0101ganj on the opposite bank, which is included within the same municipal limits, was 13,385 in 1901. Azimganj is the terminus of the branch railway from Nalh\u0101ti junction, and is an important trade centre. A small steamer runs in connexion with the railway between Azimganj and Berhampore, but sometimes during the dry season it cannot get beyond L\u0101lb\u0101gh. Azimganj is connected by a ferry with Ji\u0101ganj on the opposite bank; and a service of steamers, which plies during the rains between Ji\u0101ganj and Dhulian, calls here for goods and passengers. The town contains many well-built houses and some handsome temples belonging to Jain merchants. Azimganj was constituted a municipality in 1896. The income during the eight years ending 1903-4 averaged Rs. 16,000, and the expenditure Rs. 15,000. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 16,000, of which Rs. 9,000 was derived from a tax on persons (or property tax); and the expenditure was Rs. 15,500.\n\nAzmeriganj.\u2014Trade centre in Sylhet District, Eastern Bengal and Assam. See AJMIRIGANJ.\n\nB\u0101b\u0101 Budan Mountains.\u2014The highest range in Mysore State, lying between 13\u00b0 23' and 13\u00b0 35' N. and 75\u00b0 37' and 75\u00b0 52' E., in the middle of Kad\u016br District. The form of the range is that of a crescent or horseshoe, with the opening north-west, hence its appropriate Hindu name Chandra Drona or 'crater of the moon.' The northern arm, beginning with the Hebbe hill (4,385 feet), stretches eastwards without interruption for about 15 miles, and then, bending southwards, presents to the east an unbroken wall of more than 20 miles. The southern arm is formed by the Basavan-gudda and Woddin-gudda ranges. The character of the chain is that of a stupendous ridge, whose elevation is 6,000 feet above sea-level, and in some parts only a few yards wide at the summit, rising at intervals into loftier peaks. The higher portions consist of steep grassy slopes, well wooded in the ravines, through which flow perennial springs. The sides are densely clothed with forests, among which are numerous coffee plantations, while the J\u0101gar valley is one stretch of forest as far as the eye can see. The highest point is Mulainagiri (6,317 feet), towards the south of the range. Near\nto this, north-eastwards, is B\u0101b\u0101-Budan-giri or V\u0101yu-parvata (6,214 feet), on which are the sources of the Veda and Avati rivers. The hollow which succeeds marks the shrine of the eponymous saint B\u0101b\u0101 Budan. The conspicuous conical peak on the outer verge of the eastern face is Deviramman-gudda, where a beacon is lighted at the Dip\u0101vali festival. Near the north-east angle is Kalhatti-giri (6,155 feet), north of which a hot-season retreat has been established. These vast wilds and solitudes, with scarcely a human habitation, were formerly well stocked with game, from the elephant and bison downwards. The advance of the coffee-planter has now forced back wild animals to the remoter and more secluded spots. The B\u0101b\u0101-Budan-giri was the cradle of coffee cultivation in Southern India; and the slopes of the entire range, as well as the tract south of the forest-bound J\u0101gar valley, are now occupied by coffee gardens, both European and native. The first European garden was opened about 1840, to the south of B\u0101b\u0101-Budan-giri. Two roads run along the eastern face of the mountains, one over the summit and the other at a lower level. About midway in the latter is Santaveri, chiefly a colony of Lamb\u0101nis, whence there is a road to Kalhatti at the top. On the north-east of the mountains are the Abbe falls of 600 feet. The name B\u0101b\u0101 Budan is that of a Musalm\u0101n saint who took up his abode on the hill so called, and reared coffee from seeds he obtained at Mocha when on pilgrimage, thus introducing that important staple into India. A cave said to contain his tomb is in charge of a Musalm\u0101n fak\u012br at Attigundi, the only village on the hills, and is visited by pilgrims of both creeds. Hindus claim that the tomb is the throne of Datt\u0101treya, whose appearance at the mouth of this cave will herald the final avat\u0101r of Vishnu and usher in the millennium.\n\nBaber\u016b.\u2014Tahsil of B\u0101nd\u0101 District, United Provinces, conterminous with the pargana of Aug\u0101si, lying along the Jumna, between 25\u00b0 23\u2032 and 25\u00b0 41\u2032 N. and 80\u00b0 30\u2032 and 80\u00b0 57\u2032 E., with an area of 363 square miles. Population fell from 96,284 in 1891 to 77,395 in 1901, the rate of decrease being the highest in the District. There are 121 villages, but no town. The demand for land revenue in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 1,26,000, and for cesses Rs. 20,000. The density of population, 213 persons per square mile, is almost exactly the District average. Near the south and east rice is grown in considerable quantities, this tract being known as Jur\u0101r. The Jumna, as usual, is fringed by a network of deep ravines. In 1903\u20134 only one square mile was irrigated, out of 189 square miles under cultivation. The Ken Canal, when completed, will supply part of this tahsil.\n\nB\u0101bra.\u2014Petty State in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, Bombay.\n\nBachhraon.\u2014Town in the Hasanpur tahsil of Mor\u0101d\u0101b\u0101d District, United Provinces, situated in 28\u00b0 56\u2032 N. and 78\u00b0 15\u2032 E., 41 miles west\nof Mor\u0101d\u0101b\u0101d city. Population (1901), 7,452. According to tradition, it was founded in the time of Prithwi R\u0101j. The town contains several mosques and a temple. It is administered under Act XX of 1856, with an income of about Rs. 1,300. A primary school has 78 pupils.\n\n**Backergunge** (*B\u0101karganj*, \u2018Mart of Agh\u0101 B\u0101kar\u2019).\u2014Southernmost District of the Dacca Division, Eastern Bengal and Assam, lying between $21^\\circ 49'$ and $23^\\circ 5'$ N. and $89^\\circ 52'$ and $91^\\circ 2'$ E., with an area of 4,542 square miles. It is bounded on the north by Faridpur; on the east by the Meghn\u0101 and Sh\u0101hb\u0101zpur rivers, which separate it from No\u0101kh\u0101l\u012b; on the south by the Bay of Bengal; and on the west by the Baleswar river and its estuary the Haringh\u0101ta, which divide it from Khuln\u0101.\n\nBackergunge is a typical part of the alluvial delta formed by the three great river systems of Eastern Bengal. The District consists partly of mainland and partly of islands in the estuary of the Meghn\u0101, the largest being *Dakhin Sh\u0101hb\u0101zpur*, and forms an unbroken plain intersected by a network of sluggish and muddy tidal rivers and channels, with a slight decline from the east towards the west and north-west. Along the coast-line of the Bay lie the Sundarbans, a group of half-reclaimed islands separated by tidal creeks, which cover an area in this District of 897 square miles. The Meghn\u0101 estuary, here some 8 miles in breadth, sweeps past the east of the District, and is divided by the Dakhin Sh\u0101hb\u0101zpur island into an eastern branch called the Sh\u0101hb\u0101zpur, and a western known as the Tetuli\u0101 river. The Ari\u0101l Kh\u0101n is a branch of the Ganges; it crosses the north-east corner of the District, and joins the Meghn\u0101 through the M\u0101shk\u0101ta and Kaling\u0101 channels. The river system consists of offshoots from the Meghn\u0101 estuary and the tributaries and distributaries of the Ari\u0101l Kh\u0101n and Baleswar (as the Madhumat\u012b is called in its lower reaches), which ramify into channels intersecting the District in every direction. A perplexing multiplicity of names extends even to the smaller watercourses, which are often known by different names to villagers living on opposite banks, while the Meghn\u0101 estuary itself is known in different parts of its course as the S\u0101tb\u0101ria, the Ilsa, the Tetuli\u0101, and the Sh\u0101hb\u0101zpur. Most of the rivers and water-channels are navigable throughout the year and are subject to tidal action, which however is powerless during the freshes of the rainy season to arrest the seaward flow of the immense volume of rain-water pouring down the big rivers. Alluvion and diluvion are constantly taking place, especially towards the east, where the District is washed by the Meghn\u0101. On the north and east of the island of Dakhin Sh\u0101hb\u0101zpur, the land is being rapidly cut away, while on its western shore a corresponding formation is taking place and large alluvial accretions are being thrown up in the estuary, the names of which indicate their recent origin. There is a very\nstrong bore at spring tides in the estuary of the Meghn\u0101, and at that season boatmen seldom venture on the river.\n\nThe District lies low and, except in the east, most of the country is inundated during the rains. There are extensive depressions in the north and north-west, where the water remains all the year round, the principal being the S\u0101tl\u0101, Dalbair\u0101, Jhanjhani\u0101, R\u0101mpur Chechri, Adampur, and K\u0101l\u0101r\u0101ja bils or swamps.\n\nThe District is covered by recent alluvium, consisting of sandy clay and sand along the course of the rivers and fine silt consolidating into clay in other parts of the river plain, while in the marshes beds of impure peat commonly occur.\n\nDuring the rainy season, only the river banks and the artificial mounds on which habitations are situated escape inundation. Where not occupied by gardens, these patches of high ground are densely covered with a scrubby jungle of semi-spontaneous species, from which rise bamboos, areca and coco-nut palms, with a few taller trees, among which the commonest is Odina Wodier and the most conspicuous the red cotton-tree (Bombax malabaricum). The surface of the marshes either shows huge stretches of inundated rice or is covered by matted floating islets of sedges and grasses, and with various water-lilies, the most striking of these being the makana (Euryale ferox). Backergunge contains no Government forests, but the Sundarbans in the south produce many kinds of timber and an abundant supply of firewood. The chief trees are the sundri (Heritiera littoralis), haritaki (Terminalia Chebula), g\u0101b (Diospyros embroyopteris), keor\u0101 (Sonneratia apetava), kripa (Lumnitzera racemosa), gar\u0101n (Ceriops Roxburghianus), gamh\u0101r (Gmelina arborea), and karanj (Galedupa indica).\n\nTigers, leopards, deer, buffaloes and wild hog abound in the Sundarbans, and crocodiles swarm in the rivers and are very destructive. Nearly 300 persons are killed annually by wild beasts and snakes.\n\nBackergunge is remarkable for its uniform temperature and for the high humidity prevailing from April to October; the mean temperature remains almost stationary between $83^\\circ$ and $85^\\circ$ from April to September, but falls in the cold season to $67^\\circ$. The annual rainfall averages 83 inches, of which 8\u00b71 inches fall in May, 16\u00b73 in June, 18\u00b77 in July, 15\u00b73 in August, 10\u00b76 in September, and 5\u00b79 in October.\n\nBackergunge is peculiarly liable to cyclones accompanied by storm waves. The most disastrous in recent times were those of 1822 and 1876. In the former, 40,000 human beings and 100,000 cattle perished, and the Collectorate records were swept away. In the latter, Dakhin Sh\u0101hb\u0101zpur and some th\u0101nas of the Pauv\u0101kh\u0101li subdivision were submerged to a depth of from 10 to 45 feet, and 124,000 persons were drowned or died in the cholera epidemic which ensued; there was also an enormous mortality among the cattle.\nIn prehistoric times Backergunge appears to have formed part of the old kingdom of Banga or Samatata. Its people, who are described in the Raghubansa as living in boats, were clearly the ancestors of the Namas\u016bdras or Chand\u0101ls, who are still numerous in the north-west of the District. Authentic history dates only from the fifteenth or sixteenth century. Pargana Chandradw\u012bp, or B\u0101kla, was long the seat of a line of Hindu zamind\u0101rs, belonging to the group of chiefs known as the B\u0101ra Bhuiy\u0101, who were poetically known as \u2018the twelve suns of Bengal.\u2019 These zamind\u0101rs first ruled in Kachu\u0101 and subsequently in M\u0101dh\u0101bp\u0101sa, where the Durg\u0101 S\u0101gar, a large tank still in existence, is associated with them. One of the scions of their family married a daughter of the famous R\u0101j\u0101 Prat\u0101p\u0101ditya of Jessore.\n\nWhen or how Musalm\u0101ns first came into the District in any numbers is uncertain, but relics of their early settlements exist in the ruins of mosques at Bibi Chini and Kasb\u0101. During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the Arakanese (locally known as Maghs) made regular raids in fleets of armed vessels up the rivers of Eastern Bengal; and as late as 1770, when Major Rennell surveyed the District, he described the southern half of it as a wilderness devastated by the Maghs. In order to defend the country against these incursions, the Mughal governor of Bengal in 1608 transferred his capital to Dacca, and his successor Sh\u0101h Shuj\u0101, the brother of Aurangzeb, built a fort (since completely washed away by the Nalchit\u012b river) at Shuj\u0101b\u0101d, 5 miles south-west of Baris\u0101l. Early in the eighteenth century, pargana Buzurgumedpur came into the hands of Agh\u0101 B\u0101kar, a servant of the Naw\u0101b of Murshid\u0101b\u0101d, who has given his name to the village and District of Backergunge. After Agh\u0101 B\u0101kar\u2019s death, R\u0101j\u0101 R\u0101j Ballabh of Rajnagar, one of the most famous men of his time, got possession of the property; and it was he who first invited Portuguese Christians from B\u0101ndel and Goa in order to coerce his refractory tenants, and settled them in the Sibpur t\u0101luk, where their descendants, known as Firinghis, still reside.\n\nBritish rule in the District dates from the Company\u2019s accession to the Diw\u0101ni in 1765. Until 1817 the District formed part of the Dacca Collectorate, but was administered by a Judge and Magistrate of its own, who was stationed at the town of Backergunge near the junction of the Krishnak\u0101ti and Khair\u0101b\u0101d rivers. In 1801 the administrative head-quarters were transferred to Baris\u0101l. Numerous changes of jurisdiction have since occurred, the most important being the transfer of the island of Dakhin Sh\u0101hb\u0101zpur from No\u0101kh\u0101li to Backergunge in 1859, and that of the greater part of the M\u0101d\u0101ripur subdivision from this District to Far\u012bdpur in 1874.\n\nThe population increased from 1,887,586 in 1872 to 1,900,889 in 1881, to 2,153,965 in 1891, and to 2,291,752 in 1901. Progress\nwas checked between 1872 and 1881 by the disastrous cyclone of 1876. During the decade ending 1901 the greatest increase of population took place in the swampy th\u0101nas in the north (Gaurnad\u012b 14\u00b78 per cent. and Swarupk\u0101ti 13\u00b77), where reclamation is steadily going on as fresh deposits of silt gradually replace water by mud. Two of the three Sundarban th\u0101nas, Amtali and Gal\u0101chip\u0101, in which cultivation is rapidly extending, also showed large increases. The climate is not unhealthy, except after the close of the rains, when fever is prevalent. The chief statistics of the Census of 1901 are shown below:\n\n| Subdivision | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|-------------|---------------------|----------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Baris\u0101l     | 1,110               | 3              | 2,048    | 945,367    | 852                       | + 7\u00b75                                           | 92,778                                 |\n| Pirojpur    | 692                 | 1              | 1,066    | 553,494    | 800                       | + 6\u00b75                                           | 55,992                                 |\n| Patu\u0101kh\u0101li  | 1,231               | 1              | 1,051    | 522,658    | 425                       | + 5\u00b72                                           | 21,794                                 |\n| Dakhin Sh\u0101h-b\u0101zpur | 612       | ...            | 447      | 270,233    | 442                       | + 4\u00b76                                           | 12,319                                 |\n| District total | 4,542*             | 5              | 4,612    | 2,291,752  | 505                       | + 6\u00b74                                           | 182,793                                |\n\n* Includes 897 square miles comprised in the Sundarbans, which are not included in the subdivisional figures.\n\nThe District contains a large but sparsely inhabited tract in the Sundarbans. If this be excluded, the density of population rises from 505 to 629 per square mile; it is greatest in the Pirojpur and Jh\u0101lak\u0101ti th\u0101nas, where there are respectively 1,128 and 1,193 inhabitants to the square mile. The principal towns are Baris\u0101l, the head-quarters, Pirojpur, Jh\u0101lak\u0101ti, and Patu\u0101kh\u0101li. A great influx of labourers takes place at the winter rice harvest from Faridpur, Dacca, and No\u0101kh\u0101li. The language of the District is the dialect of Bengali known as Musalm\u0101ni. Musalm\u0101ns number 1,565,024, or more than 68 per cent. of the total, and Hindus 713,800: among the remainder there are 7,220 Buddhists and 5,591 Christians.\n\nOf the Musalm\u0101ns more than 1\u00bd millions call themselves Shaikhs, and are doubtless in the main derived from the aboriginal race represented at the present day by the Hindu Namas\u016bdras, who number 318,000 and live an almost amphibious life in the swamps in the north-west of the District. After the Namas\u016bdras, K\u0101yasthas (78,000), Br\u0101hmans (52,000), N\u0101pits and S\u016bdras (each with 36,000), and Kaibarttas (26,000) are the most numerous Hindu castes. The Buddhists are Maghs who have resided in this part of the Sundarbans for more than a century; they adhere to their own mode of living, intermarry strictly among themselves, and build their dwellings on piles\non the model of Burmese houses. Of the total population, no less than 81 per cent. are dependent on agriculture; industries support 9\u00b76 per cent., commerce 0\u00b75 per cent., and the professions 2\u00b73 per cent.\n\nMissions of various denominations are active; the number of native Christians has nearly doubled since 1881 and now exceeds 5,000. They are mainly recruited from the ranks of the despised Namas\u016bdras. The Portuguese colony at Sibpur has already been mentioned; a Roman Catholic mission was established at this place 200 years ago under the patronage of the King of Portugal, and there is another more recent mission subordinate to the Bishop of Dacca. The Baptist Mission has some 3,000 converts, and connected with it is a Zan\u0101na Mission, which maintains a large boarding-school for girls at Baris\u0101l. The Bengal Evangelistic Mission, whose head-quarters are at Faridpur, and the Oxford Mission have branches in this District; and a sisterhood is engaged in medical, educational, and proselytizing work among native women in Baris\u0101l.\n\nThe higher ground in the east produces sugar-cane, pulses, the p\u0101n creeper (Piper Betle), and a little jute; the rest of the District is fertilized by rich deposits of silt and forms with No\u0101kh\u0101li the most important rice-producing tract in Eastern Bengal.\n\nThe chief agricultural statistics for 1903-4 are shown below, areas being in square miles:\n\n| Subdivision          | Total | Cultivated | Cultivable waste |\n|----------------------|-------|------------|------------------|\n| Baris\u0101l              | 1,110 | 701        | 39               |\n| Pirojpur             | 692   | 547        | 70               |\n| Patu\u0101kh\u0101li           | 1,231 | 547        | 102              |\n| Dakhin Sh\u0101hb\u0101zpur    | 612   | 418        | 23               |\n| **Total**            | **4,542** | **2,213** | **234**         |\n\n* Includes 897 square miles in the Sundarbans.\n\nRice is grown over an area of 2,205 square miles, or 83 per cent. of the total cultivated area. The winter rice, which covers 78 per cent. of the net cropped area, is sown in April or May, transplanted from the beginning of June to the middle of August, and reaped in November and December. The early rice crop is sown in spring and the early part of the hot season, and reaped in August; in some parts it is transplanted, but in the north it is sown broadcast. The spring crop, although not equal in importance to the others, is cultivated to a considerable extent on the alluvial accretions along the river banks and in the swamps. It is generally sown broadcast in December and reaped in April or May; it is sometimes transplanted. Pulses are sown in the cold season and harvested in the spring. Til (Sesamum indicum) and\nlinseed are also cultivated, the latter chiefly in the Dakhin Sh\u0101hb\u0101zpur subdivision. There is very little jute, but betel-nut and coco-nut palms are grown extensively all over the District; and it is estimated that the number of betel-nut trees is altogether about 27 millions, and that the annual out-turn is 6,000 million nuts.\n\nThe area under cultivation is spreading rapidly as the swamps silt up in the north and the jungle is reclaimed in the south. The area not available for cultivation is returned at 1,121 square miles; it lies mainly in the Sundarbans, and much of it is covered with the water of the great estuaries. In Wards' and Government estates European vegetables and improved varieties of native crops have been introduced to a small extent. Owing to the fertility of the soil and the general prosperity of the cultivators, there is little need for Government loans, but Rs. 17,000 was advanced under the Agriculturists' Loans Act after the cyclone of 1893.\n\nThe District cattle are poor. Attempts have been made by Government and public bodies to improve them by importing bulls from Bih\u0101r, but without success.\n\nBackergunge is not a manufacturing District; but oil, coarse cloth, mosquito nets, gunny-bags, sacrificial knives and other iron instruments, mats of various kinds, earthenware, agricultural implements, and molasses are manufactured for local consumption. The weavers of Wazirpur and B\u0101nari p\u0101ra make dhotis of the Dacca pattern; the mosquito nets manufactured at M\u0101dh\u0101bp\u0101sa command a large sale among the middle classes, and the Maghs weave coloured cloth for their own use. Machine-made cloth is gradually driving the local weavers from their looms, and the rapidly growing taste for European pottery and enamelled ironware is depriving the local potters of their best customers. Wazirpur and its neighbourhood has a local reputation for daos and other iron implements, and boats are built all over the District. Brick-making is carried on to a considerable extent in the neighbourhood of Baris\u0101l, and a large oil-mill at Jh\u0101lak\u0101ti has an annual out-turn valued at Rs. 25,000.\n\nRice is exported to the Twenty-four Parganas, Dacca, and Mymensingh, and 2,000,000 tons of rice find their way annually to the Calcutta market; other articles exported are betel-nuts and coco-nuts to Calcutta, Dacca, No\u0101kh\u0101li, and Chittagong, and timber and mats to Calcutta. The betel-nut crop is especially large and profitable; and it is estimated that the trees in the District bring in annually nearly 44 lakhs of rupees to the growers. Most of the crop is sent to Calcutta, but some portion of it is also prepared for the Burmese market. The principal imports are salt, kerosene oil, coal, European piece-goods, cotton twist, molasses, sugar, corrugated iron, oil, tobacco, and flour. The chief trade centres are Jh\u0101lak\u0101ti and Nalchit\u012b on the main steamer route to Calcutta,\nDAULATKH\u0100N, and S\u0101hibganj; rice is also exported from Bag\u0101, Bauphal, Ni\u0101mati, Bh\u0101nd\u0101ria, Kaukh\u0101li, K\u0101laia, Chaul\u0101k\u0101ti, Char\u0101madd\u012b, and Bhuri\u0101. Large annual fairs are held at K\u0101lisuri, Kalask\u0101ti, and L\u0101kutia. The traders belong chiefly to the Gandhabanik, S\u0101h\u0101, Teli, and P\u0101tikar castes. Goods are carried by both country boats and steamers, the main trade route being via the Sundarbans to Calcutta.\n\nThere is no railway in the District, and the roads are little used for goods traffic except in the Dakhin Sh\u0101hb\u0101zpur subdivision. Wherever constructed, they are largely used by foot-passengers, especially on market days. Excluding 487 miles of village tracks, the District contains only 307 miles of road, of which 17 miles are metalled. The most important road runs from the northern boundary via Baris\u0101l and Backergunge to Patu\u0101kh\u0101li. Baris\u0101l is also connected on the west with B\u0101nari\u092a\u093e\u0930\u093e and Nabagr\u0101m, and on the south-west with Nalchit\u012b and Jh\u0101lak\u0101ti, while another main road runs from Pirojpur to S\u0101pleja, via Tushkh\u0101li, along the west of the District. A good road traverses the island of Dakhin Sh\u0101hb\u0101zpur.\n\nThe drains along the side of many of the roads are used as waterways; and throughout the greater part of the District there are few villages which cannot be reached by boat, especially during the rains. In Dakhin Sh\u0101hb\u0101zpur, however, few villages are accessible by boats, except in the rainy season. Regular lines of steamer ply along the larger rivers, the most important being the daily Sundarbans dispatch service from C\u0101ch\u0101r to Calcutta, via N\u0101r\u0101yanganj, Ch\u0101ndpur, Baris\u0101l, Nalchit\u012b, and Jh\u0101lak\u0101ti, and another which carries the mails between Baris\u0101l and Khuln\u0101. Daily services connect Baris\u0101l with N\u0101r\u0101yanganj, M\u0101darpur, and Patu\u0101kh\u0101li. A steamer runs to No\u0101kh\u0101li four times a week. There are numerous ferries across the principal rivers and to the islands.\n\nFor general administrative purposes the District is distributed into four subdivisions, with head-quarters at Baris\u0101l, Pirojpur, Patu\u0101kh\u0101li, and Dakhin Sh\u0101hb\u0101zpur. At Baris\u0101l is stationed the District Magistrate-Collector, who is also Administration. ex-officio collector of tolls and supervisor of the additional navigable channels under (Bengal) Act V of 1864. He is assisted by a staff of one Joint Magistrate or Assistant Collector and five Deputy-Magistrate-Collectors. Each of the other subdivisions is under a Deputy-Magistrate-Collector, and a Sub-deputy-Collector is in charge of the sub-treasury at Pirojpur. There are also three k\u0101nungos, and a special Deputy-Collector in charge of the Government estates.\n\nThe civil courts, besides that of the District and Sessions Judge, are those of an additional District and Sessions Judge, of two Sub-Judges, and of sixteen regular Munsifs, of whom six are stationed at Baris\u0101l, two at Bhol\u0101, three at Pirojpur, four at Patu\u0101kh\u0101li, and one wherever the pressure of work is greatest. Criminal courts include those of the\nDistrict and Sessions Judge, the District Magistrate, and the above-\nmentioned Deputy-Magistrates. The practice of sub-infeudation has\nbrought into existence a large body of middlemen between the revenue-\npayer and the actual cultivators, who are continually fomenting land\ndisputes, and the District is notorious for agrarian riots. These were so\nfrequently attended by gun-shot murders that the District was disarmed\nin 1896, a measure which was attended with remarkable success. The\norder was relaxed in 1904, and gun licences are now granted to\npersons of position and good character. Many crimes of violence also\narise out of marriage disputes, which are rife among the lower classes\nMuhammadans.\n\nIn the first settlement of Bengal, made in 1582 by R\u0101j\u0101 Todar Mal,\nBackergunge was included in sark\u0101r B\u0101kla; but at the subsequent\nsettlements, made by the Muhammadan rulers, it was comprised in the\nprovince of Dacca. It was constituted a separate District in 1797 by\nRegulation VII of that year, but it was not till 1817 that an indepen-\ndent Collector was first appointed. In 1903\u20134 the current land revenue\ndemand was 16.94 lakhs, payable by 3,634 estates, of which 3,019 with a\ndemand of 10.05 lakhs were permanently settled, 278 paying 2.65 lakhs\nwere temporarily settled, and the others were managed direct by Govern-\nment. At the time of the permanent settlement there were extensive\nareas of waste land which remained unsettled. These have since been\nlargely brought under cultivation and now form valuable Government\nestates. Owing to this circumstance, the incidence of revenue is\nRs. 1-2-6 per cultivated area, as compared with only R. 0-8-18 in\nFaridpur and R. 0-6-11 in Dacca.\n\nSub-infeudation is carried to extreme lengths, and there are said to be\nas many tenures as there are ryot\u012b holdings. The system was originated\nby zamind\u0101rs and talukd\u0101rs, who, finding themselves unable to clear the\nlarge tracts of unreclaimed land included in their properties, divided\nthem into lots and placed each lot in the haol\u016b or charge of an indi-\nvidual; the haol\u0101dir repeated the process to sub-lessees, who in their\nturn sublet portions of their tenures, until these became of manageable\nsize. This system of reclamation tenures is universal in the half-cleared\ntracts of Eastern Bengal, but in Backergunge it has been overlaid by\na bewildering maze of more or less fictitious tenures, which owe their\norigin to land-jobbing. The grant of a tenure of any description com-\nmands a heavy sal\u0101mi or premium; and a landlord\u2019s favourite method\nof raising money is to create an intermediate tenure between himself\nand the ryot or tenure-holder immediately subordinate to him, at a rent\nslightly lower than he has been receiving, the premium paid to him\nbeing equivalent to the capitalized value of the reduction in rent. The\nnew lessee makes a profit by squeezing an extra cess out of the man\nbelow him; and the result is that an undue share of the produce of the\nsoil goes to feed an army of middlemen who have no rightful place in the rural economy. This process is being constantly repeated by all grades of tenure-holders; and there seems to be no limit to its development, save the capacity of the actual cultivator to bear the increased burden falling upon him. In spite of this, however, the system tends to diffuse wealth widely among the people; many of the tenure-holders are men of the cultivating class and cultivate some portion of their tenures themselves; they generally hold these tenures at fixed rates, the rents are moderate, and, as a class, they are very prosperous. The ryot again is only rack-rented where the tenure immediately above him is held by a strong and unscrupulous man, and such rack-renting is confined to certain localities in which the lowest grade of tenure is in the hands of a bad class of landlord. When the ryot finds his rent enhanced more than he can bear, or if he is influenced by attractive promises held out by an outsider, he will deny his relationship as tenant to his real landlord, and will place himself under the protection, or zimba, of the outsider, acknowledging the latter as his landlord. This, with the infinitesimal division of shares, where no actual partition of the land can take place, has led to the agrarian riots and murders for which this District is notorious. To obviate these disputes, a general survey and record-of-rights is now being carried out throughout the District. The latest survey papers show that the rent per acre paid by the actual cultivator to his immediate landlord for arable land varies from Rs. 2 to Rs. 10 per acre, the average being Rs. 5. High land suitable for homesteads commands a still higher rate.\n\nThe following table shows the collections of land revenue and of total revenue (principal heads only), in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 14.63  | 15.64  | 16.41  | 16.95  |\n| Total revenue  | 23.09  | 26.29  | 30.81  | 31.79  |\n\nOutside the five municipalities of Baris\u0101l, Nalchit\u012b, Jh\u0101lak\u0101ti, Patu\u0101kh\u0101li, and Pirojpur, local affairs are managed by the District board, with subordinate local boards in each subdivision. In 1903-4 its income was Rs. 3,32,000, of which Rs. 2,26,000 was derived from rates; and the expenditure was Rs. 3,21,000, including Rs. 1,96,000 spent on public works and Rs. 61,000 on education.\n\nThe District contains 16 police stations or th\u0101nas, and 11 outposts. The force subordinate to the District Superintendent in 1903 consisted of one Assistant District Superintendent, 8 inspectors, 66 sub-inspectors, 38 head constables, and 541 constables; 76 town chaukid\u0101rs are employed for watch and ward duty in the five municipal towns, and there is also a rural police force consisting of 5,293 village watchmen.\nand 508 head watchmen. The District jail at Baris\u0101l has accommodation for 580 prisoners, and the subsidiary jails at the other subdivisions for 99.\n\nEducation is widely diffused, and in 1901, 7.9 per cent. of the population (14.7 males and 0.9 females) could read and write. Musalmans are more backward than Hindus, only 10 per cent. of their males being literate, compared with 24 per cent. in the case of Hindus. The total number of pupils under instruction rose from 75,859 in 1892-3 to 86,456 in 1900-1, while 81,554 boys and 7,189 girls were at school in 1903-4, being respectively 46.2 and 4.2 per cent. of the children of school-going age. The number of educational institutions, public and private, in that year was 3,074, including an Arts college, 98 secondary schools, and 2,497 primary schools. The expenditure on education was 3.51 lakhs, of which Rs. 27,000 was met from Provincial funds, Rs. 61,000 from District funds, Rs. 1,500 from municipal funds, and 1.88 lakhs from fees. The chief educational institutions are in Baris\u0101l Town.\n\nIn 1903 the District contained 41 dispensaries, of which 5 had accommodation for 68 in-patients. The cases of 331,000 out-patients and 1,060 in-patients were treated during the year, and 8,913 operations were performed. The expenditure was Rs. 34,000, of which Rs. 2,000 was met from Government contributions, Rs. 21,000 from Local and Rs. 4,000 from municipal funds, and Rs. 6,000 from subscriptions.\n\nThough vaccination is compulsory only within the five municipalities, it has made great progress in recent years, the number of successful vaccinations in 1903-4 being 122,000, or 54.2 per 1,000 of the population.\n\n[Sir W.

Population (1901), 11,319. The value of the imports by sea in 1903-4 was 9 lakhs; of the exports, 34 lakhs. The former consist chiefly of rice and salt; the latter of coco-nuts, copra, pepper, and timber. Badagara is a busy town, and the head-quarters of the t\u0101luk and of a sub-magistrate and a District Munsif.\n\nBadakhsh\u0101n.\u2014A separate province of Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n, which may be defined as the country drained by the Kokcha and its tributaries. It is bounded by the Oxus on the north, and to the east as far as\nIshkashim; thence by W\u0101kh\u0101n and a great spur of the Hindu Kush; on the south by the Hindu Kush, which separates it from Chitr\u0101l and K\u0101f\u012brist\u0101n; and on the west by the district of Katagh\u0101n. Except near the Oxus, the country is distinctly alpine in character, and contains some lofty peaks, notably Tirgar\u0101n, which is probably over 20,000 feet. The rivers are for the most part rapid, and difficult to cross. They abound in fish.\n\nThe inhabitants of the country are T\u0101jiks and Turks, of whom the former are the more numerous, and probably represent the original Ir\u0101nian inhabitants of the Oxus valley. They have a distinctly Aryan type; their features are good, their complexions fair but weather-beaten, and their physique is respectable. The Turks, who are more industrious and enterprising, are distinguished by the square and high cheek-bone which marks the infusion of Mongol blood. The total population of Badakhsh\u0101n proper may be estimated at about 100,000. The inhabitants of the country were originally Shiah; but on the irruption of the Uzbeg Sunnis, all who could not escape to the hills were forcibly converted to that form of the Moslem faith. The people are, as a rule, hospitable, peaceful, and well conducted. Heinous crimes are seldom heard of in Badakhsh\u0101n or W\u0101kh\u0101n; adultery is rare; and only disputes regarding land and water have to be decided by the village communities, or by higher authority. The Badakhshis are on the whole well fed and warmly clad, while their habits and domestic arrangements are simple. The only places which have any pretence to be designated as towns are Faizab\u0101d, Rust\u0101k, Kh\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d, and Chay\u0101b.\n\nOf the early history of Badakhsh\u0101n there are no reliable records. Tradition states that the early rulers were descendants of Alexander the Great, and it is possible that one of his adherents secured the country for himself, and transmitted it to his descendants. One Muhammad Sh\u0101h was the last of these so-called Badakhshi \u2018Sult\u0101ns of Alexander.\u2019 None of the three great Tartar conquerors\u2014Chingiz, Tim\u016br Lang, and Shayb\u0101ni Kh\u0101n\u2014appears to have penetrated so high up the valley of the Oxus. Native tradition states that the emperor B\u0101bar bestowed Badakhsh\u0101n upon a son, Mirza Hindal, who after a short reign went to India and was succeeded by one of the emperor\u2019s generals, Mirza Sulaim\u0101n. On his death the country devolved upon his son; but later it seems to have been ruled over by its own M\u012brs. About 1840 it was subjugated by M\u012br Mur\u0101d Beg of Katagh\u0101n. In 1859, on the conquest of Katagh\u0101n by the Afgh\u0101ns, Badakhsh\u0101n became tributary to K\u0101bul. In 1881 the Am\u012br Abdur Rahm\u0101n abolished the last remnant of local autonomy, and set up an Afgh\u0101n governor. W\u0101kh\u0101n and Shighn\u0101n, the latter being now Russian territory, were also ruled for centuries by their own M\u012brs; but the ruler of Badakhsh\u0101n was invariably recognized\nas the suzerain. Since the advent of Afgh\u0101n troops to Badakhsh\u0101n, W\u0101kh\u0101n has also been ruled by an Afgh\u0101n H\u0101kim.\n\nThe winter in Badakhsh\u0101n is severe, the mountains being impassable from snow early in December, and the rivers generally frozen. Rain is said to be abundant and chiefly falls during the spring. In the mountainous region snow commences to fall in November. On the other hand, in the low-lying districts of Rust\u0101k, Chay\u0101b, and Daung, bordering the Oxus, the heat in summer is very great; and even Faiz\u0101b\u0101d, the capital of Badakhsh\u0101n proper, is unpleasantly warm.\n\nThe mineral wealth of Badakhsh\u0101n is probably considerable. Salt and sulphur are found in the valley of the Kokcha, and iron is known to exist near Faiz\u0101b\u0101d. Near the sources of the Kokcha are famous lapis lazuli mines, while within 20 miles of Ishkashim, and on the right bank of the Oxus, are ruby mines, for which Badakhsh\u0101n has long been famous. There are no important manufactures. Badakhshi horse-trappings and furniture, however, find a ready sale in the surrounding countries.\n\n**Bad\u0101mgarh.**\u2014Peak in Bonai State, Bengal, situated in 21\u00b0 49' N. and 85\u00b0 16' E., and rising to a height of 3,525 feet above sea-level.\n\n**Bad\u0101mi T\u0101luka.**\u2014South-westernmost t\u0101luka of Bij\u0101pur District, Bombay, lying between 15\u00b0 49' and 16\u00b0 9' N. and 75\u00b0 19' and 76\u00b0 32' E., with an area of 615 square miles. It contains one town, Guledgarh (population, 16,786), and 167 villages, including Ker\u016br (5,353). The population in 1901 was 110,287, compared with 100,511 in 1891, the increase being mainly confined to Guledgarh, which carries on a large manufacture of bodices held in great repute throughout the Deccan and Southern Mar\u0101th\u0101 Country. The density, 179 persons to the square mile, is much above the District average. The demand for land revenue in 1903\u20134 was 1.31 lakhs, and for cesses Rs. 11,000. The head-quarters are at Bad\u0101mi. The extreme north-west of the t\u0101luka lies high, and the surface, which is sandstone overlaid with trap, is undulating without large hills. In the centre, sandstone ranges are separated by plains of red sand. The t\u0101luka is poorly supplied with water. The climate is considered the worst in the District. The annual rainfall averages about 26 inches.\n\n**Bad\u0101mi Village.**\u2014Village in the t\u0101luka of the same name, in Bij\u0101pur District, Bombay, situated in 15\u00b0 55' N. and 75\u00b0 41' E., on the Southern Mahrratta Railway. Population (1901), 4,482. It is interesting for a Jain excavation and cave-temple ascribed to A.D. 650, together with three caves of Br\u0101hmanical construction, one of which has an inscription bearing the date A.D. 579. The Jain cave is only 31 feet across by about 19 feet deep. These caves mark the period when Hinduism was reasserting itself, previous to its final triumph over Buddhism in the next century or two. The Narsingha incarnation\nof Vishnu, seated on the five-headed serpent Anant, and a variety of sculptures, still survive. In one cave-temple the front pillars have three brackets of a wooden-like design, ornamented by male or female figures and dwarfs, of considerable beauty of execution. Some of the pillars are more architectural in their forms, and in the best style of Hindu art. There are two forts, one to the north called B\u0101vanbande (or 'fifty-two rocks'), and one to the south called Ran-mandal (or 'battle-field'). Both were dismantled about 1845. Its strength and neighbourhood to the sacred Aivalli, B\u0101nshankari, Mah\u0101kut, and Pattadkal combine to make B\u0101d\u0101mi a likely site for an early capital. It was probably a Pallava stronghold in the sixth century, and then fell to the Ch\u0101lukyas. Hiuen Tsiang visited it early in the seventh century. B\u0101d\u0101mi continued for several years in possession of the Vijayanagar kings during the sixteenth century; it then fell to the Mar\u0101th\u0101s. In 1818 General Munro took it after considerable resistance. In 1840 a band of 125 Arabs from the Niz\u0101m's territory, headed by a blind Br\u0101hman, Narsingh, took possession of the village, plundered the Government treasury and market, and carried the booty into the Niz\u0101m's territory. Returning, Narsingh commenced administration, but in seven days he was caught, tried, and sentenced with his followers to transportation. B\u0101d\u0101mi contains a boys' school with 163 pupils and a girls' school with 53.\n\nBadarpur (Badarpur).\u2014Village in the Karimganj subdivision of Sylhet District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, situated in $24^\\circ 51'$ N. and $92^\\circ 33'$ E., on the south bank of the Bar\u0101k close to the boundary of C\u0101ch\u0101r. When the Burmese invaded C\u0101ch\u0101r in 1824, the British troops met and defeated them near this spot. The remains of an old fort are still to be seen on a rock overhanging the river. Badarpur is now an important junction on the Assam-Bengal Railway. The main line crosses the Bar\u0101k by a fine bridge 454 yards long, which is raised sufficiently high above the river to admit of the passage of steamers at all seasons of the year. A branch line runs along the south bank of the river to Silchar. There is a temple of Siddheswar in the neighbourhood, at which a bathing fair is held every year in March.\n\nBadaus\u0101.\u2014South-western tahsil of B\u0101nd\u0101 District, United Provinces, conterminous with the pargana of the same name, lying between $25^\\circ 3'$ and $25^\\circ 27'$ N. and $80^\\circ 31'$ and $80^\\circ 52'$ E., with an area of 333 square miles. Population fell from 77,922 in 1891 to 74,755 in 1901. There are 132 villages, but no town. The demand for land revenue in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 86,000, and for cesses Rs. 14,000. The density of population, 224 persons per square mile, is above the District average. The B\u0101ghain flows through the tahsil from south-west to north-east. In the south are scattered hills, and the south-east includes a small patch of 'reserved' forest, but most of the tahsil lies in the plains.\n1903-4 only 1 square mile was irrigated, out of 165 square miles under cultivation. The Ken Canal, when completed, will supply a small area.\n\n**Badin Taluka.**\u2014Taluka in Hyder\u0101b\u0101d District, Sind, Bombay, lying between 24\u00b0 13' and 24\u00b0 58' N. and 68\u00b0 43' and 69\u00b0 16' E., with an area of 792 square miles. The population rose from 73,823 in 1891 to 84,790 in 1901. The density is 103 persons per square mile, which is a little below the District average. The number of villages is 165. Land revenue and cesses amounted in 1903-4 to 2.8 lakhs. Badin is the head-quarters. The taluka, which is triangular in shape, with its base on the Rann of Cutch, is flat, well watered, and an ideal grazing tract. The principal crops are rice and sugar-cane.\n\n**Badin Village.**\u2014Head-quarters of the taluka of the same name in Hyder\u0101b\u0101d District, Sind, Bombay, situated in 24\u00b0 38' N. and 68\u00b0 54' E., 62 miles from Hyder\u0101b\u0101d city and 41 from Tando Muhammad Kh\u0101n. Population (1901), 2,076. The Hindus are principally shopkeepers and the Muhammadans agriculturists and weavers. Badin was founded about 1750 by a Hindu named Sawalo. The old town (on the opposite bank of the Mirwah canal) was totally destroyed by Sh\u0101h Nasirdin, otherwise Madad Kh\u0101n, the famous Path\u0101n, in his raid into Sind. There is a large local trade in grain, ghi, sugar, molasses, cloths, metals, tobacco, skins, cotton and drugs, with an annual fair in June, lasting a fortnight. The village contains a dispensary.\n\n**Badnera** (or Wadnera).\u2014Town in the District and taluk of Amraoti, Ber\u0101r, situated in 20\u00b0 52' N. and 77\u00b0 46' E. Population (1901), 10,859. The town is mentioned in the Ain-i-Akbar\u012b as the head-quarters of a pargana in the sarkar of G\u0101wil. It is known as Badnera Bibi, as it formed, with K\u0101ranja, part of the dowry of Daulat Sh\u0101h Begam, daughter of Dary\u0101 Im\u0101d Sh\u0101h of Ber\u0101r, who was given in marriage to Husain Niz\u0101m Sh\u0101h of Ahmadnagar. The exactions of successive rulers depopulated Badnera, and it was plundered in 1822 by R\u0101j\u0101 R\u0101m, who partly demolished the fort and town walls. The railway station (Badnera junction) is 413 miles from Bombay, on the Nagpur branch of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway. It is connected with Amraoti by a branch (state) railway 6 miles long. Badnera is important as the station whence all the Amraoti cotton is dispatched to Bombay. The town contains a cotton-spinning and weaving factory, where 248 looms and 16,336 spindles were at work in 1903-4, the number of hands employed being 822.\n\n**Badnor.**\u2014Principal town of an estate of the same name in the north of the State of Udaipur, R\u0101jput\u0101na, situated in 25\u00b0 50' N. and 74\u00b0 17' E., close to the border of the British District of Merw\u0101ra, about 96 miles north-east of Udaipur city. Population (1901), 2,056. The town contains a post office and a vernacular school, and to the north are the remains of an old fort called Bair\u0101tgarh. The estate, which is held\nby one of the first-class nobles of Mew\u0101r, consists of 117 villages. The income is about Rs. 72,000, and a tribute of about Rs. 3,300 is paid to the Darb\u0101r. The Th\u0101kurs of Badnor belong to the Mertia branch of the R\u0101thor clan of R\u0101jputs, and claim descent from D\u016bda, a younger son of Rao Jodha. The first and most distinguished of the family was Jai Mal, who was killed at Chitor fighting against Akbar in 1567.\n\nBadn\u016br.\u2014Head-quarters of the District and tahs\u012bl of Bet\u016bl, Central Provinces, situated in 21\u00b0 55\u2032 N. and 77\u00b0 54\u2032 E., on the M\u0101chna river, 55 miles from It\u0101rsi station, and 115 miles from N\u0101gpur by road. A daily mail-cart service connects it with It\u0101rsi. Bet\u016bl, the old capital, from which the District takes its name, lies on the N\u0101gpur road, 3 miles from Badn\u016br, the latter town having informally become the District head-quarters in 1822, when the Deputy-Commissioner removed his residence to it from Bet\u016bl. The population in 1901 was 5,766, and Badn\u016br is a growing town. At a distance of 4 miles is Kherl\u0101, the former capital of one of the Gond dynasties, where there is an old fort now in ruins. Badn\u016br was created a municipality in 1867. The municipal receipts during the decade ending 1901 averaged Rs. 9,300. In 1903\u20134 they were Rs. 9,000, derived principally from a house tax and a grant from Provincial funds. The town is the principal trading centre for Bet\u016bl District. A station of the Swedish Mission has been established here; and Badn\u016br contains an English middle school with a hostel and garden, which were constructed partly from funds raised for a memorial to Queen Victoria. A dispensary is also maintained.\n\nBadrih\u0101t.\u2014Ruins in the L\u0101lb\u0101gh subdivision of Murshid\u0101b\u0101d District, Bengal, situated in 24\u00b0 18\u2032 N. and 88\u00b0 15\u2032 E., on the right bank of the Bh\u0101girathi, a few miles above Azimganj. An ancient city with a palace or fort once stood here. Stones and pillars engraved with P\u0101li characters, gold coins, and much broken pottery have been found; but nothing has yet been discovered which throws any light upon the history of the place. The P\u0101li inscriptions seem to point to the Buddhist period. The old Hindu name of Badrih\u0101t was changed by the Muhammadans to Ghiy\u0101s\u0101b\u0101d, in honour of Ghiy\u0101sud-d\u012bn, one of the Path\u0101n kings of Gaur, who is said to have been buried here.\n\nBadrin\u0101th.\u2014Peak of the Central Him\u0101layan axis in Garhw\u0101l District, United Provinces, reaching to a height of 23,210 feet above the sea. From the glaciers on its sides the Bishangang\u0101, an affluent of the Alaknand\u0101 river, and several other tributaries take their rise. On one of its shoulders, at an elevation of 10,400 feet, and on the road from Sr\u012bnagar to the M\u0101n\u0101 Pass, stands a shrine of Vishnu, which also bears the name of Badrin\u0101th (30\u00b0 45\u2032 N. and 79\u00b0 30\u2032 E.). The original temple is said to have been built by Sankar\u0101ch\u0101rya; but\nseveral buildings have been swept away by avalanches. The present structure is modern. It is conical in shape, and is surmounted by a small cupola covered with plates of copper and crowned with a gilded ball and spire. Below the shrine a sacred tank stands on the hill-side, supplied from a hot spring by means of a spout in the shape of a dragon's head. Pilgrims of both sexes bathe in the holy pool. The god is daily provided with dinner, and his comfort is carefully ensured in many other ways. The vessels on which he is served are of gold and silver, and a large staff of servants attend to his wants. The chief priest, known as the R\u0101wal, is always a Br\u0101hman of the Namb\u016bri class from Southern India. In 1896 a suit was instituted in the civil court and a scheme of management was framed, by which the R\u0101wal manages the secular affairs of the temple, subject to the control of the R\u0101j\u0101 of Tehri State. A large number of villages have been assigned for the maintenance of the temple, with a revenue demand of about Rs. 7,000. The temple is annually closed about November, when the priests remove the treasure to Joshimath for the winter, returning to Badrin\u0101th in May. Immense numbers of pilgrims annually visit Badrin\u0101th and other shrines in the hills.\n\nBadrpur.\u2014Railway station in Sylhet District, Eastern Bengal and Assam. See BADARPUR.\n\nB\u0101dsh\u0101hpur.\u2014Town in the Machhlishahr tahsil of Jaunpur District, United Provinces. See MUNGRA-B\u0100DSH\u0100HPUR.\n\nB\u0101dur\u012b\u0101.\u2014Town in the Basirh\u0101t subdivision of the Twenty-four Parganas District, Bengal, situated in 22\u00b0 45' N. and 88\u00b0 48' E., on the right bank of the Jamun\u0101 river. Population (1901), 12,921, of whom 7,974 were Hindus and 5,847 Muhammadans. The town has a considerable trade in jute, molasses, and sugar. B\u0101dur\u012b\u0101 was constituted a municipality in 1869. The income and expenditure during the decade ending 1901\u20132 averaged Rs. 5,000 and Rs. 4,800 respectively. In 1903\u20134 the income, which is mainly derived from a tax on persons (or property tax), and the expenditure were each Rs. 5,000.\n\nBadvel Taluk.\u2014North-eastern taluk of Cuddapah District, Madras, lying between 14\u00b0 37' and 15\u00b0 14' N. and 78\u00b0 45' and 79\u00b0 11' E., with an area of 755 square miles. The population in 1901 was 88,361, compared with 93,152 in 1891, the decrease being greater than in any other taluk in the District. The density is 118 persons per square mile, compared with the District average of 148. It contains two towns, Badvel (population, 10,883), the head-quarters, and Porum\u0101milla (5,522); and 111 villages. The demand for land revenue and cesses amounted in 1903\u20134 to Rs. 1,70,000. The annual rainfall is exactly equal to the District average of 28 inches. More than one-third consists of 'reserved' forests, the best being on the spurs of the Nallamalais which run down into the north-western portion of it.\nThe chief product is indigo. The taluk suffers from deficient water-supply; it possesses two of the finest tanks in the District\u2014at Badvel and Porum\u0101milla\u2014but has only one river, the Sagileru. The Sagileru irrigation project, which was completed in 1898\u20139, consists of a dam across the river and a channel 10 miles long supplying a chain of tanks. It has proved successful, as all the land suitable for cultivation and commanded by it has been readily taken up.\n\nBadvel Town ('the town of cloths').\u2014Head-quarters of the taluk of the same name in Cuddapah District, Madras, situated in 14\u00b0 44' N. and 79\u00b0 4' E., in the valley of the Sagileru, 32 miles from Cuddapah town. Population (1901), 10,833. It lies near a large tank which irrigates a wide extent of land. In the hamlet of Lakshmip\u0101lem is an ancient temple to Prasanna Venkateswarasw\u0101mi, and in the town itself are two other old shrines.\n\nBaffa.\u2014Town in the M\u0101nschera taluk of Haz\u0101ra District, North-West Frontier Province, situated in 34\u00b0 26' N. and 73\u00b0 13' E., on the right bank of the Siran river in the northern corner of the Pakhli plain. Population (1901), 7,029. This is the principal mart of Northern Haz\u0101ra and of the neighbouring independent tracts. The municipality was created in 1873. The income during the ten years ending 1902\u20133 averaged Rs. 4,500, and the expenditure Rs. 4,600. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 5,300, chiefly derived from octroi; and the expenditure was Rs. 4,700. A vernacular middle school is maintained by the municipality and the District board.\n\nB\u0101galkot T\u0101luka.\u2014South-western taluka of Bij\u0101pur District, Bombay, lying between 16\u00b0 4' and 16\u00b0 28' N. and 75\u00b0 26' and 76\u00b0 3' E., with an area, including the Bilgi petty subdivision, of 683 square miles. It contains one town, B\u0101galkot (population, 19,020), the head-quarters; and 160 villages. The population in 1901 was 123,456, compared with 119,033 in 1891. The density, 181 persons per square mile, is higher than in any other taluka. The demand for land revenue in 1903\u20134 was 1-25 lakhs, and for cesses Rs. 10,000. An area of about 100 acres is protected from famine by the Muchkundi tank, constructed with a capital outlay (to the end of 1903\u20134) of over 1\u00bd lakhs. For five years from October, 1903, its water is to be supplied free for non-perennial crops, a rate of Rs. 8 per acre being charged upon land bearing perennial crops. B\u0101galkot has the best climate in the District. The annual rainfall averages nearly 24 inches.\n\nB\u0101galkot Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the taluka of the same name in Bij\u0101pur District, Bombay, situated in 16\u00b0 11' N. and 75\u00b0 42' E., on the Ghatprabha river, and on the Southern Mahratta Railway. Population (1901), 19,020. B\u0101galkot is a place of considerable trade, with manufactures of silk and cotton goods and five cotton-presses. At Muchkundi, about 5 miles to the south-west of B\u0101galkot, is a large tank,\nconstructed for irrigation. B\u0101galkot has three markets\u2014an old market and two Jain and Ling\u0101yat markets. The municipality, established in 1865, had an average income during the decade ending 1901 of Rs. 24,000. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 23,000. The town contains a Subordinate Judge\u2019s court, a dispensary, and a municipal middle school. In early times B\u0101galkot is said to have belonged to the musicians of R\u0101vana, the demon king of Ceylon. In the sixteenth century it was in possession of the Vijayanagar kings. From 1664 to 1755 it was under the management of the Savan\u016br Naw\u0101b, from whom it was taken by the Peshw\u0101. In 1778 it passed to Haidar and again to the Peshw\u0101s, who in 1810 handed it over to Nilkanth Rao, Sars\u016bbahd\u012br, who held it until General Munro took it in 1818. Under the Peshw\u0101s, B\u0101galkot had a mint which was not abolished till 1835. The town contains four boys\u2019 schools with 558 pupils, and a girls\u2019 school with 80.\n\nBagasra.\u2014Petty State in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, Bombay.\n\nBagasra.\u2014Town in the Bagasra t\u0101luka of the Sorath Pr\u0101nt, K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, Bombay, situated in 21\u00b0 29' N. and 71\u00b0 E., 15 miles from Kunkavav on the Bhaunagar-Gondal-Jun\u0101garh-Porbandar Railway. Population (1901), 9,178. It belongs to the Vala K\u0101this, and is the seat of an Agency th\u0101na. Bagasra is situated in the vicinity of the Gir, or wild highlands which occupy the centre of the K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r peninsula. It was conquered about 1525 by Vala Mancha Bhaiya of Deog\u0101m Devli. Square cotton shirts (chop\u0101ls) and women\u2019s scarves (s\u0101dlas) are manufactured. It is also a mart for the Gir timber.\n\nB\u0101gdi.\u2014Ancient name for South Bengal. See B\u0100GRI.\n\nB\u0101gepalli.\u2014Northern t\u0101luk of Kol\u0101r District, Mysore, including the sub-t\u0101luk of Gudibanda, and lying between 13\u00b0 37' and 13\u00b0 58' N. and 77\u00b0 39' and 78\u00b0 8' E., with an area of 447 square miles. The population in 1901 was 65,621, compared with 58,086 in 1891. The t\u0101luk contains two towns, Gudibanda (population, 2,384) and B\u0101gepalli (1,789), the head-quarters; and 372 villages. The land revenue demand in 1903-4 was Rs. 1,47,000. The centre is crossed from north to south by the Dokkala-konda hills, and is covered with low jungle. The east drains to the P\u0101paghni, which forms the large Vy\u0101sa-samudra tank, and runs a little beyond the border, receiving in the north-east a stream called the Vandaman from the centre. The west is watered by the Chitr\u0101vati, which is dammed for some small channels. Iron ore is found and largely manufactured. There is a good breed of sheep.\n\nB\u0101geshw\u0101r.\u2014Village in the District and tahsil of Almor\u0101, United Provinces, situated in 29\u00b0 51' N. and 79\u00b0 48' E., at the confluence of the Sarj\u016b and Gom\u0101ti, which form a tributary of the K\u0101li or S\u0101rd\u0101. Population fluctuates considerably, and is about 800 in the autumn. The village was formerly a great trade centre for the exchange of the\nproduce of Tibet with that of the plains and also imported goods, but the Bhoti\u0101 merchants now travel to the submontane marts. B\u0101geshwar is also a place of pilgrimage, and contains a temple built about 1450, but an older inscription records a grant to a temple here by a Katy\u016bri R\u0101j\u0101. There are some curious tombs made of tiles, which are assigned by tradition to Mughal colonies planted by Tim\u016br. A dispensary is maintained, and there is a small school with 24 pupils.\n\nB\u0101gev\u0101di T\u0101luka.\u2014Central t\u0101luka of Bij\u0101pur District, Bombay, lying between 16\u00b0 20' and 16\u00b0 46' N. and 75\u00b0 38' and 76\u00b0 16' E., with an area of 764 square miles. It contains 117 villages, including B\u0101gev\u0101di (population, 6,159), the head-quarters, and Mangoli (5,287), but no town. The population in 1901 was 83,620, compared with 102,444 in 1891. The density, 109 persons per square mile, is much below the District average. The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was 2.19 lakhs, and for cesses Rs. 17,000. The Don valley in the north is very rich black soil; the rest of the t\u0101luka is red trap in the uplands and black soil in the hollows. The annual rainfall averages about 25 inches.\n\nB\u0101gev\u0101di Village.\u2014Head-quarters of the t\u0101luka of the same name in Bij\u0101pur District, Bombay, situated in 16\u00b0 34' N. and 75\u00b0 59' E., 12 miles from Telgi station on the Southern Mahratta Railway. Population (1901), 6,159. According to one account B\u0101gev\u0101di was the birthplace of Basava, the founder or reviver of the Ling\u0101yat faith. It has a temple of Baseshwar, with shrines of Ganpati, Sangameshwar, Mallik\u0101rjun, and Baseshwar. Of the chief wells, one named Basvanna is believed to be of the same age as the Basvanna temple. B\u0101gev\u0101di is said to have been formerly called Nilgiri Pattan, and afterwards Bagodi, a contracted form of Bagid\u0101 Hode, i.e. a bent ear of jow\u0101r, to which tradition ascribes the origin of Basvanna. The village contains a dispensary, a boys\u2019 school with 167 pupils, and a girls\u2019 school with 41.\n\nB\u0101gh.\u2014Village in the Amjhera district of Gwalior State, Central India, celebrated for the Buddhist excavations in its neighbourhood. It stands at the confluence of the W\u0101gh or B\u0101gh and Girna streams, from the former of which it takes its name, in 22\u00b0 22' N. and 74\u00b0 48' E. Population (1901), 1,793. As is usual in places containing Buddhist remains, the village lies on an old main route, that from Gujar\u0101t to M\u0101lw\u0101, close to the Udaipur gh\u0101t (pass), 12 miles north of Kuksh\u012b. Tradition assigns great importance to the place in early days, and the ruins of a large town are still traceable. This town is said to have been founded in the tenth century by one R\u0101j\u0101 Mordhaj, who built the local fort, remains of which are still to be seen. Later on it fell to R\u0101j\u0101 B\u0101gh Singh, whose descendants live in Girw\u0101ni close by, and are still locally called R\u0101j\u0101. In the eighteenth century it passed to the Peshw\u0101\nand finally to Sindhia. The famous caves, which lie about 4 miles west of the village, are of considerable archaeological interest. As usual, they are locally known as the P\u0101nch P\u0101ndu, the five P\u0101ndava brothers being supposed to have inhabited them. The caves are excavated in the face of a sandstone hill 850 feet above the sea. Owing to the disintegration of a belt of clay stone superimposed on the sandstone, the roofs of most of the caves have been destroyed. All of the caves, which number eight or nine, are vih\u0101ras or monasteries, there being apparently no chaitya hall or Buddhist church attached to them. In age they rank before the latest at Ajanta, and may be assigned to the sixth or seventh century A.D. In a room attached to the largest cave there existed formerly a series of frescoes equalling those at Ajanta. Unfortunately, they were never copied and have now vanished. Fergusson, remarking on the appearance of the figures depicted, considers that they represented people of Central Asia and not of India.\n\n[Transactions of the Bombay Literary Society, vol. ii; Journal of Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, vol. v; and Indian and Eastern Architecture, pp. 159, 446.]\n\nB\u0101ghal.\u2014One of the Simla Hill States, Punjab, lying between $31^\\circ 5'$ and $31^\\circ 19'$ N. and $76^\\circ 52'$ and $77^\\circ 5'$ E., with an area of 124 square miles. Population (1901), 25,720. The capital of the State is Arki, 20 miles north-west of Simla. The R\u0101n\u0101s of B\u0101ghal claimed descent from the Ponw\u0101r R\u0101j\u0101s of R\u0101jput\u0101na. Little is known of the early history of the State, but between 1803 and 1815 it was overrun by the Gurkhas. After their expulsion the British Government reinstated the R\u0101n\u0101. In 1875 the chief, Kishan Singh, was rewarded with the title of R\u0101j\u0101 for his services. The present R\u0101j\u0101, Bikram Singh, succeeded in 1904 at the age of twelve. During his minority the administration is conducted by a council, consisting of the brother of the late R\u0101j\u0101 and an official deputed by Government. The revenue is Rs. 50,000, out of which a tribute of Rs. 3,600 is paid.\n\nBagh\u0101t.\u2014One of the Simla Hill States, Punjab, lying between $30^\\circ 50'$ and $30^\\circ 58'$ N. and $77^\\circ 2'$ and $77^\\circ 12'$ E., with an area of 36 square miles. Population (1901), 9,490. The R\u0101n\u0101s of Bagh\u0101t claim descent from a R\u0101jput family of Dhar\u0101nagri in the Deccan. In 1805 the R\u0101n\u0101, being in alliance with the Bil\u0101spur State, was allowed to retain his territory by the Gurkhas, but in 1815 five-eighths of it was confiscated and made over to Pati\u0101la. In 1839 the State lapsed in default of a direct heir; but in 1842 it was restored to a brother of the late R\u0101n\u0101, only to escheat again in 1849. In 1860, however, it was once more restored, and R\u0101n\u0101 Dalip Singh, C.I.E., succeeded in 1862. He has proved himself a public-spirited chief. Bagh\u0101t has a revenue of Rs. 30,000. The sites for the cantonments of Kasauli and Solon were acquired from the State in 1842 and 1863, the tribute being reduced\nas compensation. It was remitted altogether in 1906, in connexion with arrangements concluded with the R\u0101n\u0101 for the supply of water to the Sab\u0101thu cantonment.\n\n**B\u0101gh\u0101t.**\u2014T\u0101luk in Medak District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, with an area of 451 square miles. The population in 1901, including j\u0101g\u012brs, was 57,973, compared with 52,819 in 1891. There are 110 villages, of which 52 are j\u0101g\u012br, and Mushir\u0101b\u0101d (population, 815) is the headquarters. The land revenue in 1901 was Rs. 75,000. These statistics include the t\u0101luk of Ibrahimpatan, transferred from Mahbubnagar District in 1905, which had an area of 393 square miles in 1901, with a population of 46,604. The paig\u0101h t\u0101luk of Shams\u0101b\u0101d lies to the west, with two villages, a population of 5,446, and an area of about 9 square miles. The name B\u0101gh\u0101t ('gardens') was given to the original t\u0101luk, because most of the 'crown' gardens were included in it. The t\u0101luk is watered by the river M\u016bsi and the Husain S\u0101gar (lake).\n\n**Baghelkhand.**\u2014A tract adjoining Bundelkhand and forming the easternmost section of the Central India Agency. It lies roughly between 22\u00b0 40' and 25\u00b0 0' N. and 80\u00b0 30' and 82\u00b0 57' E., and derives its name from the Baghela Rajput clan, which has held it during the last six or seven hundred years.\n\nThe tract falls naturally into two divisions, separated by the Kaimur range, which strikes across it from south-west to north-east. The section lying to the west of this range consists, except for a small area in the south, near the town of Maibar, where the Bandair (Bhander) range terminates, of a wide elevated plain about 1,100 feet above sea-level, while the eastern portion is a rough hilly tract cut up by a succession of long parallel ridges belonging to the Vindhyan system, heavily clothed in jungle. Through the western section runs the Tons river with its tributaries, while the Son and its affluents traverse the eastern section. The geological riches of this region are so varied as almost completely to epitomize the most important formations to be met with throughout Peninsular India. It includes, moreover, the type areas of several important groups, the Rewah, Bandair, Kaimur, Kheinjua, and Sirbu rocks, which derive their names from localities in this region. North of the Kaimur range all subdivisions of the Upper Vindhyan rocks are to be met with, while the Lower Vindhyan are more completely represented here than elsewhere in India, together with the curious volcanic ash-beds known as the porcellanites. The hills in the eastern section of the tract belong mostly to the Bij\u0101war formation, the underlying gneiss outcropping in the valleys. This region, lying between the Vindhyan outcrop in the north and the Gondw\u0101na in the south, occupies the site of a once lofty range, the materials for both the Vindhyan and Gondw\u0101na sediments being products of its denudation.\nThe Bij\u0101war rocks, moreover, exhibit an extraordinarily varied series, in which slates, sandstones, jaspers, bands of iron ore, limestones, basic lavas, and ash-beds are all represented. In the south the Bij\u0101wars and the underlying gneiss abut suddenly on the Gondw\u0101nas, which have been most carefully surveyed, on account of their coal-bearing strata (see Umari\u0101). Farther south Cretaceous rocks of the Lameta series and Deccan trap appear, the hill on which Amarkantak stands being formed of the latter rock. The known mineral riches of the region are considerable, and more detailed examination is certain to reveal others; coal, corundum, mica, galena, iron ores, ornamental marbles, red-banded jaspers, and the magnificent building materials furnished by Vindhyan sandstones and limestones are among its known treasures.\n\nThe hills in the eastern section are covered with heavy jungle, on which the khair (Acacia Catechu), s\u0101l (Shorea robusta), s\u0101j\u0101 (Terminalia tomentosa), mahu\u0101 (Bassia latifolia), tend\u016b (Diospyros tomentosa), ach\u0101r (Buchanania latifolia), s\u0101lai (Boswellia serrata), and a stunted form of teak are the common trees, while Grewia, Zizyphus, Phyllanthus, Carissa, dhawai (Woodfordia), and similar species predominate in the undergrowth.\n\nThe name Baghelkhand, or \u2018country of the Baghelas,\u2019 is of comparatively late origin, and cannot have become common before the seventeenth or eighteenth century, as it is never used by the Muhammadan historians, who invariably style the region Ghora or Bhatghora. Before the Muhammadan period the tract was known as D\u0101h\u0101la and Chedi, the latter term applying more strictly to the southern districts, now included partly in the Soh\u0101gpur pargana of Rewah State and partly in the Central Provinces.\n\nThe early Buddhist books, the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, the R\u0101m\u0101yana, and the Pur\u0101\u1e47as, all connect this region with the Haihaya, Kalachuri, or Chedi clan. Nothing definite is known of the rise of this clan, but the fact that they employ in their dated records an era of which the initial year corresponds to A.D. 249 points to their having become a tribe of local importance somewhere about the third century. Their original habitat is always placed on the Narbad\u0101, with M\u0101bhistmati or Maheshwar as their capital town. From this position they appear to have been driven eastwards and to have finally acquired K\u0101linjar, where Krishna Chedi is said to have slain an evil-minded king who practised cannibalism. With this stronghold as a base, they gradually extended their dominions over what is now known as Baghelkhand. During the fourth and fifth\n\n---\n\n1 The Economic Geology of India (1905); articles on \u2018Corundum,\u2019 \u2018Mica Deposits of India\u2019 in Memoirs of the Geological Survey of India, vol. xxxiv; \u2018The Vindhyan Series,\u2019 ibid., vol. vii, p. 1; \u2018The Southern Coal-fields of the Rewah Gondw\u0101na Basin,\u2019 ibid., vol. xxi, p. 137; \u2018The Geology of the Son Valley,\u2019 ibid., vol. xxxi, p. 1; \u2018Fossil Flora of the Gondw\u0101na System,\u2019 Feistmantel and Zeiller in the Palaeontologia India.\ncenturies the Gupta dynasty of Magadha was paramount over this region, as is shown by the records of the feudatory chiefs of the Uchhakalpa family and the Parivr\u0101jaka R\u0101j\u0101s of Kho. In one of these records the king is stated \u2018to have sought to give prosperity to the kingdom of D\u0101h\u0101la together with the eighteen forest kingdoms.\u2019 Special interest attaches to the term \u2018forest kingdoms,\u2019 as it is also employed by Samudra Gupta in the Allah\u0101b\u0101d pillar inscription, when detailing his conquests; and it refers no doubt to chiefs of this region, some of whom may possibly have been Haihayas. In the sixth century the Kalachuris must have become a ruling clan of some importance, as the B\u0101d\u0101mi king Mangalisa records his victory over Buddha Varman Kalachuri of Chedi; and the Brihat Sanhit\u0101, written at the same period, mentions the Chaidyas as an important Central Indian tribe. During the latter part of the seventh century the Kalachuris rapidly acquired the sovereignty of the whole tract, which came to be called after them Ched\u012bdesa or the land of the Chedis. Their chief stronghold was K\u0101linjar, and their proudest title K\u0101lanjar\u0101dhishwara, or \u2018lords of K\u0101linjar.\u2019 During this period the Chandels were rising to power in Bundelkhand, the Param\u0101ras in M\u0101lw\u0101, the R\u0101shtrak\u016btas in Kanauj, and the Ch\u0101lukyas in Gujar\u0101t and Southern India. The records of these clans relate many of their contests and alliances. The Kalachuris received their first blow at the hand of the Chandel chief Yasovarmma (925\u201355), who seized the fort of K\u0101linjar and its surrounding district, he and his successors assuming thenceforth the ancient Kalachuri title of \u2018lords of K\u0101linjar.\u2019 The Kalachuris were still, however, a powerful tribe and continued to hold most of their possessions until the twelfth century.\n\nIt is not quite certain when the Baghelas established themselves in this district. After the advent of the Muhammadans had broken the power of the Kalachuris, the country fell to the Bhars, Chauh\u0101ns, Sengars, Gonds, and other clans; and there is no proof that the Baghelas entered the region before the thirteenth century. It is probable that they gained a footing in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, after the destruction of their kingdom in Gujar\u0101t by Ulugh Kh\u0101n in 1296. From this time onward the history of the country becomes that of the Rewah State.\n\nThe ancient remains in the tract are considerable and have not as yet been exhaustively examined. The earliest monument dates from the third century B.C., when the Bh\u0101rhut st\u016bpa (see N\u0101god) was erected, while the remains include cave-temples of the fourth and fifth centuries and mediaeval temples of the tenth to the thirteenth century.\n\nThe population consists very largely of jungle tribes, of whom the Gonds and Kols are the most numerous. The soils met with are mar, a kind of black soil; and d\u016bmat and s\u012bgon, lighter soils found in the alluvial plateau north of the Kaimurs. In the hilly tracts south of\nthe Kaimur range, the soil is agriculturally of little value. Kodon and rice are the two staple food-grains.\n\nBaghelkhand Agency.\u2014A Political Charge in Central India, coinciding practically with the historical area of the same name described above. Of the total area of 14,323 square miles, 13,000 belong to the Rewah State, the remainder being divided between eleven minor holdings\u2014Baraund\u0101, N\u0101god, Maihar, Soh\u0101wal, Koth\u012b, Jaso, P\u0101ldeo, Pahra, Taraon, Bhaisaunda, and K\u0101mta Rajaula. It is bounded on the north by the Mirz\u0101pur, Allah\u0101b\u0101d, and B\u0101nd\u0101 Districts of the United Provinces; on the south by the Bil\u0101spur, Mandl\u0101, and Jubbulpore Districts of the Central Provinces; on the west by Jubbulpore District and the Bundelkhand Agency, and by a part of Mirz\u0101pur District; and on the east by the Tributary States of Chota N\u0101gpur. The population in 1901 was 1,555,024, of whom Hindus numbered 1,203,908, or 77 per cent.; Animists, 310,681, or 20 per cent.; Musalm\u0101ns, 39,549; and Christians, 165. The density is 109 persons per square mile. The Agency contains six towns: Rewah (population, 24,608), Satn\u0101 (7,471), Maihar (6,802), Umari\u0101 (5,381), Govindgarh (5,022), and Unchahra (3,785); and 6,556 villages. Satn\u0101 is the principal trade centre.\n\nTwo metalled roads of importance run through the Agency. One is the great Deccan road, which passes through Rewah, and divides at Mangaw\u0101n, one branch, partially metalled, leading to Allah\u0101b\u0101d, and the other to Mirz\u0101pur. The second road leads from Nowgong and Pann\u0101 in Bundelkhand to N\u0101god, Satn\u0101, and Rewah. The Agency is traversed by the East Indian Railway from Jubbulpore to Allah\u0101b\u0101d, the principal stations being at Maihar and Satn\u0101, and by the Beng\u0101l-N\u0101gpur Railway from Katni to Pendra, with stations at Umari\u0101 and Sahdol.\n\nAfter the disturbances of 1857 a Political officer was attached to the Rewah Darb\u0101r, and was at the same time put in charge of the minor holdings of Maihar, N\u0101god, Soh\u0101wal, and Koth\u012b. In 1862 this officer was withdrawn at the request of the Rewah Darb\u0101r, and these States were placed under the Political Agent in Bundelkhand. In 1871 the Baghelkhand charge was re-established under a separate officer, with head-quarters at Satn\u0101. In 1896 the estates of Baraund\u0101, Jaso, and the five Chaube J\u0101g\u012brs were transferred from Bundelkhand to Baghelkhand. Rewah alone is held under treaty, the remaining States and estates being sanad holdings. All transit dues in the Agency have been abolished.\n\nThe Political Agent exercises the usual general supervision over the affairs of the States, and in the case of all but Rewah personally deals with crimes of a heinous character. For that portion of the Jh\u0101nsi-M\u0101nikpur section of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway which lies\nin the estates of Pahra and Taraon, the Political Agent exercises the powers of a District Magistrate and a Court of Sessions.

The north of the subdivision is low-lying and contains numerous swamps, but the country is more open and there is less jungle than in the S\u0101tkhira subdivision. To the south the country merges in the Sundarbans, where the land is being steadily reclaimed. The population in 1901 was 363,041, compared with 340,559 in 1891, the density being 535 persons per square mile. The subdivision contains 1,045 villages, but no town. Its head-quarters are at B\u0101gherh\u0101t, a place containing several antiquities of interest. The chief trade centres are Morrelganj and Kachua.\n\n**B\u0101gherh\u0101t Village.**\u2014Head-quarters of the subdivision of the same name in Khuln\u0101 District, Bengal, situated in 22\u00b0 40\u2032 N. and 89\u00b0 47\u2032 E., on the Bhairab river. Population (1901), 1,124. In the neighbourhood are the ruins of several buildings left by Kh\u0101nja Ali, the pioneer settler in the Sundarbans (*see* Khuln\u0101 District), including a brick-built road from the bank of the Bhairab, a large hall known as the Sh\u0101t Gumbaz, and the mausoleum of Kh\u0101nja Ali. There is a large bi-weekly market, and an annual fair lasting for a month is held on the\noccasion of the \u015ar\u012bpancham\u012b. The village contains the usual public offices, a sub-jail with accommodation for 35 prisoners, and a Government-aided school.\n\n**B\u0101ghpat Tahsil.**\u2014North-western tahsil of Meerut District, United Provinces, comprising the parganas of B\u0101ghpat, Baraut, Kut\u0101n\u0101, and Chhaprauli, and lying between $28\u00b0 47'$ and $29\u00b0 18'$ N. and $77\u00b0 7'$ and $77\u00b0 29'$ E., with an area of 405 square miles. The population rose from 259,656 in 1891 to 297,506 in 1901. There are 218 villages and six towns, the chief of which are Baraut (population, 7,703), B\u0101ghpat (5,972), the tahsil head-quarters, Khekra (8,918), and Chhaprauli (7,058). In 1903\u20134 the demand for land revenue was Rs. 6,65,000, and for cesses Rs. 1,07,000. The density of population is high, being 735 persons per square mile. The tahsil lies between the Jumna and Hindan; but even the narrow kh\u0101dars of those rivers are fairly fertile, and a great part consists of an excellent loam, while ample irrigation is provided by the Eastern Jumna Canal. In 1903\u20134 the area under cultivation was 336 square miles, of which 190 were irrigated.\n\n**B\u0101ghpat Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of the tahsil of the same name in Meerut District, United Provinces, situated in $28\u00b0 57'$ N. and $77\u00b0 13'$ E., near the Jumna, 30 miles west of Meerut city by a metalled road. Population (1901), 5,972. B\u0101ghpat is identified with the Vy\u0101ghraprastha or \u2018place of tigers\u2019 of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, and its name is said to have been changed from B\u0101gp\u0101t to B\u0101ghpat by one of the Delhi emperors. The town is divided into two portions: the kasba or agricultural quarter, and the mandi or commercial quarter. Besides the tahsil, it contains a dispensary, and a branch of the American Methodist Mission. From 1869 to 1904 the place was administered as a municipality, with an average income and expenditure of Rs. 6,000, the chief tax being octroi. It has now been constituted a \u2018notified area.\u2019 Formerly B\u0101ghpat was the chief centre of the sugar trade with the Punjab, but Meerut and other towns have now taken its place to a large extent. In 1904 it contained three schools with 137 pupils.\n\n**B\u0101gl\u0101n.**\u2014A tract of country north of the S\u0101tm\u0101la Hills in N\u0101sik District, Bombay, which is now represented by the B\u0101gl\u0101n and Kalv\u0101n talukas. B\u0101gl\u0101n is a region of hills and streams, and has long been noted for the excellence of its garden cultivation.\n\nIn the earliest times of which record remains, the tract appears to have been held by a family of R\u0101thors, claiming kinship with the R\u0101thors of Kanauj, and to have formed a prosperous principality by reason of the fact that through it ran the main line of traffic between the Deccan and Gujar\u0101t. Up to the commencement of the seventeenth century the R\u0101thors of B\u0101gl\u0101n, who adopted the honorific title of Baharji, and coined their own money, wielded considerable power;\nbut they were from time to time reduced to the position of tributaries by the Sult\u0101ns of Gujar\u0101t or the overlords of the Northern Deccan. The first authentic notice of B\u0101gl\u0101n is in 1298, when Rai Karan, the last king of Anhily\u0101da, after his defeat by Ulugh Kh\u0101n, fled thither and maintained himself as an independent chieftain with the aid of R\u0101mdeo of Deogiri. It is probable that at this date the R\u0101thors of B\u0101gl\u0101n were tributaries of the Y\u0101davas of Deogiri. After the overthrow of R\u0101mdeo, the country became an apanage of the Musalm\u0101n rulers of Deogiri; but in 1347, during the disturbances which resulted in the Deccan becoming independent of Delhi, it passed out of the possession of the Bahmani kings. Thus in 1366 the B\u0101gl\u0101n chief is mentioned as allying himself with the rebel Bairam Kh\u0101n against Muhammad Sh\u0101h Bahmani I; while five years later, when Malik R\u0101j\u0101, the founder of the F\u0101r\u016bki dynasty, established himself in Kh\u0101ndesh, the chief was forced to become a tributary of Delhi. During the fifteenth century B\u0101gl\u0101n was subject to the Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d Sult\u0101ns, and in 1429 was laid waste by Ahmad Sh\u0101h Bahmani I; and save for a short period commencing in 1499, when the B\u0101gl\u0101n chiefs were forced to recognize the overlordship of the Niz\u0101m Sh\u0101hi dynasty of Ahmadnagar, they remained vassals of Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d until Akbar\u2019s conquest of Gujar\u0101t in 1573. The country is described in the Ain-i-Akbari (1590) as a mountainous and populous region between Surat and Nandurb\u0101r, in which excellent fruit of various kinds was grown. The chief was a R\u0101thor in command of 8,000 cavalry and 5,000 infantry, and possessed seven fortresses, two of which, Mulher and S\u0101lher, were posts of exceptional strength.\n\nOn his conquest of Kh\u0101ndesh in 1599, Akbar attempted to take B\u0101gl\u0101n; but after a seven years\u2019 siege was forced to compound with the chief, Prat\u0101p Sh\u0101h, giving him several villages in return for an undertaking to protect all merchants passing through his territory, to send presents to the emperor, and to leave one of his sons as a hostage at Burh\u0101npur.\n\nBairam Sh\u0101h, who succeeded Prat\u0101p Sh\u0101h, was attacked and reduced to the position of a vassal by Aurangzeb in 1637. A description of the country at that date is given in Elliot\u2019s History of India, vol. vii. A temperate climate, abundance of water, and the cultivation of excellent fruit combined to render it famous. It measured 200 miles in length by 160 in breadth, and contained 30 petty subdivisions and about 1,000 villages. It was bounded on the north by Sult\u0101npur and Nandurb\u0101r; on the east by Chandor; on the south by Trimbak and N\u0101sik; and on the west by Surat and the territory of the Portuguese. Tavernier (1640\u201366) speaks of B\u0101gl\u0101n as containing a large variety of valuable trees, vast quantities of antelope, hare, and partridge, and wild cows (probably bison) in its more mountainous parts. Sugar-cane was largely grown and supplied many sugar-mills and furnaces; and\nthe country generally derived much profit from the continuous stream of traffic between Surat and Golconda, which passed along its well-protected highways.\n\nBetween 1670 and 1672 the Mar\u0101th\u0101s appeared and succeeded in taking S\u0101lher fort, which, however, was eventually restored to the Muhammadans in 1684. Under the rule of the Niz\u0101m, who rose to independent power in the Deccan in 1724, a commandant was appointed to Mulher and a governor to B\u0101gl\u0101n; and this system seems to have been followed till 1795, when B\u0101gl\u0101n was ceded by the Niz\u0101m to the Peshw\u0101, who placed it, together with Kh\u0101ndesh, in charge of a Sars\u016bbahd\u0101r. The fort of S\u0101lher is supposed to have been granted by the Peshw\u0101 to R\u0101ni Gahin\u0101bai, wife of Govind Rao Gaikw\u0101r, who, after the battle of Dhadop (1768), remained for some time at Poona as a state prisoner and afterwards ruled at Baroda from 1793 to 1800. On the overthrow of the Peshw\u0101, Mulher fort was surrendered to the English on July 3, 1818, and the territory of B\u0101gl\u0101n was incorporated in Kh\u0101ndesh District. In 1869 B\u0101gl\u0101n was transferred to N\u0101sik District; and in 1875 it was, with its petty subdivisions of Jaikhedan and Abhona, formed into two t\u0101lukas\u2014B\u0101gl\u0101n and Kalv\u0101n.\n\n**B\u0101gl\u0101n T\u0101luka** (or Sat\u0101na).\u2014T\u0101luka of N\u0101sik District, Bombay, lying between 20\u00b0 26' and 20\u00b0 53' N. and 73\u00b0 51' and 74\u00b0 24' E., with an area of 601 square miles. There are 156 villages, but no town. The head-quarters are at Sat\u0101na. The population in 1901 was 64,645, compared with 65,562 in 1891. The density, 108 persons per square mile, is much below the District average. The demand for land revenue in 1903\u20134 was 1.8 lakhs, and for cesses Rs. 12,000. The chief river is the Mosam. B\u0101gl\u0101n is noted for its garden tillage. The western portion of the t\u0101luka is marked by steep and narrow ridges, running nearly east and west, which are usually crowned by perpendicular ledges of rock. The summits are in some places fortified. Between the ridges lie narrow valleys seamed by the beds of torrents. To the east and south the country is more open and level, with sparse isolated groups of flat-topped hills. Even in the level parts much of the land is fallow and covered with brushwood. The climate, especially in the west, is malarious after the rains; but at other seasons it is healthy and cool. The annual rainfall averages about 20 inches. In 1875 Sat\u0101na, with its two petty subdivisions or pethas of Jaikhedan and Abhona, was divided into two t\u0101lukas\u2014B\u0101gl\u0101n and Kalv\u0101n.\n\n**B\u0101gl\u012b.\u2014Thakur\u0101t** in M\u0101lw\u0101 Agency, Central India.\n\n**B\u0101gni.\u2014Village** in the V\u0101lya t\u0101luka of S\u0101t\u0101ra District, Bombay, situated in 16\u00b0 55' N. and 74\u00b0 26' E., 4 miles south-west of Ashta. Population (1901), 5,641. B\u0101gni is a large agricultural village alienated to the junior branch of the Mantri family, the senior branch of which lives at Isl\u0101mpur. The village, which contains a fortified citadel,\nencompassed by lofty walls and a deep moat, was formerly an outpost of the Bijapur kingdom. The relics of Muhammadan rule include a handsome mosque to the east of the village, and a mausoleum covered with a fine brocade presented by the Mantri family.\n\nB\u0101gor.\u2014Head-quarters of a pargana or subdivision of the same name in the State of Udaipur, R\u0101jput\u0101na, situated in $25^\\circ 22' N.$ and $74^\\circ 23' E.$, on the left bank of the Koth\u0101r\u012b river, a tributary of the Ban\u0101s, about 70 miles north-east of Udaipur city. Population (1901), 2,353. The pargana of B\u0101gor, which consists of 27 villages, was formerly a j\u0101g\u012br estate, and the four immediate predecessors of the present Mah\u0101r\u0101n\u0101 were all of the B\u0101gor house.\n\nB\u0101gri (or B\u0101gdi).\u2014Ancient name for South Bengal, said to have been given by king Ball\u0101l Sen in the eleventh century to the portion of the Gangetic delta immediately east of the Bh\u0101g\u012brathi river, corresponding with the southern Districts of the modern Presidency Division. The caste of B\u0101gd\u012bs either derived their name from this tract or gave their name to it.\n\nB\u0101gru.\u2014Town in the State of Jaipur, R\u0101jput\u0101na, situated in $26^\\circ 48' N.$ and $75^\\circ 33' E.$, on the Agra-Ajmer road, about 18 miles south-west of Jaipur city. It is the residence of a th\u0101kur, who serves the Jaipur Darb\u0101r with fourteen horsemen but pays no tribute. The place is famous for its dyed and stamped chintz, but the industry has suffered owing to cheap foreign imitations. There are two elementary indigenous schools attended by 28 boys.\n\nB\u0101h.\u2014South-eastern tahsil of Agra District, United Provinces, conterminous with the pargana of the same name, lying between $26^\\circ 45' N.$ and $26^\\circ 59' N.$ and $78^\\circ 12' E.$ and $78^\\circ 51' E.$, with an area of 341 square miles. The tahsil is sometimes called Pin\u0101hat. Population decreased from 125,848 in 1891 to 123,591 in 1901. There are 204 villages and one town, B\u0101h (population, 3,867), the tahsil head-quarters. The demand for land revenue in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 2,09,000, and for cesses Rs. 28,000. The density of population, 362 persons per square mile, is the lowest in the District. The tahsil is almost an island, being cut off from the rest of the District by the Utangan and Jumna on the north, and from the Gwalior State by the Chambal on the south. While the average breadth between these rivers is 8 or 9 miles, the wild maze of deep ravines which fringes them reduces the comparatively level central tract to a width of 4 or 5 miles. The villages in this area are perched on almost inaccessible positions\u2014a memorial of the time when security was required against the revenue collector and foreign invaders. While the actual ravines are totally barren, and do not produce even trees, the low-lying land, here called kachh\u0101r, is exceptionally fertile. This is especially the case near the Chambal, where black soil, called m\u0101r as in Bundelkhand, is common. The Utangan kachh\u0101r, though of\ndifferent composition, is equally fertile, while the Jumna lowlands are poorer. In 1903-4 the area under cultivation was 190 square miles, of which only 12 were irrigated, almost entirely from wells. The great depth of spring-level and the cost of irrigation make this tract peculiarly liable to distress in dry seasons, and it was the only tahsil in the District which lost in population between 1891 and 1901.\n\nBah\u0101dr\u0101n.\u2014Tahsil and head-quarters thereof in Bikaner State, R\u0101jput\u0101na. See Bh\u0101dra.\n\nBah\u0101durgarh.\u2014Former name of Is\u0101garh Zila, Gwalior State, Central India.\n\nBah\u0101durgarh.\u2014Town in the S\u0101mpla tahsil of Rohtak District, Punjab, situated in 28\u00b0 41' N. and 76\u00b0 56' E., 18 miles west of Delhi on the Rohtak road, and on the Southern Punjab Railway. Population (1901), 5,974. The name of the town was originally Sharaf\u0101b\u0101d. It was given in j\u0101g\u012br to Bah\u0101dur Kh\u0101n and T\u0101j Muhammad, Baloch chiefs of Farrukhnagar, in 1754, and its name changed to Bah\u0101durgarh. The j\u0101g\u012br was resumed in 1793 by Sindhia, and in 1803 the town and the surrounding villages were bestowed by Lord Lake on Ismail Kh\u0101n, brother of the Naw\u0101b of Jhajjar. The estate was confiscated in 1857, owing to the disloyalty of the chief, Bah\u0101dur Jang. The municipality was created in 1873. The income and expenditure during the ten years ending 1902-3 averaged Rs. 6,600. Both income and expenditure in 1903-4 amounted to Rs. 6,400, the income being chiefly from octroi. The town is of no commercial importance. The municipality maintains a vernacular middle school and a dispensary.\n\nBahalda.\u2014Village in May\u016brbhanj, one of the Orissa Tributary States in Bengal, situated in 22\u00b0 23' N. and 86\u00b0 5' E. Population (1901), 1,724. Bahalda is the head-quarters of the B\u0101mangh\u0101ti subdivision of the State, and is connected with Barip\u0101d\u0101, the capital, by a metalled road.\n\nBah\u0101walpur State.\u2014Native State under the political control of the Government of the Punjab, lying in the extreme south-west of the Province, between 27\u00b0 42' and 30\u00b0 25' N. and 69\u00b0 31' and 74\u00b0 1' E., with an area of 15,918\\(^1\\) square miles. On the north-east it adjoins Ferozepore District; and on the north-west the Sutlej separates it from Montgomery and Mult\u0101n Districts, and, after its junction with the Chen\u0101b, from Muzaffargarh District. The Indus then divides it from the Punjab District of Dera Gh\u0101zi Kh\u0101n and the Upper Sind Frontier District in Sind, the latter also adjoining it on the south. On the south-east it is bordered by the R\u0101jput\u0101na States of Jaisalmer\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) These figures do not agree with the area given in Table III of the article on the Punjab, and on p. 197 of this article, which is the area returned in 1901, the year of the latest Census. They represent a more recent survey.\nand Bikaner. Its length from north-east to south-west is about 300 miles, and its mean breadth 40 miles. Devoid of hills and streams, except the pools and backwaters of the three great rivers, it is divided lengthwise into three great strips. Of these, the first is a part of the Great Indian Desert, known as the Rohi or Cholist\u0101n; the central tract is chiefly desert, not capable of cultivation, identical with the B\u0101r or Pat uplands of the western Punjab; and the third, a fertile alluvial tract in the river valley, is called the Sind. The desert is separated from the central tract by a depression known as the Hakra, which must at one time have carried the waters of a large river. Opinions are divided as to whether this river was the Sutlej, the Ghaggar, or the Jumna.\n\nThe State lies entirely in the alluvium. The Cholist\u0101n is a deep mass of sand in which wells fail to reach a substratum of clay, and which is at some places overlaid with deposits of amorphous sulphate of lime, while its surface is a succession of sand-dunes, rising in places to a height of 500 feet, and covered with the vegetation peculiar to sandy tracts. The central upland is a stiff clay mixed with sand, and the riverain tract is a micaceous soil with alternating layers of light bluish silt.\n\nThe flora of the State is as varied as its natural divisions. The scenery of the fertile riverain with its countless palms is almost Egyptian in character, and the lotus abounds in the pools by the river. In the uplands and in the Sind tamarisk jungles stretch for miles; and in the Rohi there are stretches of kh\u012br (Caroxylon Griffithii), from which the State derives an income of more than Rs. 30,000.\n\nWolves are found in the Sind and Rohi, and the wild ass occurs in the latter. Hog and hog deer abound in the Sind, and antelope, chink\u0101ra, or \u2018ravine deer,\u2019 and nilgai in the uplands. Fish are common in the rivers, and the State derives a small income from the fisheries which are leased to the Jhabel, Mor, and Kehal\u2014three indigenous tribes of almost amphibious habits.\n\n\u2018In Bah\u0101walpur,\u2019 says a local proverb, \u2018rain changes into storms of wind.\u2019 In July and August showers fall occasionally, but the annual rainfall rarely exceeds 5 inches. This deficiency of rain causes a climate abnormally hot in spite of its extra-tropical latitude; and from the end of April to the middle or end of June the mean shade temperature is $103^\\circ$, the air is dry and the wind fiery, so that the growth of vegetation is imperceptible. During the monsoon clouds soften the temperature, and with only an inch of rain the country becomes fresh and green. After November the mean temperature falls to $60^\\circ$ or $65^\\circ$ with frosty nights. The climate is generally healthy, except in the Sind during the autumn. The water is bad in some places, and it is to this cause that the frequency of stone and scurvy is attributed. Spleen-disease is common.\n\nFloods are said to be less frequent than they were before the great\nPunjab canals were made. The flood of 1871, which covered some 1,300 square miles of the lowlands, threw large areas out of cultivation for a whole year.\n\nThe Abb\u0101si Daudputras, from whom the ruling family of Bah\u0101walpur has sprung, claim descent from the Abb\u0101sid Khal\u012bfs of Egypt. The tribe originally came from Sind, and assumed independence during the dismemberment of the Durr\u0101ni empire, the mint at Bah\u0101walpur being opened in 1802 by Naw\u0101b Muhammad Bah\u0101wal Kh\u0101n II with the permission of Sh\u0101h Mahm\u016bd of K\u0101bul. On the rise of Ranjit Singh, the Naw\u0101b, Muhammad Bah\u0101wal Kh\u0101n III, made several applications to the British Government for an engagement of protection. These, however, were declined, although the Treaty of Lahore in 1809, whereby Ranjit Singh was confined to the right bank of the Sutlej, in reality effected his object. The first treaty with Bah\u0101walpur was negotiated in 1833, the year after the treaty with Ranjit Singh for regulating traffic on the Indus. It secured the independence of the Naw\u0101b within his own territories, and opened up the traffic on the Indus and Sutlej. The political relations of Bah\u0101walpur with the paramount power, as at present existing, are regulated by a treaty made in October, 1838, when arrangements were in progress for the restoration of Sh\u0101h Shuj\u0101 to the K\u0101bul throne.\n\nDuring the first Afgh\u0101n War, the Naw\u0101b rendered assistance both in facilitating the passage of troops and in furnishing supplies; and in 1847\u20138 he co-operated actively with Sir Herbert Edwardes in the expedition against Mult\u0101n. For these services he was rewarded by the grant of the districts of Sabzalkot and Bhung, together with a life-pension of a lakh. On his death a dispute arose regarding the succession. He was succeeded by his third son, whom he had nominated for the throne in supersession of his eldest son. The new ruler was, however, deposed by his elder brother, and obtained asylum in British territory, with a pension from the Bah\u0101walpur revenues; he broke his promise to abandon his claims, and was confined in the Lahore fort, where he died in 1862. In 1863 and 1866 insurrections broke out against the Naw\u0101b, caused by cruelty and misgovernment. The Naw\u0101b successfully crushed the rebellions; but in March, 1866, he died suddenly, not without suspicion of having been poisoned, and was succeeded by his son, Naw\u0101b S\u0101dik Muhammad Kh\u0101n IV, a boy of four. After several endeavours to arrange for the administration of the country without active interference on the part of Government, it was found necessary, on account of disorganization and disaffection, to place the principality in British hands during his minority. The Naw\u0101b attained his majority in 1879, and was invested with full powers, with the advice and assistance of a council of six members. During the Afgh\u0101n campaigns (1878\u201380) the Naw\u0101b placed the entire resources of his State at the disposal of the British\nGovernment, and a contingent of his troops was employed in keeping open communications, and in guarding the Dera Gh\u0101zi Kh\u0101n frontier. On his death in 1899 he was succeeded by Muhammad Bah\u0101wal Kh\u0101n V, the present Naw\u0101b\\(^1\\), who attained his majority in 1901, and was invested with full powers in 1903. The Naw\u0101b of Bah\u0101walpur is entitled to a salute of 17 guns.\n\nThe principal archaeological remains are described in the articles on Bijnot, Marot, Pattan Mun\u0101ra, Sarw\u0101hi, Sui Veh\u0101r, and Uch.\n\nThe State contains 10 towns and 1,008 villages. The population at the three last enumerations was: (1881) 573,494, (1891) 650,042, and (1901) 720,877. It is divided into the three niz\u0101mat\\(^2\\)s or administrative subdivisions of Bah\u0101walpur, Minchin\u0101b\u0101d, and Kh\u0101npur, which derive their names from their headquarters. The chief towns are Bah\u0101walpur, the modern capital of the State, Ahmadpur East, Kh\u0101npur, Uch, Ahmadpur West, and Khaipur.\n\nThe following table gives the chief statistics of population in 1901:\n\n| Niz\u0101mat       | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|---------------|----------------------|-----------------|----------|------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Minchin\u0101b\u0101d   | 3,528                | 2               | 556      | 180,001    | 51.2                        | + 8.96                                                      | 4,205                                  |\n| Bah\u0101walpur    | 7,079                | 4               | 268      | 260,696    | 36.8                        | + 11.5                                                     | 16,104                                 |\n| Kh\u0101npur        | 5,311                | 4               | 184      | 279,280    | 52.6                        | + 10.9                                                     | 20,309                                 |\n| State total   | 15,000               | 10              | 1,008    | 720,877    | 48.0                        | + 10.9                                                     |                                        |\n\nNote.\u2014The figures for the areas of niz\u0101mat\\(^2\\)s are taken from revenue returns. The total State area is that given in the Census Report. Since 1901, 551 square miles have been transferred from Kh\u0101npur to Bah\u0101walpur, and the population given in the table is, in the case of each niz\u0101mat, the population in 1901 of the territory now comprised in that niz\u0101mat.\n\nAbout 83 per cent. of the people are Muhammadans. Since 9,881 square miles of the State are desert, the density of population appears low as compared with the Provincial average of 185, but the Sind tract is somewhat thickly populated and has gained considerably by immigration from the Punjab. Three-fourths of the people speak the dialect of Western Punjabi known locally as Mult\u0101n\u012b or Bah\u0101walpuri. This is spoken all along the river from Khaipur to Ahmadpur West and southwards to the Cholistan. Punjabi, also called Jatki (the Jat speech), and Ubhechar or Eastern, extends from Khaipur to the north-east border, while west of Ahmadpur West and round Kot Sabzal and Fatehpur M\u0101chk\u0101 Sind\u012b and Bah\u0101walpuri are spoken. In the Cholistan the M\u0101rw\u0101ri-R\u0101th\u012b dialect of R\u0101jasth\u0101n\u012b prevails.\n\n\\(^1\\) Naw\u0101b Muhammad Bah\u0101wal Kh\u0101n V died at sea in February, 1907, while returning from a pilgrimage to Mecca. His son, who succeeds as Naw\u0101b, H\u0101ji S\u0101dik Muhammad Kh\u0101n V, Abb\u0101si, is only two years of age.\nThe most important of the landowning tribes are the Jats, who number 192,000 and comprise 26 per cent. of the population, R\u0101jputs (107,000), and Balochs (65,000). Other agricultural tribes are the Arains (38,000), Daudputras (19,000), Khokhars (17,000), Path\u0101ns (11,000), and Kharrals (6,000). The only commercial class, the Aroras, numbers 66,000. Of the menials, the most important are the M\u0101chhis (fishermen, 23,000), Kumh\u0101rs (potters, 11,000), Mall\u0101hs (boatmen, 10,000), Julah\u0101s (weavers, 9,000), Mochis (shoemakers, 10,000), Jhinw\u0101rs (water-carriers, 8,000), and Tarkh\u0101ns (carpenters, 8,000). Saiyids number 11,000 and Shaikhs 14,000. The native Christians number only 6. About 58 per cent. of the population are dependent on agriculture.\n\nThe three natural tracts have already been described. The Rohi or Cholist\u0101n, bounded on the north and west by a depression called the Hakra, is pure desert, in which crops depend wholly on the scanty rainfall, and the vegetation is sparse. Unbricked wells are sunk, but their excavation in the sandy soil is a perilous task, as the spring-level is 80 feet below the surface. The second tract runs parallel to the Rohi. Its soil is a stiff clay mixed with sand, and though cultivation depends chiefly on the rainfall, wells are also worked. The third and richest tract in the State is the Sind or alluvial strip along the rivers. Every year its soil is enriched by floods, which leave a deposit of rich silt, and the land yields fine crops with little labour. The supply of water to the Sind is supplemented by a system of inundation canals and by wells. Large areas have been brought under cultivation during the last twenty-five years, owing to the extension of the system of inundation canals. Half a million acres of State land, which now brings in a revenue of 3 lakhs, have been leased to cultivators, the leases in most cases containing the promise of proprietary rights after a period of years. There is abundance of room for the extension of colonization in the Kh\u0101npur niz\u0101mat.\n\nThe following table shows the chief statistics of cultivation in 1903-4, areas being in square miles:\n\n| Niz\u0101mat     | Total | Cultivated | Irrigated | Cultivable waste |\n|-------------|-------|------------|-----------|------------------|\n| Bah\u0101walpur  | 7,079 | 417        | 370       | 580              |\n| Minchin\u0101b\u0101d | 3,528 | 515        | 419       | 1,200            |\n| Kh\u0101npur     | 5,311 | 519        | 572       | 1,427            |\n| Total       | 15,918| 1,451      | 1,361     | 3,207            |\n\nThe crops which covered the largest area in 1903-4 were wheat (607 square miles), rice (183), spiked millet (90), great millet (85), and gram (82).\n\nAlthough rules sanctioning advances were passed in 1879, they were\nnot made to any useful extent by the State till 1900, when Rs. 7,20,000 was advanced to cultivators for the sinking of 1,280 new wells and the repair of 159 old ones. Up to 1904 about 8 lakhs had been thus advanced.\n\nThe commonest domestic animals are the bullock and the buffalo. There is also a large number of camels in the State, many of which are employed in the Imperial Service Camel Corps.\n\nOf the total area cultivated in 1903\u20134, 1,361 square miles, or nearly 94 per cent., were irrigated. Of this area, 204 square miles were irrigated from both wells and canals, 14 from wells alone, 993 from canals, and 150 by inundation from the rivers. In that year the State contained 17,220 masonry wells, besides 2,420 unbricked wells. The State has a vast system of inundation canals which take off from the rivers, especially from the Sutlej.\n\nCash rents are very rare. Produce rents vary from one-fifth on unirrigated lands to one-half on some of the canal-irrigated and inundated lands in parts of the Kh\u0101npur and Bah\u0101walpur niz\u0101mat. The rent of canal-irrigated land in these two niz\u0101mat rules higher than in Minchin\u0101b\u0101d, where the tenant is responsible for the cost of canal clearance. Throughout the State, landlords realize in addition to the rent a number of dues of varying amounts. The occupancy tenant of the British Punjab is unknown in Bah\u0101walpur. Cash wages have risen very largely in the last few years, but except in towns the wages of labour are generally paid in kind.\n\nForests cover an area of 412 square miles; but of this a large portion is merely treeless waste, which is being gradually colonized by settlers from British Districts and other States, as well as by the people of Bah\u0101walpur itself. During the minority of the late Naw\u0101b extensive plantations were established, and these now yield a large income. The forests, plantations, and gardens realized an income of Rs. 1,60,000 in 1903\u20134. The chief forest officer is the Mohtamim jungl\u0101t, and the department is controlled by the Mush\u012br-i-\u0101la.\n\nKankar abounds in several places, especially in the MeLeodganj il\u0101ka of the Minchin\u0101b\u0101d tahsil. Saltpetre is also made from saline earth in several villages in the Minchin\u0101b\u0101d and Khairpur tahsils.\n\nThe only arts of any importance are the manufacture of silk lungis (ornamental turbans) and suf\u012bs (silk cloth). Metal cups are made at Bah\u0101walpur and Kh\u0101npur towns, while a very lucrative industry is the manufacture of impure carbonate of soda, which is exported in large quantities, especially from the Bah\u0101walpur tahsil. Ahmadpur East and Khairpur are noted for their porcelain vessels and shoes, and the latter also for its painted cloth of various kinds. The last decade has witnessed considerable industrial development on modern lines. Nine rice-husking mills\nhave been established\u2014one at Bah\u0101walpur, three at Kh\u0101npur, two at Allah\u0101b\u0101d, and one each at S\u0101dik\u0101b\u0101d, Kot Sam\u0101ba, and Naushahra. Cotton-ginning is also carried on in the mills at Bah\u0101walpur and Kot Sam\u0101ba, and in one of the Kh\u0101npur mills.\n\nThe trade of the State is free, all transit dues having been abolished under treaty with the British Government. The principal exports are wheat, gram, indigo, dates, mangoes and other fruit, wool, saltpetre, and the manufactured articles mentioned above. Cloth and gur (unrefined sugar) are the chief imports.\n\nThe Lahore-Kar\u0101chi branch of the North-Western State Railway enters the State at the centre of its north-west border by the Adamw\u0101han bridge across the Sutlej, and leaves it at Walhar in the extreme south-west, with a length of 148 miles within the State. This line is joined at Samasata by the Southern Punjab Railway, which enters the State near McLeodganj Road, 156 miles from Samasata, and has a branch to Ferozepore. There are 624 miles of unmetalled and about 40 miles of metalled roads.\n\nThe postal arrangements are peculiar. In return for an annual payment of Rs. 6,000, they are undertaken by the British Post Office. Official letters are conveyed free within the State, and the Postal department supplies service stamps free of charge to the value of Rs. 1,300 annually, for purposes of official correspondence outside the State. These arrangements have been in force since 1878.\n\nFamine in R\u0101jput\u0101na always causes a stream of immigration into Bah\u0101walpur, and in recent years the State has invariably made a point of providing work for the refugees. In 1899 the number of immigrants was 40,000. The able-bodied were employed on the canals, and many of the others were admitted into poorhouses. The total cost to the State of the relief measures was 2\u00b75 lakhs.\n\nThe direct functions of administration are exercised by the Naw\u0101b, who is assisted by a council of eleven members, comprising the Mushir-i-\u0101la or Waz\u012br (who is the president of the council), the foreign minister, the revenue minister, the chief judge, the finance minister, the commander-in-chief of the State forces, the minister of public works, the minister of the Naw\u0101b's household, the private secretary, the general secretary, and the minister of irrigation. The Political Agent for the Ph\u016blk\u012b\u0101n States and Bah\u0101walpur resides at Pati\u0101la.\n\nEach niz\u0101mat is divided into three tahsils. The nine tahsils are Minchinab\u0101d, Nahr S\u0101dik\u012by\u0101h, Khairpur, Bah\u0101walpur, Ahmadpur, Allah\u0101b\u0101d, Kh\u0101npur, Naushahra, and Ahmadpur Lamma. Each niz\u0101mat is in charge of a n\u0101sim, and each tahsil is in charge of a tahsild\u0101r and a nail-tahsild\u0101r.\nThe Mushir-i-M\u00e1l or revenue minister exercises general revenue control in the State. The n\u0101zims, t\u0101hsild\u0101rs, and naib-t\u0101hsild\u0101rs are subordinate to him in all matters connected with his functions. The State canals are in charge of a special minister.\n\nBills are introduced by the member in charge of the department concerned, and, after approval by the council, are submitted to the Naw\u0101b for his final assent. A large number of the Acts in force in British India have been adopted, including the Penal Code and the Procedure Codes.\n\nThe principal court is the Sadr Ad\u0101lat, established in 1870. It consists of a single judge called the chief judge, under whom are three district judges and five first-class and three second-class Munsifs. The district judges hear suits up to Rs. 10,000 in value, and also exercise the powers of magistrates with enhanced jurisdiction under sections 30 and 34 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The first-class Munsifs exercise the powers of first-class, and the second-class Munsifs those of second-class magistrates and Munsifs in British territory. The judicial department is also in charge of registration, the chief judge being chief registrar, the district judges registrars, and the Munsifs sub-registrars. Pleaders are not admitted to practise in the State courts. The commonest forms of crime are cattle-theft and the abduction of women.\n\nPrior to 1886 the State issued two rupees, the Bah\u0101walpuri, worth 12 annas, and the Ahmadpuri, worth 10 annas in British currency. It also coined gold mohars, Rs. 16 to Rs. 52 in value. It still coins a copper nikka paisa (or small pice), \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of which equal the British quarter anna. British coin is now current throughout the State.\n\nThe following table shows the revenue of the State in recent years, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 9.45   | 10.65  | 13.65  | 14.35  |\n| Total revenue  | 14.43  | 16.39  | 22.94  | 26.93  |\n\nApart from land revenue, the principal receipts in 1903-4 were forests (1.6 lakhs), and stamps (Rs. 98,000). The expenditure was chiefly: on the Naw\u0101b's court and household (12.8 lakhs), public works (3 lakhs), army (2.2 lakhs), police (1.5 lakhs), pensions (1.1 lakhs), and revenue administration (1.1 lakhs). There was a reserve balance in the State treasury at the end of the year of nearly 26 lakhs.\n\nPrior to 1866 the land revenue was mostly collected in kind, by division (batai) of the produce, the State taking one-fourth, one-third, or even two-fifths. In 1868 this system was abolished, and fixed assessments were imposed on each kind of crop. These rates were\nreduced in 1871-2, owing to a fall in prices. The summary settlements were completed in 1877, resulting in a revenue demand of 9.5 lakhs. The assessments were revised in 1889-91, and the revenue was raised to 11.3 lakhs. A further revision is now in progress. In the Bahawalpur and Khanpur niz\u0101ms, where the reassessment was completed in 1905, the increase amounts to 3.4 lakhs. Members of the Daudputra tribe, to which the Naw\u0101b belongs, hold revenue grants of the annual value of Rs. 74,000 on feudal conditions which are now obsolete. The revenue rates on cultivated lands vary from 8 annas per acre (unirrigated) to Rs. 5 per acre for gardens. The income from the grazing tax (tirni) in 1903-4 was 1.3 lakhs.\n\nThe Excise department is controlled by the Mush\u012br-i-M\u0101l. The contract for the manufacture and vend of country spirits is sold by auction annually, and in 1903-4 the State realized Rs. 25,000. The contractor arranges for the retail sale of the liquor, subject to the sanction of the department. The system in regard to the contract for the sale of opium and drugs is similar; Rs. 34,000 was realized for the contract in 1903-4. The import of opium from Bahawalpur into the British Punjab is prohibited. The State receives an allotment of 15 chests of M\u0101lw\u0101 opium per annum, each chest containing 1.25 cwt. The State pays a special duty of Rs. 280 per chest, instead of the ordinary duty of Rs. 725; but the duty so paid is refunded with a view to securing the co-operation of the State officials in the suppression of smuggling. By the agreement of 1879, the Naw\u0101b is bound to prohibit and prevent the manufacture of salt within the State, and in return receives a subsidy of Rs. 80,000 from the British Government.\n\nThe State contains sixteen municipalities, the committees being composed of nominated official and non-official members. Each is under the Mush\u012br-i-\u0101la as ex-officio president, and the Bahawalpur committee has one official vice-president, who also supervises the outlying municipalities. In 1903-4 the municipalities had an income, chiefly derived from octroi, of Rs. 88,000, and an expenditure of Rs. 82,000. Octroi is levied on the principles in force in British territory.\n\nThe Public Works department is under the control of the Mush\u012br-i-tam\u012br\u0101t, who has a seat on the council. The principal works that have been carried out by the department are the palace at Ahmadpur, and the palace at Bahawalpur, each of which cost 7 lakhs. A new palace at Bahawalpur is in course of construction, on which nearly a lakh had been spent up to the end of March, 1904. The total expenditure on public works in 1903-4 was 2 lakhs.\n\nIn 1888 the State organized a force of cavalry (two troops) and 450 infantry as Imperial Service troops; but in 1900 this force was disbanded, and an Imperial Service Silladar Camel Transport Corps raised instead. This consists of 355 men and 1,144 camels. There is\nalso an Imperial Service (Camel) Mounted Rifle Company, with 169 officers, non-commissioned officers, and men. The State further maintains the Niz\u0101m Infantry Regiment (492 strong), an orderly troop (103 strong), and an Imperial Service Reserve Company of 80 men. There are 13 serviceable guns. The military expenditure is about 2 lakhs annually.\n\nThe police force in 1904-5 consisted of 539 officers and men, including 47 camel-riders and 34 trackers, under a Superintendent, controlled by the Mush\u012br-i-\u0101la. A training school was opened at Bah\u0101walpur in 1904. Each tahsil is divided into several police circles (th\u0101n\u0101s), under a deputy-inspector. There are in all 30 circles, with 15 outposts. The expenditure on police in 1903-4 was Rs. 56,000. Village watchmen number 873. There is a central jail at Bah\u0101walpur town in charge of a Superintendent, who is under the Mush\u012br-i-\u0101la. It contains 17 wards, with accommodation for 2,000 prisoners. Female prisoners are kept in a separate ward, and life-prisoners in separate cells. The jail manufactures include daris, carpets, blankets, and paper.\n\nBah\u0101walpur stands thirty-first among the Districts and States of the Punjab in regard to the literacy of the population, of whom 2\u00b78 per cent. (5\u00b71 males and 0\u00b71 females) could read and write in 1901. Higher education is confined to Bah\u0101walpur, the capital. The State contains a college, called the S\u0101dik Egerton College, and a high school, both at Bah\u0101walpur, 7 Anglo-veracular middle schools, 32 primary schools, and 6 Muhamadan theological schools. There is also a Church Mission school at Bah\u0101walpur, to which the Naw\u0101b gives a grant-in-aid. Public schools are supervised by an Inspector. The total expenditure on education in 1903-4 was Rs. 33,000.\n\nThe State possesses two hospitals at Bah\u0101walpur town, and six outlying dispensaries. The two hospitals contain accommodation for 36 in-patients. In 1904 the number of cases treated was 27,232, of whom 403 were in-patients, and 3,591 operations were performed. The expenditure of the Medical department (including vaccination) in the same year was Rs. 29,000. The department is in charge of the State Medical officer. The number of successful vaccinations in 1903-4 amounted to 21\u00b79 per 1,000 of the population.\n\nA revenue survey of the entire inhabited area of the State was made in 1869-74. The maps were revised in 1880, and are now again under revision, those for the Kh\u0101npur and Bah\u0101walpur niz\u0101mat having been completed in 1904. A 4-inch survey of the riverain tracts and a 2-inch survey of the desert portion were carried out in 1869-74, the result being published on the 1-inch scale in 1876.\n\n[State Gazetteer (in press); Shah\u0101mat Ali, History of Bah\u0101walpur (1848).]\nBah\u0101walpur Tahsil.\u2014Head-quarters tahsil of the State and niz\u0101mat of Bah\u0101walpur, Punjab, lying south of the Sutlej, between 27\u00b0 52' and 29\u00b0 33' N. and 71\u00b0 19' and 72\u00b0 36' E., with an area of 3,617 square miles. The population in 1901 was 91,954, compared with 90,031 in 1891. It contains the town of Bah\u0101walpur (population, 18,546), its head-quarters and the capital of the State; and 107 villages. The tahsil is traversed by the Hakra depression, south of which lies the desert. The north lies in the Sutlej riverain, and between this and the Hakra are the central uplands. The land revenue and cesses amounted in 1905\u20136 to one lakh.\n\nBah\u0101walpur Town.\u2014Capital of the Bah\u0101walpur State, Punjab, and head-quarters of the Bah\u0101walpur niz\u0101mat and tahsil, situated in 29\u00b0 24' N. and 71\u00b0 47' E., on the North-Western Railway, on the south bank of the Indus, 65 miles south of Mult\u0101n. Population (1901), 18,546. Founded in 1748 by Naw\u0101b Bah\u0101wal Kh\u0101n I, it replaced Der\u0101war as the capital of the State. The town is surrounded by a mud wall 4 miles in circuit. The palace built by Naw\u0101b S\u0101dik Muhammad Kh\u0101n IV in 1882 is a vast square pile, with towers at each corner. The reception hall in the centre is 60 feet long and 56 high, the vestibule being 120 feet high. The palace contains underground apartments, where the thermometer remains at about 70\u00b0, while it rises to 100\u00b0 and even 110\u00b0 in the upper rooms. From the roof an extensive view is gained over the vast desert of Bikaner, which stretches away waterless for 100 miles. Five miles from Bah\u0101walpur, the North-Western Railway crosses the Sutlej by the magnificent iron-girder Empress Bridge, opened in 1878, 4,258 feet in length, consisting of 16 spans, each 250 feet long. The guesthouse or Nur Mahal, built in 1875 at a cost of 12 lakhs, is a handsome building in the Italian style. The town possesses the S\u0101dik Egerton College, the high school of the same name, an Anglo-vernacular middle school, a theological school, an orphanage, and two hospitals, one of which is the Jubilee Hospital for females, opened in 1898. It has a considerable trade and some flourishing industries, and contains a rice-husking mill, to which is attached a cotton-ginning factory. The municipality was constituted in 1874. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 32,500, chiefly from octroi. The cantonment contains the lines of the Niz\u0101m regiment and the Imperial Service Camel Corps.\n\nBaheri.\u2014Northern tahsil of Bareilly District, United Provinces, comprising the parganas of Sirs\u0101w\u0101n, K\u0101bar, Chaumahla, and Richh\u0101, and lying between 28\u00b0 35' and 28\u00b0 54' N. and 79\u00b0 16' and 79\u00b0 41' E., with an area of 345 square miles. Population fell from 207,063 in 1891 to 193,412 in 1901. There are 410 villages and two small towns, neither of which has a population of 5,000. The demand for land revenue in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 3,64,000, and for cesses Rs. 61,000. The\ndensity of population, 561 persons per square mile, is considerably below the District average. This tahsil was the only one which decreased in population between 1891 and 1901. It is a level plain, intersected by numerous small rivers which have nearly all been dammed to supply an extensive system of canals. It is damp and malarious, especially towards the north, and population is liable to fluctuate considerably with the variations in rainfall. This is the chief rice tract in the District, and sugar-cane is less grown than in the areas farther south. The latter crop is also inferior, and its place is taken by maize in the higher lands. In 1903\u20134 the area under cultivation was 258 square miles, of which 44 were irrigated, almost entirely from canals.\n\nBahlolpur (Bhilolpur).\u2014Village in the Samr\u0101la tahsil, Ludhi\u0101na District, Punjab, situated in 30\u00b0 55' N. and 76\u00b0 22' E. Population (1901), 2,194. It was founded in the reign of the emperor Akbar by two Afghans, Bahlol Kh\u0101n and Bah\u0101dur Kh\u0101n, whose descendants still live here. It is now of no importance. Three tombs, said to date from the time of Akbar, stand on the west side of the village.\n\nBahraich District.\u2014North-western District of the Fyz\u0101b\u0101d Division, United Provinces, lying between 27\u00b0 4' and 28\u00b0 24' N. and 81\u00b0 3' and 82\u00b0 13' E., with an area of 2,647 square miles. The shape of the District is that of an isosceles triangle, with its apex pointing north-west, and its base running from south-west to north-east. It is bounded on the west by the Kauri\u0101la or Gogra, which separates it from the Districts of Kheri, Sit\u0101pur, and B\u0101ra Bank\u012b; on the north-east by Nep\u0101l territory; and on the south-east by Gond\u0101. The physical features are well marked by the courses of the Gogra and Rapt\u012b. A belt of comparatively high land of a uniform breadth of 12 or 13 miles, and a total area of about 670 square miles, runs through the District in a south-easterly direction, dividing the basins of the two rivers. The great plain of the Gogra stretches away from the western edge of this strip of upland to the river itself. Tradition asserts, and the appearance of the country supports the theory, that in past ages the Gogra flowed immediately under this high bank. The plain is scored with numerous channels having a course generally parallel to that of the great river. The Gogra, or Kauri\u0101la as it is called in its upper reaches, enters Bahraich from Nep\u0101l on its extreme north-west corner. After a course of a few miles it is joined by the Girw\u0101, which itself is merely a branch of the Kauri\u0101la, leaving the parent stream in Nep\u0101l. The only other tributary of importance is the Sarj\u016b, a river also rising in Nep\u0101l, which joins the Kauri\u0101la at Katai Gh\u0101t. An old channel, likewise called the Sarj\u016b or Suheli, passes below the edge of the upland into Gond\u0101. It is said that this formerly carried the main stream, but a European timber\nmerchant diverted it to secure a more expeditious route for floating timber. The R\u0101pt\u012b crosses the north-east corner of the District, its principal tributary being known at first as the Bhakl\u0101, and later as the Singh\u012b\u0101. A small stream, named the T\u012brhi, rises a short distance from Bahraich town and flows into Gond\u0101. There are numerous lakes and jhils, the largest being the B\u0101ghel T\u0101l near Pay\u0101gpur. Many of them have been formed by the old beds of rivers.\n\nThe whole District is composed of alluvium, and even kankar or calcareous limestone is rare.\n\nThe flora is that of the sub-Himalayan area. At annexation most of the District, excluding the river valleys, was jungle, and considerable areas are still occupied by low forest growths. Along the Nep\u0101l border lie large stretches of 'reserved' forests, which will be described later. The rest of the District is also well wooded, groves of mangoes and mahu\u0101 (Bassia latifolia) having been planted largely, and shisham (Dalbergia Sissoo) to a smaller extent.\n\nOwing to the large area of forests and jungle, the District presents a varied fauna. Tigers, leopards, bears, wolves, hyenas, wild hog, s\u0101mbhar, spotted deer, swamp deer, hog deer, barking-deer, antelope, and nilgai are all found. In some places cattle have run wild and do much damage to the crops. Game-birds of the usual kinds are common, and fish abound in the rivers and tanks.\n\nThe climate is moist, and cooler than that of the Districts south of the Gogra; the cold season lasts long and the prevailing winds are easterly. The District is, however, malarious, especially after the close of the rains.\n\nThe annual rainfall averages 45 inches, the north receiving a slightly larger amount than the south. Variations are large: in 1870 the fall was 79 inches, and in 1864 only 24 inches.\n\nLegend connects the name of the District with Brahm\u0101, who is said to have chosen this area as his own special kingdom. Other traditions include it in the realm of R\u0101ja Karna, who is referred to in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. At the dawn of history the tract formed part of the kingdom of Northern Kosala, with its capital at Sr\u0101vasti. The identification of the site of this great city, at which Gautama Buddha spent several years of his life, is still a disputed question. Some writers place it at Set Mahet on the borders of Bahraich and Gond\u0101, while others believe that it lies on the R\u0101pt\u012b in Nep\u0101l. In the fifth and seventh centuries the country round Sr\u0101vasti was found by the Chinese pilgrims to be waste and desolate. Later traditions state that Bahraich was held by the Bhars, whose name it bears. The half-mythical raid of S\u0101l\u0101r Mas\u016bd, the Muhammadan warrior saint, ended in battle with the chiefs of the neighbourhood near Bahraich town in 1033. It was not, however, till the thirteenth\ncentury that a regular Muhammadan government was established in the trans-Gogra region. One of the earliest governors was N\u0101sir-ud-din Mahm\u016bd, son of Altamsh, who ruled here rigorously until he succeeded to the throne of Delhi in 1246. For the best part of a century the records of Bahraich contain nothing of note. The Ans\u0101ris, the descendants of the early Musalm\u0101n settlers and invaders, gradually extended their hold over the south of the District; but the Bhars were not crushed till later. In 1340 Muhammad bin Tughlak visited the tomb of Saiyid S\u0101l\u0101r, and made the first of a series of grants, from which sprang several of the great talukd\u0101ri estates. This grant was in favour of the Saiyids, who expelled the Bhars and acquired a large estate. F\u012broz Sh\u0101h Tughlak passed through the District and left a young Janw\u0101r R\u0101jput, named Bari\u0101r S\u0101h, to clear the country of banditti. Bari\u0101r S\u0101h resided at Ikaun\u0101, and his clan has provided owners for several estates in both Bahraich and Gond\u0101. About forty years later the Raikw\u0101rs established themselves in the west. Under Akbar the District, together with parts of Gond\u0101 and Kher\u012b, formed the Bahraich sark\u0101r. The Muhammadan rule was, however, never thoroughly effective till the appointment of Sa\u0101dat Kh\u0101n to the governorship of Oudh.\n\nThe great Raj\u0101s fought with each other or with the governor of Bahraich, and paid as little revenue as they could. All, however, had to yield to the new power, and for many years they were kept in check. Sa\u0101dat Ali Kh\u0101n, the sixth Naw\u0101b, first introduced a system of farming the revenue, under which the local governors paid a fixed amount, and appropriated surplus collections. The system worked well as long as it was adequately supervised, and the n\u0101zims or governors of Bahraich were at first able and considerate. Deterioration then set in, and oppression rose to its height under Raghubar Day\u0101l, who held the contract for 1846\u20137. The state of desolation to which the country was reduced is graphically described by Sir W. Sleeman, who passed through the District in 1849. The annexation of Oudh in 1856 put an end to this misrule and misery, though the work of organization was delayed by the Mutiny. The troops at Bahraich rebelled; and the officers, after an attempt to reach the hills, made for Lucknow, but were murdered on the Gogra. The talukd\u0101rs had lost little by the land policy adopted at annexation, compared with those of other Districts; but on the outbreak of the Mutiny, the majority joined the mutineers. Troops were not sent into the District till December, 1858, when the rebels fled to Nep\u0101l after a short campaign. Large estates were confiscated, and part of the District was restored to Nep\u0101l, from which it had been taken in 1816.\n\nA number of ancient sites still await exploration; relics of the Buddhist period have been discovered in places. The celebrated shrine of Saiyid S\u0101l\u0101r is situated about two miles north of Bahraich.\nTown. An old town, called Dogaon, was an important centre of trade in the Mughal period.\n\nThe District contains 3 towns and 1,881 villages. Population is increasing. The numbers at the last four enumerations were as follows:\n\n- (1869) 775,915,\n- (1881) 878,048,\n- (1891) 1,000,432,\n- (1901) 1,051,347.\n\nThere are three tahsils\u2014Bahraich, Kaisarganj, and Nanp\u0101ra\u2014each named from its headquarters. The principal towns are the municipalities of Bahraich, the District capital, and Nanp\u0101ra, and the 'notified area' of Bhing\u0101.\n\nThe following table gives the chief statistics of population in 1901:\n\n| Tahsil     | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|------------|----------------------|-----------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Bahraich   | 918                  | 2               | 688      | 377,588    | 411                       | +5.7                                                        | 18,426                                 |\n| Kaisarganj | 679                  | ...             | 647      | 348,172    | 513                       | +4.5                                                        | 7,933                                  |\n| Nanp\u0101ra    | 1,050                | 1               | 546      | 325,587    | 310                       | +4.6                                                        | 6,620                                  |\n| District total | 2,647              | 3               | 1,881    | 1,051,347  | 397                       | +5.1                                                        | 32,979                                 |\n\nHindus form more than 81 per cent. of the total, and Musalm\u0101ns more than 18 per cent. The density of population is much below the average for Oudh, but the increase during the last decade was considerable. Almost the whole population speaks the Awadh\u012b dialect of Eastern Hindi.\n\nThe most numerous Hindu caste is that of Ah\u012brs (graziers and cultivators), who number 125,000. Other castes largely represented are Kurmis (agriculturists), 95,000; Br\u0101hmans, 92,000; Cham\u0101rs (tanners and cultivators), 76,000; Koris (weavers), 51,000; P\u0101s\u012bs (toddy-drawers and cultivators), 48,000; Lodhas (cultivators), 43,000; Muraos (market-gardeners), 26,000; and R\u0101jputs, 25,000. Th\u0101rus, a tribe confined to the submontane swamps, are found in small numbers in the north of the District. The Mu\u1e25ammadans are chiefly Path\u0101ns, 33,000; Jul\u0101h\u0101s (weavers), 21,000; Behn\u0101s (cotton-carders), 14,000; and Nais (barbers), 11,000. Agriculture supports 70 per cent. of the total population, and general labour 5 per cent. Kurmis occupy more than one-sixth of the area held by tenants, and Brahmins, R\u0101jputs, and Ah\u012brs also cultivate large areas.\n\nOf the 173 native Christians enumerated in 1901, 148 were Methodists. The American Methodist Mission began work here in 1865, and has several branches in the District.\n\nThe soil of Bahraich is chiefly loam and clay. North of the R\u0101pt\u012b, and at one or two other places near the Nep\u0101l frontier, a moist tarai\n\n---\n\n1 W. Vost, Journal, Asiatic Society of Bengal, vol. lxiv, p. 69.\ntract occurs, which is especially favourable for the valuable late rice, but produces little else. The central plateau yields excellent wheat. The inferior early rice, followed by wheat or other spring crops, is grown in this tract, while late rice is grown in small depressions. The basins of the R\u0101pti and Gogra are more distinctly alluvial, and are very fertile except where the layer of rich silt above the sandy subsoil is thin. The larger rivers constantly flood their banks, but the Sarj\u016b and R\u0101pti generally deposit good silt, while the Gogra causes damage by bringing down sand.\n\nThe tenures are those usually found in Oudh. About 78 per cent. of the total area, excluding the forests, is held by talukd\u0101rs, and more than half is included in four large estates. A very small proportion is occupied by sub-settlement holders and under-proprietors. The main agricultural statistics for 1903-4 are given below, in square miles:\n\n| Tahsil     | Total | Cultivated | Irrigated | Cultivable waste |\n|------------|-------|------------|-----------|------------------|\n| Bahaich    | 918   | 591        | 105       | 124              |\n| Kaisarganj | 679   | 443        | 13        | 123              |\n| N\u0101np\u0101ra    | 1,050 | 524        | 20        | 181              |\n| **Total**  | **2,647** | **1,558** | **138**   | **428**          |\n\nWheat, maize, and rice are the crops most largely grown, and in 1903-4 covered 459, 447, and 422 square miles respectively, or from 29 to 27 per cent. of the net area cultivated. Gram (273 square miles), barley (156), and peas and mas\u016br (59) are the remaining food-crops of importance. Poppy covered 15 square miles and oilseeds 189.\n\nThere has been a very large increase in the cultivated area since the first regular settlement, amounting to 25 per cent. This is due both to the recovery of the District from the effects of misgovernment, and also to the clearing of jungle. No conspicuous changes in methods have taken place; but double cropping is more extensively practised, and the area under rice, wheat, and poppy is increasing rapidly. Population is still comparatively thin, and a large area is held by Br\u0101hmans and R\u0101jputs, who are inferior cultivators. Very few advances are taken under the Land Improvement and Agriculturists' Loans Acts. Out of a total of Rs. 11,600 lent during the ten years ending 1900, the single year 1896-7 accounted for Rs. 9,000. In four years since 1900 the loans averaged less than Rs. 2,000.\n\nIn the south of the District the cattle are of the ordinary inferior type, but towards the north they improve, and two good breeds are locally recognized, known as the N\u0101np\u0101ra and the Ris\u012ba. Though small, these cattle are active and hardy, and well fitted for agricultural work. The\nponies are also of poor quality, but better animals are imported from Nep\u0101l. Sheep and goats are kept in very large numbers and are used for penning on the land.\n\nIrrigation is required to a comparatively small extent. Tanks and jhils are the most important source, supplying 100 square miles in 1903-4, while wells irrigated 29, and other sources 9 square miles. In the river basins there is very little irrigation, as the soil retains sufficient moisture except for garden crops. Masonry wells are rarely used for irrigation. Small streams are dammed to supply water, especially the hill streams in the north-east. Water is raised from jhils by the swing-basket and from wells by the lever.\n\nBahraich includes an area of 334 square miles of 'reserved' forests in charge of a Deputy-Conservator. They are situated chiefly along the Nep\u0101l frontier, but also extend some distance south of the boundary. The chief timber tree is the s\u0101l (Shorea robusta); but many other species are found, including the t\u016bn (Cedrela Toona), mahu\u0101, haldu (Adina cordifolia), asna (Terminalia tomentosa), dhau (Anogeissus latifolia), &c. In the low-lying alluvial land shisham (Dalbergia Sissoo) and khair (Acacia Catechu) are common. The receipts on account of forest produce in 1903-4 amounted to 1.5 lakhs, the chief item being timber (1.2 lakhs).\n\nA little kankar is extracted in places and is used for making lime, but lime is also largely imported.\n\nCoarse cotton cloth is made in many villages for local consumption. The only industry known outside the District is that of felt-making.\n\nTrade and communications. Small rugs of felted wool are made and ornamented with patterns. Blankets are made at a few places, and excellent wood-carving was formerly produced.\n\nThe trade of the District has grown up since the commencement of British rule. The chief exports are grain, forest produce, oilseeds, and opium, while piece-goods, metals, salt, and sugar are imported. Timber is floated down the river, but the railway carries most of the trade. The chief markets are thus situated on the line of rail at Bahraich, N\u0101np\u0101ra, Pay\u0101gpur, and other smaller places. Gram, oilseeds, and spices from Nep\u0101l are largely carried by a branch of the railway which terminates on the frontier close to Nep\u0101lganj, and piece-goods, metals, salt, tobacco, and sugar enter Nep\u0101l from the same place. There are also other routes, and the total traffic with Nep\u0101l is valued at 25 to 30 lakhs a year.\n\nThe main line of the Bengal and North-Western Railway crosses the extreme southern corner of the District, while a branch from Gond\u0101 traverses it from end to end. The latter terminates at Kat\u0101rn\u012b\u0101n Gh\u0101t on the Girw\u0101, with a branch from N\u0101np\u0101ra to Nep\u0101lganj Road on the frontier. Road communications are poor. There are 619 miles of roads, but only 14 miles are metalled, owing to the difficulty and expense of\nobtaining stone. The whole cost is charged to Local funds. Avenues of trees are maintained on 133 miles.\n\nAn extensive failure of the crops owing to drought is unknown in Bahraich, and damage from excess is more common than loss from deficiency of rain. The principal effects of an exceptionally dry season are to injure the late rice, and curtail the sowings of a second crop after maize or early rice. Prices rise when there is famine elsewhere, and the labouring classes suffer. Thus in 1877 relief works and poorhouses were opened. In 1896-7, however, no relief was required.\n\nThe Deputy-Commissioner is usually assisted by three Deputy-Collectors recruited in India. An officer of the Opium department is stationed in the District, and a tahsildar at the headquarters of each tahsil.\n\nTwo District Munsifs and a Subordinate Judge comprise the ordinary civil courts of the District, which is included in the Civil and Sessions Judgeship of Gonda. Criminal work is usually light; but outbreaks of dacoity occur, and breaches of the peace are common. Although Bahraich has large grazing-grounds there are no professional cattle thieves.\n\nThe records of the summary settlement made in 1856 perished in the Mutiny. On the restoration of order a second summary settlement was made, the revenue demand amounting to 5.8 lakhs. In 1865 a survey commenced, which was followed by a regular settlement completed in 1872. In the greater part of the District the soil was divided into classes, and rent rates were selected from those actually paid, which were applied to the area in each class. The 'assets' of the grain-rented land were estimated by ascertaining the average annual value of the crops in each class of soil. The revenue demand was raised to 9.6 lakhs. This settlement was revised between 1896 and 1899, when regard was had to the different rates paid by high-caste and low-caste tenants. Where rents were paid in cash, the recorded rents were used as the basis of assessment. Nearly half of the area included in the holdings of tenants is, however, held on grain-rents, and rates were estimated for this land on the basis of the actual receipts recorded in the village papers. The result was an enhancement to 12.8 lakhs, of which 1.7 lakhs represented the revenue on permanently settled estates. The revenue of the temporarily settled portion of the District amounted to 45 per cent. of the corrected net 'assets,' excluding forests. The incidence is R. 0.9 per acre, varying in different parganas from R. 0.3 to Rs. 1.5. Collections on account of land revenue and revenue from all sources are shown in the table on next page, in thousands of rupees.\n\nThe District contains two municipalities, Bahraich and Nanpara, and one 'notified area,' Bhinga. Outside these towns, local affairs are\nmanaged by the District board, which in 1903-4 had an income of 1\u00b72 lakhs, of which half was derived from rates. The expenditure was 1 lakh, including Rs. 40,000 spent on roads and buildings.\n\n|                | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 9,77   | 9,94   | 11,53  | 12,07  |\n| Total revenue  | 11,81  | 12,18  | 16,24  | 17,40  |\n\nThere are 12 police stations; and the District Superintendent of police has under him a force of 3 inspectors, 74 subordinate officers, and 293 constables, besides 71 municipal and 2,153 rural police. The District jail contained a daily average of 250 prisoners in 1903.\n\nThe District takes a medium place as regards the literacy of its population, of whom 3\u00b71 per cent. (6\u00b75 males and 0\u00b71 females) could read and write in 1901. The number of public schools increased from 94 with 4,425 pupils in 1880-1 to 114 with 4,821 pupils in 1900-1. In 1903-4 there were 166 such schools with 6,694 pupils, of whom 121 were girls. Only 639 pupils had advanced beyond the primary stage. Two schools were managed by Government, and 91 by the District and municipal boards. The total expenditure on education was Rs. 30,000, of which Rs. 22,000 was derived from Local funds, and Rs. 6,000 from fees.\n\nThere are 14 hospitals and dispensaries, with accommodation for 88 in-patients. In 1903 the number of cases treated was 111,000, including 877 in-patients, and 4,082 operations were performed. The expenditure in the same year amounted to Rs. 14,000, chiefly met from Local funds.\n\nAbout 34,000 persons were successfully vaccinated in 1903-4, representing a proportion of 31 per 1,000 of population. Vaccination is compulsory in the municipalities.\n\n[P. Harrison, Settlement Report (1901); H. R. Nevill, District Gazetteer (1903).]\n\nBahraich Tahsil.\u2014Eastern tahsil of Bahraich District, United Provinces, comprising the parganas of Bahraich, Ikaun\u0101, Bhing\u0101, and Tulsipur, and lying between 27\u00b0 16' and 27\u00b0 56' N. and 81\u00b0 27' and 82\u00b0 13' E., with an area of 918 square miles. Population increased from 356,958 in 1891 to 377,588 in 1901. There are 688 villages and two towns: BAHRAICH (population, 27,304), the District and tahsil headquarters, and BHING\u0100 (5,972). The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was Rs. 5,04,000, and for cesses Rs. 82,000. The density of population, 411 persons per square mile, is slightly above the District average. Two large areas in the north are occupied by 'reserved' forests. A tract of tarai or damp rice land in the north, between the forests, is crossed by several streams running into the R\u0101pti. The valleys of this large river, and of its tributary the Singh\u012b\u0101, occupy the central part of\nthe tahsil, and on the south lies the upland plateau, drained by the Tirh\u012b. In 1903\u20134 the area under cultivation was 591 square miles, of which 105 were irrigated. Tanks or jhils are the chief source of supply, but wells are more used than in other parts of the District.\n\nBahraich Town.\u2014Head-quarters of Bahraich District and tahsil, United Provinces, situated in 27\u00b0 34' N. and 81\u00b0 36' E., on the Bengal and North-Western Railway. Population (1901), 27,304. The principal building of interest is the shrine of Saiyid S\u0101l\u0101r Mas\u016bd, a famous warrior and saint, who invaded Oudh about 1033, and, after several victories, was defeated and slain by the confederate Hindu chiefs. The tomb is a domed building erected two centuries after the saint\u2019s death, and it occupies the site of a former temple of the Sun. F\u012broz Sh\u0101h Tughlak added a wall and other buildings. A large fair, attended by about 100,000 persons, both Hindus and Muhammadans, takes place annually in May, when large offerings are collected. The shrine is now managed by a committee under the supervision of the Deputy-Commissioner. The town stands at the edge of a plateau on undulating ground, and is well drained. It contains a municipal hall and male and female dispensaries, besides a dispensary near the tomb, and is the head-quarters of the American Methodist Mission in the District. Bahraich has been administered as a municipality since 1869. During the ten years ending 1901 the income and expenditure averaged Rs. 26,000 and Rs. 25,000 respectively. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 32,000, chiefly derived from octroi (Rs. 23,000); and the expenditure was Rs. 34,000. The trade of the town has increased considerably since the opening of the railway, and a large traffic with Nep\u0101l passes through it. Grain, sugar, timber, and tobacco are the chief articles dealt in, and there is a small manufacture of felt. There are 11 schools with 900 pupils.\n\nBahr\u0101mg\u0101t.\u2014Village in the Fatehpur tahsil of B\u0101r\u0101 Bank\u012b District, United Provinces, situated in 27\u00b0 7' N. and 81\u00b0 27' E., on the right bank of the Gogra at its junction with the Chauk\u0101, on the broad-gauge line of the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway, and on a road from Lucknow to Gonda. Population (1901), 2,838. The place was formerly of commercial importance as the point at which traffic crossed the Gogra; and a bridge of boats, replaced during the rains by a ferry, is still maintained. The construction of the Elgin railway bridge a mile away has reduced the trade passing through it, but there is still a large traffic in timber and grain from Nep\u0101l and the Districts north of the Gogra. Timber is sawn here, and there is a small manufacture of furniture. A factory owned by a European turns out and repairs iron sugar-mills.\n\nBahrampur.\u2014Subdivision and town of Murshid\u0101b\u0101d District, Bengal. See BERHAMPORE.\nBaidyab\u0101ti.\u2014Town in the Serampore subdivision of Hooghly District, Bengal, situated in $22^\\circ 47'N.$ and $88^\\circ 26'E.$, on the right bank of the Hooghly river. Population (1901), 17,174. The town is an important trade centre, and Seor\u0101phul\u012b, a southern suburb, is a thriving market for jute and potatoes. A jute-mill at Ch\u0101mpd\u0101ni east of the town gives employment to 3,000 hands. Rope made of jute and hemp is manufactured within the town. Baidyab\u0101ti was constituted a municipality in 1869. The income during the decade ending 1901-2 averaged Rs. 20,000, and the expenditure Rs. 18,000. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 25,200, of which Rs. 8,000 was derived from a tax on persons, and Rs. 5,000 from a conservancy rate; and the expenditure was Rs. 22,000.\n\nBaidyan\u0101th.\u2014Site of temples in the Sant\u0101l Parganas District, Bengal. See Deogarh.\n\nBaig\u0101\u00b9.\u2014A primitive Dravidian tribe in the Central Provinces, with 25,000 members in 1901, residing principally in Mandl\u0101 and the adjoining Districts. The Binjh\u0101ls or Binjhw\u0101rs, who number 71,000, and are found chiefly in Sambalpur, were originally a subdivision of the Baig\u0101s, but have now become Hinduized, and are practically a separate caste. In Mandl\u0101 and B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t the Binjh\u0101ls are shown as a sub-caste of Baig\u0101s. They include several of the Sambalpur zamind\u0101rs. The Bhumi\u0101s ('guardians of the earth') are the same tribe as the Baig\u0101s, while the Bhain\u0101s of Bil\u0101spur are probably another offshoot, Raibhain\u0101 being shown as a sub-caste of Baig\u0101 in B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t.\n\nThe Baig\u0101s have several endogamous divisions, some of which will not eat with each other. The Gondwain\u0101s who eat beef and monkeys are the lowest sub-caste. Each sub-caste is divided into a number of exogamous septs, the names of which are identical in many cases with those of the Gonds. The septs are further divided, as among the Gonds, into groups worshipping different numbers of gods, and the marriage of persons worshipping the same number of gods is prohibited, although they may belong to different septs. This organization is probably taken from that of the Gonds, adopted in accordance with the usual principle of imitation at the time when the Gonds were a ruling race. Gond girls marrying Baig\u0101s are admitted into the caste.\n\nMarriage is adult, and a price varying from Rs. 5 to Rs. 20 is usually paid for the bride. Unchastity before marriage is said to be a rare occurrence. The ceremony presents no special features, except that it is considered essential that the bride's father should go out to meet the bridegroom's party riding on an elephant. As a real elephant is not within the means of a Baig\u0101, two wooden bedsteads are lashed together and covered with blankets, with a black cloth trunk in front, and this\n\n\u00b9 The greater part of this article is taken from a monograph furnished by the Rev. J. Lampard, missionary, Baihar.\narrangement passes muster for an elephant. A widow is expected to marry her husband's younger brother, and if she marries anybody else without his consent, he must be compensated by a payment of Rs. 5. Divorce is effected by the husband and wife jointly breaking a straw.\n\nThe dead are usually buried, old persons alone being burnt as a special honour, and to save them from the risk of being devoured by wild animals. The bodies are laid naked in the grave with their heads pointing to the south. In the grave of a man of importance two or three rupees and some tobacco are placed. Over the grave a platform is made on which a stone is erected. This is called the bhiri of the deceased, and is worshipped by his relations in time of trouble.\n\nTheir religion presents no special features; but a Baiga is frequently the priest in a Gond village, probably because as an earlier resident of the country he is considered to have a more intimate knowledge of the local deities and is therefore called in to lay spirits. Even a Brahman has been known to consult a Baiga priest and ask what forest gods he should worship, and what other steps he should take to keep well and escape calamity. The knowledge which the Baigas possess of the medicinal properties of jungle roots and herbs enables them to sustain their reputation among the other tribes as medicine men.\n\nThe Baigas are the wildest of all the forest tribes, and formerly practised only shifting cultivation, by burning down patches of jungle and sowing seed on the ground fertilized by the ashes after the breaking of the rains. Now that this practice has been prohibited in Government forests, attempts have been made to train them to regular cultivation, but with indifferent success in Balagh\u00e1t. One explanation of their refusal to cultivate is that they consider it a sin to lacerate the breast of their mother earth with a plough-share. They also say that God caused the jungle to produce everything necessary for the sustenance of man and made the Baigas kings of the forest, giving them wisdom to discover the things provided for them. To Gonds and others who had not this wisdom the inferior occupation of tilling the land was left. Men never become farm-servants, but during the cultivating season they work for hire at uprooting the rice seedlings for transplantation; they do no other agricultural labour for others. Women do the actual transplantation of rice, and work as harvesters. The men make bamboo mats and baskets, which they sell in the weekly village markets; they also collect and sell honey and other forest products, and are most expert at all work that can be done with an axe, making excellent wood-cutters. But they show no aptitude in acquiring the use of any other implement and dislike continuous labour, preferring to do a few days' work and then rest in their homes for a like period before beginning again. They hunt all kinds of wild animals with spears, poisoned arrows, and axes,\nwith a single blow of which they will often kill a leopard or other large animal. Their active and wiry frames, great powers of endurance, sharp eyes and ears, and supple limbs make them expert trackers of wild animals. They are also very clever at setting traps and snares, and catch fish by damming streams in the hot season, and, it is said, throwing into the pool thus formed some leaf or root which causes the fish to become partially stupefied and enables them to be caught easily with the hand. They never live in a village with other castes, but have their huts some distance away in the jungle. While nominally belonging to the village near which they dwell, so separate and distinct are they from the rest of the people that in the famine of 1897 cases were found of Baig\u0101s starving in hamlets only a few hundred yards from the village proper in which ample relief was being given. In character they are simple, honest, and truthful, and when their fear of a stranger has been dissipated are most companionable folk. The Baig\u0101s have no separate language of their own, but speak a broken Hindi.\n\n**Baihar (Behir).**\u2014Northern tahsil of B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t District, Central Provinces, lying between 21\u00b0 32' and 22\u00b0 24' N. and 80\u00b0 2' and 80\u00b0 3' E. In 1901 its area was 1,452 square miles, and its population 76,911 persons. In 1904 a redistribution of territory between the B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t and Baihar tahsils took place, and also a small interchange of area between the Baihar tahsil and Mandl\u0101 District. The adjusted figures of area and population are 1,774 square miles and 86,230 persons. The population in 1891 of the area now constituting the tahsil was 91,860. The density is 49 persons per square mile. The tahsil contains 493 inhabited villages. The head-quarters are at Baihar, a village of 1,298 inhabitants, 41 miles from B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t town by road. Excluding 664 square miles of Government forest, 26 per cent. of the available area is occupied for cultivation. The demand for land revenue on the present area in 1903-4 was Rs. 34,000, and for cesses Rs. 4,000. The tahsil consists of a series of elevated plateaux, divided and surrounded by hills, and covered for the most part with forest. Large areas of waste land are fit for cultivation, and their colonization on the ryotw\u0101ri system is in progress. The tahsil includes one whole zamind\u0101ri estate and parts of three others, with a total zamind\u0101ri area of 484 square miles, of which 132 are forest.\n\n**Baijn\u0101th.**\u2014Site of temples in the Sant\u0101l Parganas District. See Deogarh.\n\n**Baijn\u0101th (the ancient Kiragr\u0101ma).**\u2014Village in K\u0101ngra District, Punjab, situated in 32\u00b0 2' N. and 76\u00b0 43' E., 11 miles east of P\u0101lampur. Population (1901), 6,555. Two Hindu temples here bear inscriptions in the ancient S\u0101rada character, which give the pedigree of the R\u0101j\u0101nakas or princes of Kiragr\u0101ma, who were kinsmen and feudatories of the kings of J\u0101landhara or Trigartta. The date of the inscriptions is\ndisputed. Formerly attributed to the early part of the ninth century, they are assigned by a recent investigator to a period three or four centuries later. One of these temples was seriously damaged by the earthquake of April 4, 1905.\n\n[Epigraphia Indica, vol. i, pp. 97-119; Journal, Royal Asiatic Society (1903), p. 16, note.]\n\nBaijn\u0101th.\u2014Village in the District and tahsil of Almor\u0101, United Provinces, situated in 29\u00b0 55' N. and 79\u00b0 37' E., on a cart-road from K\u0101thgod\u0101m. Population (1900), 148. Baijn\u0101th lies in the centre of the Katy\u016br valley, and was formerly known as K\u0101rttikeyapura, a capital of the Katy\u016bri R\u0101j\u0101s. On a neighbouring hill stands an old temple, sacred to K\u0101l\u012b, at which kids and buffalo calves are sacrificed to the goddess, especially at the Dasahra. Other old temples are to be seen in the valley, and some copperplates are preserved; inscriptions found here yield a series of dates from A.D. 1202. The valley now contains several tea plantations. A dispensary is maintained at Baijn\u0101th.\n\nBaikal.\u2014Village in South Kanara District, Madras. See Bekal.\n\nBairagni\u0101.\u2014Village in the Sit\u0101marhi subdivision of Muzaffarpur District, Bengal, situated in 26\u00b0 44' N. and 85\u00b0 20' E., on the east bank of the Lal Baky\u0101 river, on the Nep\u0101l frontier. Population (1901), 2,405. Bairagni\u0101, which is the terminus of a branch of the Bengal and North-Western Railway, is a large grain and oilseed d\u00e9p\u00f4t of growing importance, where the dealers of the plains meet the hillmen and the Nep\u0101l trade changes hands.\n\nBair\u0101t (Vair\u0101ta).\u2014Head-quarters of the tahsil of the same name in the Tor\u0101wati niz\u0101mat of the State of Jaipur, R\u0101jput\u0101na, situated in 27\u00b0 27' N. and 76\u00b0 12' E., about 42 miles north-by-north-east of Jaipur city. Population (1901), 5,637. The place contains a vernacular middle school attended by 138 boys, and an elementary indigenous school. Bair\u0101t is of very great antiquity, two inscriptions of the time of Asoka (250 B.C.) having been found within a mile of the town, besides copper coins believed to be of an even earlier date. It has been identified as the capital of the old province of Matsya, celebrated in Hindu legends as the abode of the five P\u0101ndavas during their exile of twelve years from Delhi. The earliest historical notice of the place is that of the Chinese pilgrim, Hiuen Tsiang, in A.D. 634; he mentions the existence of eight Buddhist monasteries, but found them much ruined and the number of monks small. In the beginning of the eleventh century Mahm\u016bd of Ghazni invaded the country and sacked the town, which is said to have remained more or less deserted for about 500 years; but it was certainly in existence in Akbar's time, as it is mentioned in the Ain-i-Akbari as possessing very profitable copper-mines. The latter have not been worked for many years.\n\n[Archaeological Survey of Northern India, vols. ii and vi.]\nBairi\u0101.\u2014Town in the District of Balli\u0101, United Provinces, situated in $25^\\circ 46' N.$ and $84^\\circ 29' E.$, 20 miles east of Balli\u0101 town, on the road to Ch\u0101pra in Bengal. Population (1901), 8,635. The town is little more than a conglomeration of mud-built houses, traversed from east to west by one good street. It is administered under Act XX of 1856, with an income of about Rs. 1,100. There is a considerable export trade in sugar and coarse cotton cloth, which are manufactured here, and the shoes made locally have some reputation in the surrounding Districts. Bairi\u0101 contains a dispensary and a town school with 116 pupils.\n\nBaisw\u0101r\u0101.\u2014The name given to several tracts of country in various parts of the United Provinces, from the fact that they belong or have belonged to the Bais R\u0101jputs. The most important of these includes a number of parganas (traditionally twenty-two) in the eastern half of Unao District, the western half of R\u0101e Bareli, and the extreme south of Lucknow, with a total area of nearly 2,000 square miles. The Bais R\u0101jputs first became of importance here in the thirteenth century, when two of them, named Abhai Chand and Nirbhe Chand (who are supposed to have come from Mung\u012b P\u0101tan in the Deccan), rescued the Gautam R\u0101n\u012b of Argal, who had been attacked by the Muhammadan governor of Oudh. Nirbhe Chand died of his wounds, and the R\u0101j\u0101 of Argal gave his daughter to Abhai Chand, who settled at Daundi\u0101 Khera. Tenth in descent from him was Tilok Chand, who lived about 1400, and extended the area held by the Bais to the limits described above. Legends are numerous about Tilok Chand, who became the greatest noble in Oudh, and opposed the Muhammadans, as did his immediate successors. According to one account, he defeated the Chauh\u0101n R\u0101j\u0101 of Mainpur\u012b, who thereupon gave him a daughter to wife, though the Bais were reckoned inferior to the Chauh\u0101ns. In the eighteenth century the bravery of the chiefs of Baisw\u0101r\u0101 gained the admiration of Sa\u0101dat Kh\u0101n, founder of the Lucknow dynasty. Under the Naw\u0101bs Baisw\u0101r\u0101 formed a separate administrative division, as described above. The Baisw\u0101r\u0101 Division formed by the British Government after annexation consisted of R\u0101e Bareli, Part\u0101bgarh, and Sult\u0101npur, the last two Districts having nothing to do with the real Baisw\u0101r\u0101. The tract has given its name to a dialect of Eastern Hindi, which differs very slightly from other dialects of that language. Its inhabitants still bear a reputation for bravery. It was a Bais chieftain, Drigbijai Singh, who saved the four survivors of the Cawnpore massacre from their pursuers in 1857.\n\n[C. A. Elliott, Chronicles of Oonao, p. 66 et seq.]\n\nBaitaran\u012b.\u2014River of Bengal. Rising among the hills in the north-west of Keonjhar State, Orissa, in $21^\\circ 28' N.$ and $85^\\circ 33' E.$, it flows first in a south-westerly and then in an easterly direction, forming suc-\ncessively the boundary between Keonjhar and Mayurbhanj States, between Keonjhar and the District of Cuttack, and between Cuttack and Balasore. In the latter District the Br\u0101hma\u1e47\u012b joins it in $20^\\circ 45' N.$ and $86^\\circ 49' E.$, after the Baitaran\u012b has had a course of 224 miles, and the united stream flows, under the name of the Dh\u0101mra, into the Bay of Bengal. The river is navigable as high as Olokh, 15 miles from its mouth; beyond this point it is not affected by the tide, and is fordable during the hot season. This river is the Styx of Hindu mythology; and a legend has it that R\u0101ma, when marching to Ceylon to rescue his wife Sit\u0101 from the ten-headed demon R\u0101vana, halted on its banks on the borders of Keonjhar. In commemoration of this event large numbers of people visit the river every January. The chief tributaries are the S\u0101land\u012b and Matai in Balasore District. The principal places on the banks are Anandapur in Keonjhar State, and Olokh and Ch\u0101ndb\u0101li in Balasore District. The river is crossed by the Orissa High-level Canal, which derives from it a portion of its water-supply.\n\n**Baj\u0101na.**\u2014State in the K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r Political Agency, Bombay, lying between $22^\\circ 58'$ and $23^\\circ 10'$ N. and $71^\\circ 40'$ and $71^\\circ 59'$ E., with an area of 183 square miles. The population in 1901 was 10,279, residing in twenty-seven villages. The revenue in 1903-4 was Rs. 71,000, and 38 square miles were cultivated. Baj\u0101na ranks as a fourth-class State in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r. The J\u0101ts or Jats of Baj\u0101na originally came from V\u0101nga B\u0101z\u0101r in Sind, whence they were driven by one of the rulers in consequence of their refusing him a bride from their community, and were forced to seek shelter with the Ponw\u0101rs in the M\u0101ndav hills near Th\u0101n. The J\u0101ts were employed in the siege of Ch\u0101mp\u0101ner, and there displayed such prowess that the Sult\u0101n bestowed on their leader, Malik Hedoji, the twenty-four villages subject to Baj\u0101na. Shortly after this they conquered Mandal from the Jh\u0101las. Malik Is\u0101ji next established himself at V\u0101livda and subsequently at V\u0101r\u0101hi, which he took from R\u0101vm\u0101s, while Malik L\u0101kha and Malik Haidar Kh\u0101n settled respectively in S\u012bt\u0101pur and Vanod and in Baj\u0101na. V\u0101r\u0101hi and its neighbourhood is called Great Jatv\u0101r, and Baj\u0101na and its neighbourhood Little Jatv\u0101r.\n\n**B\u0101jaur.**\u2014A tract of country in the D\u016br, Sw\u0101t, and Chitr\u0101l Agency, North-West Frontier Province, lying between $34^\\circ 25'$ and $35^\\circ 5'$ N. and $70^\\circ 1'$ and $72^\\circ$ E. It comprises five valleys: namely, Chah\u0101rmung, B\u0101b\u016bkara, Watalai (or Ut-lai), R\u016bd in the valley of the R\u016bd river, and the S\u016br Kamar valley, in which lies Nawagai. In the last, the Nawagai, Chamarkand, and Suran ravines unite to form the Pipal, or Ambah\u0101r river, which falls into the Sw\u0101t some distance below its junction with the Panjkora. B\u0101jaur is bounded on the north by the Panjkora river; on the east by the Utm\u0101n Khel and Mohmand territories, the latter also bordering it on the south; and on the west by the crest of the\neastern watershed of the Kunar river, which divides it from Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n. Its population probably amounts to 100,000, and its area to nearly 5,000 square miles. Lying at a lower elevation than D\u012br, B\u0101jaur has a smaller rainfall, and the snowfall on the range in which the affluents of the R\u016bd take their rise is also slight. In consequence the hills are not well wooded; and though the R\u016bd, the most important of the five valleys, is very fertile, B\u0101b\u016bkara, Chah\u0101rmung, and Watalai are not so productive. The history of the tract is dealt with in the article on Sw\u0101t.\n\nThe R\u016bd valley is peopled by various Path\u0101n tribes, Tarkanri or Tarkilanri Y\u016bsufzai, Mohmands, S\u0101f\u012bs, Utm\u0101n Khel, and others. Chah\u0101rmung and B\u0101b\u016bkara are held by the Salarzai, and Watalai by Mamunds, both sections of the Tarkanri. The political system, if it can be termed system, is a communal form of party government, subject to the control of the Kh\u0101n of Nawagai, who is nominally the hereditary chief of all B\u0101jaur. Under him the country is divided into several minor Kh\u0101nates, each governed by a chieftain, usually a near relative of the Kh\u0101n. But virtually the authority of the chieftains is limited to the rights to levy tithe, or ushar, when they can enforce its payment, and to exact military service if the tribesmen choose to render it. Public, or rather tribal, affairs are managed by the jirga or assembly of the party in power, and in this assembly each landowner has a vote.\n\nBaj-Baj.\u2014Town in the Twenty-four Parganas District, Bengal. See Budge-Budge.\n\nB\u0101jitpur.\u2014Town in the Kishorganj subdivision of Mymensingh District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, situated in 24\u00b0 13' N. and 90\u00b0 57' E. Population (1901), 10,027. The town was formerly noted for its fine muslins, and the East India Company had a factory here. The industry has declined, but the gal\u0101b\u0101t\u0101n s\u016bris of B\u0101jitpur still command a large sale. B\u0101jitpur was constituted a municipality in 1869. The income during the decade ending 1901-2 averaged Rs. 2,950, and the expenditure Rs. 2,800. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 4,500, of which Rs. 2,600 was derived from a tax on persons (or property tax); and the expenditure was Rs. 3,500.\n\nBajranggarh.\u2014Fort in R\u0101ghugafh State, Central India.\n\nBajw\u0101ra.\u2014Ancient town in the District and tahsil of Hoshi\u0101rpur, Punjab, situated in 31\u00b0 31' N. and 75\u00b0 57' E., 2 miles south-east of Hoshi\u0101rpur. Population (1901), 2,653. It is said to have been founded by immigrants from Ghazni, and was once the chief town of the District, tradition relating that its walls were 18 miles in circumference. It is mentioned in the Ain-i-Akbari as famous for horses. Todar Mal, Akbar's minister, is said to have broken up the town into small divisions as a punishment for the inhabitants not receiving him with proper respect. In later times it was held by Sird\u0101r Bh\u016bp Singh,\nFaizullahpuri, who was ousted in 1801 by R\u0101j\u0101 Sans\u0101r Chand. The latter built a fort here, which was taken by Ranjit Singh in 1825. Since then the town has declined and its ruins have been largely used for road-metal. The fort was utilized as a military prison in the earlier years of the British administration, but was afterwards dismantled; and at the present time only two ruined bastions are in existence. The town has an Anglo-vernacular high school.\n\nB\u0101karganj.\u2014District in Eastern Bengal and Assam. See Backergunge.\n\nBakhira T\u0101l (also called Bad\u0101nch T\u0101l or Moti Jhil).\u2014A lake on the eastern border of Bast\u012b District, in the United Provinces. Buchanan described it as the finest piece of fresh water he had seen in India. It covers a space of about 5 miles by 2, but is merely a shallow depression filled with water, the depth of which rarely exceeds 4 or 5 feet. On the west and south the fringe of marsh is small; but on the north a tract, which is regularly flooded in the rains, extends for 3 miles. To the east a low fen stretches for about 2 miles to the edge of the R\u0101pt\u012b. The water in the lake is largely supplied by floods from this river, and would escape again but for an embankment along the eastern side. Fish are plentiful, and are caught in screens at the outlets of the dam or speared with a thin piece of bamboo tipped with iron. In the cold season the surface of the water is covered with wild-fowl. Boro or summer rice is largely planted in February or March round the edges of the lake.\n\nBakhtgarh.\u2014Thakur\u0101t in the Bhop\u0101war Agency, Central India.\n\nBakhtiy\u0101rpur.\u2014Village in the B\u0101rh subdivision of Patna District, Bengal, situated in 25\u00b0 27' N. and 85\u00b0 32' E., on the East Indian Railway. Population (1901), 234. It is 22 miles from Patna and 310 miles from Calcutta, and is the nearest station for Bih\u0101r town, with which it is connected by a light railway.\n\nBakloh.\u2014Cantonment in the Path\u0101nkot tahsil of Gurd\u0101spur District, Punjab, situated in 32\u00b0 29' N. and 75\u00b0 56' E., in the Outer Him\u0101layas, 14 miles below Dalhousie. Population (1901), 3,042. The permanent garrison consists of the two battalions 4th Gurkha Rifles. The station staff officer is also Cantonment Magistrate.\n\nBakreswar.\u2014A group of hot sulphur springs, in the head-quarters subdivision of Birbh\u016bm District, Bengal, situated in 23\u00b0 53' N. and 87\u00b0 22' E., on the banks of the Bakreswar stream, about a mile south of Tantip\u0101ra village. The temperature of the water varies from 128\u00b0 to 162\u00b0. About 120 cubic feet of water per minute are ejected from the hottest well. A group of temples to Siva, mostly modern, are much resorted to by pilgrims. Bakreswar is also a pithasth\u0101n or sacred place, where the forehead of the goddess Sakt\u012b is said to have fallen.\n\nB\u0101l\u0101ganj.\u2014Village in the North Sylhet subdivision of Sylhet Dis-\ntrict, Eastern Bengal and Assam, situated in $24^\\circ 39'$ N. and $91^\\circ 50'$ E., on the right bank of the Kusiy\u0101ra river. It is the most important centre of trade in the Surm\u0101 Valley, with a large business in rice, mustard, linseed, jute, oil, sit\u0101lp\u0101\u1e6d\u012b mats, and salt. The public buildings include a dispensary. B\u0101l\u0101ganj is a place of call for river steamers, and a European firm has opened a warehouse for the sale of salt and oil.\n\n**Bal\u0101garh.**\u2014Village in the head-quarters subdivision of Hooghly District, Bengal, situated in $23^\\circ 8'$ N. and $88^\\circ 28'$ E., on the bank of the Hooghly river. Population (1901), 763. Bal\u0101garh is the seat of a large boat-building and timber trade. On the alluvial islands in the vicinity vegetables are largely grown for the Calcutta market.\n\n**B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t.**\u2014The name given in Ber\u0101r to the upland country above the Ajanta ridge, sloping southwards beyond the gh\u0101ts or passes which lead up to it from the north. The B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t is the most northerly portion of the table-land of the Deccan.\n\n**B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t** ('above the passes').\u2014The name given by the Musalm\u0101ns of Bij\u0101pur to a region in Southern India conquered by them from Vijayanagar in the seventeenth century. It comprised the north-east part of Mysore and the Bellary, Anantapur, Kurnool, and Cuddapah Districts of Madras.\n\n**B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t** (*B\u0101l\u0101*, 'above,' and *gh\u0101t*, 'a mountain pass').\u2014Range of hills in the western half of Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State. It extends from the Bilol\u012b taluk in N\u0101nder District in the east, through the southern portion of Parbhani District, past Dh\u0101r\u016br and P\u0101toda to Ashti in Bh\u012br District in the west, having a length of 200 miles and a width which varies between 3 and 6 miles. A spur of this range branches off from Ashti, and taking a south-easterly direction traverses the tracts which lie between the rivers Sina, M\u0101nja, and K\u0101gna, comprising the Districts of Bh\u012br, Osm\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d, and Gulbarga, and terminates in the last-named District. Another spur starts from the south of Parbhani District, also in a south-easterly direction, and passes through the R\u0101j\u016bra taluk of Bidar District, south of Kaul\u0101s in Niz\u0101m\u0101b\u0101d District. The country enclosed by the range and its two spurs forms a plateau, known locally as the B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t.\n\n**B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t District** ('above the passes').\u2014District in the N\u0101gpur Division of the Central Provinces, lying between $21^\\circ 19'$ and $22^\\circ 24'$ N. and $79^\\circ 39'$ and $81^\\circ 3'$ E., with an area of 3,132 square miles. It is bounded on the north by Mandl\u0101 District; on the east by Bil\u0101spur and Drug Districts, and by the Kawardh\u0101 and Khair\u0101garh States; on the south by Bhand\u0101ra; and on the west by Seoni.\n\nPhysical aspects. B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t consists of an upland section of the most easterly portion of the S\u0101tpur\u0101 plateau, and of a strip of low country forming part of the valley of the Wain-ganga, and extending along the southern and western border of the\nhills. The eastern ridge of the S\u0101tpur\u0101s, known as the Maikala range, divides it from the Chhattisgarh plain. The hills and elevated plateaux, which occupy about two-thirds of the District, extend in the north almost across its entire width, with the exception of a small lowland strip to the north-west consisting of the valley of the Waingang\u0101, here only about 10 miles wide, and forming the Mau estate. The greater part of the hilly country is included in the Baihar tahsil, and, outside the Feudatory States, is perhaps the wildest and most backward area in the Province. It consists mainly of the three table-lands of Parasw\u0101ra, Baihar, and Raigarh, from west to east. The Raigarh plateau, about 2,000 feet high, is a small open stretch of undulating country covered with high grass, and surrounded by thickly wooded hills, the highest peaks of which rise to 2,900 feet. It is drained by the H\u0101lon and Kashmiri rivers, and is approached from Baihar by the passes of Bhains\u0101gh\u0101t and Lapt\u012b running through dense forest. The main table-land of Baihar, to the west of Raigarh and about 200 feet below it, is also very undulating and covered with thick forest, the soil being generally sandy, and cultivation consisting principally of the minor autumn millets, as the slopes are frequently too steep to permit of the growth of rice. The valley is watered by the Banj\u0101r and its tributary the Tannor, which passes Baihar. Farther west and separated from the Banj\u0101r valley by a long ridge lies the Parasw\u0101ra plateau, slightly lower than that of Baihar and somewhat more fertile. It is watered by the Kanh\u0101r, a tributary of the Banj\u0101r, and on the west is bounded by another range of hills leading down to the Waingang\u0101 valley. The drainage of this part of the District is north to the Narbad\u0101. South of the main plateau the hilly country consists of small and scattered table-lands, with a southerly inclination and gradually narrowing in from the west. The hills are for the most part covered with forests belonging to samind\u0101ri estates. Along the base of the outer spurs of hills lies the plain country of the District, forming part of the valley of the Waingang\u0101, narrow and closely shut in by the hills to the north, and gradually opening out on both sides of the river to the south-east and south-west. The general elevation of this part of the District is about 1,000 feet above sea-level. It is watered by the Waingang\u0101 and several minor streams, the principal of which are the B\u0101gh, Ghisr\u012b, Deo, and Son. The Waingang\u0101 flows nearly due south through B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t, its width varying from 200 yards in the upper reaches to 400 lower down. Its bed is generally rocky. The B\u0101gh rises in the Chichgarh hills of Bhand\u0101ra, and flows north and north-west, forming for a short distance the boundary between B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t and Bhand\u0101ra. It is crossed by the S\u0101tpur\u0101 Railway just before its junction with the Waingang\u0101 on the border of the District. The Ghisr\u012b, Deo, and Son rise in the eastern range of hills, and join the B\u0101gh after a short and rapid course. On the west of the Waingang\u0101 the low country,\nbroken in places by isolated hills, lies along the eastern and southern border of the portion of the S\u0101tpur\u0101 range belonging to Seoni District, a triangular strip of which abuts into B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t. The Sar\u0101thi is the only stream of any consequence on this side. The lowland country is well watered and studded with fruit trees, and is principally devoted to the growth of rice.\n\nGneissic and metamorphic rocks are the main formations, and there are a few outliers of Deccan trap in the north. The gneissic rocks belong partly to a highly metamorphosed sedimentary and volcanic series, resembling the Dh\u0101rw\u0101r schists of Southern India and known locally as the Chilpi beds. The metamorphic or transition rocks consist of quartzites, shales, and limestones.\n\nThe extensive forests of the District are mainly of the mixed character usual in Central India. Along the Waingang\u0101 river are scattered patches of teak (Tectona grandis), and towards the north-east s\u0101l (Shorea robusta) is the dominant tree. In various parts of the District fine clumps of bamboos occur. Besides s\u0101l, which is plentiful, and teak, which is always scarce or local, the principal trees to be met with are s\u0101j (Terminalia tomentosa), beul\u0101 (Pterocarpus Marsupium), shisham (Dalbergia Sissoo), dhaur\u0101 (Anogeissus latifolia), pal\u0101s (Butea frondosa), aonl\u0101 (Phyllanthus Emblica), haldu (Adina cordifolia), lend\u012b (Lagerstroemia parviflora), moyen (Odina Wodier), with species of Diospyros, Schleichera, Schrebera, Soyymida, Boswellia, Bombax, Garuga, Buchanania, and Stereospermum. Shrubs and small trees include Grewia, Zizyphus, Nyctanthes, Flueggea, Cleistanthus, Woodfordia, and Casearia.\n\nThe usual kinds of game, including tigers, leopards, and deer, are fairly plentiful. Bison are found in the Son\u0101w\u0101ni forests, in Bij\u0101garh, and in the north of the plateau. Herds of nilgai roam on the Raigarh plateau, and swamp deer are met with in the Topl\u0101 Reserve. There are a few herds of antelopes on the Baihar plateau. In the Hirri forests are some wild cattle, descended from tame ones let loose, which do serious damage to the crops but are not killed. Wild duck are plentiful in the tanks in the open country, but snipe are less frequent.\n\nThe uplands of Baihar are subject to sharp frosts in December and January, which cause much injury to the foliage of trees and the cold-season crops. The climate of B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t is that of the Nagpur plain, but it is especially damp during the monsoon. As usual in rice country, malaria is prevalent in the autumn months. The Baihar tahsil, owing to its heavy rainfall and dense forest, is notoriously unhealthy from August to December, and the mortality from malaria has largely contributed to retard immigration. The particles of mica suspended in the water also tend to produce gastritis.\n\nThe annual rainfall at B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t averages 62 inches, exceeding that of any other District in the Province. The District owes its copious rain-\nfall to the fact that it is encircled by hills on the north and east, on which the rain-clouds brought up by the south-west monsoon impinge. Until within the last few years the rainfall has seldom been deficient.\n\nB\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t, as it now stands, has only recently been constituted. The Baihar tahsil formerly belonged to Mandl\u0101 District, and formed part of the dominions of the Gond dynasty of Garh\u0101 Mandl\u0101. The eastern part of it was for some time assigned to the chief of Kawardh\u0101 as a reward for service. Soon after the beginning of the nineteenth century the greater part of the tahsil was laid waste by an inroad of the Gond R\u0101n\u012b of R\u0101mgarh in Mandl\u0101, and at the time of cession in 1818 the country was sparsely populated. Of the low country, the old parganas of Hatt\u0101, Dhansu\u0101, and L\u0101nji were included in Mandl\u0101, while the tract on the west of the Waingang\u0101 belonged to the Deogarh kingdom, which was annexed by the Bhonsla rulers of N\u0101gpur in 1743. In 1798 the Bhonslas also obtained the Mandl\u0101 territories, and most of what is now the B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t tahsil was then administered from Bhand\u0101ra. At this period the greater part of it was covered with forest, and several of the present zamind\u0101ri estates originated in grants of territory made by the Mar\u0101th\u0101s for the purpose of opening up the country. In 1862, when the Baihar tahsil, then attached to Mandl\u0101, was being settled, the attention of Government was directed to its natural resources, and it was recommended that special measures should be taken to colonize it. With this object sanction was obtained in 1867 to the formation of a new District, consisting of the Baihar tahsil and a fringe of open country below the hills which was taken from Bhand\u0101ra and Seoni Districts, and from which was to be obtained a supply of colonists for the upland plateaux. The task of reclaiming from waste the hitherto almost unknown plateau of Baihar was entrusted to Colonel Bloomfield, for many years Deputy-Commissioner of B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t District, and under his management some progress was made towards settling the large expanse of fertile waste land with sturdy Ponw\u0101r peasantry. But owing principally to the unhealthiness of the climate, and partly also to changes in Government policy and the neglect of local officials, no very great or permanent advance has been made; and the tract remains one of the poorest in the Province. Very recently fresh measures have been taken for the systematic encouragement of immigration. A scheme for liberal advances for the reclamation of land has been sanctioned, the construction of a number of tanks undertaken, and other inducements offered to immigrants of the more skilful agricultural castes.\n\nThe archaeological remains are not of much importance. Baihar contains a number of stone tanks and ruined temples, some built in the Hem\u0101dpanti style without cement. The fort of L\u0101nji was built by the Gonds early in the eighteenth century, and was afterwards the head-\nquarters of a *kamaisd\u0101r* under the Mar\u0101th\u0101s. Human sacrifices are said to have been formerly offered at the temple of the Lanjki Dev\u012b, the tutelary deity of the place. About a mile from the town, in the bamboo forest, stands the temple of Koteswar, at which a small annual fair is held. At Mau, in the middle of a tank, about a mile from the village, a granite platform has been constructed on which is the image of a N\u0101ga and a pillar. Other remains are at B\u012b\u015bapur near Kat\u0101ngi, Sonkh\u0101r, Bh\u012bmlat, and Sawarjhiri near Bh\u012bri.\n\nThe population of B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t at the last three enumerations was as follows: (1881) 340,614, (1891) 383,363, and (1901) 326,521. Up to 1891 the District prospered and the rate of increase was about equal to the Provincial average. During the last decade the decrease of population has been nearly 57,000 persons, or about 15 per cent. The District was very severely affected by famine in both 1896 and 1897, and the B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t *tahsil* also in 1900, and the decrease of population is mainly to be attributed to this cause. About 11,000 persons emigrated to Assam during the last decade. The District contains one town, B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t, and 1,075 inhabited villages. The principal statistics of population based on the Census of 1901 are shown below:\n\n| Tahsil | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|--------|---------------------|----------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t | 1,388 | 1 | 582 | 239,141 | 172 | -17.6 | 5,543 |\n| Baihar | 1,744 | ... | 493 | 86,230 | 49 | -6.1 | 1,485 |\n| District total | 3,132 | 1 | 1,075 | 325,371 | 104 | -14.9 | 7,028 |\n\nIn 1904, 11 villages with 1,150 inhabitants were transferred from B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t to Mandl\u0101, while a tract of 'reserved' forest was received from that District. The revised totals of area and population are given above. About 75 per cent. of the population are Hindus, 22 per cent. Animists, and 6,454 persons are Muhammadans. The eastern portions of the District have been largely populated by immigration from Chhatt\u012bsgarh, as is shown by the fact that nearly 145,000 persons, or 44 per cent. of the total, speak the Chhatt\u012bsgarh\u012b dialect. Of the balance, the language of 84,342 is shown as Mar\u0101th\u012b and of 54,168 as Gondi. The Ponw\u0101rs, numbering 41,106, have a special dialect, a mixture of Hindi and Mar\u0101th\u012b, and the Mar\u0101rs another of somewhat the same nature.\n\nThe principal landowning castes are Ponw\u0101rs, Gonds, and Lodhis. Ponw\u0101rs (41,000) are the best cultivators and are especially skilful at the irrigation of rice. Many Ponw\u0101rs are lessees of villages in the *zamin-d\u0101ri* estates and headmen of *ryotw\u0101ri* villages in the Baihar *tahsil*.\nThe Lodhis (18,000) are partly immigrants from Chhattisgarh, and partly from Northern India. Gonds (73,000) constitute 32 per cent. of the population, and Baigas and Binjhals (6,000) 2 per cent. The Gonds are found in both the B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t and Baihar tahsils, and those of the open country are gradually learning settled methods of cultivation from their Hindu neighbours. Those of the Baihar tahsil are still backward and migratory. The Pardhans are the priests of the Gonds and take the clothes and jewels of the dead, and the Ojh\u0101s are bird-catchers and tattooers. The Gonds are polygamous in B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t, and the number of a man\u2019s wives gives an indication of his wealth and dignity, as many as six being by no means unusual. On market days a Gond goes to the bazar with all his wives walking behind him to show his importance.\n\nThe Baigas also are priests of the Gonds, and are employed to lay the ghosts of persons who have been killed by tigers. They are one of the wildest of the tribes and are incapable of sustained manual labour, though they are clever at transplanting rice-plants. This is the only field-work which they usually do for hire. They collect forest produce and exchange it for small quantities of grain, and will subsist for weeks together on roots and fruits, in the collection of which they display the greatest skill. Since the system of bewar or shifting cultivation has been stopped in Government forests, the Baigas are hard put to it to earn a living. An attempt was made to teach them to adopt regular cultivation by settling them in five villages under the direct supervision of the revenue officials of Baihar, but it has been given up as a failure. Some idea of the difficulty to be encountered may be gained from the fact that Baiga tenants, if left unwatched, would dig up the grain which they had themselves sown and eat it. They are skilled woodmen and some are employed as forest guards. They also catch fish and make bamboo matting to a small extent. Both Gonds and Baigas suffered severely in the famines. Farm-servants are recruited from all castes, but are principally Gow\u0101ras. In the Baihar tahsil are a number of Golars (1,200) and Banj\u0101ras (1,000) who are professional cattle graziers. About 72 per cent. of the total population were shown as dependent on agriculture in 1901.\n\nChristians number 219, including 191 natives, most of whom belong to the B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t Mission. This institution is unsectarian, and its efforts are principally directed to the conversion of the Gonds and Baigas. It was founded by the Rev. J. Lampard, who still directs it; and it has four stations\u2014at B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t, Baihar, Nikum, and Khursip\u0101r\u2014with schools at each station, an orphanage, and an industrial farm.\n\nThe quality of the soil in the plains is as a rule much superior to that of the plateau. It is of greater depth and more fertile, while in Baihar the mixture of particles of mica with the soil also reduces its productive capacity. The alluvial land on\nthe banks of the Son and other rivers in the eastern parts of the lowlands is the most fertile of all, but its area is insignificant. Next to this the richest and deepest soil is found in the strip about ten miles wide extending along the left bank of the Waingang\u0101, from the Dhansu\u0101 hills to its junction with the B\u0101gh. The plains of Dhansur\u0101 and Hatt\u0101 parganas are rich in black and brown soil of superior quality and good depth; and there is also good brown soil in the north Karol\u0101 tract to the west of the Waingang\u0101, and in Bhadr\u0101 zamind\u0101ri to the extreme south-east. In the hilly country and the Mau valley the land is generally medium or poor, dark soil being found only in patches in the Mau valley and in the shallow depressions which form a characteristic feature of the plateaux. The Raigarh plateau is the most fertile portion of the Baihar tahsil, but the tract is very thinly populated, and much of the land unreclaimed. The good quality of the soil, however, renders this area rich in pasturage. In the hill villages of the zamind\u0101ris the land is, as a rule, very poor, being largely intermixed with stones and gravel or coarse sand.\n\nOf the total area, 923 square miles, or 29 per cent., are included in the 12 zamind\u0101ri estates. There are about 230 ryotw\u0101ri villages with an area of 370 square miles, of which 90 are cultivated and pay a revenue of Rs. 20,000, while 4,000 acres have been sold outright under the Waste Land Rules. The remaining area is held on the ordinary m\u0101l-guz\u0101ri tenure. The following table gives the chief statistics of cultivation in 1903\u20134, with areas in square miles:\n\n| Tahsil | Total | Cultivated | Irrigated | Cultivable waste | Forests |\n|--------|-------|------------|-----------|-----------------|---------|\n| B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t | 1,388 | 561        | 24        | 429             | 308     |\n| Baihar  | 1,744 | 220        | 3         | 467             | 664     |\n| **Total** | **3,132** | **781**    | **27**    | **896**         | **972** |\n\nNot much of the fertile land in the low country remains unoccupied, but elsewhere there is considerable scope for extension of cultivation. Rice occupies 366 square miles, kodon and kutki 137, wheat 23, urad 75, linseed 57, gram 34, and tiur\u0101 36 square miles. Rice is by far the most important crop, and in sowing it the system of transplantation is usually practised. Kodon, the staple food of the Gonds, is grown chiefly in the hilly tracts, and on the plateaux of Baihar and Raigarh. Tobacco is a very profitable crop in the alluvial soil of the Son valley, where it covers rather less than 1,000 acres. Castor is sown in rotation with tobacco. Sugar-cane was grown on 1,300 acres in 1903\u20134.\n\nBetween 1867 and 1895 the area taken up for cultivation increased by 31 per cent., and that actually cropped by 19 per cent. The area on which two crops were grown in the year and the number of tanks con-\nstructed for irrigation largely increased during the same period. The famines of 1897 and 1900, however, caused a decline in the cropped area, which had not been recovered by 1903-4. Manure is now more largely applied to the rice crop, and cattle and small stock are sometimes penned at night in the fields during the summer months. During the decade ending 1903-4, about Rs. 72,000 was advanced by Government under the Land Improvement Loans Act, and nearly 7\u00bd lakhs under the Agriculturists\u2019 Loans Act.\n\nCattle are bred principally in the Baihar tahsil, where there are excellent grazing-grounds. The ordinary cattle are small and not particularly strong. The best bullocks are bred by Golars and are sold as yearlings at fairly good prices. Bulls are reserved for breeding by the owners of any considerable number of cows. Buffaloes are used for the heavy work of hauling the rice plants from the nurseries at the time of transplantation. They are not bred to any considerable extent in B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t, but young bulls are imported from the northern Districts. The grazing-grounds are generally adequate, and those of the Baihar tahsil are resorted to by large herds of cattle from the surrounding Districts during the hot months. There are no members of the professional shepherd caste, but goats are bred by ordinary landholders for food and for sacrifice. Pigs are reared for the same purposes in the Baihar tahsil. Very few sheep are kept. The principal cattle-markets are at W\u0101r\u0101seoni and L\u0101lburr\u0101 in the plain country, and at Bh\u012bri on the plateau.\n\nAbout 150 square miles can ordinarily be irrigated, but in 1903-4 the irrigated area was only 27 square miles owing to the unfavourable rainfall. With the exception of about 7 square miles under sugar-cane and garden crops, this is practically all rice land. Nearly 40 per cent. of the rice area, or 25 per cent. of the total area, can be watered in a normal year. There are nearly 3,000 tanks and about 4,000 wells, the latter being generally used for garden crops and sugar-cane. Numerous tanks have been constructed by Government agency in the Baihar tahsil, and plans for much larger works to protect a large proportion of the District have been prepared.\n\nThe Government forests cover an area of 972 square miles, mainly on the hilly ranges of Baihar, with blocks on the banks of the Waingang\u0101 and to the south-east. Teak grows in patches in the Son\u0101w\u0101ni and Parasw\u0101ra ranges. The Baihar and Raigarh ranges contain pure s\u0101l forest of excellent quality, and s\u0101l mixed with other species, while the lowland blocks contain only inferior timber trees. Till recently the difficulties of transport have been too great to permit of any substantial revenue being obtained from timber, but the opening of the S\u0101tpur\u0101 Railway should greatly increase the sales. The forest revenue in 1903-4 amounted to Rs. 2,09,000, of which Rs. 1,60,000 was obtained from sales of timber and Rs. 15,000 from\ngrazing. The large revenue from timber was due to a contract for the supply of sleepers. The principal minor products are lac and myrabolams. The zamind\u0101ri estates contain 401 square miles of forest.\n\nDeposits of iron ore occur in the Bhadr\u0101, Kinh\u012b, and Bh\u0101npur zamind\u0101ris. Iron is smelted by native smiths by indigenous methods, but the output is small. Manganese deposits have been found near B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t town, and are being worked by a European company. The out-turn in 1904 was 10,323 tons, and about 300 labourers are employed. There are other numerous deposits of manganese as yet unworked. Copper ore exists in the hill of Mel\u0101njkund\u012b. Mica is plentiful in the Baihar tahsil, but the plates are not sufficiently large to be marketable. Bauxite, used for the manufacture of aluminium, is also found in the Baihar tahsil. Small amounts of gold are obtained by washing in the Son and Deo rivers.\n\nThe principal local industry is the weaving of coarse cotton cloth, the chief centres being W\u0101r\u0101seoni and L\u0101lburr\u0101 with the villages round them. L\u0101lburr\u0101 dhotis are well-known, and are exported to the other S\u0101tpur\u0101 Districts and to Jubbulpore. Ling\u0101, Borgaon, and Hatt\u0101 also contain considerable colonies of weavers. In the W\u0101r\u0101seoni tract a number of Ot\u0101ris make ornaments and vessels from brass by moulding, while the Kas\u0101rs of W\u0101r\u0101seoni and Hatt\u0101 make ornaments of bell-metal. Glass bangles are manufactured at L\u0101nji from imported Indian glass. At Baihar a variety of small tin vessels, such as lamps, sieves, betel boxes, and watering-pots, are made from empty kerosene-oil tins and sometimes sent to Mandl\u0101.\n\nRice and the pulse urad are the principal exports. The former is sent mainly to Ber\u0101r, and the latter to Bombay for the foreign trade. Tobacco is supplied to Chhattisgarh from the Bij\u0101garh zamind\u0101ri. Ghi manufactured from the milk of both cows and buffaloes is exported from the Baihar tahsil. Of forest produce, teak is sent from the Son\u0101w\u0101ni and Ch\u0101regaon forests to N\u0101gpur and Kamptee. Bamboos are exported to Kamptee and Seoni. Hides and horns, myrabolams, lac, gum, and other forest products are largely exported. The leaves of the tendu tree (Diospyros tomentosa) are collected for the manufacture of leaf-plates and the outside covering of b\u012bris or native cigarettes. Mill-woven cloth is brought from N\u0101gpur and Hingangh\u0101t, and small quantities of English cloth from Bombay. The salt used is goland\u0101zi or sea-salt from Bombay. Gur or unrefined sugar comes from Mirz\u0101pur, while refined sugar is chiefly the produce of Mauritius. Jow\u0101r, wheat, and gram are received from the neighbouring S\u0101tpur\u0101 Districts, the local supply being inadequate, and the pulse arhar is obtained from Ber\u0101r. Brass vessels are imported from Mandl\u0101, Bhand\u0101ra, Jubbulpore, and the United Provinces. The grain trade is principally in the hands of M\u0101rw\u0101ri\nBanias. For timber, contracts are taken for Government and zamindari forests by Muhammadan merchants from Kamptee and Raipur.\n\nThe S\u0101tpur\u0101 extension of the Bengal-Nagpur Railway from Gondi\u0101 to Jubbulpore, which has recently been constructed, passes through the west of the District up the valley of the Waingang\u0101, with a length of 53 miles and six stations within its borders. The length of metalled roads is 15 miles, and of unmetalled roads 208 miles, and the annual expenditure on maintenance is Rs. 39,000, all these roads being in charge of the Public Works department. There are avenues of trees on only 16 miles. The opening of the railway will naturally effect a material alteration in the existing trade routes.\n\nThere are no reliable records of famine previous to 1868\u20139, in which year the rains ended abruptly a month before time, and the rice crop in the lowlands failed, leading to acute distress. A series of partial failures of the harvest was followed in 1896\u20137 by a more serious deficiency, the out-turn of all crops together being only about 17 per cent. of the normal. The numbers on relief rose to 68,000, or 15 per cent. of the population, in May, 1897, and the total expenditure was 13 lakhs. In 1899\u20131900 the rice crop again failed, the out-turn being 23 per cent. of a normal harvest. Relief was begun in September, 1899, and continued till November, 1900, the highest number relieved being 135,000, or 35 per cent. of the population, in August, and the total expenditure amounting to 26 lakhs. During these famines most of the existing roads were constructed and the embankment of the S\u0101tpur\u0101 Railway was built. Many tanks were made or repaired by famine loans in 1897 and by grants to landowners in 1900.\n\nThe Deputy-Commissioner is aided by one Assistant or Extra-Assistant Commissioner. For administrative purposes the District is divided into two tahsils, each of which has a tahsildar and a naib-tahsildar. The Forest officer usually belongs to the Imperial service, and for Public Works the District is included in the charge of the Executive Engineer, Bhand\u0101ra Public Works division.\n\nThe civil judicial staff consists of a District and a Subordinate Judge, and a Munsif at B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t town. The Divisional and Sessions Judge of the N\u0101gpur Division has jurisdiction in the District. Cattle-poisoning is a comparatively common form of offence.\n\nThe area now constituting B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t was formerly included in the Districts of Seoni and Bhand\u0101ra, and the land revenue demand was assessed at the thirty years' settlements of those Districts. These expired in 1896\u20138, when revision was commenced, but it was somewhat delayed by the famines. The revenue demand before revision was Rs. 1,26,000, which was raised to Rs. 1,87,000, or by 48 per cent. The current settlement is for a period of sixteen years, and will expire in 1914. The average incidence of revenue per acre at settlement was\nR. 0-9-11 (maximum, R. 0-15-1; minimum, R. 0-2-10), the corresponding figures of rental incidence being average R. 0-15-6 (maximum, Rs. 1-11-11; minimum, R. 0-3-7). In the Baihar tahsil a summary settlement has been made for seven years without rental enhancement, to allow the tract to recover from the effects of famine. In certain areas temporary remissions and abatements have been given.\n\nThe collections of land revenue and total revenue in recent years are shown below, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 1,60   | 1,65   | 91     | 2,43   |\n| Total revenue  | 3,27   | 4,55   | 2,73   | 6,19   |\n\nThe management of local affairs, outside municipal areas, is entrusted to a District council and three local boards, two for the B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t tahsil and one for Baihar. The income of the District council in 1903-4 was Rs. 35,000, while the expenditure on education was Rs. 12,000 and on public works Rs. 9,000. B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t is a municipal town.\n\nThe force under the District Superintendent of police consists of 247 officers and men, including 3 mounted constables, besides 843 village watchmen for 1,076 inhabited towns and villages. There is a District jail, with accommodation for 59 prisoners, including 6 females. The daily average number of prisoners in 1904 was 52.\n\nIn respect of education B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t stands twelfth in the Province, 2.2 per cent. of the population (4.4 males and 0.1 females) being able to read and write. The percentage of children under instruction to those of school-going age is 10. Statistics of the number of pupils under instruction are as follows: (1880-1) 2,033; (1890-1) 2,597; (1900-1) 2,883; and (1903-4) 4,663, including 85 girls. The educational institutions comprise an English middle school at B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t town, 3 vernacular middle schools, and 62 primary schools. There are girls' schools at B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t and W\u0101r\u0101seoni, and a mixed school for girls and boys at Baihar supported by the B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t Mission. The expenditure on education in 1903-4 was Rs. 17,000, of which Rs. 15,000 was provided from Provincial and Local funds and Rs. 1,800 by fees.\n\nThe District has 6 dispensaries, with accommodation for 28 in-patients. In 1904 the number of cases treated was 38,483, of whom 253 were in-patients, and 560 operations were performed. The total expenditure was Rs. 6,800.\n\nVaccination is compulsory only in the municipal town of B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t. The number of persons successfully vaccinated in 1903-4 was 31 per 1,000 of the District population.\n\n[J. R. Scott, Settlement Report (1901). A District Gazetteer is being compiled.]\nB\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t Tahsil (B\u016brha).\u2014Southern tahsil of B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t District, Central Provinces, lying between $21^\\circ 19'$ and $22^\\circ 5'$ N. and $79^\\circ 39'$ and $80^\\circ 45'$ E. In 1901 the area of the tahsil was 1,687 square miles, and the population 249,610. In 1904 a redistribution of territory between the B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t and Baihar tahsils took place, and the adjusted figures of area and population are 1,388 square miles and 239,141 persons. The population in 1891 of the area now constituting the tahsil was 268,108. The density is 172 persons per square mile. The tahsil contains one town, B\u0100L\u0100GH\u0100T (population, 6,223), the headquarters of the District and tahsil; and 582 inhabited villages. Excluding 308 square miles of Government forest, 56 per cent. of the available area is occupied for cultivation. The demand for land revenue in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 2,16,000, and for cesses Rs. 24,000. The tahsil consists of a rich lowland rice-growing tract on both sides of the Waingang\u0101 river, and of a triangular block of hills to the northeast of the plain. It includes five complete zamindari estates and parts of three others. The total area of these estates is 439 square miles, of which 267 are forest.\n\nB\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the District and tahsil of the same name, Central Provinces, situated in $21^\\circ 49'$ N. and $80^\\circ 12'$ E. Population (1901), 6,223. When the District of B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t was constituted in 1867, the small village of B\u016brha was selected as its headquarters, and the name has now been officially changed to correspond with that of the District, which means \u2018above the passes.\u2019 So far as the town is concerned, however, the name is a misnomer, as it lies below the hills. B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t is a station on the new S\u0101tpur\u0101 narrow-gauge line, 25 miles from Gondi\u0101 junction and 626 from Bombay. It is situated two miles from the Waingang\u0101 river; and between the town and river lie about 1,200 acres of small forest through which roads have been laid out, while a large tank has been built on the outskirts of the town. B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t was created a municipality in 1877. The municipal receipts during the decade ending 1901 averaged Rs. 5,000. In 1903\u20134 they were Rs. 7,000, the chief source of income being a house tax. A manganese mine is now being worked near the town. B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t has a certain amount of trade, but no manufactures. It contains an English middle school, a girls\u2019 school, and a dispensary.\n\nB\u0101l\u0101pur T\u0101luk.\u2014T\u0101luk of Akola District, Ber\u0101r, lying between $20^\\circ 17'$ and $20^\\circ 55'$ N. and $76^\\circ 45'$ and $77^\\circ$ E., with an area of 569 square miles. The population rose from 101,673 in 1891 to 104,495 in 1901, the density being 184 persons per square mile. The t\u0101luk contains 162 villages and three towns, B\u0100L\u0100PUR, the head-quarters (population, 10,486), P\u0100T\u016aR (5,993), and W\u0100DEGAON (5,825). A few miles from B\u0101l\u0101pur are the ruins of the palace built at Sh\u0101hpur by Sult\u0101n Mur\u0101d, fourth son of the emperor Akbar, immediately after the\nannexation of Ber\u0101r by the Mughals. The fort and chhatri at B\u0101l\u0101pur and the shrine of Shaikh B\u0101b\u016b at P\u0101t\u016br are interesting. The demand for land revenue in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 3,62,000, and for cesses Rs. 28,000. The only natural boundaries are the P\u016brna river on the north, and the B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t hills on the south. The t\u0101luk lies almost entirely in the fertile valley of the P\u016brna; but the land in the south, which occupies the lower slopes of the B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t, is comparatively poor.\n\nB\u0101l\u0101pur Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the t\u0101luk of the same name in Akola District, Ber\u0101r, situated in 20\u00b0 40' N. and 76\u00b0 50' E., 6 miles south of P\u016bras station on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway. Population (1901), 10,486. The M\u016bn river divides the town from the peth or suburb. B\u0101l\u0101pur was the chief military station of the Mughals in Ber\u0101r after Ellichpur; and at a distance of a few miles from the town Akbar's son, Sult\u0101n Mur\u0101d, founded Sh\u0101hp\u016br, now in ruins. B\u0101l\u0101pur is mentioned in the Ain-i-Akbar\u012b as one of the richest parganas in Ber\u0101r. Muhammad Azam Sh\u0101h, third son of Aurangzeb, is said to have resided here and to have built a mud fort. Close to the town Asaf Jah defeated (July, 1720) the imperial forces dispatched against him by the Saiyids, after a severe engagement in which his famous Deccan artillery decided the day. The present fort of B\u0101l\u0101pur is the largest and strongest in Ber\u0101r, the hill forts of the Melgh\u0101t excepted. It was completed in 1757 by Ismail Kh\u0101n, first Naw\u0101b of Ellichpur, and consists of an inner and outer fort, the former rising by the whole height of its walls above the latter. The outer or lower fort is a decagon, with a bastion at each angle, and the inner is a pentagon, the angles of which likewise terminate in bastions. Both forts are entered by Mughal gateways. The chhatri, or pavilion, of R\u0101j\u0101 Jai Singh, a commander of 4,000 horse in the reign of Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n, and afterwards one of Aurangzeb's best generals, stands apart from the fort overlooking the river. It is a graceful building of black stone, 38 feet high, on a high plinth. A fine flight of steps formerly led down to the river, but these have been washed away during the last thirty years. The J\u0101ma Masjid, once a fine building 90 feet long, but now a ruin, dates from 1623. The woven manufactures, formerly in high repute, are at present little sought after, and the importance of the town is declining.\n\nB\u0101l\u0101sinor State (V\u0101d\u0101sinor).\u2014State in the Political Agency of Rew\u0101 K\u0101ntha, Bombay, lying between 22\u00b0 53' and 23\u00b0 17' N. and 73\u00b0 17' and 73\u00b0 40' E., with an estimated area of 189 square miles. It is bounded on the north by the States of Mah\u012b K\u0101ntha; on the east by the State of L\u016bnav\u0101da, and part of the Godhra t\u0101luka of the P\u0101nch Mah\u0101ls; on the west by Kaira District and a portion of the Par\u0101ntij t\u0101luka of Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d; and on the south by Kaira District. The territory is about 30 miles in length and 10 to 12 in breadth, and is divided into two distinct and nearly equal parts, the B\u0101l\u0101sinor and Virpur sub-\ndivisions, the former containing 41 villages, the latter 57, much mixed with those of the adjoining State of L\u00fcn\u0101v\u0101da. Except some hilly tracts in the west, the surface is flat. The soil is fertile, and, though fever prevails, the climate is tolerably healthy. There are no rivers of any note except the Mah\u012b.\n\nThe family traces its origin to Sher Kh\u0101n B\u0101bi, a distinguished officer in the Mughal service (1664). The fifth in descent, Sal\u0101bat Kh\u0101n, obtained possession of the principality of Jun\u0101garh in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r; on his death his territory was divided, the younger son receiving Jun\u0101garh, and the elder son continuing to hold B\u0101l\u0101sinor. During the ascendancy of the Mar\u0101th\u0101s in Gujar\u0101t, the State became tributary to both the Peshw\u0101 (1768) and the Gaikw\u0101r; and in 1818 the British Government succeeded to the rights of the Peshw\u0101, and assumed the political superintendence of B\u0101l\u0101sinor. Placed at first under the supervision of the Collector of Kaira, B\u0101l\u0101sinor has, since 1853, formed part of the territory controlled by the Political Agent of Rew\u0101 K\u0101nth\u0101. The chief is entitled to a salute of nine guns. Succession follows the rule of primogeniture, and there is a sanad authorizing adoption. The distinguishing title of the family is B\u0101bi, meaning 'doorkeeper,' that having been the office assigned to the founder who attained distinction at the Mughal court.\n\nThe Census of 1901 showed a total population of 32,618, or 172 persons per square mile, living in 98 villages. Hindus numbered 28,146; Musalm\u0101ns, 4,256; and Jains, 215. Numerically, the most important caste is the Koli. The soil is generally rich, yielding millet, pulse, rice, oilseeds, sugar-cane, and cotton. Of the total area, 89 square miles are occupied for cultivation, of which nearly two-thirds were under crop in 1903-4. Routes from Gujar\u0101t to M\u0101lw\u0101 pass through the State.\n\nThe Naw\u0101b is a chief of the second class, and has the power to try his own subjects for capital offences without the sanction of the Political Agent. The crop share system of land revenue prevails in some parts of the State. The revenue is 1\u00bc lakhs, of which Rs. 72,000 is land revenue. The expenditure is 1\u00bc lakhs, including tribute of Rs. 15,532 to the British Government and of Rs. 3,078 to the Gaikw\u0101r of Baroda. The State maintains a quasi-military force of 117 men, of whom 16 are mounted. They are employed for police and revenue purposes. There are 11 boys' schools with a daily average attendance of 384 pupils, and one girls' school with a daily average attendance of 57. The State maintains 2 dispensaries, which treated 10,316 patients in 1903-4. Nearly 700 persons were vaccinated in the same year.\n\nB\u0101l\u0101sinor Town.\u2014Chief town of the State of the same name in the Rew\u0101 K\u0101nth\u0101 Agency, Bombay, situated in 22\u00b0 59\u2032 N. and 73\u00b0 25\u2032 E., near the Shedi river, about 41 miles east of Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d. Population\nThe town is surrounded by a stone wall with flanking bastions and four gates. On the high ground to the north stands the Naw\u0101b\u2019s palace. On a hill 3 miles from the town an annual fair is held in August in honour of Dungaria Mah\u0101deo. The town is administered as a municipality.\n\nBalasore District.\u2014Northern District of the Orissa Division of Bengal, situated between $20^\\circ 44'$ and $21^\\circ 57'$ N. and $86^\\circ 16'$ and $87^\\circ 31'$ E., with an area of $2,085^1$ square miles. The District of Midnapore bounds it on the north-east; the wooded hills of the Tributary States of May\u016brbhanj, Nilgiri, and Keonjhar lie along the northern and western flank; and on the south the Baitaran\u012b river marks the boundary of Cuttack. The Bay of Bengal forms the eastern boundary.\n\nBalasore District consists of a strip of alluvial land lying between the sea and the hills which rise from the western boundary. This strip varies in breadth from about 30 miles at the northeast extremity to 10 miles at the narrowest or central portion and 40 miles in the south. Along the coast is a belt of land about 3 miles broad, which is impregnated with salt and unfit for cultivation. The western portion which runs along the foot of the hills is jungly and uncultivable. Between these two extremes lies the fertile arable country which constitutes the greater part of the District. It is watered, proceeding from north to south, by the river systems of the Subarnarekh\u0101, H\u0101skur\u0101, S\u0101rath\u0101, P\u0101nchp\u0101ra, Burh\u0101balang, K\u0101nsb\u0101ns, S\u0101landi, and Baitaran\u012b. The Subarnarekh\u0101, which rises in Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur, pursues a winding course of some 60 miles in this District. It communicates with the coast canal at J\u0101mkund\u0101 lock, and is largely used by country boats from Calcutta. The H\u0101skur\u0101 is a hill stream which rises in May\u016brbhanj; it contains very little water in the hot season, but during the rains it receives and carries away a great portion of the Subarnarekh\u0101 floods. The S\u0101rath\u0101 runs a course parallel to the H\u0101skur\u0101. The P\u0101nchp\u0101ra is formed by the confluence of several hill streams from May\u016brbhanj, the principal being the B\u0101ns, J\u0101mira, and Bhairingi, which unite, bifurcate, and reunite in the wildest confusion. The tide runs up only 10 miles; and although the interlacings constantly spread into open swamps, yet one of them, the B\u0101ns, is deep enough at certain parts of its course for boats of 4 tons burden. The Burh\u0101balang, on which Balasore town is situated, runs a tortuous course of 35 miles; the name signifies \u2018The old twister.\u2019 The tide runs up 23 miles; and though sea-going steamers can no longer enter it, owing to the sand-bar across its mouth, it is navigable by brigs and sloops as far as Balasore town. The K\u0101nsb\u0101ns, which is formed by the confluence of a number of small hill streams rising in the Tributary\n\n---\n\n1 The area shown in the Census Report of 1901 was 2,059 square miles; that given above is taken from figures supplied by the Surveyor-General.\nStates, is liable to sudden freshes, and eventually reaches the sea by two mouths, the lower of which is called the Gamai, while the northern retains its original name. The Baitaran\u012b, which rises in Keonjhar State, forms the boundary between Balasore and Cuttack. After its junction with the Br\u0101hmani, the united stream flows under the name of the Dh\u0101mra into the Bay of Bengal. The river is navigable as far as Olokh, 15 miles from the mouth; beyond this point it is not affected by the tide and becomes fordable during the hot season. It receives two tributaries on the Balasore bank\u2014the S\u0101landi and the Matai. A large weir has been constructed across the Baitaran\u012b at Akshay\u0101pad\u0101, to dam the water during the dry season for the supply of the portion of the High-level canal between Akshay\u0101pad\u0101 and Bhadrakh.\n\nThe Nilgiri hills consist of granitoid gneiss, interfoliated with which are occasionally found bands of a chloritic rock approaching serpentine in texture. This rock yields a beautiful, compact, and very tough material, which is at the same time soft and easy to work. A few miles west and south-west of Jugjhuri the rocks alter considerably and assume a hard, tough, indistinctly crystallized hornblendic character. Still farther to the south-west and near the S\u0101landi river well-foliated quartz schist comes in. Laterite in a compact form occurs along the base of the Nilgiri hills\u00b9.\n\nAlong the coast as far north as the Burh\u0101balang river are large grassy plains, with occasional sparse patches of cultivation and low jungle on the sand ridges and near the tidal streams. North of the Burh\u0101balang, especially round the mouth of the H\u0101skur\u0101 and Subarnarekh\u0101, are numerous tidal creeks fringed with heavy jungle. The cultivated land has the usual rice-field weeds, while ponds and ditches are filled with floating water-weeds or submerged water-plants. Near human habitations shrubberies of semi-spontaneous shrubs are common, and are loaded with a tangled mass of climbing Convolvulaceae. The arborescent portion of these village shrubberies includes the red cotton-tree (Bombax malabaricum), jiyal (Odina Wodier), Tamarindus indica, Moringa pterygosperma, pipal (Ficus religiosa), banyan (Ficus bengalensis), and the palms Borassus flabellifer and khaj\u016br (Phoenix sylvestris). There are no forests; but in the west of the District, where the boundary approaches the hills and the lands are higher, patches of jungle occur, including a little s\u0101l (Shorea robusta), which rarely attains to any size. The usual bamboo is Bambusa arundinacea. Open glades are filled with grasses, sometimes of a reedy character. Sedges abound, and ferns are fairly plentiful.\n\nBlack bears are found in the north, and tigers, leopards, hyenas,\n\n\u00b9 'The Geological Structure and Physical Features of the Districts of B\u0101nkur\u0101, Midnapore, and Orissa,' Memoirs, Geological Survey of India, vol. i, pt. iii.\nspotted deer, antelope, hog deer, mouse deer, civet cat, and hare are common in the more jungly portions of the District.\n\nThe District is directly on the track of the cyclonic storms which frequently cross Orissa during the monsoon season, and the extremes of climate are more marked than in most parts of Bengal. In April and May the average maximum temperature is $98^\\circ$. The mean temperature falls from $89^\\circ$ in the hot months to $83^\\circ$ in the monsoon and to $74^\\circ$ in February. Dry westerly winds often blow during the hot season, and these are followed by well-marked south-west monsoon conditions; the humidity thus ranges from 79 per cent. in April and May to 89 per cent. in August. The annual rainfall averages 60 inches, of which 5\u00b71 inches fall in May, 9\u00b70 in June, 12\u00b71 in July, 11\u00b75 in August, 11\u00b72 in September, and 5\u00b71 in October.\n\nThe District is subject to floods, due to the sudden rising of the rivers in the hills. Protective embankments have been built, the principal being the Bhograi and S\u0101ls\u0101 P\u0101t on the lower reaches of the Subarnarekh\u0101; but the protection afforded by them is far from complete. An exceptionally high flood occurred in 1868; and there were floods of inferior height but more serious in results in 1892 and 1896, the latter causing a great loss of crops in the south of the District. Other years of high floods were 1855, 1866, 1872, 1883, 1886, 1888, 1894, 1897, and 1898. In October, 1900, the water rose 18 inches higher than in any flood previously recorded, and breached the railway line and destroyed crops and cattle, though it caused very little loss of human life. The cyclones to which Balasore is exposed are generally accompanied by irresistible storm-waves, which vary in height from 3 to 10 feet and sometimes penetrate as far as 10 miles inland. Such calamities occurred in 1823, 1831, 1832, 1848, and 1851. In the severest of these, the cyclone of 1831, 26,000 persons lost their lives. Cyclones have also occurred in 1872, 1874, and 1891; but these were not accompanied by storm-waves.\n\nThe early history of Balasore presents no special features of interest beyond such as are given in the article on ORISSA. The English settlement in the District dates from 1633, when a factory was established in BALASORE TOWN; but the country did not pass into the hands of the British till the acquisition of Orissa in 1803. It was created a separate District in 1828. There have been many minor changes of jurisdiction, but it is unnecessary to detail them here.\n\nThe population of the present area increased from 770,232 in 1872 to 945,280 in 1881, to 994,675 in 1891, and to 1,071,197 in 1901. The great increase between 1872 and 1881 was due partly to improved enumeration, and partly to a recovery from the losses caused by the famine of 1866. The District\noften suffers from severe epidemics of cholera. The worst outbreak took place in 1892, when this disease was responsible for a mortality of 15 per 1,000. Elephantiasis is extremely common. Fever prevails in the cold season; but the country is singularly free from malaria, except in the Jaleswar th\u0101na, which is very unhealthy.\n\nThe principal statistics of the Census of 1901 are shown below:\n\n| Subdivision | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|-------------|---------------------|----------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Balasore    | 1,155               | 1              | 2,112    | 592,544    | 513                       | + 8.3                                           | 43,512                                 |\n| Bhadrakh    | 930                 | 1              | 1,246    | 478,653    | 515                       | + 6.9                                           | 39,974                                 |\n| District total | 2,085             | 2              | 3,358    | 1,071,197  | 514                       | + 7.7                                           | 83,486                                 |\n\nThe two towns are Balasore, the District head-quarters, and Bhadrakh. The density of population is greatest in the Bhadrakh th\u0101na, where it rises to 662 persons per square mile. The largest increase in the decade ending 1901 took place in the Ch\u0101ndb\u0101li and B\u0101sudebpur th\u0101nas in the south-east of the District, both of which contain much land fit for cultivation. The District send numerous emigrants to the Twenty-four Parganas and to Calcutta, where many of them are employed as domestic servants and cooks; but otherwise there is little migration except to and from the neighbouring Districts and States. The vernacular is Oriy\u0101. Of the population, 1,033,166 (96.4 per cent.) are Hindus, 28,340 (2.6 per cent.) Musalm\u0101ns, and 0.8 per cent. Animists.\n\nThe most numerous castes are the Khandaitis (211,000), originally the feudal militia of the R\u0101j\u0101s of Orissa, Br\u0101hmans (120,000), Gauras (74,000), and R\u0101jus (47,000). Gokh\u0101s (31,000) and Gol\u0101s (34,000) are more numerous in this District than elsewhere, while other Orissa castes are K\u0101ndras, usually day-labourers and chaukid\u0101rs (32,000), and Karans, the writer caste (26,000). Agriculture supports 79 per cent. of the population, industries 9.6 per cent., commerce 0.3 per cent., and the professions 1.1 per cent.\n\nChristians number 1,274, of whom 1,110 are natives. Two missions are at work, a Roman Catholic and an American Free Baptist Mission. The latter, which has been in the District since 1832, has 6 stations. It maintains at Balasore a high school, an English school for European boys and girls, 5 Kindergarten lower primary schools, and a middle English school; and at other stations 2 middle English schools and one vernacular school, as well as 31 lower primary schools and one Kindergarten school. Industrial work is taught, including farming, weaving, and carpentry. The mission also possesses three orphanages, and\ncarries on medical work on a large scale. The Roman Catholic mission is a comparatively small one; it works chiefly in the town of Balasore, where it possesses a large chapel and an orphanage for native girls.\n\nThe alluvial tract which extends through the centre of the District is fertile. The higher land on the west is for the most part rocky, but in some places where vegetable deposits occur it is very productive. Along the coast, except in years of excessive rainfall, the soil is generally infertile on account of the deposits of salt. Lands are ordinarily divided into three classes: *jal\u0101*, or rice lands; *p\u0101l*, or rich river-side lands growing tobacco, cotton, *rabi* crops, and the best rice; and *k\u0101l\u0101*, the highlands of the homestead, which generally grow vegetables.\n\nThe chief agricultural statistics for 1903-4 are shown below, areas being in square miles:\n\n| Subdivision | Total | Cultivated | Cultivable waste | Irrigated from canals |\n|-------------|-------|------------|------------------|----------------------|\n| Balasore    | 1,155 | 735        | 121              | ...                  |\n| Bhadrakh    | 930   | 591        | 98               | 63                   |\n| **Total**   | **2,085** | **1,326** | **219**          | **63**               |\n\nOf the cultivated area only one per cent. is estimated to be twice cropped. Rice is the principal food-grain, and includes three crops: *s\u0101rad* or winter rice, *bi\u0101li* or autumn rice, and *d\u0101lua* or spring rice. Of these, winter rice is estimated to cover 1,025 square miles, or 77 per cent. of the whole area under cultivation. On the higher levels the crop is sown broadcast, but in low lands the seedlings are transplanted. The sowing takes place in May or June; but the reaping seasons vary for different varieties, *\u0101su* being reaped in August or September, *kand\u0101* in September or October, and *guru* from November to January. *Bi\u0101li* rice, which is sown in May and reaped in August and September, covers 168 square miles, while the area under *d\u0101lua*, sown in November and December and reaped in March, is ordinarily very small. The other crops are of minor importance, pulses covering only 17 and oilseeds 16 square miles.\n\nCultivation has extended by 40 per cent. during the last seventy years, but owing to the innate conservatism of the Oriy\u0101 little improvement is visible in the methods adopted. Various experiments have been made at the instance of Government with new crops and modern implements, but these have not found favour with the ryots. Little advantage has been taken of the Land Improvement Loans Act, but useful work has been done under the Agriculturists' Loans Act, particularly in times of distress following floods.\n\nThe cattle are similar to those common in South Bengal. Fodder\nis scarce in the centre of the District, but extensive pasture lands along\nthe coast and the higher land in the west afford good grazing.\n\nThe only irrigation system is that provided by the High-level Canal,\nwhich has within the District a length of 19 miles, in addition to\n50 miles of distributaries. It commands 90 square miles, of which\n69 square miles are actually provided with means for irrigation. The\narea irrigated in 1903-4 was 63 square miles. In addition to this,\nwater from the rivers is utilized in order to irrigate the crops near their\nbanks.\n\nLaterite is found along the west of the District, and is used for build-\ning; the honeycombed variety was largely used in former times for\ntemples. Chlorite is also obtained from the hills in the western border,\nand is the material from which all ancient statues and idols were carved;\nat the present time it is used for the manufacture of plates and bowls.\n\nCotton-weaving and mat-making are carried on, and brass and bell-\nmetal articles are manufactured.\n\nThe chief imports are European cotton piece-goods, oil, salt, and\nspices; the principal export is rice, which in favourable seasons is\ndispatched in enormous quantities by sea, canal, and\nrail. Other exports are hides, jute, oilseeds, timber, and stoneware. Rice is shipped to Ceylon and\nMauritius, but otherwise trade is carried on chiefly with Calcutta and\nMadras. Balasore and Ch\u0101ndb\u0101li are the chief centres of the seaborne\ntrade, other places of trade being M\u0101ndh\u0101ta on the Coast Canal, B\u0101li\u0101-\np\u0101l on the Matai river, and B\u0101r\u0101b\u0101tia on the Guchid\u0101 river, a tributary\nof the Subarnarekh\u0101. A great deal of the rice exported was formerly\ncarried by native coasting vessels, but the silting up of several of the\nsmaller ports and the opening of the Coast Canal and the railway have\nrecently caused a great decline in the volume of this trade. The\nimports which passed through the ports of Ch\u0101ndb\u0101li and Balasore in\n1903-4 were valued at 28.9 lakhs and the exports at 25.7 lakhs, but\nthese figures include a large amount of trade from Cuttack District.\n\nThe Bengal-N\u0101gpur Railway runs for 88 miles through the District,\nconnecting it with Calcutta, Cuttack, and Madras. A branch line,\ncalled the May\u016brbhanj State Railway, from Rups\u0101 junction to Barip\u0101d\u0101\nin the May\u016brbhanj State, was opened in 1904. A survey for a branch\nfrom Balasore to Chandipur on the coast is being made, and a light\ntramway from Balasore to tap the N\u012blgiri stone quarries is contemplated.\nThe trunk road affords communication with Midnapore and Calcutta\non the north, and with Cuttack, Puri, and Ganjam on the south. Apart\nfrom this road (95 miles), which is metalled and maintained from Pro-\nvincial funds, 41 miles of metalled and 268 miles of unmetalled roads,\nand 106 miles of village tracks, are maintained by the District board.\nThe most important are those from Bhadrakh to Ch\u0101ndb\u0101li, from Bala-\nsore to Mitrapur in Nilgiri, from Kamard\u0101 to B\u0101liap\u0101l, from B\u0101liap\u0101l to Bast\u0101, from Kamard\u0101 to Jaleswar, and from Singl\u0101 to Nangaleswar.\n\nFor purposes of navigation the most important rivers are the Subarnarekh\u0101, the Burh\u0101balang, on which Balasore is situated, the Dh\u0101mra and Baitaran\u012b, which connect Ch\u0101ndb\u0101li with the sea, and the S\u0101land\u012b, on which Bhadrakh lies. The Coast Canal, which connects the Hooghly at Geonkh\u0101li with the Matai at Ch\u0101rib\u0101tia, has a length of 71 miles within the District; it was completed in 1887, but has not been a financial success. The High-level Canal has a course of 19 miles within this District; it is navigable, but has been little used for traffic since the opening of the railway. The Public Works department also maintains 46\u00bd miles of protective embankments. A canal connecting the old port of Chur\u0101man with the Matai river has fallen into disrepair. A bi-weekly steamer service runs between Ch\u0101ndb\u0101li and Calcutta. The District contains eighteen ferries under the control of the District board, the most important being those where the trunk road crosses the Subarnarekh\u0101 and Burh\u0101balang rivers.\n\nThe District suffered grievously in the great Orissa famine of 1865\u20136. The rainfall of 1865 was scanty and ceased entirely after the middle of September, so that the out-turn of the winter rice crop on which the country depends was only one-third of the average. Stocks were moreover dangerously depleted, as unusually large quantities of grain had been exported. By November distress had begun to be acute, and in February, 1866, starvation appeared and relief operations were commenced; but the works were to a great extent rendered inoperative for want of rice to feed the labourers. By the month of April even the well-to-do peasants had only a single scanty meal a day, while the poorer classes eked out their subsistence with roots, herbs, and leaves. Government succeeded in importing about 12,000 maunds of rice by the end of July, but the monsoon had begun and importation on any large scale was impossible. Orissa was at that time almost isolated from the rest of India. The mortality reached its culminating point in August, when heavy rains caused great suffering among the people, who were then at the lowest stage of exhaustion, emaciated by hunger, and without sufficient shelter. Disastrous floods in the south-east of the District followed these rains; 83,000 acres were inundated, and in all the low-lying lands the crop was lost. The harvest in the higher lands was, however, a good one; the new crop came into the market in September; and though the rate of mortality continued high for some time owing to cholera, the famine came to a close in November. During the year the price of rice rose as high as 2\u00bd seers to the rupee, and in the town of Balasore alone 10,000 paupers succumbed to starvation and disease. The total mortality was estimated at 217,608, 31,424 deaths being ascribed to diseases resulting\nfrom starvation; 29,558 persons emigrated; and the total loss was, therefore, 247,166, or one-third of the population. The daily average of persons relieved from June to November, 1866, amounted to 26,497; out of this number, 21,945 received gratuitous relief and 4,552 were employed on light work. The total expenditure on relief works from May to November, 1866, amounted to Rs. 73,356. In 1896 the out-turn of rice was estimated at barely half of a normal crop; but though there was considerable local distress, very little relief was found necessary beyond such as was afforded by the facilities for obtaining earthwork on the railway.\n\nFor administrative purposes the District is divided into two subdivisions, with head-quarters at Balasore and Bhadrakh. The Magistrate-Collector is assisted at Balasore by three Deputy-Magistrate-Collectors. The subdivisional officer of Bhadrakh, who is often a member of the Indian Civil Service, has a Sub-Deputy-Collector subordinate to him. The Executive Engineer of the Balasore division is stationed at Balasore, and the Port Officer of the Cuttack and Balasore ports at Ch\u0101ndb\u0101li.\n\nFor the disposal of civil judicial work, two Munsifs sit at Balasore and Bhadrakh, subordinate to the District and Sessions Judge, who is also Judge of Cuttack and Puri. The criminal courts include those of the District and Sessions Judge, the District Magistrate, three Deputy-Magistrates, the subdivisional officer of Bhadrakh, the Sub-Deputy-Collector of Bhadrakh, and the Port Officer of Balasore port. The District Magistrate is ex-officio Assistant to the Superintendent of the Orissa Tributary Mah\u0101ls, in which capacity he exercises the powers of a Sessions Judge in Nilgiri, May\u016brbhanj, and Keonjhar. The District is singularly free from serious crime, and the majority of cases are of a petty character.\n\nThe early Hindu rulers of Orissa recognized no middlemen between them and their subjects, but the residents of each village paid their quota through a headman (padh\u0101n). The villages were grouped into large divisions (khand or bisi) of 10 to 50 square miles, the prototypes of the later Muhammadan parganas; over each division was an executive officer (khandpati), who acted as the representative of the sovereign, and with the assistance of the divisional accountant (bhoim\u016bl or bishay\u012b) collected the revenue and handed it over to the head of the district (des\u0101dhipati). The first regular settlement was begun in 1580 by Akbar\u2019s finance minister, Todar Mal. In the central and most highly cultivated part of Balasore he made a detailed settlement, fixing the rates of rent in every village. He confirmed in possession the hereditary under-officials, the khandpatis and bhoim\u016bls becoming chaudhris and k\u0101nunghos, and being entrusted with the collection of revenue and the other rights and liabilities of zamind\u0101rs for the area under their direct management. The village headmen he maintained under the appellation of mukaddam:\nwhere there were no hereditary headmen or where the *padh\u0101n* had been dispossessed, collections were often made through an agent (*karji*) or farmer (*sarbar\u0101hk\u0101r* or *must\u0101jir*) appointed by the *talukd\u0101r*, and many of these developed into hereditary tenure-holders with rights almost equal to those of *mukaddams*. The Mar\u0101th\u0101s made no change in the character of the fiscal organization, and the above-mentioned tenures represent the most important of those found by the British Commissioners in 1803. A settlement made in 1834\u20135 should have expired in 1867 but was extended till 1897, when a new settlement was introduced for a term of thirty years, which will expire in 1927. The revenue demand was raised from 3.85 to 6.28 lakhs. In 1903\u20134 the total current demand was 6.50 lakhs, of which 5.82 lakhs was payable by 1,463 temporarily settled estates, Rs. 42,000 by 152 permanently settled estates, and Rs. 26,000 by 14 estates held direct by Government. The total incidence of land revenue was 11\\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) annas per cultivated acre. At the recent settlement the average area held by each ryot was found to be 5.48 acres, and the rates of rent ranged between Rs. 3\u20138\u20133 and R. 0\u201311\u20135 per acre, the average being Rs. 1\u201312\u201311.\n\nThe following table shows the collections of land revenue and of total revenue (principal heads only), in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1880\u20131 | 1890\u20131 | 1900\u20131 | 1903\u20134 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 4.11   | 4.21   | 6.25   | 6.55   |\n| Total revenue  | 6.69   | 7.53   | 10.98  | 11.21  |\n\nOutside the municipality of Balasore, local affairs are managed by the District board, to which subdivisional local boards are subordinate. In 1903\u20134 its income was Rs. 1,05,000, of which Rs. 36,000 was obtained from rates; and the expenditure was Rs. 96,000, including Rs. 43,000 spent on public works and Rs. 32,000 on education.\n\nThe District contains 9 police stations and 13 outposts; and the force subordinate to the District Superintendent consists of 2 inspectors, 28 sub-inspectors, 25 head constables, and 331 constables. In addition, there is a rural police force of 140 *daffad\u012brs* and 1,538 *chaukid\u016brs*. The District jail at Balasore has accommodation for 163 prisoners, and a subsidiary jail at Bhadrakh for 14.\n\nOf the population in 1901, 7.8 per cent. (15.7 males and 0.4 females) could read and write. The number of pupils under instruction increased from 22,737 in 1880\u20131 to 37,140 in 1892\u20133, but fell to 35,375 in 1900\u20131. In 1903\u20134, 30,034 boys and 4,447 girls were at school, being respectively 38.6 and 5.3 per cent. of the children of school-going age. The number of educational institutions, public and private, in that year, was 1,671, including 34 secondary, 1,535 primary, and 102 special schools. The expenditure on education was Rs. 1,47,000, of\nwhich Rs. 17,000 was met from Provincial revenues, Rs. 31,000 from District funds, Rs. 1,300 from municipal funds and Rs. 71,000 from fees. The chief schools are the Government and Baptist Mission high schools at Balasore; other special institutions are an industrial school at Alalpur, a madrasa at Dhamnagar, and eight schools for depressed tribes and castes.\n\nIn 1903 the District contained 11 dispensaries, of which 3 had accommodation for 71 in-patients; the cases of 43,000 out-patients and 600 in-patients were treated, and 1,700 operations were performed. The expenditure was Rs. 16,000, of which Rs. 600 was met from Government contributions, Rs. 6,000 from Local and Rs. 1,200 from municipal funds, and Rs. 3,000 from subscriptions.\n\nThe mortality from small-pox is comparatively high. Vaccination is compulsory only in Balasore municipality; but the population is not averse to vaccination, and 24,000 persons, or 23\u00b72 per 1,000 of the population, were successfully vaccinated in 1903-4.\n\n[Sir W. W. Hunter, Orissa (1872), and Statistical Account of Bengal, vol. xviii (1877); S. L. Maddox, Final Report on the Survey and Settlement of Orissa (Calcutta, 1900).]\n\nBalasore Subdivision.\u2014Head-quarters subdivision of Balasore District, Bengal, lying between 21\u00b0 4' and 21\u00b0 57' N. and 86\u00b0 21' and 87\u00b0 31' E., with an area of 1,155 square miles. The subdivision consists of a narrow strip of alluvial soil, shut in by the Bay of Bengal on the east and by the hilly country of the Garhjats on the west. The population in 1901 was 592,544, compared with 546,893 in 1891, the density being 513 persons per square mile. It contains one town, Balasore (population, 20,880), its head-quarters; and 2,112 villages. After Balasore, Baliapal is the chief centre of trade. A large annual fair is held at Remuna.\n\nBalasore Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the District and subdivision of the same name, Bengal, situated in 21\u00b0 30' N. and 86\u00b0 56' E., on the right bank of the Burhabalang river, about 15 miles from its mouth, though only 6 miles in a direct line from the sea. Population (1901), 20,880, of whom 16,671 were Hindus, 3,688 Muhammadans, and 510 Christians. The name is probably derived from the temple of Mahadeo Baneswar, which is still standing, and was so called after Banasura, its traditional founder.\n\nBalasore was the first place occupied by the English in Bengal. It owed its importance not so much to its convenience for trade with Orissa as to the safety of its roadstead, near the mouth of the Ganges, which enabled sea-going ships to unload their cargoes into smaller vessels for transport up the Hooghly. The earliest mention of the name in the English records is in 1633, when a party of factors, who had reached Orissa on a voyage from Masulipatam, received permission from the local governor to trade at Balasore; but the factory does\nnot seem to have been permanently established until 1651. The staff usually consisted of a chief and four other factors, subordinate to the agency at Hooghly. The most interesting event in its history is connected with the war between the English Company and Aurangzeb. In 1687, when Job Charnock was driven out of Hooghly, he avenged himself by sacking Balasore; and a similar exploit was repeated in the following year by Captain Heath, who had been sent out in command of a fleet from England. The importance of Balasore declined as the navigation of the Hooghly became more familiar to European pilots, while its local trade was affected by the Mar\u0101th\u0101 invasion of Orissa, and also by the silting up of the channel of the Burh\u0101balang river. During the eighteenth century it was regarded as a seaside health resort for the inhabitants of Calcutta. Governor Drake himself was there in 1756 when the trouble with Siraj-ud-Daula first began. After the fall of Fort William, the factors at Balasore safely withdrew and joined the fugitives at Falta; but the little sub-factory of Balr\u0101mgarhi (or Balr\u0101mgachi) at the mouth of the Burh\u0101balang river was never abandoned, and had the honour of being formally proclaimed the seat of the Presidency. In 1803, when Orissa was conquered from the Mar\u0101th\u0101s, Balasore was occupied, with trifling opposition, by a small force sent by sea from Calcutta.\n\nThe French, Dutch, and Danes also possessed settlements at Balasore. The two latter, known as Ulansh\u0101hi (Hollandais-sh\u0101hi) and Denam\u0101rd\u0101nga, were ceded to the British in 1846. The French settlement or l\u014dge, known as Far\u0101sd\u0101nga, was never ceded; it is subject to the authority of the Administrator at Chandernagore. The lease of the territory, which is only 38 acres in area, is disposed of annually by auction.\n\nBalasore lost a great deal of its importance when Government abandoned the monopoly of the salt manufacture and trade in 1863; but the port still possesses a large trade, and is in charge of the Port Officer at Ch\u0101ndb\u0101li. The principal exports are rice and stoneware quarried chiefly in the Nilgiri hills; and the principal imports are cotton twist, European cotton piece-goods, kerosene oil, and salt.\n\nBalasore was constituted a municipality in 1877. Though it includes an extensive bazar, the town is in reality little more than a collection of hamlets, the area within municipal limits being 5 square miles. The income during the decade ending 1901\u20132 averaged Rs. 18,000, and the expenditure Rs. 17,000. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 18,000, of which Rs. 8,000 was derived from a tax on persons (or property tax); and the expenditure was Rs. 16,000. The chief buildings are the usual public offices, the District jail, the general hospital, and a charitable dispensary, while the railway bridge over the Burh\u0101balang is an imposing structure. The jail has accommodation for 163 prisoners, who are employed on oil-pressing, weaving of coarse cloths and carpets, and cane\nand bamboo work. The chief educational institutions are the Government high school and a high school maintained by the American Free Baptist Mission.\n\n**Baldeo.**\u2014Town in the Mah\u0101ban tahsil of Muttra District, United Provinces, situated in 27\u00b0 24' N. and 77\u00b0 49' E., on the metalled road from Muttra city to Jalesar. Population (1901), 3,367. It is generally known in the neighbourhood as Dauji, and derives its importance from a celebrated temple. A shrine was first erected in the seventeenth century, when a statue of Baldeo was found in a tank. The present temple was built late in the eighteenth century. It is of mean appearance, and is surrounded by a number of quadrangles where the resident priests and pilgrims are accommodated. The temple is in charge of a peculiar caste called Ahiv\u0101si Br\u0101hmans, found only in this neighbourhood. Baldeo is administered under Act XX of 1856, with an income of about Rs. 1,100. There is a primary school with about 120 pupils.\n\n**B\u0101le-Honn\u016br.**\u2014Town (or rather group of villages) in the Koppa taluk of Kad\u016br District, Mysore, situated in 13\u00b0 22' N. and 75\u00b0 27' E., on the Bhadra river. Population, with associated villages (1901), 1,081. A fine bridge has recently been built across the river, which always had a ford at this point. To the north is the B\u0101lehalli math, the seat of one of the principal gur\u016bs of the Ling\u0101yat sect.\n\n**Baleswar.**\u2014River of Bengal and Eastern Bengal and Assam. See MADHUMAT\u012a.\n\n**Balgaon.**\u2014Town in Amraot\u012b District, Ber\u0101r. See WALGAON.\n\n**B\u0101li.**\u2014Village in the Ar\u0101mb\u0101gh subdivision of Hooghly District, Bengal, situated in 22\u00b0 49' N. and 87\u00b0 46' E., on the west bank of the Dw\u0101rkeswar river. Population (1901), 732. B\u0101li is the seat of a large trade in brassware and rice. Silk and cotton cloth of a superior quality are still manufactured here and in the neighbourhood, though the industry is on the decline. Diw\u0101nganj, a contiguous village, is the seat of a large market.\n\n**B\u0101li.**\u2014Town in Howrah District, Bengal. See BALLY.\n\n**B\u0101li.**\u2014Head-quarters of a district of the same name in the State of Jodhpur, R\u0101jput\u0101na, situated in 25\u00b0 11' N. and 73\u00b0 18' E., 1,013 feet above the sea, about 5 miles south-east of F\u0101lna station on the R\u0101jput\u0101na-M\u0101lw\u0101 Railway. Population (1901), 5,186. The town of B\u0101li is walled, and possesses a fort in good repair, a post office, a vernacular school, and a hospital with accommodation for 6 in-patients. About 10 miles to the south, near the village of Bij\u0101pur, are the remains of an ancient city called Hath\u016bndi or Hastikundi, the earliest seat of the R\u0101thor R\u0101jputs in R\u0101jput\u0101na. A stone inscription found here bears date A.D. 997, and tells of five R\u0101thor R\u0101j\u0101s who ruled at this place in the tenth century. The district of B\u0101li, which, with that of Desuri, forms the tract known as Godw\u0101r, was formerly held by the Chauh\u0101ns,\nand next by the R\u0101n\u0101s of Udaipur. It passed finally into the possession of the Jodhpur chiefs about the end of the eighteenth century.\n\nB\u0101lia.\u2014Village in Din\u0101jpur District, Eastern Bengal and Assam. See Alawakh\u0101wa.\n\nB\u0101li\u0101p\u0101l.\u2014Village in the head-quarters subdivision of Balasore District, Bengal, situated in $21^\\circ 39' N.$ and $87^\\circ 17' E.$, on the Matai river. Population (1901), 298. Rice to the annual value of a lakh of rupees is exported in sloops to Calcutta, Madras, and the Laccadives.\n\nB\u0101lip\u0101ra.\u2014Village in Darrang District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, situated in $26^\\circ 50' N.$ and $92^\\circ 44' E.$, about 20 miles north of Tezpur town. B\u0101lip\u0101ra is the terminus of a light railway, which runs from that point to the river gh\u0101t at Tezpur. A large market is held every Sunday, which is attended by great numbers of coolies from the tea gardens in the neighbourhood. Prior to the construction of the railway, an outpost of military police was stationed at B\u0101lip\u0101ra to keep the Ak\u0101s in check. In 1835 this outpost was rushed and seventeen persons killed by the hillmen. In 1883 the Ak\u0101s again gave trouble and carried off two native forest officers from the B\u0101lip\u0101ra range office.\n\nBalisna.\u2014Town in the P\u0101tan t\u0101luka, Kadi prant, Baroda State, situated in $23^\\circ 49' N.$ and $72^\\circ 15' E.$, with a population (1901) of 4,650. It is the home of the Leva Kunbis. The town possesses a vernacular school.\n\nBalkh.\u2014Town in Afgh\u0101n-Turkist\u0101n, situated in $36^\\circ 46' N.$ $66^\\circ 53' E.$; 1,266 feet above the sea. Balkh (Bactra) was the capital of the old Bactrian satrapy and subsequently of the Graeco-Bactrian kings. Its siege by Antiochus the Great (206 B.C.), followed by the temporary submission of king Euthydemus, marks the last effort of Seleucid power in these regions. On the overthrow of the Graeco-Bactrian kingdom, Balkh passed under the Yueh-chi and then under the Parthians; and it was here that Artaxerxes (Ardeshir), the first of the Sassanids, was acknowledged as Great King in supersession of the Parthian dynasty. After the overthrow of the Sassanid kingdom by the Arabs, Balkh and the adjoining territories, known as Hai\u0101thala or Tukh\u0101rist\u0101n (now Afgh\u0101n-Turkist\u0101n), fell under their sway, and the subsequent connexion of these was generally either with Khor\u0101s\u0101n or with Trans-Oxiana. On the break-up of the Khal\u012bfat, Balkh came successively under the rule of the Saff\u0101r\u012bds, the S\u0101m\u0101n\u012bds, the Ghaznivids, the Selj\u016bks, the Sh\u0101hs of Khw\u0101rizm, the Mongols of Chingiz who destroyed the city, and of Tim\u016br, from one of whose descendants it passed to the Uzbegs, Shayb\u0101n\u012bds, and J\u0101n\u012bds of the line of Chingiz. It was temporarily occupied, under the reign of the Mughal emperor Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n, by his sons, Mur\u0101d and Aurangzeb, but was evacuated very shortly. It passed into Afgh\u0101n possession under Ahmad Sh\u0101h Durr\u0101n\u012b, but was again lost (1826) in the troublous period that followed the\nexpulsion of his grandson, Mahm\u00fbd Sh\u00e2h. For a time it was ruled by an Uzbeg chief who owned a nominal suzerainty to Bokh\u00e2ra; but in 1840, disputes having arisen between the Am\u00eer of Bokh\u00e2ra and his vassal, the former crossed the Oxus, captured and destroyed the city of Balkh, and deported the majority of the inhabitants. In 1850 Balkh was again united to Afgh\u00e2nistan.\n\nThere is little of antiquarian interest to be seen at the present day in the ruins of this once great city, probably one of the oldest capitals in Asia, but now a small and insignificant T\u00e2j\u00eek village. The inner walls, which are still standing, enclose an area of about three square miles. The only buildings of any importance that yet retain any form or shape are the z\u00eearat and madrasa of Khw\u00e2ja Ab\u00fbnasar P\u00e2rsai, and it is doubtful whether these were built in the thirteenth or the sixteenth century. According to local tradition, Balkh has been destroyed twenty-four times; it certainly never fully recovered its destruction by Chingiz Kh\u00e2n, attended by the wholesale massacre of the inhabitants, though it was not until the capture of the city by the Am\u00eer of Bokh\u00e2ra (1840) that it was finally abandoned. No trace has been discovered of the ancient splendours of Bactra; and the still visible remains, which are scattered over a circuit of 20 miles, consist mainly of mosques and tombs of sun-dried bricks, and show nothing of even early Muhammedan date. The old Arab historians record a heathen temple at Balkh, called by them Naobih\u00e2r, which Sir Henry Rawlinson points out to have been certainly a Buddhist monastery (naava vih\u00e2r\u00fb). The name Naobih\u00e2r still attaches to a village on one of the Balkh canals, thus preserving through many centuries the memory of the ancient Indian religion.\n\nB\u00e2lkonda.\u2014J\u00e2g\u00eer town in the Arm\u00fbr t\u00e2luk of Niz\u00e2m\u00e2b\u00e2d District, Hyder\u00e2b\u00e2d State, situated in 18\u00b0 53' N. and 78\u00b0 21' E., six miles north-east of Arm\u00fbr town, and 24 miles from the Ind\u00fbr station on the Hyder\u00e2b\u00e2d-God\u00e2v\u00e2ri Valley Railway. Population (1901), 5,118. The town is surrounded by an old ruined wall, still having a few gates and posterns. It contains one temple, four mosques, one of the latter being built of stone, several tombs and shrines, and an idg\u00e2h used for prayers on Musalm\u00e2n holidays. A fort stands near a large tank in the vicinity of the town, on the Hyder\u00e2b\u00e2d-N\u00e2gpur road, and small watch-towers are perched on the topmost crags of the hills in the neighbourhood. A post office and a police station are located here, besides the j\u00e2g\u00eer tahsil office, and a civil and criminal court.\n\nBallabgarh Tahsil.\u2014Southern tahsil of Delhi District, Punjab, lying between 28\u00b0 12' and 28\u00b0 36' N. and 77\u00b0 7' and 77\u00b0 31' E., with an area of 395 square miles. It lies to the west of the river Jumna, which separates it from the Bulandshahr District of the United Provinces. The population in 1901 was 126,693, compared with 119,652 in 1891.\nIt contains the two towns of Ballabgarh (population, 4,506), the headquarters, and Faridabad (5,310); and 247 villages. The land revenue and cesses in 1903\u20134 amounted to 2.7 lakhs. The country is in general bare and treeless. On the east lie the Jumna lowlands, while the hills that run south from the Delhi Ridge cross the western portion of the tahsil. The rest consists of a plain of sandy loam.\n\n**Ballabgarh Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of the tahsil of the same name in Delhi District, Punjab, situated in 28\u00b0 20' N. and 77\u00b0 20' E., 24 miles south of Delhi on the Delhi-Muttra road and the Delhi-Agra branch of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway. Population (1901), 4,506. The name Ballabgarh is a corruption of Balramgarh, 'the fort of Balram,' a Jat chief who held the surrounding country under Suraj Mal of Bharatpur, and built the fort and palace. In 1775 the estate was transferred by the Delhi emperor to Ajit Singh, whose son Bahadur Singh was recognized in 1803 as chief and built the town. His successor was hanged for complicity in the Mutiny of 1857 and the estate confiscated. The municipality was created in 1867. The income during the ten years ending 1902\u20133 averaged Rs. 7,000, and the expenditure Rs. 6,300. The income in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 8,700, chiefly derived from octroi; and the expenditure was Rs. 6,900. The town possesses a vernacular middle school and a dispensary.\n\n**Ballarayandurga.**\u2014Fortified hill in the Western Ghats, situated in 13\u00b0 8' N. and 75\u00b0 25' E., in the south-west of Kadur District, Mysore; 4,940 feet above the sea. It was a stronghold of the Hoysala kings in the twelfth century. Hither the queen of Bednur fled for refuge when her capital was taken by Haidar Ali in 1763, and here she was captured and sent as a prisoner to Maddagiridurga.\n\n**Ballia District (Baliya).**\u2014Eastern District of the Benares Division, United Provinces, lying between 25\u00b0 33' and 26\u00b0 11' N. and 83\u00b0 38' and 84\u00b0 39' E., with an area of 1,245 square miles. It consists of a wedge-shaped tract of country forming the eastern extremity of the Ganges-Gogra Doab. It is bounded on the north-east by the Gogra, which separates it from Gorakhpur and from the Saran District of Bengal; on the south by the Ganges, which divides it from the Shahabad District of Bengal; and on the west by Azamgarh and Ghazipur. Ballia may be divided into two almost equal areas: the modern alluvial formation which lies along the banks of the Ganges and Gogra, especially the former; and the uplands in the centre and west, which consist of alluvium deposited in past ages. The meeting of these two areas takes place by a gentle slope, and there is no prominent ridge. Every part of the District is highly cultivated and thickly populated. The Ganges and Gogra are the chief rivers, and every year carry on a continual process of destruction and renewal. At each bend the concave bank is\nbeing eroded, while the opposite shore receives a new alluvial deposit to fill up the void left by the receding river. After a period of years the process is reversed, or the river suddenly cuts a new bed for itself. Besides the Ganges and Gogra, the only river of importance is the Chhot\u012b or Lesser Sarj\u016b, a branch from the Gogra, which leaves that river in Azamgarh, and joins the Ganges a little to the west of Balli\u0101 town. It forms approximately the boundary between this District and Gh\u0101zipur in the upper part of its course. The Sura\u1e25\u0101 T\u0101l, the largest perennial lake, is connected with the Ganges by a narrow deep channel, the Katih\u0101r Nadi, which admits the Ganges floods in the rainy season and drains the lake when the river falls again.\n\nThe whole District contains no rock formation; but the older alluvium is distinguished from the new by the prevalence of kankar or nodular limestone.\n\nThe flora of the District presents no peculiarity. The upland area is well wooded, and mango groves abound in great profusion. In the alluvial soil liable to be inundated the bab\u016bl (Acacia arabica) is the principal tree. The toddy palm (Borassus flabellifer) is very common in the west of the District. There is very little jungle; but where waste exists the dh\u0101k (Butea frondosa) is found, while on the banks of the rivers tall grasses and tamarisk form a refuge for wild hog.\n\nThe wild animals of Balli\u0101 are not important, owing to the density of population. Nilgai and wild hog are, however, found in the grass jungles near the rivers. Wild-fowl of numerous kinds frequent the lakes. Fish are plentiful in the rivers and ponds, and are much used for food. The fishing rights in the lower reaches of the Chhot\u012b Sarj\u016b belong to Government.\n\nBalli\u0101 resembles the border Districts of Gh\u0101zipur and Azamgarh in climate. Extremes of heat and cold are less than in the more western Districts, but to European constitutions and also to the natives of drier tracts the climate is relaxing.\n\nThe annual rainfall averages 42 inches, equally distributed in all parts. The rainy season commences early, and as a rule lasts longer than in the Districts farther west.\n\nThere is no material for a history of the District, which only became a separate entity in 1879. Many ancient mounds and ruined forts exist, which are generally assigned by the people to the Bhars and Cher\u016bs, who are said to have held the tract before the Musalm\u0101n conquest. Some of them probably contain Buddhist remains, and attempts have been made to identify sites visited by the Chinese pilgrims. Balli\u0101 was no doubt included in the early Hindu kingdom of Magadha, and a thousand years later in the Musalm\u0101n kingdom of Jaunpur. Under Akbar it belonged to the S\u016bbahs of Allah\u0101b\u0101d and Bih\u0101r. In the eighteenth century it became\nincluded in the territory subject to the R\u0101j\u0101 of Benares. The Do\u0101ba pargana was ceded to the British as part of Bih\u0101r in 1765, and the rest of the District in 1775. Up to 1879 Balli\u0101 was included first in Benares, and then in Gh\u0101zipur District. In 1893, when a wave of fanaticism spread over the east of the United Provinces, and riots took place about the slaughter of kine by Musalm\u0101ns, the Hindus of this District took a prominent part in the movement.\n\nBalli\u0101 contains 13 towns and 1,784 villages. Its population increased between 1872 and 1891, but decreased in the next decade. The numbers at the last four enumerations were as follows:\n\nPopulation. (1872) 726,791, (1881) 975,673, (1891) 995,327, and (1901) 987,768. The Census of 1872 probably understated the population, while in 1894 a serious outbreak of fever took place. The District supplies large numbers of emigrants to Eastern Bengal and Assam. There are three tahsils\u2014Balli\u0101, Rasr\u0101, and B\u0101nsd\u012bh\u2014each named from its head-quarters. The municipality of Balli\u0101, the District head-quarters, is the principal town.\n\nThe following table gives the chief statistics of population in 1901:\n\n| Tahsil | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|--------|---------------------|----------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Balli\u0101 | 44                  | 6              | 572      | 405,623    | 920                       | -0.1                                            | 17,657                           |\n| Rasr\u0101  | 433                 | 2              | 607      | 288,226    | 666                       | 6.3                                             | 6,065                            |\n| B\u0101nsd\u012bh| 371                 | 5              | 515      | 293,919    | 792                       | +4.4                                            | 8,236                            |\n| District total | 1,245               | 13             | 1,784    | 987,768    | 793                       | -0.8                                            | 31,958                           |\n\nAbout 93 per cent. of the population are Hindus and nearly 7 per cent. Musalm\u0101ns. The decrease in population between 1891 and 1901 was much less than in the adjoining Districts, while the density is higher than in any District in the Provinces except Benares. More than 99 per cent. of the population speak Bih\u0101r\u012b, the prevailing dialect being Bhojpuri.\n\nThe most numerous Hindu castes are: R\u0101jputs or Chhattris, 129,000; Br\u0101hmans, 117,000; Ahirs (graziers and cultivators), 111,000; Cham\u0101rs (leather-workers and labourers), 90,000; Koiris (cultivators), 64,000; Bhars (cultivators), 50,000; Bani\u0101s, 42,000; and Bhuinh\u0101rs (agriculturists), 31,000. The Bhars are an aboriginal race chiefly found in the Benares Division. The Dus\u0101dhs, 17,000, are noteworthy as supplying large numbers of village policemen and also of professional criminals. Among Musalm\u0101ns are Jul\u0101h\u0101s (weavers), 33,000; and Shaikhs, 8,000. About two-thirds of the total area is held by R\u0101jputs or Chhattris, who also cultivate a very large proportion. The District is essentially\nrural, 67 per cent. of the population being supported by agriculture, and nearly 7 per cent. by general labour.\n\nThere were no missions in the District up to 1903, and only four native Christians were enumerated in 1901. A mission has now been opened by a society called the Christian Church Workers of Canada.\n\nThe upland and lowland areas present strikingly different features. In the former rice is the most important crop, covering about half the area sown with autumn crops. The spring crop area varies considerably from year to year, being greatest when there has been heavy rain early in October. In the lowlands, however, the spring crops are more important than the autumn crops. Wheat, gram, peas, and barley are grown here. There is little rice in this tract, maize and small millets being the principal autumn crops, and they can often be harvested before the flood sets in. The annual deposits of the Ganges are usually very productive; but those of the Gogra are sandy, and sometimes quite infertile. In wet or cloudy winters the spring crops are very liable to rust.\n\nThe ordinary tenures existing in the permanently settled Districts of the United Provinces are found in Balli\u0101. A tenure called gamw\u0101dh is peculiar to this District. It consists in the grant by a zamind\u0101r of a village or part of a village at a fixed rent in perpetuity, the grant being generally for some consideration. These grants were originally made to Br\u0101hmans only. Complex mah\u0101ls extending to parts of a number of villages are very common, and the possession of a considerable tract of country by a clan of R\u0101jputs was a prominent feature in the early history of British rule. The main agricultural statistics for 1903\u20134 are shown below, in square miles:\n\n| Tahsil | Total | Cultivated | Irrigated | Cultivable waste |\n|--------|-------|------------|-----------|-----------------|\n| Balli\u0101 | 441   | 327        | 47        | 22              |\n| Rasr\u0101  | 433   | 270        | 167       | 66              |\n| B\u0101nsdih| 371   | 256        | 92        | 23              |\n| **Total** | **1,245** | **853**    | **306**   | **111**         |\n\nKodon and other small millets covered 146 square miles, barley 193, rice 143, peas 147, and gram 121. Other food-crops of importance are maize, arhar, and wheat. Sugar-cane is a most valuable crop, covering 58 square miles, and poppy is grown on 6 square miles.\n\nBefore the permanent settlement, a good deal of Balli\u0101 was waste; but improved administration soon led to extended cultivation, and at the first preparation of records in 1840 it was found that the District had become fully cultivated. There has been little extension since that date. Agricultural methods show no change. Very small\nadvances are made in ordinary years under the Agriculturists' Loans Act, and still smaller under the Land Improvement Loans Act. Out of a total of Rs. 46,000 advanced during the ten years ending 1900, the advances in two years amounted to Rs. 35,000. In the next four years only Rs. 520 was lent.\n\nThe cattle of the District are of a poor type, and the best animals are all imported or purchased at the large fair held near Balli\u0101 town. Horse-breeding operations under the Government Stud department were formerly carried on in and near the District at Korant\u0101dih, Buxar, and Gh\u0101zipur, and at that time the Government stallions were used by the zam\u012bnd\u0101rs. Since the abolition of the stud, about 1873, there has been a decline, but small ponies are still bred for sale in the neighbourhood. The sheep and goats are generally inferior.\n\nOut of 306 square miles irrigated in 1903-4, 232 were irrigated from wells, 44 from tanks and jh\u012bls, and 30 from other sources. Irrigation is required chiefly in the upland area, and wells are by far the most important source of supply. Rice land, however, is largely kept moist by small field embankments which hold up rain water. Artificial tanks are very numerous, but all are small excavations. Ponds and jh\u012bls or swamps are made use of as long as water remains in them. The only stream used to an appreciable extent is the Katih\u0101r Nadi, which is dammed at several places, and admits Ganges water to the Surah\u0101 T\u0101l during the rains. In the uplands water is raised from wells in leathern buckets drawn by bullocks. Where the spring-level is higher, the lever (dhenkli) is used, and the swing-basket is the usual means of lifting water from ponds and streams.\n\nKankar or nodular limestone occurs in the upland area, and is used for making lime and metalling roads. Saline efflorescences (reh) are found in the west of the District, and large quantities of saltpetre and carbonate of soda are manufactured.\n\nThe most considerable industry is sugar-refining, after indigenous methods, and the raw material is sometimes imported from Sh\u0101h\u0101b\u0101d. Coarse cotton cloth is woven in many villages, chiefly for local use. A little indigo is made, but this industry is fast disappearing.\n\nThe principal article of trade is sugar, which is exported largely to Bengal, and also to R\u0101jput\u0101na and Bombay. Oilseeds, gram, wheat, saltpetre, carbonate of soda, and a little coarse cloth are exported, chiefly to Bengal; and the imports are rice, spices, piece-goods, salt, and metals. River traffic has survived in this District, especially on the Gogra and Chhot\u012b Sarj\u016b, but it seems probable that the railway extensions recently made will capture a great deal of the trade. Balli\u0101, Majhauw\u0101, Maniar, Belthr\u0101, and a village near Rasr\u0101 are the chief ports. A great deal of trade, especially in cattle and ponies, is carried\non at the annual fair held at Balli\u0101, and many small towns and villages play an important part in the trade of the District.\n\nA branch of the Bengal and North-Western Railway from Mau in Azamgarh passes through the District from west to east, where its terminus is situated near the bank of the Gogra; another branch from Jaunpur and Gh\u0101zipur joins this at Phepn\u0101. The Benares-Gorakhpur branch of the same railway traverses the north-west, crossing the Gogra by a bridge at Turtip\u0101r. There are 414 miles of roads, of which 52 are metalled. The latter are maintained by the Public Works department, but the cost of all but 9 miles is charged to Local funds. Avenues of trees have been planted along 88 miles. The chief routes are from Balli\u0101 town to Gh\u0101zipur, with a branch from Phepn\u0101 to Rasr\u0101, and from Balli\u0101 to Bansdih; the other metalled roads are chiefly short feeders to the railway.\n\nBalli\u0101 has suffered very little from scarcities. The south and east of the District are able to produce excellent spring crops after being flooded by the Ganges, and water can always be obtained from temporary wells. In 1896\u20137 this tract was hardly affected, and even in the west of the District nothing worse than scarcity was felt. No relief works were required in any part.\n\nThe Collector is usually assisted by four Deputy-Collectors recruited in India. Besides the ordinary members of the District staff, an officer of the Opium department is stationed at Balli\u0101. There is a tahsild\u0101r at the head-quarters of each tahsil.\n\nCivil work is dealt with by two Munsifs, and the District lies within the civil and criminal jurisdiction of the Judge of Gh\u0101zipur. Balli\u0101 bears an unenviable reputation for the litigious and quarrelsome nature of its inhabitants. Affrays, and even murders, arising from disputes about the changes made by the rivers, are more common than in most Districts of the United Provinces. The more serious offences against property are, however, infrequent, though the Dus\u0101dhs have a bad reputation as thieves and burglars, and the District is the home of many pickpockets and river-thieves who ply their trade elsewhere.\n\nPargana Do\u0101ba was acquired in 1765 with Bih\u0101r, and the rest of the District in 1775 with the province of Benares. Do\u0101ba was administered as part of Sh\u0101h\u0101b\u0101d District in Bengal till 1818, when it was transferred to Benares District, which at that time included Balli\u0101. Shortly afterwards Gh\u0101zipur District, including Balli\u0101, was separated from Benares, and in 1832 and 1837 portions of the present Balli\u0101 District were added to Azamgarh. Three parganas formed a separate subdivision of Gh\u0101zipur, administered by a member of the Indian Civil Service posted at Balli\u0101. In 1879 a separate District was formed, and in 1894 a considerable area was added from Gh\u0101zipur. The whole\nDistrict was thus permanently settled, in either Shahabad or Benares, before the close of the eighteenth century. A striking feature in the fiscal history of the District has been the tenacity with which the great landholding clans of Rajputs have maintained their hold on the land, in spite of nominal sales. This was facilitated by the fact that the permanent settlement was carried out without any attempt to record completely all interests in the land. The defect was remedied by a detailed survey, and a preparation of a record-of-rights at various times between 1837 and 1841. The records of the portion of the District included in Azamgarh were revised at the resettlements made in that District. For the greater part, however, the record was not periodically corrected, and soon became obsolete. In 1867-9 it was partially revised. At the same time village papers were prepared for the Lakhnesar pargana, for which no records of any sort existed. Shortly after the formation of a separate District a new revision was commenced, which was completed in 1885, and records are now maintained as in the rest of the Provinces. The present revenue demand is 6.8 lakhs, or about R. 1 per acre, varying in different parganas from R. 0.8 to Rs. 1.5.\n\nCollections on account of land revenue and total revenue have been, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 6.13   | 6.36   | 6.45   | 6.64   |\n| Total revenue  | 7.85   | 10.55  | 11.26  | 11.95  |\n\nThe only municipality is Ballia Town, but eight towns are administered under Act XX of 1856. Outside the limits of these, local affairs are managed by the District board, which had an income in 1903-4 of Rs. 86,000, of which Rs. 35,000 was derived from local rates and Rs. 25,000 from ferries. The expenditure was Rs. 96,000, including Rs. 51,000 spent on roads and buildings.\n\nThe District Superintendent of police has a force of 3 inspectors, 79 subordinate officers, and 274 constables, distributed in 12 police stations. There are also 119 municipal and town police, and 1,370 rural and road police. The District gaol contained on the average 50 inmates in 1903, but prisoners sentenced for long terms are transferred to Ghazipur or to a Central jail.\n\nBallia stands fairly high as regards the literacy of its inhabitants, of whom 3.2 per cent. (6.6 males and 0.1 females) could read and write in 1901. The number of public schools increased from 74 with 2,801 pupils in 1880-1 to 123 with 6,600 pupils in 1900-1, but part of this increase is due to additions to the District area. In 1903-4 there were 151 public schools with 7,423 pupils, all of whom\nwere boys, besides 13 private schools with 400 pupils. Only 455 pupils in both classes of schools were beyond the primary stage. One school was managed by Government, and 106 by the District and municipal boards. Out of a total expenditure on education of Rs. 39,000, Local funds contributed Rs. 32,000 and fees Rs. 6,000.\n\nThere are 5 hospitals and dispensaries, with accommodation for 32 in-patients. In 1903 the number of cases treated was 39,000, including 401 in-patients, and 3,256 operations were performed. The total cost was Rs. 7,600, chiefly met from Local funds.\n\nAbout 43,000 persons were successfully vaccinated in 1903-4, representing the high proportion of 44 per 1,000 of population. Vaccination is compulsory only in the municipality of Balli\u0101.\n\n[District Gazetteer (1884, under revision); D. T. Roberts, Report on Revision of Records, Balli\u0101 District (1886).]\n\n**Balli\u0101 Tahsil (Baliy\u0101).**\u2014Southern tahsil of Balli\u0101 District, United Provinces, comprising the parganas of Balli\u0101, Do\u0101ba, Kop\u0101chit (East), and Garha, and lying between 25\u00b0 33\u2032 and 25\u00b0 56\u2032 N. and 83\u00b0 55\u2032 and 84\u00b0 39\u2032 E., with an area of 441 square miles. Population fell from 406,151 in 1891 to 405,623 in 1901. There are 572 villages and six towns, including Balli\u0101 (population, 15,278), the District and tahsil head-quarters, Ch\u012bt F\u012brozpur or Bar\u0101g\u0101on (9,505), Bairi\u0101 (8,635), Bhalsand (5,777), and Narh\u012b (6,462). The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was Rs. 311,000, and for cesses Rs. 60,000. The density of population, 920 persons per square mile, is the highest in the District. The tahsil lies along the northern bank of the Ganges, with its eastern extremity enclosed between the Ganges and the Gogra. It is noted for its fertility, the soil being of modern alluvial formation, and a large portion being subject to annual inundation by the Ganges. The area under cultivation in 1903-4 was 327 square miles, of which only 47 were irrigated, almost entirely from wells and from the Katih\u0101r Nadi. The rich alluvial soil in the river bed does not require irrigation.\n\n**Balli\u0101 Town (Baliy\u0101).**\u2014Head-quarters of the District and tahsil of the same name, United Provinces, situated in 25\u00b0 44\u2032 N. and 84\u00b0 10\u2032 E., on the north bank of the Ganges, and on the Bengal and North-Western Railway. Population (1901), 15,278. The name of the town is popularly derived from V\u0101lmiki, the poet; but it has no history, though an attempt has been made to identity it with some of the remains visited by the Chinese pilgrims. The old town of Balli\u0101 was almost entirely destroyed by the erosive action of the Ganges between 1873 and 1877. Houses and offices were built on a new site; but the river still cut away the bank, and in 1894 the head-quarters were removed to Korant\u0101dih. A new civil station was then laid out a mile from the Ganges, and occupied in 1900. Balli\u0101 contains the\nusual public offices and a hospital and several schools. It has been a municipality since 1871. During the ten years ending 1901 the income and expenditure averaged Rs. 10,500. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 23,000, chiefly derived from a tax on circumstances and property (Rs. 5,000) and receipts at fairs (Rs. 12,000); and the expenditure was Rs. 23,000. Sugar and cloth are manufactured; and the town is one of the chief trade centres in the District, oilseeds and ghi being exported, and rice, piece-goods, metals, and salt being imported. Balli\u0101 is noted for the great Dadri fair held annually on the full moon of K\u0101rtik (October\u2013November). The attendance reaches 500,000 to 600,000 in favourable years, and a large trade is done in cattle and miscellaneous goods. Small charges levied from the dealers form the greater part of the municipal income. The municipality manages 1 school and aids 11 others with a total attendance of 570, besides the District school with 180 pupils.\n\n**Balligud\u0101 Subdivision.**\u2014Subdivision of Ganj\u0101m District, Madras, consisting of the Agency taluks of Balligud\u0101, R\u0101magiri, and Udayagiri.\n\n**Balligud\u0101 Taluk.**\u2014North-western Agency taluk of Ganj\u0101m District, Madras, with an area of 1,390 square miles. It consists of a confused mass of wooded hills intersected by deep ravines, and averages about 3,000 feet in elevation. The population, which consists mostly of Khonds, was 104,714 in 1901, compared with 107,213 in 1891. They live in 472 villages. The land revenue payable by the patros (headmen) and the chief of Katingia is only Rs. 170. The head-quarters are at Balligud\u0101, which is also the temporary station of the Special Assistant Agent and the Assistant Superintendent of police. To overawe the somewhat lawless Khonds, a force of 80 reserve police is stationed there in charge of an inspector. Excellent grass mats are made near it and are largely exported to the plains. The Balligud\u0101 Khonds are a wilder and more warlike type than those in Udayagiri. They are, however, getting accustomed to civilized rule, have given up Meriah (human) sacrifices since 1857, and have not taken part in any serious disturbance for nearly forty years.\n\n**Bally (B\u0101li).**\u2014Town in the head-quarters subdivision of Howrah District, Bengal, situated in 22\u00b0 39' N. and 88\u00b0 21' E., on the right bank of the Hooghly. The population increased from 13,715 in 1872 to 14,815 in 1881, 16,700 in 1891, and 18,662 in 1901. Bally is a flourishing town, containing paper- and bone-mills. It is a station on the East Indian Railway, 7 miles from Calcutta, and a place of call for a daily service of steamers between Calcutta and K\u0101lna. The Bally Kh\u0101l, which forms the main drainage channel of the D\u0101nkuni marshes, here debouches into the Hooghly, and along its right bank is a very large brick-making industry. Bally was constituted a municipality in\nThe income during the decade ending 1901-2 averaged Rs. 20,000, and the expenditure Rs. 18,000. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 32,000, half of which was derived from a tax on houses and land; and the expenditure was Rs. 29,000. The municipality maintains 15 miles of metalled and 13 miles of unmetalled roads.\n\n**Ballygunge.**\u2014Suburb of Calcutta. See Calcutta.\n\n**Balmer.**\u2014Town in Jodhpur State, Rajputana. See Barmer.\n\n**Balod\u0101 B\u0101z\u0101r.**\u2014Tahsil of Raipur District, Central Provinces, lying between 21\u00b0 15' and 21\u00b0 53' N. and 81\u00b0 38' and 82\u00b0 59' E., constituted in 1906 on the formation of the new Drug District. It contains the eastern portion of the old Simg\u0101 tahsil which was abolished, the Deori zamind\u0101ri from the Raipur tahsil and the Tareng\u0101 estate from Bilaspur District, and also that portion of Bilaspur District lying south of the Mah\u0101nadi which was transferred to Raipur. The area of the Balod\u0101 B\u0101z\u0101r tahsil is 1,933 square miles, and the population in 1901 of the area now constituting it was 264,063, compared with 318,706 in 1891. The density is 137 persons per square mile, and the tahsil contains 975 inhabited villages. The head-quarters are at Balod\u0101 B\u0101z\u0101r, a village with 1,858 inhabitants. The tahsil includes 270 square miles of Government forest. It contains the zamind\u0101ri estates of Deori, Bhatgaon, Katgi, and Bilaigarh, with a total area of 315 square miles, of which 45 are forest, and a population of 39,254 persons. The land revenue demand in 1902-3 on the area now constituting the tahsil was approximately 1.92 lakhs. The western portion, which was formerly in Simg\u0101, is open and populous, while the tract east of the Mah\u0101nadi contains some well-cultivated country and also considerable areas of forest.\n\n**B\u0101lotra.**\u2014Town in the Pachbhadr\u0101 district of the State of Jodhpur, Rajputana, situated in 25\u00b0 50' N. and 72\u00b0 15' E., on the right bank of the Luni river on the Jodhpur-Bikaner Railway. Population (1901), 5,118. The town is built on a sandhill, and possesses a combined post and telegraph office and an Anglo-vernacular school. The chief industries are dyeing and stamping of cotton cloths. Just across the river is the village of Jasol, where there is a small hospital, while at Tilw\u0101ra, 10 miles to the west, a famous horse and cattle fair is held yearly in March.\n\n**Balr\u0101mpur Estate.**\u2014The largest talukd\u0101ri estate in Oudh (United Provinces), situated in the Districts of Gond\u0101, Bahraich, Part\u0101bgarh, and Lucknow, with an area of 1,268 square miles. The land revenue payable to Government is 6.8 lakhs, of which 2.4 lakhs is due on account of permanently settled estates, and cesses amount to Rs. 74,000. The rent-roll exceeds 22 lakhs. The estate is being constantly enlarged by purchase.\n\nThe family traces descent to Bari\u0101r S\u0101h, a Janw\u0101r R\u0101jput, who was\ndeputed about 1374 by Firoz Shah Tughlak to suppress the marauding gangs in the east of what is now Bahraich District. Bariar Sah settled at Ikaun\u0101, and acquired a large estate. About 1566 Madho Singh, in the seventh generation from Bariar Sah, separated from his brother who held the ancestral property, and acquired an estate for himself between the Rapti and Kuwan\u0101. His son, Balram Das, founded the town of Balrampur and added to his father's acquisitions. The estate grew rapidly, and when Sadat Khan was appointed Nawab of Oudh, the Balrampur chief was forward in resisting his authority. In 1777 Nawal Singh became Raj\u0101 and was one of the greatest warriors of the Janwars. He was repeatedly engaged in hostilities with the Oudh officials, but, although often defeated by the Nawab's troops, he was never subdued, and succeeded in keeping the assessment on his pargana at so low a rate as to amount to little more than a tribute. His grandson, Drigbijai Singh, came into possession in 1836 at the age of eighteen, and was frequently engaged in warfare with the neighbouring chiefs of Utraula and Tulsipur and also with the revenue officers of the king's court. On the outbreak of the Mutiny, Drigbijai Singh was conspicuous for his loyalty. He sheltered the English officers of the District within his fort, and finally sent them in safety to Gorakhpur. This loyal behaviour exposed him to the hostility of the rebel government, and a farm\u0101n from Lucknow divided his territories among his old enemies. A rebel force was actually sent to carry out this order, but was recalled. In the trans-Gogra campaign, which concluded the Mutiny, Raj\u0101 Drigbijai Singh joined the British force and remained with it till the remnants of the rebel army were finally driven into Nep\u0101l. As a reward for his distinguished loyalty large estates in Gond\u0101 and Bahraich were conferred on him; 10 per cent. of the Government revenue on his ancestral estates was remitted, and the settlement of these was confirmed in perpetuity. He subsequently received the title of Maharaja Bahadur and was made a K.C.S.I. During the controversy over rights in land in the Province of Oudh, Drigbijai Singh was one of the leaders who helped to bring about a satisfactory settlement. On his death in 1882 he was succeeded by his widow; but the estate is now held by Maharaja Bhagwat\u012b Pras\u0101d, K.C.I.E., an adopted son, who ranks as the premier talukdar of Oudh after the Raj\u0101 of Kapurthala. Balrampur and Tulsipur are the chief places of commercial importance in the estate, while a large fair is held at Debi Patan.\n\nBalrampur Town.\u2014Town in the Utraula tahsil of Gond\u0101 District, United Provinces, situated in 27\u00b0 26' N. and 82\u00b0 14' E., on a branch of the Bengal and North-Western Railway, and on a metalled road from Gond\u0101 town. Population (1901), 16,723. The town was founded by Balram Das in the reign of Jahangir, and owes much to the Raj\u0101s in whose estate it is situated. A handsome stone temple, profusely\ncarved, was erected by the late Maharaja. Another fine stone building, containing a statue of Sir Drigbijai Singh, was erected by subscriptions from the tenants and lessees of the estate. A school with a boarding-house, a dispensary and female hospital, a large poorhouse, and an orphanage are also maintained by the estate, and are provided with excellent buildings. The Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101\u2019s palace is an imposing pile enclosing a large court. The town is well built and well drained, and a new bazar has recently been laid out near the railway station. Balrampur has been a municipality since 1870. During the ten years ending 1901 the income and expenditure averaged Rs. 6,500. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 8,000, chiefly raised from a tax on professions and trades; and the expenditure was also Rs. 8,000. There is a large traffic in grain, especially rice, and cotton cloth, blankets, and knives are made. Five schools have about 250 pupils, one being maintained by the American Methodist Mission.\n\nBals\u0101n (or Ghodna).\u2014One of the Simla Hill States, Punjab, lying between 30\u00b0 58\u2032 and 31\u00b0 7\u2032 N. and 77\u00b0 24\u2032 and 77\u00b0 35\u2032 E., with an area of 51 square miles. Population (1901), 6,704. The State lies 30 miles east of Simla, beyond the Giri river. It is fertile and contains fine forests of deod\u0101r. The chief, R\u0101n\u0101 B\u012br Singh, is a R\u0101jput who traces his descent from the Sirm\u016br dynasty, to which the State was tributary before 1805. The State is well administered on old-fashioned lines by the R\u0101n\u0101. The revenue is Rs. 9,000, out of which a tribute of Rs. 1,080 is paid to the British Government in lieu of thirty labourers.\n\nBaltist\u0101n.\u2014A tract under the Wazir Waz\u0101rat of Lad\u0101kh, Kashmir, also known as Little Tibet, lying approximately between 34\u00b0 and 36\u00b0 N. and 75\u00b0 and 77\u00b0 E. It is bounded on the north by the Muzt\u0101gh range and Nagar; on the east by Lad\u0101kh; on the south by Kashmir, Wardw\u0101n, and Z\u0101sk\u0101r; and on the west by Gilgit and Astor. The tract is situated in the midst of enormous mountain ranges with peaks of 25,000 and 26,000 feet, and one above 28,000 feet, and glaciers which are the largest known out of Polar regions. The villages cling to the river valleys, the most important of which are the Indus, the Shyok, and the Shigar, together with the Dr\u0101s and Suru rivers which unite near Kargil, the Braldu and Bashar which join the Shigar, and the Hushe and Saltaro which join the Shyok just above Khapalu, one of the most fertile oases in Baltist\u0101n.\n\nThere are no forests of any size or value. Deod\u0101rs and pines grow in clumps on the hills. In the villages and along the roadsides, where water is available, poplars and willows, as well as fruit-trees, grow freely. On the hill-sides and uncultivated land cumin-seed, violets, truffles, and asafoetida are gathered by the people.\n\nThe rainfall is light, about 6 inches in the year, and the air is dry\nand bracing. The snowfall is often considerable, and is of great importance to the villages which depend on the snow for their irrigation. In Skardu and Shigar snow remains from the middle of December till the middle of March. In Rondu snow rarely lies. The cold is intense, most of the rivers freeze and form natural roads, superior to the rough tracks on their banks, and there are many villages which the sun's rays do not reach for more than an hour daily. The climate in the spring and autumn is mild; but in July and August the heat in the villages on the Indus is very severe, especially in the sandy plains of Skardu and the narrow rock-bound valley of Rondu.\n\nThe old rulers of Baltistan, known as Rajas or Gialpos, trace their descent from a fakir. One of the most famous of the Gialpos was Ali Sher, who lived about the end of the sixteenth century.\n\n**History.** He conquered Ladakh, and built the fort on the rock at Skardu. Ahmad Shah was the last of the independent Rajas. His fort was captured by the Dogra general, Zorawar Singh, in 1849, and he himself accompanied Zorawar Singh on his ill-fated expedition into Tibet, and died in captivity near Lhasa. Several of his near relatives were deported as political prisoners to Kashmir, where their descendants still live. The present Rajas of Baltistan have little recognized power, but the people still look up to them with respect, and have endured their unlicensed exactions with patience.\n\nThe Baltis are of the same stock as the Ladakhis. They have Mongolian features, high cheek-bones, and eyes drawn out at the corners, but the nose is not so depressed as is the case with the Bhotis of Ladakh. There is very little to distinguish the Baltis from the Ladakhis, save the absence of the pigtail, but they are perhaps slighter in build and taller. They are good-natured and patient, and are devoted to polo. In spite of much oppression, they are a merry, light-hearted race, always ready to laugh. Their dress consists of a skull-cap, coat and trousers of wool, and raw skin boots made comfortable by grass quilted inside. They shave the head, leaving long elf-locks growing from behind the temple into which they entwine flowers.\n\nWhen the Baltis adopted Islam and became Shias they eschewed polyandry; and while in Ladakh, where polyandry prevails, the population does not fall heavily on the land, in Baltistan the population, owing to polygamy, is too large for the cultivated area. The density rises to 1,649 persons per square mile of cultivation in Khapalu, and the average per square mile of cultivation is 1,467. The constant subdivision of the lands held by a family leads to holdings becoming so small that the occupier can no longer subsist by cultivation, but deserts his land and turns to other means of earning a livelihood. There is in consequence much real poverty, and the Baltis emigrate to India in search of labour, or carry loads to Gilgit and Ladakh.\nThe principal castes are R\u0101j\u0101, Balti, Saiyid, and Brukpa. The Baltis are numerically the strongest, and hold most of the land; but the R\u0101j\u0101 caste, including the local chiefs and their collaterals, hold a considerable area of cultivation and enjoy numerous privileges. The Brukpa are immigrants from Dardist\u0101n, and are a distinct people from the Baltis. According to Major Kaye, Settlement Commissioner, Kashm\u012br, they correspond to the Dum in Kashm\u012br in their position among the village community.\n\nThe most important tracts in Baltist\u0101n are Sk\u0101rdu, Shigar, Braldah, Basha, Rondu, Haramosh, Kiris, Khapalu, Chorbat, Parkutta, and Tolti. Farther east lies Kargil, where some of the population are Buddhists, acknowledging the Grand L\u0101ma of Lh\u0101sa as their spiritual head. The Baltis have suffered great hardships from maladministration and forced labour in the past. The language of the people is Tibetan, with a small admixture of Persian and Arabic. It slightly differs from the Lad\u0101khi language, but the two peoples understand each other's talk.\n\nCultivation depends on irrigation; and where water is plentiful excellent crops are raised. The actual work of cultivation, except ploughing, is done almost entirely by women, as the men are away tending cattle on the distant pastures, carrying loads to Lad\u0101kh and Gilgit, or repairing the watercourses and the terraces on which their little fields are built up. In many places the fields are too small for ploughing by cattle, and then either spade labour is employed or the ploughs are drawn by human beings. The plough is light and is made entirely of wood. The chief spring crops are wheat, barley, beardless barley (grim), peas, beans, and lentils; while buckwheat, china (Panicum miliaceum), and kangni (Setaria italica) are the most important of the autumn crops. Turnips are also grown as a following crop after barley and grim. Except in the higher and colder tracts, or where manure is deficient, the land bears two crops each year.\n\nCertain land, usually strong and difficult to cultivate, situated high up the source of irrigation above the cultivation proper of the village, and known as ul \u0101bi, is reserved for growing fodder-grasses, chiefly lucerne. This is always watered, fenced, and carefully looked after.\n\nThe soil is light, and requires little ploughing. The time for sowing depends on the snow, and when snow lies long it is artificially cleared by sprinkling earth over it. Among other peculiarities of cultivation in Baltist\u0101n may be noticed the large amount of irrigation given to spring crops as compared with that given to autumn crops; the practice of rooting out the crops, instead of cutting them; the little preparation given to the soil after the spring crop has been harvested and before the autumn crop is sown on the same land; and the utter absence of\nrotation crops. In some villages good tobacco is grown. No crops can be raised without manure. As winter approaches, earth is stored on the house-tops and mixed with the dung of cattle and human excrement. The latter is always collected in small walled enclosures. The manure is carried out in the spring in baskets and spread thickly over the land. Frost or early snowfall may cause a failure of crops.\n\nFruits play an important part in the economy of the Baltis. The apricots are celebrated, and are largely exported to Kashmir and the Punjab. The dried fruit and the kernels are both in great demand. Traders pay large sums in advance for the crop. Mulberries are an important source of food. Raisins are exported. Excellent peaches, in quality hardly surpassed by the best English fruit, and good grapes, melons, and cucumbers are common.\n\nGold-washing is carried on in many villages, and all find it profitable, and pay most of the revenue from this source. The State charge for a licence for gold-washing is Rs. 10. In Kargil to the south-east of Baltistan the gold industry is of some importance, and for the most part the sand is excavated high above the present river-level. The present methods of washing are wasteful, and with better appliances the industry might give a large return. Arsenic is met with, and sulphur abounds. Copper is found in Rondu, and white nitre exists in several places, but is not collected.\n\nThere is very little trade. Tea, cloth, sugar, and rice are imported, and there is a small business in salt from Ladakh. The most considerable export is that of apricots and apricot kernels, but raisins are also exported to Kashmir. A special manufacture is a very close thick black pattu (frekhan), resembling the cloth of which pilot-jackets are made. A curiosity is the zahri-mora, a green soft stone like an inferior jade found in the Shigar valley. Cups and plates are made of it, and in Kashmir and the Punjab it is used as an antidote to poison and in eye diseases.\n\nCommunications are of the worst description, and money judiciously spent in road-making would add greatly to the comfort and prosperity of the Baltis. Several routes connect Baltistan with Kashmir, Ladakh, and Astor, and one dangerous track leads to Gilgit. Of the Kashmir routes, one passes over the Deosai plains. These lie at an elevation of 13,000 feet, and are surrounded by a ring of lofty mountains. For most of the year they are under snow, and even in the summer the cold at nights is intense. The so-called plains are mournful stretches of grass and stones, with many a bog difficult to cross, and uninhabited but for the marmots, an occasional bear, and swarms of big black gnats. The absence of wood for fuel, the distance from human habitations, and local superstitions regarding \u2018the devil\u2019s place\u2019 prevent the people from using the pastures of Deosai.\nBaltist\u0101n has recently been placed under the charge of the Wazir Wazarat of Ladakh. His local deputies are the tahsild\u0101rs of Skardu and Kargil. Both tahsils have recently been settled by a British officer, and it is probable that the long-suffering and patient Baltis may look for better days. The ex-Raj\u0101s, or Gialpos, still exercise some authority over the people, and a definite sum out of the several collections has now been alienated in favour of each family. The total land revenue assessed at the recent settlement of the tahsils of Skardu and Kargil was 1.4 lakhs. Of this about a fourth is taken in kind.\n\nBaluchist\u0101n (more correctly Balochist\u0101n).\u2014An oblong stretch of country occupying the extreme western corner of the Indian Empire, and situated between 24\u00b0 54' and 32\u00b0 4' N. and 60\u00b0 56' and 70\u00b0 15' E.\n\nIt is divided into three main divisions: (1) British Baluchist\u0101n, with an area of 9,476 square miles, consisting of tracts assigned to the British Government by treaty in 1879; (2) Agency Territories, with an area of 44,345 square miles, composed of tracts which have, from time to time, been acquired by lease or otherwise brought under control and been placed directly under British officers; and (3) the Native States of Kal\u0101t and Las Bela, with an area of 78,034 square miles.\n\nBaluchist\u0101n is bounded on the south by the Arabian Sea; on the north by Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n and the North-West Frontier Province; on the west by Persia; and on the east by Sind, the Punjab, and a part of the Frontier Province. The western boundary from Gwetter Bay to Kuhak was settled by Colonel Goldsmid in 1871. A line from Kuhak to Koh-i-Malik-Si\u0101h was defined by an Anglo-Persian Boundary Commission in 1896, and the southern portion of it was demarcated by pillars to the bank of the Talab river. There has been no demarcation north of that point; but the line thence to Koh-i-Malik-Si\u0101h is governed by the agreement of 1896 and a supplementary agreement concluded in May, 1905. The Baloch-Afghan Boundary Commission delimited the northern frontier between 1894 and 1896. The boundary dividing Baluchist\u0101n from the Frontier Province on the one hand and the Punjab on the other has been defined at various times since the establishment of the Agency. That between Sind and Baluchist\u0101n was settled in 1854 and demarcated in 1862.\n\nThe Province covers a total area of 131,855 square miles, including the Native States of Kal\u0101t and Las Bela, and is the largest of the Agencies administered under the Foreign Department. Its area exceeds that of the whole of the British Isles. The country, which is almost wholly mountainous, lies on the great belt of ranges connecting the Safed Koh with the hill system of Southern Persia. It thus forms a watershed, the drainage of which enters the Indus on the east and the Arabian Sea on the south, while on the north and west it makes its\nway to those inland lakes or hamuns which form so general a feature of Central Asia.\n\nThe name of the country is derived from the Baloch, whose migratory hordes gradually extended eastwards from Southern Persia in and after the seventh century, until they eventually took up a position in Kachhi about the fifteenth century. The Baloch are not, however, the most numerous people in the Province, being exceeded in numbers by both Br\u0101huis and Afgh\u0101ns.\n\nThe characteristic divisions of the country are four in number: upper highlands, lower highlands, plains, and deserts. The upper highlands, locally known as Khor\u0101s\u0101n, occupy the central and east-central portion of the country, extending between 28\u00b0 and 31\u00b0 N. Here the mountains reach an elevation of nearly 12,000 feet, while the valleys lie about 5,000 feet above sea-level. The lower highlands include the slopes of the Sulaim\u0101n range on the east, the Pab and K\u012brthar ranges on the south, and the ranges of Makr\u0101n, Kh\u0101r\u0101n, and Ch\u0101gai on the west. The elevation of the valleys in this tract varies from 250 feet above sea-level upwards. The plains of Baluchist\u0101n include the peculiar strips of country known as Kachhi and Las Bela, and the valley of the Dasht river. They may be described as flat triangular inlets of generally similar formation, running up into the mountains. Their population differs markedly from that of the highlands. The deserts are situated in the north-western part of the Province. They consist of open level plains covered with black gravel, or of broad expanses of deep sandhills which sometimes assume the proportions of formidable sand-mountains.\n\nThe general configuration of the mountains resembles the letter S. On the east the Sulaim\u0101n range stretches upwards in gradually ascending steps to the Takht-i-Sulaim\u0101n. The mountains then curve round in a westerly direction on the northern side of the Zhob river along the Toba-K\u0101kar hills till the Central Br\u0101hui range is reached. Near Quetta the direction becomes north and south, but from about the 66th degree of longitude the general trend is again in a westerly direction through Makr\u0101n and Kh\u0101r\u0101n. To the south of the Central Br\u0101hui range the K\u012brthar and Pab ranges occupy the south-east corner of the Agency. On the west four parallel ranges occur, the southernmost being known as the Makr\u0101n Coast range, the next as the Central Makr\u0101n range, north of which again lies the Si\u0101h\u0101n range. Above these are situated the R\u0101s Koh, skirting Kh\u0101r\u0101n, and the Ch\u0101gai hills. The mountains are, as a rule, composed of bare rocky limestone or conglomerate, and, except in the upper highlands, seldom have much vegetation. In southern Makr\u0101n the hills are distinguished by the absence of stones; and the white clay of which they consist has been worn by the lapse of ages into most fantastic shapes. A range seldom bears\na distinctive title, but every peak is known by a separate name to the inhabitants.\n\nNo rivers are to be found carrying a large and permanent flow of water. For the greater part of the year the beds contain merely a shallow stream, which frequently disappears in the pebbly bottom. Wherever practicable, this supply is taken off for irrigation purposes. After heavy rains the rivers become raging torrents; and woe to the man who happens to meet a flood in one of those weird gorges of stupendous depth, running at right angles to the general strike of the hills, which form so remarkable a feature of this region. Sometimes these defiles are so narrow that both sides can be touched at one time with the hands, and the walls rise many hundred feet perpendicularly upwards. The largest river in the country is the Hingol or Gidar Dhor. The north-eastern part of the Province is drained by the Zhob river on the east and the Pishin Lora on the west. Farther south the Nari receives the drainage of Loralai and Sibi Districts and passes through Kachhi. The rivers draining the Jhalawan country are the Mula, the Hab, and the Porali. In Makran the Dasht river carries off the drainage to the south, and the Rakhshan, which joins the Mashkel river, to the north.\n\nThe traveller who has left the plains of India and entered the passes of Baluchistan finds himself among surroundings which are essentially un-Indian. The general outlook resembles that of the Iranian plateau, and, taken as a whole, it is unattractive, though its peculiarities are not without a certain charm. Rugged, barren, sunburnt mountains, rent by huge chasms and gorges, alternate with arid deserts and stony plains, the prevailing colour of which is a monotonous drab. But this is redeemed in places by level valleys of considerable size, in which irrigation enables much cultivation to be carried on and rich crops of all kinds to be raised. The flatness of the valleys, due to the scanty rainfall, distinguishes Baluchistan from the Eastern Himalayas.\n\nWithin the mountains lie narrow glens, whose rippling watercourses are fringed in early summer by the brilliant green of carefully terraced fields. Rows of willows, with interlacing festoons of vines, border the clear water, while groups of ruddy children and comely Italian-faced women in indigo-blue or scarlet shifts and cotton shawls complete a peaceful picture of beauty and fertility. Few places are more beautiful than Quetta on a bright frosty morning when all the lofty peaks are capped with glistening snow, while the date-groves, which encircle the thriving settlements of Makran, are full of picturesque attraction. The frowning rifts and gorges in the upper plateau make a fierce contrast to the smile of the valleys. From the loftier mountain peaks magnificent views are obtainable.\n\nNo lakes of importance occur. The Hamun-i-Mashkel and Hamun-i-\nLora can hardly be described as such, for they only fill after heavy floods. The same may be said of the kops of Parom and Kolwa in Makran. The Siranda in Las Bela is a land-locked lagoon. Astalu or Haptal\u0101r, lying off the Makran coast, is the only island, unless the bare rock of Churna off Ras Muari be reckoned as such.\n\nThe Province has a coast-line of about 472 miles. The distance in a direct line, however, from Karachi to Gwetter Bay is only 335 miles. Owing to small rainfall, the salt nature of the soil, and the physical conformation of the country, the shore is almost entirely desert, presenting a succession of arid clay plains impregnated with saline matter and intersected by watercourses. From these plains rise precipitous table hills. The coast-line is deeply indented, but its most characteristic feature is the repeated occurrence of promontories and peninsulas of white clay cliffs, table-topped in form. The intermediate tract is low, and in some places has extensive salt-water swamps behind it. The chief ports on the coast are Sonmi\u0101ni or Mi\u0101ni, Pasni, and Gwadar. They are much exposed, and, owing to the shoaling of the water, no large ships can approach nearer than two or three miles.\n\nFor geological purposes Baluchistan is conveniently divided into three regions:\n\n1. An outer series of ranges, forming a succession of synclines and anticlines comparable in structure to the typical Jura mountains of Europe. In this region we have two subdivisions: (a) the semicircular area of Sewistan, and (b) the ranges of Kalat, Sind, and Makran, which continue into Southern Persia as far west as the Straits of Ormuz. Further curved ranges of the same type extend as far as Kurdist\u0101n.\n\n2. A region of more intense disturbance exhibiting the typical Himalayan structure, whose southern or south-eastern limit is a great overthrust forming the western continuation of the Great Boundary Fault of the Himalaya. It includes the ranges north of the Zhob and Pishin valleys. The Sewistan semicircular area stands very much in the same relation to these ranges as does the Jura to the Alps in Europe.\n\n3. A region of fragmentary ranges, separated by desert depressions, including the Nushki desert and Kh\u0101r\u0101n.\n\nLittle of the centre and west of Baluchistan has yet been geologically\n\n---\n\n1 From material supplied by Mr. E. Vredenburg, Deputy-Superintendent, Geological Survey of India.\n2 Though not locally recognized, this name has come into general use in scientific literature. It includes the Marri-Bugti country and the Districts of Sibi and Loralai.\n3 For an explanation of the Great Boundary Fault and a discussion of the Himalayan structure, see Manual of the Geology of India.\nexplored. In the following table, most of the formations occur indifferently in any of the three regions. The upper Eocene igneous intrusions are, however, restricted to the second and third regional types, and the Makr\u0101n group to the coast of that name.\n\n| Sedimentary rocks. | Approximate age. | Igneous rocks. |\n|-------------------|------------------|----------------|\n| Recent and sub-recent alluvial and eolian formations. | Quaternary (Pleistocene and recent) | Recent and sub-recent volcanoes. |\n| [Makr\u0101n group] | Upper. | Upper Miocene or Lowermost Pliocene. |\n| Siw\u0101lik | Middle. | Middle and Upper Miocene. |\n| | Lower. | Oligocene. |\n| N\u0101ri | Upper. | Priabonian. |\n| | Lower. | |\n| Unconformity. | Bartonian. | Basic dikes.

South of the Zhob valley occurs a succession of curved ranges in four distinct zones or belts, the first or outer one Siw\u0101lik, the second Eocene, the third Jurassic, and the fourth or innermost Triassic.\n\nOf the various geological groups the upper and middle Siw\u0101liks have, so far, proved unfossiliferous. The lowermost strata of the lower Siw\u0101liks contain fresh-water shells and remains of mammalia. The\nupper and lower N\u0101ri appear to be conformable with one another, the latter being well represented in the Bol\u0101n Pass. The Spintangi is a massive pale-coloured limestone that caps the scarp of the K\u012brthar range. It is the most important of the nummulitic limestones in Baluchist\u0101n. Shaly intercalations occur here and there in the Spintangi limestone, and become gradually more abundant towards its base, thus passing into the next underlying group called the Gh\u0101zij. The Gh\u0101zij beds are the only formations among all the rocks in Baluchist\u0101n that have as yet proved of economic importance, owing to the coal seams which they contain. When the thickness of the Gh\u0101zij increases considerably, this group becomes very similar in appearance to the Khojak shales, the age of which is well established by the presence of nummulites contained in calcareous shales and massive dark bituminous limestone towards the base of the group. *Cardita Beaumonti* beds occur in the form of detached patches in many parts. The exposures of the Dungh\u0101n series are of limited extent. This consists of an extremely variable series of shales and limestone often merging into the flysch facies. Below comes a group of shales of Neocomian age containing innumerable specimens of belemnites, known as Belemnite beds. They rest on the massive limestone of which all the more conspicuous peaks in Baluchist\u0101n are composed. The Triassic shales and limestones, forming an extensive outcrop south of the Zhob valley, are profusely injected by great intrusive masses of coarse-grained gabbro, often altered into serpentine, and innumerable dolerite or basalt veins and dykes of the Deccan trap age. To this period also belong many of the igneous rocks, both intrusive and eruptive, which occur abundantly in all three of the regional types mentioned above. A second group of igneous rocks is represented by deep-seated intrusions, without any connexion with volcanoes; it belongs to the second and third regional types, where it forms the granite and diorite of the Khw\u0101ja Amr\u0101n, the augite-syenite and augite-diorite of the R\u0101s Koh, and the hornblende-diorite of Ch\u0101gai. Owing to the absence of rain, the materials formed by the disintegration of the mountains are not removed by rivers, but form immense deposits which are, therefore, of enormous depth. The desert plains represent vast areas of subsidence in regions once occupied by inland seas or lakes.\n\n1 The flora of the plains and lower highlands resembles in general aspect the vegetation of Western R\u0101jput\u0101na and the adjoining parts of the Punjab. Trees and herbs are conspicuously absent; and the bare stony soil supports a desolate jungle of stunted scrub, the individual plants of which are almost all armed to the leaf-tip with spines, hooks, and prickles of diverse appearance but alike in malignancy. A few, like the two first mentioned below, dispense with leaves altogether; and others, like *Boucerosia*, protect their fleshy branches with a hide-like\n\n---\n\n1 From notes by Major D. Prain, Director, Botanical Survey of India.\nepidermis. The commoner constituents of this ill-favoured flora are *Capparis aphylla*, *Periploca aphylla*, *Boucerosia*, *Tecoma undulata*, *Acanthodium spicatum*, *Prosopis spicigera*, *Withania coagulans*, *Zizyphus jujuba*, *Salvadora oleoides*, *Calotropis procera*, *Caragona polyacantha*, three kinds of *Acacia*, *Leptadenia Spartium*, *Taverniera Nummularia*, *Physorhynchus brahuicus*, and *Alhagi camelorum*. In low-lying parts where water is available *Tamarix articulata* and *T. gallica* are found. Here and there *Euphorbia neriifolia* and the dwarf-palm (*Nannorhops Ritchieana*) occur, the latter often in great quantities. The herbaceous vegetation is very scanty, consisting of such plants as *Aerva javanica*, *Pluchea lanceolata*, *Fagonia arabica*, *Mimulus alatus*, and *Cassia obovata*; near water, *Eclipta erecta*; and as weeds of cultivation, *Solanum dulcamara* and *Spergularia*. Two species akin to *Haloxylon*, *Suaeda vermiculata* and *Salsola foetida*, abound on saline soil. *Panicum antidotale* is the most important grass, but *Eleusine flagellifera* and a species of *Eragrostis* are also abundant.\n\nIn the upper highlands the flora is of a quite different type. The long flat valleys have, for the greater part of the year, a monotonous covering of *Artemisia* and *Haloxylon Griffithii*, diversified, where there are streams, with tamarisks and species of *Salsola*, *Arenaria*, *Halocharis*, &c. On the surrounding hills, up to an elevation of 7,000 feet above sea-level, are to be found species of *Acantholimon*, *Acanthophyllum*, *Salvia*, *Amygdalus*, *Spiraea*, *Gentiana*, *Eremotachys*, and *Campanula*. Pistachio trees, associated with ash, wild olive, and daphne, are also common. Myrtle is occasionally found in the valleys. At higher elevations *Juniperus macropoda* and *Prunus eburnea* are abundant. Other plants common at these altitudes are *Lonicera*, *Caragana ambigua*, *Berberis*, *Cotoneaster nummularia*, *Spiraea brahuica*, *Rosa Beggeriana*, *Salvia cabulica*, *Berchemia lineata*, *Viola kunawarensis*, *Leptorhabdos Benthamiana*, and two varieties of *Pennisetum*. With the coming of spring a host of bulbous and other herbaceous plants, which have lain hidden throughout the winter, send forth leaves and flowers and for a few weeks make the valleys and hill-sides gay with blossoms of divers hues. They include four varieties of *Iris*, *Hyacinthus glaucus*, *Tulipa chrysantha*, *Tulipa montana*, *Fritillaria*, *Eremurus persicus*, *Cheiranthus Stocksianus*, *Campanula Griffithii*, *Delphinium persicum*, several species of *Alyssum*, and many species of *Astragalus*. In swampy grass lands spring up *Ononis hircina*, *Ranunculus aquatilis*, *Lotus corniculatus*, *Plantago major*, and *Eragrostis cynosuroides*. The weeds of cultivation include *Adonis aestivalis*, *Hypecoum procumbens*, *Fumaria parviflora*, *Malcolmia africana*, *Sisymbrium Sophia*, *Lepidium Draba*, *Malva rotundifolia*, *Veronica agrestis*, and many others. This many-coloured carpet of flowers endures for all too brief a season, for, under the intolerable heat of the summer sun, it speedily shrivels and disappears.\nThe fauna has never been completely studied. In the higher hills are to be found the mountain sheep (*Ovis vignei*) and the *markhor* (*Capra falconeri*). The latter, which is of the K\u0101bul and Sulaim\u0101n varieties, lives a solitary life in the glens and cavities of the mountains, while the mountain sheep wanders on the lower slopes. In the lower highlands the *markhor* is replaced by the Sind ibex (*Capra aegagrus*). The leopard (*Felis pardus*) is frequently seen, and the black bear (*Ursus torquatus*) is found here and there. The Asiatic wild ass (*Equus hemionus*) haunts the deserts of Kh\u0101r\u0101n and Nushki. The Indian wolf (*Canis pallipes*) sometimes occurs in considerable numbers and does much damage to flocks. Several kinds of foxes are found, their skins being in some demand.\n\nThe characteristic game-birds of the country are *chikor* (*Caccabis chuar*) and *sisi* (*Ammoperdix bonhami*), which abound in years of good rainfall and afford excellent sport. Large flocks of sand-grouse pass through the country in the winter, and the tanks are frequented by many varieties of wild-fowl. A few woodcock are also to be found. Most of the birds of B\u0101luchist\u0101n are migratory. Of those permanently resident, the most characteristic are the raven, frequent everywhere; the l\u00e4mmergeyer, for which no place is too wild; and the golden eagle. Among the visitors the most common are different species of *Saxicola*, headed by the pied chat, and several kinds of shrikes which appear in spring in large numbers. Sea-birds are numerous along the coast.\n\nReptiles include the tortoise, several genera of lizards, of which the species *Phrynocephalus* is the most common, and the skink. Eleven genera of snakes have so far been discovered, the most numerous in species being *Zamenis*, *Lytorhynchus*, and *Distira*. They also include *Eristocophis macmahonii*.\n\nThe coast swarms with fish and molluscs, the former including sharks, perch, cat-fish, herrings, yellow-tails, and pomfrets.\n\nThe study of insects has been confined almost entirely to Quetta-Pishin. Two species of locust are among the most conspicuous, and dragon-flies are common, as also are bees, wasps, &c. The latter include both Indian and European species, and many of them have been described by Russian naturalists. Butterflies are scarce, but moths are fairly numerous. Ants are found plentifully, but few species have been recognized. Sand-flies are common, and few persons escape their irritating attentions. Among the lesser-known classes of insects may be mentioned cicadas, which sometimes appear in vast numbers, and *Argas persicus*, so noxious to human beings. Plant-lice do great damage to many of the trees.\n\nIn a country which includes such varied natural divisions, differences of climate are varied and extreme. It is temperate or otherwise in proportion to local elevation above sea-level. Climatic conditions similar\nto those of Sind prevail in the plains and lower highlands, but in the upper highlands the seasons of the year are as well marked as in Europe. Owing to the proximity of the hills, the heat of the plains in summer is probably even greater than that of Jacob\u0101b\u0101d, where the mean temperature in July is $96^\\circ$. 'O God, when thou hadst created Sibi and D\u0101dhar, what object was there in conceiving hell?' says the native proverb. In this part of the country also the deadly simoom is not infrequent. During the short cold season, on the other hand, the climate is delightful. In the upper highlands the heat is never intense, the mean temperature at Quetta in July being only $79^\\circ$. Except at Chaman, the diurnal range is highest in November. In winter the thermometer frequently sinks below freezing-point; snow falls and icy winds blow. The following table indicates the average temperature at places for which statistics are available. The figures for Jacob\u0101b\u0101d, which is in Sind but lies close to the border of Baluchist\u0101n, have been inserted as typical of the conditions in the Kachhi plain:\n\n| Height of Observatory above sea-level | January | May | July | November |\n|---------------------------------------|---------|-----|------|----------|\n| Feet                                  | Mean    | Diurnal range | Mean | Diurnal range | Mean | Diurnal range | Mean | Diurnal range |\n| Chaman                                | 4,311   | 43-2 | 18-1 | 79-6 | 27-7 | 88-3 | 26-6 | 57-6 | 24-5 |\n| Quetta                                | 5,502   | 49-0 | 21-8 | 67-8 | 31-4 | 78-7 | 27-9 | 48-7 | 32-7 |\n| Jacob\u0101b\u0101d                             | 186     | 58-1 | 29-8 | 94-7 | 33-1 | 96-2 | 23-9 | 69-1 | 35-8 |\n\n**Note.\u2014** The diurnal range is the average difference between maximum and minimum temperature of each day.\n\nThe mountainous character of the country affects the direction and force of the winds. These partake largely of the character of draughts traversing the funnel-like valleys and finally striking the hills, where they empty the vapour that they carry. The north-west wind, known to the natives as gorich, blows constantly. It is bitterly cold in winter and, in the west, scorching in summer. The west of Ch\u0101gai is subject to the effect of the wind so well-known in Persia as the b\u0101d-i-sad-o-b\u012bst-roz, or '120 days' wind.'\n\nBaluchist\u0101n lies outside the monsoon area and its rainfall is exceedingly irregular and scanty. Sh\u0101hrig, which has the heaviest rainfall, can boast of no more than $11\\frac{3}{4}$ inches in the year. In the highlands few places receive more than 10 inches, and in the plains the average amount is about 5 inches, decreasing in some cases to 3. The plains and the lower highlands receive their largest rainfall in the summer, and the upper highlands in the winter from the shallow storms advancing from the Persian plateau. In the former area the wettest month is July; in the latter February. The table on the next page shows,\nfor eight to twelve year periods ending in 1901, the average rainfall received at principal places:\n\n|        | January | February | March | April | May | June | July | August | September | October | November | December | Total |\n|--------|---------|----------|-------|-------|-----|------|------|--------|-----------|---------|-----------|----------|-------|\n| Chaman | 1.48    | 1.78     | 1.18  | 0.51  | 0.11| 0.07 | 0.11 | ...    | 0.03      | 0.35    | 1.08      | 6.70    |\n| Quetta | 1.98    | 2.12     | 1.78  | 1.06  | 0.47| 0.17 | 0.93 | 0.56   | 0.11      | 0.08    | 0.34      | 0.92    | 10.52 |\n| Sibi   | 0.53    | 0.32     | 0.27  | 0.09  | 0.29| 0.32 | 1.26 | 1.19   | 0.24      | ...     | 0.14      | 0.51    | 5.16  |\n| Loralai| 0.98    | 1.13     | 1.06  | 0.47  | 0.80| 0.41 | 1.72 | 0.99   | 0.11      | 0.06    | 0.15      | 0.49    | 8.37  |\n| Fort Sandeman | 0.62 | 1.04 | 1.57 | 0.78 | 0.71 | 0.98 | 2.49 | 1.15 | 0.07 | 0.05 | 0.25 | 0.30 | 10.01 |\n\nThe conformation of the surface of the country renders much damage from floods impossible, but the vast volumes of water which occasionally sweep down the river channels sometimes cause harm and loss of life. The floods are generally very sudden, and have been known to rise to a great height in the N\u0101ri. The only known cyclone was that which visited Las Bela in June, 1902, destroying many cattle. Earthquakes are common everywhere and are frequently continuous. They sometimes cause much damage. A large earthquake crack has been traced for no less than 120 miles along the Khw\u0101ja Amr\u0101n and Sarlath ranges, and near this range of hills a disastrous earthquake occurred on December 20, 1892.\n\nOne of the most striking facts in the history of Baluchist\u0101n is that, while many of the great conquerors of India have passed across her borders, they have left few permanent marks of their presence. Macedonian, Arab, Ghaznivid, Mongol, Mughal, Durr\u0101ni, all traversed the country, and occupied it to guard their lines of communication, but have bequeathed neither buildings nor other monument of their presence.\n\nThe earliest-known mention of part of Baluchist\u0101n is in the Avesta, the Vara Pish\u012bn-anha of which is undoubtedly identifiable with the valley of Pish\u012bn. In the Sh\u0101hn\u0101ma we have an account of the conquest of Makr\u0101n by Kai Khusr\u016b (Cyrus), and the Achaemenian empire which reached its farthest limits under Darius Hystaspes included the whole of the country. Among Greek authors Herodotus gives us little information about Baluchist\u0101n. He merely mentions Paktyake, which has been identified with the country of the Pakht\u016bns or Afgh\u0101ns. It is to Strabo that we owe the best account, and from his writings we are able to identify the localities into which Baluchist\u0101n was distributed in ancient geography. On the north-east, and probably including all the upper highlands, was Arachosia; directly west of it was Drangiana; to the south lay Gedrosia; while in the Ichthyophagoi, Oraita\u012b, and Arabies or Arabii are to be identified the fishermen of the Makr\u0101n.\ncoast, the inhabitants of Las Bela, and the people of the Hab river valley respectively.\n\nAlexander's retreat from India led him through Las Bela and Makran, while a second division of his army under Craterus traversed the Mula Pass, and a third coasted along the shore under Nearchus. Alexander's march and the sufferings of his troops are graphically described by Arrian. After Alexander's death, Baluchistan fell to Seleucus Nicator, and later on passed from his descendants to the Graeco-Bactrian kings who ruled also in Afghanistan and in the Punjab. Between 140 and 130 B.C., they were overthrown by a Central Asian horde, the Sakas, who passed along to the valley of the Helmand. About this time Buddhism, of which many traces are still to be found, flourished in Baluchistan. The empire of the Sassanians which followed expanded slowly towards the east, and Baluchistan was not conquered till the time of Nausherwan (A.D. 529-77).\n\nHenceforth the suzerainty over the petty rulers of Baluchistan alternated between east and west. In the fourteenth year of the Hijra (635-6) Rai Chach marched from Sind and conquered Makran. The Rai dynasty at the same time appear to have extended their dominions to the north towards Kandahar. The Arabs reached Makran as early as the year 643. The parts of Baluchistan which subsequently became best known to them were Turan (the Jhalawan country), with its capital at Khuzdar, and Nudha or Budha (Kachi). Their power lasted till towards the end of the tenth century; for when Ibn Haukal visited India for the second time about 976, he found an Arab governor residing in Kaikanan (probably the modern Nal) and governing Khuzdar.\n\nShortly afterwards Baluchistan fell into the hands of Nasir-ud-din Sabuktagin; and his son, Mahmud of Ghazni, was able to effect his conquests in Sind owing to his possession of Khuzdar. From the Ghaznivids it passed into the hands of the Ghorids and, a little later, was included in the dominion of Sultan Muhammad Khan of Khwarizm (Khiva) in 1219.\n\nAbout 1223 a Mongol expedition under Chagatai, Chingiz Khan's son, penetrated as far as Makran. A few years later Southern Baluchistan came under the rule of Sultan Altamsh of Delhi, but it appears soon to have reverted to the Mongols. The raids organized by Chingiz Khan have burned deep into the memory of Baluchistan. From Makran to the Gomal, the Mongol (known to the people as the Mughal) and his atrocities are still a byword in every household.\n\nHenceforth the history of Baluchistan centres round Kandahar; and it was from this direction that in 1398 Pir Muhammad, the grandson of Timur, was engaged in reducing the Afghans of the Sulaiman mountains. Local tradition asserts that Timur himself passed through the Marri\ncountry during one of his Indian expeditions. The succeeding century is one of great historical interest. The Baloch extended their power to Kal\u0101t, Kachhi, and the Punjab, and the wars took place between M\u012br Ch\u0101kar the Rind and Gw\u0101hr\u0101m L\u0101sh\u0101ri which are so celebrated in Baloch verse. In these wars a prominent part was played by M\u012br Zunn\u016bn Beg, Argh\u016bn, who was governor of north-eastern Baluchist\u0101n under Sult\u0101n Husain Mirza of Her\u0101t about 1470. At the same time the Br\u0101huis had been gradually gaining strength, and their little principality at this time extended through the Jhalaw\u0101n country to Wad. The Argh\u016bns shortly afterwards gave way before B\u0101bar. From 1556 to 1595 the country was under the Safavid dynasty. Then it fell into the hands of the Mughals of Delhi until 1638, when it was again transferred to Persia.\n\nWe have an interesting account of Baluchist\u0101n in the Ain-i-Akbar\u012b. In 1590 the upper highlands were included in the sark\u0101r of Kandah\u0101r, while Kachhi was part of the Bhakkar sark\u0101r of the Mult\u0101n S\u016bbah. Makr\u0101n alone remained independent under the Malikis, Buledais, and Gichkis, until Nas\u012br Khan I of Kal\u0101t brought it within his power during the eighteenth century.\n\nFrom the middle of the seventeenth century Baluchist\u0101n remained under the Safavids till the rise of the Ghilzai power in 1708. The latter in its turn gave way before N\u0101dir Sh\u0101h, who, during the first part of the eighteenth century, made several expeditions to or through Baluchist\u0101n. Ahmad Sh\u0101h Durr\u0101ni followed; and thenceforth the north-eastern part of the country, including almost all the areas now under direct administration, remained under the more or less nominal suzerainty of the Sadozais and B\u0101rakzais till 1879, when Pishin, Duki, and Sibi passed into British hands by the Treaty of Gandamak.\n\nMeanwhile the whole of Western Baluchist\u0101n had been consolidated into an organized state under the Ahmadzai Kh\u0101ns of Kal\u0101t. All tradition asserts that the former rulers of Kal\u0101t were Hindus, Sew\u0101 by name. As Muhammadan dynasties held Baluchist\u0101n from about the seventh century, we must look to an earlier period for the date of the Sew\u0101s; and it is not improbable that they were connected with the Rai dynasty of Sind, whose genealogical table includes two rulers named Sihras. The Mirw\u0101ris, from whom the Ahmadzais are descended, claim Arab origin. In their earlier legends we find them living at Sur\u0101b near Kal\u0101t, and extending their power thence in wars with the Jats or Jadg\u0101ls. They then fell under the power of the Mongols; but one of their chiefs, M\u012br Hasan, regained the capital from the Mongol governor, and he and his successors held Kal\u0101t for twelve generations till the rise of M\u012br Ahmad in 1666\u20137. It is from M\u012br Ahmad that the eponym Ahmadzai is derived.\nAuthentic history now begins, and the following is a list of the rulers, with approximate dates of their accession:\n\n1. M\u012br Ahmad I, 1666\u20137.\n2. M\u012br Mehr\u0101b, 1695\u20136.\n3. M\u012br Samandar, 1697\u20138.\n4. M\u012br Ahmad II, 1713\u20134.\n5. M\u012br Abdullah, 1715\u20136.\n6. M\u012br Mu\u1e25abbat, 1730\u20131.\n7. M\u012br Mu\u1e25ammad Nas\u012br Kh\u0101n I, 1750\u20131.\n8. M\u012br Mahm\u016bd Kh\u0101n I, 1793\u20134.\n9. M\u012br Mehr\u0101b Kh\u0101n, 1816\u20137.\n\n10. M\u012br Sh\u0101h Naw\u0101z Kh\u0101n, 1839.\n11. M\u012br Nas\u012br Kh\u0101n II, 1840.\n12. M\u012br Khud\u0101d\u0101d Kh\u0101n, 1857. From March, 1863, to May, 1864, the masnad was usurped by Khud\u0101d\u0101d Kh\u0101n\u2019s cousin, Sherdil Kh\u0101n.\n\n13. M\u012br Mahm\u016bd Kh\u0101n II, 1893. (The ruling Kh\u0101n.)\n\nThe rulers of Kal\u0101t were never fully independent. There was always, as there is still, a paramount power to whom they were subject. In the earliest times they were merely petty chiefs; later they bowed to the orders of the Mughal emperors of Delhi and to the rulers of Kandah\u0101r, and supplied men-at-arms on demand. Most peremptory orders from the Afgh\u0101n rulers to their vassals of Kal\u0101t are still extant, and the predominance of the Sadozais and B\u0101rakzais was acknowledged so late as 1838. It was not until the time of Nas\u012br Kh\u0101n I that the titles of Beglar Begi (Chief of Chiefs) and W\u0101li-i-Kal\u0101t (Governor of Kal\u0101t) were conferred on the Kal\u0101t ruler by the Afgh\u0101n kings.\n\nGibbon\u2019s description of the history of Oriental dynasties, as \u2018one unceasing round of valour, greatness, discord, degeneracy, and decay,\u2019 applies well to the Ahmadzais. For the first 150 years, up to the death of M\u012br Mahm\u016bd Kh\u0101n I, a gradual extension of power took place and the building up of a constitution which, looking at the condition of the country, is a marvel of political sagacity and practical statesmanship. A period of social ferment, anarchy, and rebellion succeeded, in which sanguinary revolts rapidly alternated with the restoration of a power ruthless in retaliation, until at length the British Government was forced to interfere.\n\nAs the Mughal power decayed, the Ahmadzai chiefs found themselves freed in some degree from external interference. The first problem that presented itself was to secure mutual cohesion and co-operation in the loose tribal organization of the state, and this was effected by adopting a policy of parcelling out a portion of all conquests among the poverty-stricken highlanders. Thus all gained a vested interest in the welfare of the community, while receiving provision for their maintenance. A period of expansion then commenced. M\u012br Ahmad made successive descents on the plains of Sibi. M\u012br Samandar extended his raids to Zhob, Bori, and Thal-Choti\u0101li, and levied an annual sum of Rs. 40,000 from the Kalhoras of Sind. M\u012br Abdullah, the greatest\nconqueror of the dynasty, turned his attention westward to Makr\u0101n, while in the north-east he captured Pish\u012bn and Shor\u0101wak from the Ghilzai rulers of Kandah\u0101r. He was eventually slain in a fight with the Kalhoras at J\u0101ndrihar near Sanni in Kachhi.\n\nDuring the reign of Mir Abdullah\u2019s successor, Mir Muhabbat, N\u0101dir Sh\u0101h rose to power; and the Ahmadzai ruler obtained through him in 1740 the cession of Kachhi, in compensation for the blood of Mir Abdullah and the men who had fallen with him. The Br\u0101huis had now gained what highlanders must always covet, good cultivable lands; and, by the wisdom of Muhabbat Kh\u0101n and of his brother Nasir Kh\u0101n, certain tracts were distributed among the tribesmen on the condition of finding so many men-at-arms for the Kh\u0101n\u2019s body of irregular troops. At the same time much of the revenue-paying land was retained by the Kh\u0101n for himself.\n\nThe forty-four years of the rule of Nasir Kh\u0101n I, known to the Br\u0101huis as \u2018The Great,\u2019 and the hero of their history, were years of strenuous administration and organization interspersed with military expeditions. He accompanied Ahmad Sh\u0101h in his expeditions to Persia and India, while at home he was continuously engaged in the reduction of Makr\u0101n, and, after nine expeditions to that country, he obtained from the Gichkis the right to the collection of half the revenues. A wise and able administrator, Nasir Kh\u0101n was distinguished for his prudence, activity, and enterprise. He was essentially a warrior and a conqueror, and his spare time was spent in hunting. At the same time he was most attentive to religion, and enjoined on his people strict attention to the precepts of the Muhammadan law. His reign was free from those internecine conflicts of which the subsequent story of Kal\u0101t offers so sad a record.\n\nThe reign of Nasir Kh\u0101n\u2019s successor, Mir Mahm\u016bd Kh\u0101n, was distinguished by little except revolts. In 1810 Pottinger visited his capital and has left a full record of his experiences.\n\nThe reign of Mir Mehr\u0101b Kh\u0101n was one long struggle with his chiefs, many of whom he murdered. He became dependent on men of the stamp of Mull\u0101 Muhammad Hasan and Saiyid Muhammad Shar\u012bf, by whose treachery, at the beginning of the first Afgh\u0101n War, Sir William Macnaghten and Sir Alexander Burnes were deceived into thinking that Mehr\u0101b Kh\u0101n was a traitor to the British; that he had induced the tribes to oppose the advance of the British army through the Bol\u0101n Pass; and that finally, when Sir Alexander Burnes was returning from a mission to Kal\u0101t, he had caused a robbery to be committed on the party, in the course of which an agreement, which had been executed between the envoy and the Kh\u0101n, was carried off. This view determined the diversion of Sir Thomas Willshire\u2019s brigade from Quetta to attack\n\n---\n\n1 Henry Pottinger, *Travels in Beloochistan and Sind* (1816).\nKal\u0101t in 1839, an act which has been described by Malleson as 'more than a grave error, a crime.' The place was taken by assault and Mehr\u0101b Kh\u0101n was slain. Sh\u0101h Naw\u0101z Kh\u0101n was now appointed to succeed, with Lieutenant Loveday as Political officer. He was not, however, destined to occupy the masnad for long. In the year 1840 a rebellion of the Saraw\u0101n tribesmen caused his abdication, and M\u012br Muhammad Hasan, afterwards known as M\u012br Nas\u012br Kh\u0101n II, was placed upon it.\n\nBy the efforts of Colonel Stacy, M\u012br Nas\u012br Kh\u0101n II was induced to submit to the British Government, and was installed by Major (afterwards Sir James) Outram at Kal\u0101t in 1840. Nas\u012br Kh\u0101n at first acknowledged Sh\u0101h Shuj\u0101 as the paramount power in Baluchist\u0101n; but subsequent events in K\u0101bul caused this undertaking to be annulled, and in 1854, as a consequence of the European imbroglio with Russia, a formal treaty, the first of those with Kal\u0101t, was concluded with the British Government. Quarrels, which had meanwhile broken out between the Kh\u0101n and the chiefs, led to Nas\u012br Kh\u0101n raising a small body of mercenary troops, a measure which the chiefs naturally regarded as a serious encroachment on their powers.\n\nNas\u012br Kh\u0101n II died, perhaps by poison, in 1857, and was succeeded by Khud\u0101d\u0101d Kh\u0101n, then a mere boy. One of the first acts of the new ruler was to open fire with his guns on the chiefs who lay encamped near the city of Kal\u0101t; and, from this time till 1876, the history of Kal\u0101t contains little but one long chronicle of anarchy, revolt, and outrage, in which there were seven important and many minor rebellions. In March, 1863, through the machinations of Mull\u0101 Muhammad Rais\u0101ni, Sherdil, the Kh\u0101n's cousin, attempted his assassination, but succeeded only in wounding him. A general insurrection ensued; Sherdil Kh\u0101n was declared ruler and Khud\u0101d\u0101d Kh\u0101n retired to the frontier. Mull\u0101 Muhammad now joined the other side, and the Kh\u0101n regained the masnad in 1864. Revolt after revolt followed, until an attempt was made by the Commissioner in Sind to arbitrate between the parties in 1873. It proved abortive, and Major Harrison, the British Agent, was thereupon withdrawn and the Kh\u0101n's subsidy was stopped.\n\nAt this juncture, Sir Robert (then Major) Sandeman appeared on the scene. His first mission to Kal\u0101t in 1875 was not entirely successful; and, immediately after its departure from the capital, N\u016br-ud-din, the Mengal chief, with many of his followers, was slain by the Khan owing, it was alleged, to a plot against the latter's life. But a few months later Major Sandeman was again on the spot, accompanied by a large escort. By his tact and firmness the Mastung agreement, the Magna Charta of the Br\u0101hui confederacy, was drawn up on July 13, 1875, and read out\n\n---\n\n1 Malleson, History of Afghanistan (1878).\nformally in Darb\u0101r. An account of its provisions is given below in the section on Native States (p. 319).\n\nTo make the influence which had been thus acquired effective for the future, the British Government now accepted the responsibility, as the paramount power, of preserving the peace of the country, and a fresh treaty was concluded with the Kh\u0101n in December, 1876. In the following year Sir Robert Sandeman was appointed Agent to the Governor-General, and Quetta was permanently occupied.\n\nThe rest of the story of Kal\u0101t is soon told. During Sir Robert Sandeman\u2019s lifetime, no serious revolts occurred; and, in spite of the waywardness of Khud\u0101d\u0101d Kh\u0101n, he was always treated by the Agent to the Governor-General with the greatest courtesy and consideration. In March, 1893, the musta\u016bfi or chief accountant, with his father, his son, and a follower, were murdered by the Kh\u0101n\u2019s orders. The Kh\u0101n appears to have suspected the musta\u016bfi of treachery, and alleged that the latter had made an attempt on his life. Khud\u0101d\u0101d Kh\u0101n\u2019s abdication was subsequently accepted by the Government of India in favour of his son, M\u012br Mahm\u016bd, the present Kh\u0101n. M\u012br Khud\u0101d\u0101d Kh\u0101n was shortly afterwards removed with his second and third sons to Loralai, and is now living in Pish\u012bn.\n\nThe reign of the present Kh\u0101n has been distinguished by few events of importance. In 1897 the wave of unrest, which passed down the frontier, made itself felt in Baluchist\u0101n, where a movement among the Saraw\u0101n chiefs, which might have had serious consequences, was averted by the arrest and imprisonment of two of the ringleaders. In the same year an outbreak occurred in Makr\u0101n, and British troops engaged the Makr\u0101n rebels at Gokprosh in January, 1898, the ringleader with many of his followers being slain. Another outbreak occurred in Makr\u0101n in 1901, which was also put down by British troops by the capture of Nodiz fort.\n\nLittle need be said here of the history of Las Bela. Although nominally subject to Kal\u0101t, whose ruler could call on it for an armed force when required, and claimed the right of control over the amount of the dues levied on goods in transit from Sonmi\u0101ni, its chiefs (J\u0101ms) have always asserted and maintained a greater or less degree of independence, their position being strengthened by matrimonial alliances with the Kh\u0101ns of Kal\u0101t. Since the advent of the British the bond of connexion between the two States has been almost entirely severed.\n\nThe political connexion of the British Government with Baluchist\u0101n commences from the outbreak of the first Afgh\u0101n War in 1839, when it was traversed by the Army of the Indus and was afterwards occupied until 1842 to protect the British lines of communication. The districts of Kachhi, Quetta, and Mastung were handed over to Sh\u0101h Shuj\u0101-ul-mulk, and Political officers were appointed to administer the country and\norganize a system of intelligence. Continual trouble occurred with the tribes in Kachhi; and in 1840 Kah\u0101n, in the Marri hills, was occupied by Captain Lewis Brown. Here he was besieged for five months by the Marris, who defeated a relieving force under Major Clibborn. In the meantime the garrison at Quetta was attacked by the neighbouring tribes, and was also invested by the insurgents, who had raised Nas\u012br Kh\u0101n II of Kal\u0101t to the masnad. On the retreat of this gathering to D\u0101dhar and its defeat by a British force, Lieutenant Loveday, the Assistant Political Agent at Kal\u0101t, was murdered. The year 1841 opened auspiciously, but closed with the disaster at K\u0101bul, an event which reacted on the Baluchist\u0101n tribesmen. Fortunately the country was in charge of a man of brilliant abilities, Sir James Outram; and all remained quiet while General England\u2019s column was pushed up the Bol\u0101n Pass to Quetta at the beginning of 1842, only to be defeated in the unfortunate affair of Haikalzai in Pish\u012bn. Then began the withdrawal from Afghanist\u0101n; the districts which had been assigned to Sh\u0101h Shuj\u0101 were handed over to the Kh\u0101n of Kal\u0101t, and Quetta was finally evacuated in October.\n\nIn 1845 General Sir Charles Napier led a force of 7,000 men against the Bugtis; but in spite of the assistance given by their enemies, the Marris, the operations were only a qualified success. The charge of the Upper Sind Frontier and of Baluchist\u0101n devolved on Captain (afterwards General) John Jacob from the beginning of 1847, and he held it till his death in 1858. Jacob\u2019s indefatigable energy and military frontier methods belong to the history of Sind rather than of Baluchist\u0101n; but his influence in Kal\u0101t was very great, and it was he who negotiated the first treaty with that State in 1854. From 1856 to 1873 Political Agents were deputed to Kal\u0101t, who were subordinate to the Political Superintendent in Upper Sind.\n\nThe founder of the Baluchist\u0101n Province as it now exists was Sir Robert Sandeman, who gave his name to a policy which has been aptly described as humane, sympathetic, and civilizing. Sandeman was the first to break down the close border system and to realize that the Baloch and Br\u0101hui chiefs, with their interests and influence, were a powerful factor for good. His policy, in short, was one of conciliatory intervention, tempered with lucrative employment and light taxation.\n\nCaptain Sandeman, as he then was, first came into contact with the Marris and Bugtis as Deputy-Commissioner of Dera Gh\u0101zi Kh\u0101n in 1867; and, in consequence of the relations he then established and of his successful dealings with these subjects of the Kh\u0101n of Kal\u0101t, he was invited to take part in the Mithankot conference, which was held in February, 1871, between the representatives of the Governments of the Punjab and Sind. The result of this conference was to place Sandeman, in his relations with the Marris and the Bugtis, under the Political\nSuperintendent of the Upper Sind Frontier, and to cause the extension of the system of employing tribal horsemen, with the object of maintaining friendly communications with the tribes. Shortly afterwards matters in Kal\u0101t went from bad to worse; the missions of 1875 and 1876 already referred to took place, and Baluchist\u0101n became a separate Agency directly under the Governor-General.\n\nThe importance of the position which had been acquired on the frontier was soon to be illustrated. At the end of 1878, the second Afghan War broke out, and troops were hurried forward to Kandah\u0101r along a line of communication which Sandeman's policy had rendered absolutely safe. At the close of the first phase of the war Sir Robert Sandeman accompanied General Biddulph's column, which had been deputed to open up the country between Pishin and Dera Gh\u0101zi Kh\u0101n. At Baghao an engagement took place with the Zhob and Bori K\u0101kars under Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n, Jogezai, in which they were defeated. By the Treaty of Gandamak (May, 1879), Pishin, Sibi, Harnai, and Thal-Choti\u0101li were handed over by Yak\u016bb Kh\u0101n to the British Government, on condition that the Am\u012br should receive the surplus revenues after payment of the expenses of administration. This treaty was afterwards abrogated by the massacre of the British Resident and his escort at K\u0101bul and the deposition of Yak\u016bb Kh\u0101n. Then followed the second phase of the war and the British defeat at Maiwand in July, 1880. As a result of the renewal of military operations, some of the Afghan tribes within the Agency became restive and had to be subdued. An outbreak, too, occurred among the Marris, which was put down by a small expedition. At the close of the war the retention of the areas ceded by the Treaty of Gandamak was decided on, at Sir Robert Sandeman's strenuous instance.\n\nThe ten years succeeding 1882 were years of administrative and organizing activity. Arrangements were commenced for the proper collection of the land revenue, irrigation schemes received attention, dispensaries were started, forests developed, and communications opened out in every direction. The strategical importance, too, of the western and north-eastern portions of the Province was fully realized. Two expeditions were made to Makr\u0101n: the first in 1883-4, during which the disputes between the Nausherw\u0101nis and the Kh\u0101n of Kal\u0101t were settled; and the second in 1890-1, when the question of the better administration of Makr\u0101n was taken up. On the north-east an expedition was made against the Zhob K\u0101kars in 1884, which resulted in their submission. In 1886 Bori was taken over and the cantonment of Loralai founded. In 1887 the status of the Agent to the Governor-General was raised from that of a Resident of the second class to that of a Resident of the first class; the assigned districts were declared to be British territory, and the Agent to the Governor-General was appointed Chief Commissioner.\nfor them. The year 1889 saw an expedition to the Gomal through Zhob, when the district was occupied and the station of Fort Sandeman selected. At the end of 1890 another expedition took place under the command of Sir George White, the object being the punishment of two of the Zhob chiefs who had been raiding the Zhob valley, and the chastisement of the Khidarzai section of the Largha Shir\u0101nis. The chiefs were not captured, but the Shir\u0101ni country was occupied without opposition. The position thus taken up enabled the Gomal to be effectively flanked, and the Shir\u0101nis and other tribes of the Takht-i-Sulaim\u0101n to be brought under control. Sir Robert Sandeman died at Bela in January, 1892, universally mourned.\n\nHe was succeeded by General Sir James Browne, who died in 1896. A period of consolidation and demarcation followed. Nushki was permanently leased in 1899; and in 1903 the lands irrigated by the Sind canals, now known as the Nasir\u0101b\u0101d tahsil, were acquired from Kal\u0101t on a perpetual lease. In the same year the Political Agent was withdrawn from Southern Baluchist\u0101n, and Las Bela was placed under the Political Agent of Kal\u0101t; the Loralai District was formed by taking parts of the Zhob and the Thal-Choti\u0101li Districts, and the name of the latter was changed to Sibi. Thus, in a little more than a quarter of a century, security has replaced anarchy, and peace and plenty prevail now in tracts formerly given over to bloodshed and perpetual poverty.\n\nBaluchist\u0101n offers a virgin field to the archaeologist, and one which is not altogether unpromising. Throughout the country curious mounds occur, now deserted, but generally covered with masses of broken pottery, which will probably some day afford good ground for excavation. When the site of the present arsenal at Quetta was being prepared, a statuette of Hercules was discovered. Mounds opened at N\u0101l and M\u0101mat\u0101wa in the Jhalaw\u0101n country have yielded interesting finds of pottery. That found at the former place possesses striking resemblances to pottery of the eighth century B.C. found in Cyprus and Phoenicia and of Mycenaean technique. At Hinid\u0101n in the valley of the Hab river, at S\u016br\u0101b in the Jhalaw\u0101n country, and in Las Bela highly ornamented tombs of unknown origin are to be seen, which afford evidence of a system of superterrene burial. The gabrbands, or embankments of the fire-worshippers, which are common throughout the Jhalaw\u0101n country, are also of considerable interest, while some of the underground water-channels, both round Quetta and near Turbat in Makr\u0101n, indicate the possession of scientific skill entirely unknown at the present day. North of Bela lies the curious cave-city of Gondr\u0101ni, the cave-dwellings being hewn out of the conglomerate rock. At Chhalgari in Kachhi are indications of interesting Buddhist remains. Such finds of coins as have been made from time to time render it clear that all sorts of traders, from ancient times to the present, have left traces of them-\nselves along the routes leading from Persia to India. Near Dabar Kot in the Loralai District coins of the time of the Caliph Marw\u0101n II, struck at Balkh in the year of the Hijra 128 (A.D. 745), have been unearthed; and at Khuzd\u0101r in the Jhalaw\u0101n country Ghaznivid coins of interest have been picked up, chiefly of Ibr\u0101h\u012bm (1059-99) and Bahr\u0101m Sh\u0101h (1118-52). The Koh-i-Taft\u0101n, which, though not actually in Baluchist\u0101n, is close to the western border, has yielded a find of considerable value in the shape of Indo-Scythian coins, some of which are now deposited in the British Museum. Punch-marked coins have been discovered in Zhob, and coins of the Sh\u0101his of K\u0101bul in Kh\u0101r\u0101n.\n\nAlthough an attempt was made to obtain a rough enumeration of the population of some parts of Administered areas in 1891, it was not until 1901 that any systematic census was carried out.\n\n**Population.** This Census extended over 81,632 square miles, but omitted Makr\u0101n, Kh\u0101r\u0101n, and Western Sinjr\u0101ni. In the towns and certain other selected places a synchronous enumeration took place, but elsewhere estimates only were made. The accuracy of the available figures is not therefore absolute. The total population amounted to 810,746 persons. According to a careful estimate made in 1903, the population of Makr\u0101n amounts to about 78,000, and a similar estimate puts the population of Kh\u0101r\u0101n at 19,600. That of Western Sinjr\u0101ni may be reckoned at about 6,000. The total population of the Province is, therefore, about 915,000 persons. Areas directly administered have an area of 46,692 square miles and an estimated population of 349,187, of whom 343,187 were actually enumerated. The population of the Native States and of the Marri and Bugti tribal areas (85,163 square miles) is estimated at 565,400, of whom 467,559 were counted at the Census. Detailed figures for the different localities will be found in Table I at the end of this article.\n\nThe density of population in the area covered by the Census amounts to less than ten persons per square mile. Including the areas for which estimates have now been obtained, the density falls to seven persons per square mile. The highest density is to be found in Quetta-Pish\u012bn, with its large urban population and well-irrigated tracts, which possesses twenty-two persons to the square mile. In Ch\u0101gai, on the other hand, only one person per square mile is to be found. The number of persons per house in 1901 was 4\u00b754.\n\nAbout 95 per cent. of the total population enumerated dwelt in rural areas. No inducement exists in Baluchist\u0101n for the indigenous inhabitants to collect into towns, and a tendency is apparent among the people to avoid living together in large communities. This accounts for the paucity of towns, of which there are only six. All of them had garrisons in 1903, with the exception of Sibi and Pish\u012bn, and they have\nsprung up since the British occupation. They contain a population almost entirely alien, which has accompanied the new rulers, either in service or for purposes of trade. Striking evidence of this is afforded by the fact that only 158 per 1,000 of the persons living in towns speak vernaculars of Baluchist\u0101n. Similarly, the villages are not only few in number (2,813, or one for every 47 square miles), but their size is small, and most of them contain less than 500 inhabitants. They are, as a rule, mere collections of mud huts, which are evacuated in summer when the cultivators encamp near their fields in blanket tents. The prevalence of the nomadic habit, to which reference will be made later, is one of the most remarkable features in the population. One of its results is that throughout the country small detachments, each of some half-dozen households, live together, owning cattle, sheep, and goats, and moving from place to place for pasturage.\n\nOwing to the doubtful accuracy of the figures obtained by the Census of 1891, no reliable comparative statistics exist by which the increase in the population can be gauged. The Census of 1901 showed an increase in some rural areas of 45 per cent., but part of this is probably due to better methods of enumeration. When we consider, however, that previous to 1876 the condition of affairs represented the 'ebb and flow of might, right, possession, and spoliation,' there can be little doubt that the increase of population since the British occupation has been considerable. In Quetta town, where the figures are reliable, an increase of 20 per cent. occurred in the decade.\n\nThe figures of migration in the Report on the Census of India, 1901, show a net loss to Baluchist\u0101n of 35,986 persons, the total of emigrants enumerated in India outside Baluchist\u0101n being 70,267 against 34,281 immigrants. Migration to and from Baluchist\u0101n is of two kinds: periodic and temporary. Nearly all the highland population of the country take part in the periodic migration\u2014towards the plains in the autumn and towards the highlands in the spring. A distinction is observable between the migrations of the Afgh\u0101ns and the Br\u0101huis. The Afgh\u0101ns move far afield, and their object is generally commerce, the transport trade, or search for work as labourers. The Br\u0101huis, on the other hand, move in a more limited circle; few of them care for commerce, while such transport as they do is confined to short distances. The work in which they particularly engage is harvesting and fuel-carrying. Many of them spend nearly the whole of the year in harvesting. In October and November they cut the rice in Sind; this is followed by the jow\u0101r, and later by the spring wheat and barley. Then the heat drives them upwards until the highlands are reached in June. July and August are the Br\u0101hui's months of rest, and in September he starts downwards again.\n\nTemporary emigration is confined chiefly to Afgh\u0101ns and Makr\u0101nis.\nThe former roam all over India, and even make their way so far afield as Chinese-Turkist\u0101n and Australia. Makr\u0101nis make good workmen, and leave their homes in search of labour. This temporary emigration is compensated by the large immigration. The immigrants constitute the security, the motive force, and the brains of the country. They are soldiers, clerks, merchants, and artisans; but few of them settle permanently in Baluchist\u0101n, a fact sufficiently indicated by the very small proportion of women (18 per cent.) who are found among them. The majority of them are drawn from the Punjab, the United Provinces, and Sind.\n\nNo detailed record of age was attempted in 1901, but adults were distinguished from minors during the enumeration. It was found that in 100,000 males there were 66,053 adults and 33,947 children, while in 100,000 females there were 64,352 adults and 35,648 children. Children are thus proportionately less in number, and adults more numerous, than in India. In the towns and other places where the regular schedule was used, a synchronous statement of the ages of the normal population divided into age-periods indicates that the alien population in Baluchist\u0101n varies largely from the normal. Normal figures must naturally show a decreasing series of numbers at each age; but in Baluchist\u0101n, owing to the large alien population, the figures gradually rise till the maximum is reached in the case of males between twenty-five and thirty, and in the case of females between twenty and twenty-five.\n\nLongevity among the indigenous tribesmen appears to be infrequent. Exposure, bad nutrition, hunger, and sickness affect the age of the population; and the principle of survival of the fittest must necessarily prevail among an uncivilized people such as is found in Baluchist\u0101n. A member of a tribe whose usefulness is affected by disease becomes a social outcast depending for his subsistence on charity; and when in hard times these sources are dried up, the impaired constitution quickly sinks. Of infirmities, blindness is common, probably owing to the dry and dusty climate, malnutrition, and excessive grain diet. Leprosy does not appear to be endemic, and insanity is rare. Infant mortality is undoubtedly high, owing to the unhealthy surroundings, want of proper nourishment, and exposure with which infant life has to contend.\n\nThe disproportion of the sexes in the towns in 1901 was very great, there being only 260 women to every 1,000 men. The excess is greater in winter than in summer, as many women leave for their homes in India to avoid the former season. Among the indigenous population, numbering 762,039, a total deficiency in females of 50,901 was indicated, and this deficiency was uniform in Districts, tribes, and groups of different religious denominations. In every 1,000 Afgh\u0101ns there\nwere found to be 540 males and 460 females; among the Baloch the figures were 552 males to 448 females, and among Br\u0101huis 523 males to 477 females. The highest proportion of females is thus to be found among the Br\u0101huis and the lowest among the Baloch. That these figures are not far from the truth is indicated by the comparatively high bride-price paid by Afgh\u0101ns, reaching Rs. 400 to Rs. 500, while among the Br\u0101huis it is much lower.\n\nEvery tribesman marries as soon as he possibly can, but the payment of bride-price frequently makes bachelorhood compulsory till middle age. Polygamy is desired by all, but attained by few. As a rule, marriage among the Muhammadan population does not take place till puberty. Some of the K\u0101kar Afgh\u0101ns have a curious custom permitting cohabitation after betrothal. A Br\u0101hui or Baloch will always endeavour to marry a first cousin. The Afgh\u0101ns, on the other hand, give their daughters to the highest bidder without regard to relationship. Among both Afgh\u0101ns and Br\u0101huis a widow passes to the deceased husband's brother. Divorce, though a simple process, is infrequent. Adultery is punished among Baloch and Br\u0101huis by the death of the parties, but Afgh\u0101ns will generally salve their honour for a consideration in money or kind. In the area under a regular census, where, however, conditions are wholly anomalous, there were in 1901, 4,632 unmarried, 4,839 married, and 529 widowers among 10,000 males; while among 10,000 females 3,539 were unmarried, 5,626 were married, and 835 were widowed. As might be expected in a population which is largely Musalm\u0101n, the proportion of widows is less than in India proper. The marriage of children at an early age is much less common, among both Hindus and Muhammadans, than in the neighbouring Province of the Punjab. Of Hindus more than twice as many are married under fifteen years than of Muhammadans.\n\nThe indigenous languages prevailing in Baluchist\u0101n are Pasht\u016b, Br\u0101hui, Eastern and Western Baluchi, Jatk\u012b or Siraik\u012b, Jadg\u0101l\u012b or Sindhi, Khetr\u0101n\u012b, and L\u0101s\u012b. The Dehw\u0101rs of Kal\u0101t and Mastung speak Dehw\u0101r\u012b, a kind of bastard Persian. The Loris or minstrels and blacksmiths have a curious jargon called Mokaki. The language of correspondence is Persian. Of Indian vernaculars spoken in 1901 in the areas where the standard schedule was used, Punj\u0101b\u012b was the most common with 20,263 speakers. Urd\u016b came next with 9,331, and then Sindi with 3,305. There were 3,584 English-speaking persons.\n\nGenerally speaking, Pasht\u016b is spoken throughout the country lying eastward of a line drawn from S\u0101ng\u0101n near Sibi to Chaman. In the south-eastern corner of Loralai, Khetr\u0101n\u012b, a dialect of Lahnda or Western Punj\u0101b\u012b, is prevalent. In the Marri-Bugti country and in parts of Kachhi, Eastern Baluch\u012b occurs. The cultivators of the last-named area speak both Jatk\u012b and Jadg\u0101l\u012b, the latter language being more\nwidely spoken and being also prevalent in Las Bela. Br\u0101hui is spoken throughout the Saraw\u0101n and Jhalaw\u0101n countries, but only extends up to about the 66th parallel of longitude, where it meets Western Baluchi. Affinity of race is no criterion of language. All Afgh\u0101ns do not speak Pasht\u016b, nor do all Br\u0101huis speak Br\u0101hui. Sometimes one section of a tribe talks Br\u0101hui and another Baluchi.\n\nOf the principal indigenous languages, Pasht\u016b and Baluchi belong to the Indo-Aryan family, while Br\u0101hui has been placed by the latest inquirer, Dr. Grierson, among the Dravidian languages. Baluchi has two main dialects, Eastern and Western. Western Baluchi, also called Makr\u0101ni, is more largely impregnated with Persian words and expressions than the Eastern dialect. A considerable body of literature has sprung up in this language. The soft southern dialect of Pasht\u016b, as distinguished from the Pakht\u016b or northern dialect, is alone spoken in Baluchist\u0101n. Popular literature is entirely oral, commemorating events of local importance and relating stories of love and war. An account of Br\u0101hui and its speakers will be found elsewhere (see Br\u0101huis).\n\nThe Meds, the Afgh\u0101ns, and the Jats appear to have been the inhabitants of Baluchist\u0101n at the time of the Arab invasions. The Meds now, as then, live on the coast. The Afgh\u0101ns still cluster round their homes at the back of the Tahkt-i-Sulaim\u0101n. The Jats, in spite of the influx of Br\u0101hui and Baloch, to this day compose the cultivating classes of Las Bela and Kachhi; and some of the K\u016brks, whose insolence led to the final subjugation of Sind by the Arabs, are still to be found in the Jau valley in the Jhalaw\u0101n country. The indigenous races of chief importance at the present day are the Afgh\u0101ns, Baloch, Br\u0101huis, and L\u0101sis. The Jat cultivators now form only a small minority; but many of them have undoubtedly been absorbed by the Baloch and Br\u0101huis. Among religious and occupational groups may be mentioned Saiyids, Dehw\u0101rs, and the indigenous Hindus who live under the protection of the tribesmen and carry on the trade of the country. The Afgh\u0101ns, Baloch, and Br\u0101huis have been determined by Mr. Risley to be Turko-Ir\u0101nians. Their stature is above the mean; complexion fair; eyes dark but occasionally grey; hair on face plentiful; their heads are broad and their noses of great length. The Baloch hold the Marri and Bugti hills, and parts of Kachhi, where they mingle with the Jats. The Br\u0101huis occupy the great mountain band between Quetta and Las Bela, and in Las Bela we again have Jats called L\u0101sis. In Makr\u0101n many mixed races occur, which may be divided into two principal groups: the dominant races forming a small minority, and the races of aboriginal type known as Baloch, Darz\u0101dahs, &c. In the north-west of the Province the Baloch occur again, while in Nushki and the north-east of Kh\u0101r\u0101n Br\u0101huis are numerous. In the area where a regular census was taken in 1901, Br\u0101huis were found to be the strongest race,\nnumbering 292,879. Afgh\u0101ns came next with 190,457, and, after a considerable drop, Baloch with 80,552. Jats numbered 66,746, and L\u0101sis 37,158. The numerical predominance of the Afgh\u0101ns and the insignificance of the Baloch are worthy of remark.\n\nThe Afgh\u0101ns, or Pasht\u016bns as they describe themselves, appear to have been living not far from their present abode in the time of Herodotus, if the identification of his Paktyake with Pakht\u016bns be accepted. Cunningham considers that they are also identifiable with the Opokien of Hiuen Tsiang in the seventh century. At the beginning of the eleventh century they had already spread southwards as far as Mult\u0101n, for Mahm\u016bd of Ghazni attacked them there. Subsequently two of their tribes, the Lodi and S\u016bri, gave rulers to the throne of Delhi. But while scattered groups pushed out east and west to seek power and even empire, the nucleus of the race still remained in its ancient haunts; and to this day we find its elder representatives clustering round the Takht-i-Sulaim\u0101n, while others have made their way south to Sibi and as far north as Dir, Sw\u0101t, and B\u0101jaur. According to the Afgh\u0101n genealogies, Kais Abdur Rash\u012bd, the thirty-seventh in descent from Malik T\u0101l\u016bt (King Saul), had three sons, Gurgusht, Saraban, and Baitan. Among the descendants of Gurgusht we have Mando Khels, B\u0101bis, K\u0101kars, and Panis; the Saraban division is represented by the Tar\u012bns, Shir\u0101nis, Mi\u0101nis, and Barech; the descendants of Baitan can be identified in the Baitanis living across the Gomal. The most numerous and important indigenous Afgh\u0101n tribes in Baluchist\u0101n are the K\u0101kar (105,444), Tar\u012bn (37,906), Pani (20,682), and Shir\u0101ni (7,309). The K\u0101kars are to be found in largest numbers in the Zhob, Quetta-Pish\u012bn, and Loralai Districts. The Tar\u012bns have two main branches, the Sp\u012bn Tar\u012bn and Tor Tar\u012bn, of whom the former live in the Loralai and Sibi Districts and the latter in the Sibi and Quetta-Pish\u012bn Districts. The Panis include both the M\u016bs\u0101 Khels of Zhob and the Panis of Sibi. The Shir\u0101nis live in close proximity to the Takht-i-Sulaim\u0101n. Of their two divisions, the Bargha, or upper Shir\u0101nis, alone occupy territory in Baluchist\u0101n. Numerous Ghilzais, nearly all of whom are nomads, occupy the country to the south of the Gomal river in winter. They are labourers, traders, and expert k\u0101rez diggers.\n\nBaloch tradition indicates Aleppo as their country of origin. The latest inquirer arrives at the conclusion that they are Ir\u0101nians\\(^1\\). The word Baloch means \u2018nomads\u2019 or \u2018wanderers,\u2019 and is coupled by Ibn Haukal and others with the word Koch. Whatever their original habitat, the Baloch had taken up a position in close proximity to Makr\u0101n early in the seventh century, and to this day many of their tribal names bear the impress of the localities which they occupied in\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) M. L. Dames, *The Baloch Race* (1904).\nPersian Baluchist\u0101n. Hence they made their way eastward until in the fifteenth century we find them settled in Kachhi. The tribes of importance are the Marris, the Bugtis, the Buledis, the Magassis, and the Rinds. Of these, the Rinds and Magassis have been enrolled in the ranks of the Br\u0101hui confederacy; but the Marris and Bugtis appear, even in the palmiest days of the Ahmadzai rulers, to have been more or less independent.\n\nExcept in South-Western Baluchist\u0101n, where no tribal system appears to exist, Afgh\u0101ns, Baloch, and Br\u0101huis are all organized into tribes, each having a multitude of subdivisions, clans, sections, and subsections. There is a distinction, however, between the constitution of an Afgh\u0101n tribe and that of a Br\u0101hui or Baloch tribe. Among the former the feeling of kinship is a bond of union far stronger than among the latter, with whom common blood-feud forms the connecting link. Theoretically, an Afgh\u0101n tribe is constituted from a number of kindred groups of agnates; in a few cases only are small attached groups to be found which are not descended from the common ancestor. On the other hand, the Br\u0101hui or Baloch tribe is a political entity, composed of units of separate origin, clustering round a head group known as the Sard\u0101r Khel. It is recruited on a definite system: a new-comer first shares in the good and ill of the tribe; later he obtains a vested interest in the tribal welfare by receiving a portion of the tribal lands; and his admission is sealed with blood by the gift of a woman in marriage. The tribe is organized and officered expressly for offence under an hereditary chief and headmen of groups. Among Afgh\u0101ns the leader does not necessarily hold by heredity, for the individual has great scope for asserting himself; once, however, he has gained a position, it is not difficult for him to maintain it, provided he receives external support, and this is largely the secret of the Sandeman policy.\n\nThe Afgh\u0101ns are tall, robust, active, and well formed. Their strongly marked features and heavy eyebrows give their faces a somewhat savage expression. The complexion is ruddy; the beard is usually worn short, as also is the hair. Their general bearing is resolute, almost proud. Courage is with them the first of virtues, but they are cruel, coarse, and pitiless. Vengeance is a passion. Their cupidity and avarice are extreme. The Baloch presents a strong contrast to his Afgh\u0101n neighbour. His build is shorter, and he is more spare and wiry. He has a bold bearing, frank manners, and is fairly truthful. He looks on courage as the highest virtue, and on hospitality as a sacred duty. He is an expert rider. His face is long and oval, and the nose aquiline. The hair is worn long, usually in oily curls, and cleanliness is considered a mark of effeminacy. A Baloch usually carries a sword, knife, and shield. He rides to the combat but fights on foot. Unlike the Afgh\u0101n, he is seldom a religious bigot.\nOut of 810,746 persons enumerated in 1901, 765,368 were Muhammadans, 38,158 Hindus, 4,026 Christians, 2,972 Sikhs, and 222 'others.' In 100,000 of the population there were thus 94,403 Muhammadans, 4,706 Hindus, 497 Christians, 367 Sikhs, and 27 persons of other denominations. Of the total Christian population, 3,477 were Europeans, 124 Eurasians, and 425 natives. Members of the Anglican communion were most numerous, numbering 2,857.\n\nIsl\u0101m and Hinduism are the only indigenous religions. The spread of Isl\u0101m in Baluchist\u0101n probably occurred very early in the Muhammadan era. In practice, animistic beliefs and superstition rather than orthodox Muhammadanism prevail, and there is general ignorance of the tenets of the faith. Although the Baloch and Br\u0101huis are now professed Sunnis, there are indications that they have been much influenced by Shiah doctrines. Of sects, the Zikris or Dais of Makr\u0101n are the most interesting. They are the followers of a Mahdi, who is stated to have come from Jaunpur in India, and they believe that the dispensation of the Prophet Muhammad is at an end. While denying many of the doctrines of Isl\u0101m, they have imitated others. They have constituted their Kaaba at Koh-i-Mur\u0101d near Turbat, and thither all good Zikris repair on pilgrimage in the month of Zil Hij. They are very priest-ridden, and believe their mull\u0101s to be endowed with miraculous powers. At the same time their alleged incestuous practices appear to have been much exaggerated by their critics. They include nearly half the population of Makr\u0101n. The Taibs ('penitents') of the Kachhi are another small but curious sect.\n\nHinduism has been modified by its Musalm\u0101n surroundings. Hindus have little or no compunction in drinking from Musalm\u0101n water-skins, and some of them keep Musalm\u0101n dependants for domestic service. The R\u0101mzais of the Loralai District afford a curious example of the assimilation by Hindus of Baloch dress and customs.\n\nChristian missions are endeavouring to gain a footing by giving medical aid and education. Branches of the Church Missionary Society and of the Church of England Zan\u0101na Mission have been opened at Quetta. The Province forms part of the Anglican diocese of Lahore and of the Roman Catholic arch-diocese of Bombay.\n\nThe majority of the indigenous population are dependent for their livelihood on agriculture, the provision and care of animals, and transport. An Afgh\u0101n and a Baloch, as a rule, cultivates his own land. The Br\u0101huis dislike agriculture, and prefer a pastoral life. Their lands are, therefore, cultivated through tenants who belong to professional agricultural groups. A reminiscence of the slavery which existed in the country before British occupation is to be found in a population of servile origin numbering 22,304 in 1901. These servile dependants are happy and contented, and cases of ill-treatment seldom occur. Women\ntake a large part in all occupations. Not only have they ordinary household duties to perform, but they take the flocks to graze, groom their husband's horse, and assist in cultivation. When a husband dies, his widow is looked on as a valuable asset in the division of his property, owing to the custom of demanding bride-price.\n\nMeals are generally taken twice, at midday and in the evening. Flesh, milk, which is highly prized, and cheese in various forms, with wheaten or jow\u0101r bread, are the chief constituents. In the highlands a kind of 'biltong' is prepared in the winter from well-fattened sheep, and is much relished. Onions, garlic, and fresh asafoetida stalks are most used as vegetables. On the coast rice and fish are eaten, while in Makr\u0101n dates and dried fish form the staple diet of the people. Br\u0101huis and Baloch never condescend to eat with their women folk.\n\nThe Afgh\u0101n wears a loose tunic, baggy drawers, a sheet or blanket, sandals, and a felt overcoat with the sleeves hanging loose. His women wear a loose scarlet or dark-blue shift, with or without wide drawers, and a wrapper over the head. The Baloch wears a smock reaching to his heels and pleated at the waist, loose drawers, and a long cotton scarf. His headdress is wound in rolls round his head, generally over a small skull-cap. The colour must be white, or as near it as dirt will allow. His wife's clothes resemble those of Afgh\u0101n women, but must be red or white.\n\nMat huts and black blanket tents stretched on poles are the characteristic dwellings of the country. They are of various dimensions, some being as much as 50 feet long by 10 feet broad. They are generally about 4 feet high. The walls are of matting, home-spun blankets, or stones laid in mud. The dwelling is partitioned in the centre by a hurdle, on one side of which live the family and on the other the flocks and herds. At the back of the human dwelling are piled the felts and quilts used for bedding. The remainder of the furniture consists of a wooden bowl or two, an earthen pot, a flat stone griddle for baking, and a few skins for water and grain. Permanent dwellings are numerous only in those parts where they are required for protection from the climate, or where there is much cultivation. The house of a well-to-do person generally consists of a courtyard with three rooms in a line. They always face east or south, and consist of a storehouse, a winter room, and a summer room. Outside, in the courtyard, are a kitchen and a stable for cattle. Sometimes the houses are double-storeyed, the lower part being used as a storeroom. Cultivators of the poorer class merely have two rooms without a courtyard. In the plains an open shelter, roofed with brushwood and supported on posts, is used in summer. In Las Bela a peculiarity of the houses is the wooden framework, generally of tamarisk; there are no windows, but light and air are admitted through a windsail in the roof.\nThe usual Muhammadan mode of burial is in vogue. The aperture of the grave is narrow at the top but broader near the bottom. In some parts a corpse is never taken out through the door of the house, but the mat wall is broken down for purposes of removal. If a person dies far from home, the body is sometimes temporarily interred pending removal to its native place.\n\nField sports are the usual amusements of the people. They indulge in racing, shooting, coursing, and tent-pegging. Indoor recreations among the Br\u0101huis and Baloch include singing, dancing, and a kind of draughts. The Afgh\u0101ns are fond of marbles, prisoner\u2019s base, quoits played with a circular stone, and a game like hunt-the-slipper. Ram-and cock-fighting are much admired, but their chief delight is in dancing. Some ten or twenty men or women stand in a circle, with a musician in the centre, and the dancers execute a number of figures, shouting, clapping their hands, and snapping their fingers. Wrestling after the European fashion is common among the Afgh\u0101ns and Jats. Br\u0101huis are fond of trying their strength by lifting weights. Egg-fighting is also of frequent occurrence.\n\nFairs are held throughout the country on the occasion of the Muhammadan festivals of Id-ul-Fitr and the Id-uz-Zuha, when general rejoicings take place. Shrines are common and are constantly visited. The best-known places of pilgrimage are Hingl\u0101j and Sh\u0101h Bil\u0101wal in Las Bela, and P\u012br L\u0101kha Lahr\u0101ni in Kachhi.\n\nAmong Br\u0101huis and Baloch, children are named on the sixth night after birth; among Afgh\u0101ns, on the third day. Boys are named after the Prophet, according to the Muhammadan custom. The Br\u0101huis borrow names from trees, plants, animals, &c. The word Kh\u0101n is frequently added, out of courtesy, to the names of men of good birth, and Bibi, N\u0101z, B\u0101no, Bakht, Gul; Kh\u0101t\u016bn to those of women; a native gentleman prefixes M\u012br, thus: M\u012br Y\u016bsuf Kh\u0101n. The first child usually receives the name of the grandmother or grandfather as the case may be, a practice which causes much confusion. In stating his name a man will generally add the name of his tribe (kaum), and if questioned farther, will always give his section and sub-section also. The sectional name is formed by adding the suffix khel or zai to an eponym for Afgh\u0101ns, zai and \u0101ni for Br\u0101huis, and \u0101ni for Baloch, thus: Sanzar Khel, Ahmadzai, Ali\u0101ni. Permanent villages are usually named after individuals, with the addition of kili, kot or got, kal\u0101t, or shahr. An encampment is called halk or khalk.\n\nAgriculture, camel-driving, and flock-owning constitute the occupations on which the majority of the population depend. The proportion of agriculturists to flock-owners is probably about three to one. In many cases both agriculture and pasture are combined. Previous to the advent of the British, life and\nproperty were so insecure that the cultivator deemed himself fortunate if he reaped his harvest; the fastnesses of the hills, on the other hand, afforded shelter and safety to the herdsman. The spread of peace and security has been accompanied by a marked extension of agriculture, which accounts for the increase in numbers of the purely cultivating classes, such as L\u0101ngav\u012bs, Dehw\u0101rs, and Dehk\u0101ns. Some tribes are still almost entirely pastoral, including the Marris and Bugtis: the Sulaim\u0101n Khel, N\u0101sir, and other Afgh\u0101ns; and many Br\u0101huis.\n\nThe cultivable area of the country in comparison with the total area is necessarily small; for, with the exception of the plains of Kachhi, Las Bela, and the Dasht in Makr\u0101n, cultivation is confined to the limited area lying in the centre of the valleys between the mountains. Here there is generally a fringe of permanently irrigated land cut up into small polygons, while towards the hills lie larger fields surrounded by embankments three or four feet high, by which the rainfall is caught as it descends from the gravel slopes bordering the valleys. In the centre are sometimes found bright red clays, many of them highly saliferous. Elsewhere, as in the great Thal plateau, the valleys consist of loess deposits, apparently formed by accumulations of wind-blown dust. In the plains the soil is generally loess mixed with alluvium. The admixture of moisture-bearing sand is the usual test applied by the cultivators to the quality of a soil.\n\nThe scanty rain and snowfall, averaging between 6 and 7 inches, is nowhere sufficient to ensure cultivation without artificial assistance. The husbandman's return, therefore, is assured only where his cultivation is dependent on the k\u0101rez or underground water-channel, on springs, or on streams. All other cultivation is carried on by the artificial dams mentioned above. The areas under cultivation are thus divided into \u0101b\u012b, i.e. lands that are permanently irrigated; and khushk\u0101ba, i.e. 'dry-crop' lands which include land subject to flood cultivation (sail\u0101ba).\n\nThe season for sowing the principal crops in the plains occurs in July and August, for at this time the rivers bring down the necessary moisture. In the upper highlands the dams are filled by the winter rainfall between December and March, when wheat and barley are sown. Here the system of cultivation in 'wet-crop' differs from that in 'dry-crop' areas. In the former the land is first watered and then ploughed, after which the seed is sown broadcast, and for further irrigation the fields are later on subdivided into small plots. In the latter, wheat, barley, and other spring crops are sown with the drill (n\u0101li), and the seed depends for further moisture on the subsequent rainfall. In the plains, where the only important crop is jow\u0101r, the seed is everywhere sown broadcast after the ground has absorbed the flood moisture. There are two harvests, gathered in the spring and the autumn. The spring harvest, known to the Afgh\u0101ns as sparlai or dobe\nand elsewhere as sarav or arh\u0101ri, is most important in the uplands, while the autumn harvest, known as mane in Pasht\u016b and s\u0101nwanri or \u0101men elsewhere, takes its place in the plains.\n\nOf spring crops, the most important is wheat. Jow\u0101r (Andropogon sorghum) is the chief autumn crop in the plains, and maize in the highlands. Dates constitute the sole crop of importance in Makr\u0101n. M\u016bng (Phaseolus mungo) and oilseeds in the plains and tobacco and melons in the hills also occupy considerable areas. Of minor products may be mentioned barley, gram, and beans among spring crops; and rice, several varieties of millet, gingelly, cotton, and a little indigo among autumn crops. Lucerne yields from May to October.\n\nWheat is of several varieties, both red and white. The red is preferred for home consumption, but the white fetches better prices in the market. In the highlands the seed can be sown from the middle of September to the end of January. In the plains wheat is not grown unless there are late floods towards the end of August, affording moisture which is carefully preserved for sowing as soon as the heat of summer subsides in October. Both autumn and winter wheat are cultivated, the former ripening in about nine months and the latter in about five or six. In the highlands the crop is often grazed down with sheep or goats up to February. The harvest commences about June. The straw is carefully preserved for fodder (bh\u016bsa). The local varieties are hardy, but are affected by sudden changes of climate and by much rain in early spring.\n\nJow\u0101r is sown broadcast as soon as the lands which have absorbed the summer floods have been ploughed. If spring floods occur, much jow\u0101r is cultivated for fodder, and the same plants, if they receive water from the summer floods, bear a good crop of grain. Many varieties occur, of which those known as thuri and thor are most extensively cultivated. Not only does jow\u0101r form the staple food-grain of the tracts where it is cultivated, but the fresh stalks contain saccharine matter which is much relished. When dry, they constitute excellent fodder (karb).\n\nA large increase in the cultivation of melons, known locally as p\u0101l\u0113z\u0101t, has taken place. Both water-melons and sweet melons are grown. Sweet melons are of two varieties: garma, or summer melons; and sarda, or autumn melons. Garma melons are of several kinds\u2014spotted, streaked, or white\u2014and are eaten fresh. It is a peculiarity of sarda melons that they can be kept for several months. Those grown from imported K\u0101bul seed are considered the best. The cultivation of melons has been much improved by the introduction of the joia system from Kandah\u0101r. After the land has been ploughed, long raised beds are formed, enclosed by an irrigation trench on either side about one foot deep. The seed is sown along the edges of the trench and, when\nsmall, the plant is carefully pruned. At a later stage poor flowers are picked off and the young melons are buried in the soil to avoid disease.\n\nThroughout Makr\u0101n the staple food is dates. Great attention is paid to the cultivation and care of the date-tree, and the dates of Panjg\u016br are declared by Arabs to excel those of Basra. Though all the trees belong to the species *Phoenix dactylifera*, they are distinguished locally into more than a hundred kinds, according to the weight, size, and quality of the fruit. All trees are known either as pedigree trees (*nasabi*) or non-pedigree trees (*kuroch*). Among the former, the best varieties are *mozati*, *\u0101p-e-dandan*, *haleni*, *begam jangi*, and *sabzo*. Fresh trees are raised from offsets; they produce fruit after three to eight years, and continue to do so for three generations. The young offsets must be carefully watered for the first year, and afterwards at intervals until their roots strike the moisture of the subsoil. The date season is divided into three principal periods: *machosp*, *rang* or *kulont*, and *\u0101men*. In *machosp* (March) the artificial impregnation of the female date-spathes by the insertion of pollen-bearing twigs from the spathe of the male tree is effected. In the season of *rang* or *kulont* (June) the colour first appears on the fruit, and there is general rejoicing. The harvest (*\u0101men*) lasts from July to September, when men and cattle live on little else but dates. The fruit is preserved in various ways, the most common being by pressing and packing in palm-leaf baskets (*laghati*). Better kinds are mixed with expressed date-juice and preserved in earthen jars known as *humb*. Owing to the excessive quantity of dates in the diet of the people of Makr\u0101n, night-blindness is common.\n\nThe use of manure is fully appreciated by the highland cultivators. Each one collects the sweepings from his cattle-yard and carries them to his field, and in the neighbourhood of the towns all the available manure is bought up. The following table gives the average out-turn per acre of wheat and *jow\u0101r* from experiments made in Administered areas:\n\n|                      | Wheat | Jow\u0101r |\n|----------------------|-------|-------|\n| Irrigated land, manured | 13\u00b73  | 13\u00b76  |\n| Irrigated land, not manured | 9\u00b70   | 8\u00b73   |\n| Land under flood-irrigation | 13\u00b76  | 12\u00b79  |\n| 'Dry-crop' land       | 6\u00b72   | 6\u00b74   |\n\nThe fertility of land dependent on flood-irrigation is well exemplified by these statistics. Manured and irrigated land has been known to produce as much as 18 cwt. of wheat per acre and 21 cwt. of *jow\u0101r*. No rotation is followed in unirrigated lands, the silt brought down by floods being sufficient to ensure an excellent crop whenever there is enough moisture for cultivation. Irrigated fields near homesteads, which can be manured and which therefore are generally cropped twice a year, are allowed to lie fallow in alternate years. In other irrigated lands three or four years of fallow are allowed after each crop.\nFruit is extensively grown in the highlands, and the export is increasing. The principal kinds are grapes, the best of which are known as l\u0101l, s\u0101hibi, haita, and kishmish; apricots, mulberries, almonds, apples, pomegranates, peaches, nectarines, quinces, plums, and cherries. Much improvement has been effected by the introduction of fresh varieties. All kinds of English vegetables are grown. Excellent potatoes are produced and the cultivation is extending. The appointment of a Superintendent of Arboriculture and Fruit-growing was sanctioned in 1902, and large numbers of good fruit-trees are raised and distributed. An impetus has recently been given to mulberry cultivation by the inception of sericultural operations.\n\nA test of the increase of cultivation which has taken place in recent years is afforded by the returns of the Government share of revenue in kind. In 1879-80 the revenue in Sibi amounted to 6,575 maunds of wheat, while in 1902-3 it was 11,978 maunds; and between 1882 and 1895 the revenue in wheat from the Quetta tahsil rose from a little more than 4,000 maunds to about 18,000 maunds. The cultivation of tobacco, potatoes, and oats has been recently introduced, and sugar-cane is making some way. Madder-growing, which was extensive at one time, has now ceased.\n\nThe implements of husbandry are primitive. The plough is similar to that used in India, but somewhat lighter owing to the softness of the soil. A heavy log is used as a clod-crusher. For making large embankments a plank about 6 feet long and 2 feet wide, called keur, is employed. Small embankments in irrigated lands are made with a large wooden spade (dal), which is worked by two men with a rope. Shovels of an improved pattern are now in use near Quetta. Mattocks have a flat blade. A four-pronged fork called ch\u0101r sh\u0101kha is used for winnowing and for cleaning straw. Efforts have been made, but without success, to introduce a plough worked by horses.\n\nThough the Land Improvement and Agriculturists' Loans Acts have not been formally applied, advances to cultivators are made under executive authority. A special feature is the permission given to District officers to carry out improvements themselves with such advances. Owing to the backwardness of the country, encouragement is given to applicants by the grant of loans on easy terms or without interest. An annual sum of Rs. 60,000 is allotted for the purpose, the advances being ordinarily used for the construction of underground water-channels, embankments, and wells. The people fully appreciate the advantage of the system, and the political effect has been excellent. The rate of interest usually charged is 6\u00bd per cent. per annum. No difficulty has been found in obtaining repayment. During the five years ending March, 1904, nearly 3 lakhs of rupees was advanced. About 2\u00bc lakhs was outstanding at the end of that time.\nExcept in the plains, the agriculturists largely finance one another. The usual method of obtaining a loan is to mortgage the land with possession until both principal and interest have been paid. Tenants-at-will are deeply involved in debt, and live a hand-to-mouth existence. In the plains the Hindu bani\u0101 plays an important part among the agricultural community. He keeps a running account with the cultivator on the security of the latter's crop, and at each harvest receives a part of the grain-heap as interest, with such amount as the cultivator can spare towards the reduction of the principal. The usual rate of interest is two annas in the rupee per annum, but this rate is only allowed by the bani\u0101 to those cultivators who give mahtai. This is a measure given by the cultivator from his grain-heap at each harvest to induce the bani\u0101 to advance sums at low interest. Cultivators who do not give mahtai have to pay four annas per rupee.\n\nA thickly built bullock, of small size and generally black or brown in colour, is found in the hills and is well suited to them. A pair fetch about Rs. 60 to Rs. 80. The bullocks bred at B\u0101l\u0101 N\u0101ri in Kachhi, being suitable for agricultural, siege-train, and army transport purposes, are much sought after by dealers from the Punjab. They are of two distinct types. The taller ones are 56 inches at the shoulder, white or fawn in colour, with horns growing upwards and inwards. The other type is smoky white, with black legs and neck, 42 to 48 inches high at the shoulder, and with horns growing slightly upwards and backwards. Both these kinds fetch good prices, a pair selling for Rs. 100 or more.\n\nBaluchist\u0101n has long been noted for its breed of horses. As early as the seventh century, Rai Chach of Sind took tribute in horses from Gand\u0101va. This reputation has ever since been maintained; and in pre-British days the Huramzai Saiyids of Pishin and many of the Br\u0101hui tribesmen were in the habit of taking horses for sale so far afield as Mysore. Pedigree Baloch mares are still much prized, especially those of the Hirzai breed of Shor\u0101n. The best animals in the country are those bred round Mastung and at Jhal in Kachhi. They are big powerful animals with plenty of bone. Another good breed is found in B\u0101rkh\u0101n, these horses being about 15 hands in height, with small well-bred heads and long slender arched necks. Their legs are small below the knee, but they are very hardy. The Government, therefore, found much excellent material for commencing horse-breeding operations, when it decided to introduce Government stallions in 1884 under the superintendence of the Civil Veterinary department. The stallions are all Arabs or English and Australian thoroughbreds, the services of which are allowed free of charge to owners for mares which have been branded after inspection. As indicating the results hitherto attained, it may be noted that the Horse-breeding Commission in 1901 pronounced one of the classes of brood mares at the Sibi fair as good as anything to be seen\nin England. In 1903 the Army Remount Department took over charge of the operations. The country contained 1,276 branded mares in 1904, and 379 foals from Government sires. In the same year 36 stallions were employed. Horses vary much in price. A tribesman can generally obtain a good mount for Rs. 100 to Rs. 150, but well-bred animals fetch Rs. 400 and more.\n\nThe heavy transport of the country is done entirely on camels. They are of the small hill-bred type, excellent over rocky ground but unable to stand the great heat of the plains of India. Their usual load is about 400 lb. They are bred chiefly in the Quetta-Pishin and Zhob Districts, the Marri-Bugti country, Kachhi, Kh\u0101r\u0101n, and Las Bela. As a rule transport animals are readily available, but the number varies in different parts of the country with the season of the year. The total number of camels in the country has been estimated at about 350,000, but this figure is probably above the mark. In some parts they are used for ploughing. Special arrangements have been made by Government to organize camels for transport purposes. The price of a transport camel varies from Rs. 60 to Rs. 80, and of a breeding camel from Rs. 50 to Rs. 60.\n\nDonkeys are used by every nomadic household and are most useful animals. They frequently carry over 300 lb., and require little or no fodder besides what they can pick up on the march. The Buzd\u0101r breed, obtainable in the Loralai District, is the best, and there are some good ones near Kal\u0101t. To enable donkeys to breathe freely when going uphill, it is usual for their nostrils to be slit soon after birth. An ordinary donkey fetches from Rs. 20 to Rs. 30; large donkeys from Rs. 60 to Rs. 80. Encouragement is now being given by Government to donkey-breeding on the same lines as to horse-breeding, and six donkey stallions were stationed in the country in 1904.\n\nThe sheep are of the fat-tailed variety, white, brown, and grey in colour. The white with black faces preponderate. A breed imported from Si\u0101hband, near Kandah\u0101r in Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n, is preferred for both meat and wool. Sheep are shorn twice, in spring and in autumn, producing 2 to 3 lb. of wool. The quality of the wool is coarse, and it comes to the market in very dirty condition. The goats are small and generally black. They are not very hardy. They yield about 1\u00bd lb. of hair, which is generally used at home for making blanketing, ropes, grain-bags, &c. Both sheep and goats are very numerous, and constitute much of the agricultural wealth of the country. The average price of a sheep is from Rs. 4 to Rs. 5. Goats fetch from Rs. 3 to Rs. 4.\n\nThe question of fodder is one of the most difficult in Baluchist\u0101n, since no large quantity of grass exists in the greater part of the country, and horses and bullocks subsist chiefly on the straw of cereals. The best fodder available for horses is straw mixed with lucerne, but it is expen-\nsive. In the plains the stalks (harb) of jow\u0101r constitute almost the only fodder. The large herds of sheep and goats, which rove over the hills for six or seven months of the year, keep in excellent condition owing to the numberless small cruciferous and leguminous plants, which afford good pasturage. The goats also obtain grazing from the bush growth. Camels find abundant fodder in the salsolaceous plants, *Alhagi c\u00e6morum*, tamarisk, &c., and are fond of browsing on most of the trees. The best grazing tracts are to be found in the Loralai District.\n\nHorse and cattle fairs are held at Sibi in February and at Quetta in September. The former is chiefly a breeder\u2019s and the latter a dealer\u2019s fair. About 1,800 horses are brought to these shows, and prizes to the value of Rs. 6,000 are given. At the Quetta fair many Persian horses are brought for sale.\n\nCattle suffer considerably from diseases of the pulmonary organs owing to the cold. Foot-and-mouth disease also occurs occasionally. Mange in goats and camels is common. Camels suffer also from colic, rheumatism, fever, and cough. A gadfly causes some mortality in summer, and the cold induces pneumonia in winter. The Superintendent, Civil Veterinary department, Sind, Baluchist\u0101n, and R\u0101jput\u0101na, controls the operations of the department in the Province.\n\nThe majority of the crops depend either on permanent or flood irrigation, and those raised from rain-water are insignificant. Except jow\u0101r, mung, and oilseeds, for which a single flooding of the land is sufficient, all other crops require further waterings to bring them to maturity. The sources of permanent irrigation are Government canals, underground water-channels (*k\u0101rez*), springs, and streams. Temporary irrigation is obtained by constructing embankments along the slopes of the hills, or by throwing large dams across the river-beds to raise the flood-water to the level of the surrounding country. In the highlands the two principal irrigation works are the Shebo and Khushdil Kh\u0101n schemes in Pish\u012bn. These \u2018minor\u2019 works have been constructed at a cost of nearly 17 lakhs, and irrigate annually about 6,000 acres. The return on the capital outlay is less than 1 per cent. in each case, but they have produced an excellent political effect in settling down the inhabitants. The revenue is levied in kind at one-third of the gross produce, which includes water rate. In the plains, the Beg\u0101ri and Desert Canals, which form part of the Upper Sind system, afford irrigation in the Nasir\u0101b\u0101d tahsil of Sibi District. The assessment on the former is Rs. 2 per acre, of which R. 1 is reckoned as water rate and R. 1 as revenue, and on the latter Rs. 2\u20138, of which the water rate amounts to Rs. 1\u20138. A small cess of 6 pies per acre is also levied. The total area irrigated in 1902\u20133 was 105,962 acres, and the water rate realized Rs. 1,27,404. Improvements are now under consideration for extending the area commanded by these canals, and a revision of assessment is contemplated.\nTwenty-four artesian wells of moderate depth have been bored near Quetta. The Irrigation Commission (1903) considered that experimental borings in Baluchist\u0101n appeared to hold out more hope of securing an artesian supply of water at moderate depth than in any other part of India, and steps are being taken to experiment farther on a larger scale.\n\nThe indigenous sources of irrigation in Administered areas include 1,803 springs, 496 k\u0101rez, 132 streams, and 76 wells. The k\u0101rez is an underground tunnel, driven into the great inosculating fans which spread with a slope of 300 to 600 feet per mile from the mouths of the hill ravines into the valleys. These tunnels have a slope less than that of the surface and, acting as a subsoil drain, carry the water out to the surface. The cost varies, according to their size and the soil in which they are excavated, from Rs. 2,000 to Rs. 8,000. Most of the wells are in the Nasir\u0101b\u0101d tahsil; they irrigate about five acres each, and their cost varies from Rs. 500 to Rs. 1,000. Perhaps the most interesting system of indigenous irrigation is that prevailing in Kachhi, where the cultivators, under an organized method of co-operation, construct annually immense earthen dams in the N\u0101ri river for raising the water to the surface. A specially expert cultivator, known as the r\u0101z\u0101, is selected to superintend the work, and the cultivators living for many miles along the banks of the river are called in with their bullocks to construct the dam. The implement used is the wooden plank-harrow (kenr). Some of these dams are as much as 750 feet long, 180 feet broad at the foot, and 50 or 60 feet in height. Every village has to supply its quota of men and bullocks, or, should it fail to do so, has to pay a proportionate amount in cash. There are many of these dams in the N\u0101ri; and in July and August, when the floods come, the upper dams are broken as soon as sufficient water for the area irrigable by each has been received. Still, much water runs to waste, and the scientific development of this indigenous system would probably result in a very large increase of cultivation.\n\nThe Makr\u0101n coast is famous for the quantity and quality of its fish, and the industry is constantly developing. It affords a considerable income to the States lying along the coast, as they generally take one-tenth of the fresh fish as duty. Fisheries.\n\nThe fishermen are principally Meds and Koras. The fish are caught both with nets and with the hook and line. Large shoals of cat-fish (gallo) and of kirr (Seiaena diacanthus) appear off the coast towards the end of the cold season, when they are surrounded and caught. After arrival on shore the air-bladders are extracted, and are eventually exported to England for the manufacture of isinglass. The fish are salted and used as food by the people of the country. They also form a large article of export to Bombay and Zanzibar. Sharks are prized\nespecially for their fins, which fetch as much as R. 1 per lb. Fresh sardines are so plentiful that they not infrequently sell at the rate of forty for a pice (one farthing).\n\nThe greater part of the land is held by a cultivating class of peasant proprietors. The few tenants are almost all tenants-at-will. In local parlance such a cultivator is 'the husband of a slave girl,' for he can be replaced at his master's will. He can acquire no permanent rights, and is liable to ejectment after the crop has been harvested. Sometimes, when much labour has to be expended on the construction of embankments, a tenant retains possession so long as the embankment remains unbreached or for a given term of years. In Makr\u0101n a curious custom prevails, giving to a tenant-at-will a permanent alienable right in all date-trees which he may plant. Occupancy rights are seldom, if ever, acquired in irrigated and only occasionally in unirrigated lands. Where they have been so acquired, they usually represent compensation for the labour expended by the tenant on raising embankments.\n\nAs might be expected in a backward country in which crops are liable to great variations, rent consists in a share of the grain-heap. Various systems are in vogue; but, as a general rule, the distribution in unirrigated lands is made on the principle of an assignment of a portion of the produce for each of the chief requisites of cultivation: the land, seed, bullocks, and labour. In irrigated lands a further, and proportionately large, share is assigned for the water. Certain services have also to be performed by the tenant, such as the supply of fuel and the transport of the proprietor's share of the produce. The position of the tenants on the whole is strong, since, owing to the inveterate laziness of the land-holding classes, there is a large demand for them and they can enforce their own terms.\n\nNo cooly class exists among the cultivating population; tenants-at-will perform the services mentioned above, while the household and agricultural work of men of means is done by their servile dependants. At harvest-time the workers, many of whom are women and children, receive a share of the grain-heap, generally one-twentieth. To shepherds are given their food, two changes of clothes, and a proportion of the lambs born during the year. The wages of village servants consist in a fixed measure from the grain-heap, or in a special share of water for irrigation. Cooly work proper is a peculiarity of the industrial centres which have grown up since the British occupation, and here a plentiful supply of labour from Makr\u0101n and Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n is always to be found. As a navvy the Haz\u0101ra or Ghilzai Afgh\u0101n is unrivalled. All domestic servants and skilled labourers come from India, chiefly from Sind and the Punjab.\n\nOwing to the severity of the climate and the comparatively large\namount of clothing and fuel required by the wage-earning classes, wages throughout the highlands are higher than those usually prevalent in India. An unskilled labourer receives Rs. 11 to Rs. 15 a month; a skilled labourer, Rs. 20 to Rs. 45; mechanics, Rs. 35 to Rs. 90. The wages of domestic servants vary from Rs. 10 to Rs. 25 in European households, and from Rs. 6 to Rs. 12 with food among natives. The clerical wage rises from Rs. 20 for vernacular clerks to about Rs. 200 for those who know English. In a few special cases it is higher. A levy footman is generally paid Rs. 10 and a horseman Rs. 20 a month, for which sum the latter must maintain a mount. The opening of communications has not materially affected the wages of unskilled labour, but there has been a decrease in the earnings of artisans and clerks.\n\nWheat is the staple food-grain in the highlands and jow\u0101r in the lower tracts. Firewood and chopped straw for fodder also form important items in domestic economy. Prices rule high when compared with those prevailing in India. The following table exhibits the average prices (retail) in seers per rupee of staples at principal centres for the two quinquennial periods ending 1895 and 1900:\n\n| Station     | Wheat | Jow\u0101r | Chopped straw fodder | Firewood | Punjab salt | Country salt |\n|-------------|-------|-------|----------------------|----------|-------------|--------------|\n|             | 1895  | 1900  | 1895  | 1900  | 1895  | 1900  | 1895  | 1900  | 1895  | 1900  | 1895  | 1900  |\n| Fort Sandeman | 14    | 10 1/2 | 15 1/2 | 11 1/2 | 5 1/2 | 5 1/2 | 11 1/2 | 9 3/4 | 6 1/2 | 6 1/2 | 14 3/4 | 11 1/2 |\n| Lorakai     | 17    | 11 1/2 | 18 3/4 | 13 3/4 | 5 7/8 | 5 7/8 | 7 5/8 | 7 9 | 6 1/2 | 6 1/2 | 9 1/2 | 9 |\n| Sibi        | 15 1/2 | 12 1/2 | 22 1/2 | 17 1/2 | 10 9/10 | 8 1/2 | 10 5/10 | 11 9/10 | 9 1/2 | 9 1/2 | 14 3/4 | 13 1/2 |\n| Quetta      | 13 1/2 | 11 | 20 3/4 | 14 1/2 | 4 8/4 | 4 8/4 | 6 6 | 7 3 | 8 3/4 | 9 1/2 | 9 1/2 | 12 | 11 |\n\nIn 1903 the price of wheat at Fort Sandeman and Quetta was 11 3/4 seers per rupee, equivalent to about 35 lb. for 2s., and at Lorakai 14 1/2 seers, equivalent to 44 lb. for 2s. The price of jow\u0101r in the plains at Sibi was 20 1/2 seers per rupee, equivalent to 62 lb. for 2s. The purchasing power of the rupee in the case of the more important staples shows a marked decrease during the decade ending 1900, but the period was one of abnormally bad agricultural conditions. Prices are affected largely by the seasons. They are always lower in the plains than in the hills.\n\nThere has been a steady improvement in the standard of comfort throughout Baluchist\u0101n since the British occupation. This is more marked in the tracts under British administration than in the Kal\u0101t State. Tea is now becoming a common luxury; sandals have given place to leathern boots and shoes; warmer clothing is worn in place of the light cotton garments formerly in vogue; and ornaments are\n\n*One seer is equivalent to about 2 lb.*\nmore largely used by women. Clerical establishments are all recruited from India. Their standard of living is somewhat high and leaves little opportunity for saving. A middle-class clerk generally has a house with two or three rooms, a kitchen and bath-room. His furniture consists of two or three chairs, a small table, lamps, carpets, rugs, and cooking utensils. He generally has one servant, who is his cook and does other household work. He has two meals a day, morning and evening.\n\nThere is a considerable difference between the mode of living of a headman owning land in a village and of an ordinary cultivator. The former generally wears clothes of a superior quality, and he adds to the number a thick coat and waistcoat. He has larger house accommodation and more furniture, and he possesses a sufficiently large number of cooking utensils, rugs, blankets, felts, quilts, and saddle-bags. Both utensils and bedding in an ordinary cultivator's house are scarce. One or two earthen or metal pots, two or three bowls, an iron tripod, and a few ragged quilts complete his equipment. His dress in summer costs about Rs. 6: a turban at Rs. 1\u20138\u20130, and a shirt, trousers, shoes, and sheet at about R. 1 each. In winter he adds a felt overcoat costing Rs. 3, and sometimes a waistcoat at Rs. 2. His wife's dress, which consists of a wrapper, a shift, wide drawers, and shoes, costs about Rs. 4.\n\nGenerally speaking, the country is scantily clothed with vegetation, trees are few in number, and most of the hills which are not protected by other and higher ranges are bare of forest growth.\n\nForests. In Administered territory steps were taken in 1880 to control certain forest areas in the Sibi District, and rules were issued for their management in 1881. Legal and systematic action commenced in 1890, when the Forest Law and Forest Regulation Acts were enacted. Since then twenty-seven tracts have been 'reserved,' comprising a total area of 203 square miles. Some tracts in Zhob, which have been hitherto protected by the Political Agent, are now being brought under the Forest department. Between 1891 and 1900 the forest revenue averaged Rs. 17,102 and the expenditure Rs. 37,531, leaving an annual deficit of Rs. 20,429. The revenue in 1900\u20131 was Rs. 16,927, and the expenditure Rs. 29,254. Owing to a change of system the deficit has now been reduced, and in 1902\u20133 the revenue was Rs. 19,336 and the expenditure Rs. 23,240. These figures exclude the revenue and expenditure of the Zhob forests, the income of which was Rs. 6,370 in 1901\u20132 and the expenditure Rs. 1,713. The greater part of the revenue is derived from the sale of timber and fuel, the annual income from this source averaging nearly Rs. 15,000. The Reserves are of three kinds: juniper forests, pistachio forests, and mixed forests. The first of these, bearing *Juniperus excelsa*, form the\nprincipal Government forests in Baluchistan. They are twelve in number, covering an area of 114 square miles. The two Reserves which contain *Pistacia khanjak* have an area of 13 square miles. Mixed forests number eleven, with an area of 78 square miles. The principal trees in these forests are *Prosopis spicigera*, *Capparis aphylla*, *Tamarix indica*, *Tamarix articulata*, *Dalbergia Sissoo*, *Olea cuspidata*, *Pistacia khanjak*, and *Acacia modesta*. In Zhob *Pinus Gerardiana*, *Pinus excelsa*, and *Olea cuspidata* are the commonest trees in protected areas. The regeneration of juniper and pistachio has not been very encouraging, except in areas closed to grazing. Here also the improvement in undergrowth indicates the benefits to be derived from the exclusion of browsing animals, especially goats and camels. Experiments in the introduction of exotic trees have not been successful, except in the case of fruit and one or two roadside trees.\n\nNo protected and legally recognized unclassed forests exist, but certain trees growing on land at the disposal of Government have been 'reserved' and their cutting is regulated. These include, besides those mentioned above, *Pistacia mutica*, *Fraxinus xanthoxyloides*, *Zizyphus nummularia*, *Zizyphus oxyphylla*, *Tecoma undulata*, *Populus euphratica*, and *Periploca aphylla*.\n\nPine timber is used for building purposes at Fort Sandeman, and juniper at Zi\u0101rat. In the rural villages, almond, apricot, mulberry, and *sinj\u012bd* wood (*Elaeagnus angustifolia*) are used for roofing. Minor forest produce includes the gum of the wild almond, cumin seed, hyssop, juniper berries (which are used for flavouring tobacco in Calcutta and Kanauj), the seeds of the edible pine, and the wild pistachio. The latter is much prized as an article of food by the natives. *Asafoetida (hing)*, the gum of *Ferula persica*, is found in parts. In the lower tracts of Kal\u0101t and Las Bela dwarf-palm, gum arabic, bdellium, honey, and shellac occur.\n\nThe Forest department is in charge of an Extra Assistant Conservator of Forests, borne on the Punjab Provincial list, who is styled the Chief Forest Officer, and who works under the general control of the Revenue Commissioner in forest matters. The Reserves are divided into three ranges, known respectively as the Quetta, Zi\u0101rat, and Sibi range. Each range is in charge of a Deputy-Ranger, who is assisted by forest guards. The extraction of timber and fuel is carried on by unregulated fellings. The sale of minor forest produce, such as grass, fruit, flowers, &c., is conducted by public auction or by permit. The relations of the Forest department with the people of the country have always been conciliatory. Minor forest offences average 208 per annum.\n\nTimber for building purposes and fuel is imported from Sind. The question of fuel supply was considered at a conference in 1891, and it was decided that the main object of Government should be to maintain\nexisting and future forest Reserves intact for use in times of emergency. Government departments within reach of the railway are, therefore, supplied from external sources and special railway rates are allowed. The average area of 'reserved' forest closed to grazing is 126 square miles. In the other parts of closed areas grazing by right-holders is permitted. All these areas are available for relief in times of scarcity. The question of the depletion of the undergrowth in the large grazing tracts near the towns is one of some difficulty.\n\nCoal is the only mineral produced in large quantities. Petroleum has also been worked, and a syndicate has recently been formed for extracting chromite in the Quetta-Pishin District.\n\nMines and minerals. The production of coal has been (1886) 122 tons, (1891) 10,368 tons, (1901) 24,656 tons, and (1903) 47,374 tons; and of petroleum (1886) 27,700 gallons, and (1891) 40,465 gallons. In 1903 the output of chromite amounted to 284 tons. Earth-salt is manufactured chiefly in Kachhi and along the coast. It is also obtained in Quetta-Pishin and part of Zhob, and from the Wad-i-Sult\u0101n in the H\u0101m\u016bn-i-M\u0101shkel. A salt-mine is worked in Las Bela. The average annual out-turn of earth-salt is estimated at about 1,000 tons. Lime is burnt at Quetta and also in Las Bela. Saltpetre is manufactured in small quantities in Kachhi.\n\nCoal is fairly widely distributed in the Central Br\u0101hui range, and is worked at Khost, in the Sor range near Quetta, and in the Bol\u0101n Pass. It generally possesses good steam-producing qualities, but is very friable. The seams vary from 6 inches to 4 feet in thickness, outcropping in hill-sides and dipping steeply, and are worked by excavating adits horizontally from the face of the hills. The principal colliery is at Khost, where the mines are worked by the North-Western Railway under European supervision. Capital to the total amount of about 3\u00bd lakhs has been invested in the undertaking. The number of men employed daily is about 700. A miner earns about 12 annas a day. The working cost has recently been reduced to about Rs. 8 per ton. The miners are chiefly Makr\u0101nis, but Haz\u0101ras and local Afgh\u0101ns are also employed. The output, which amounted to a total of 246,426 tons between 1887 and the end of 1903, is almost entirely consumed by the North-Western Railway. In the Sor range, in which coal is to be traced for some seventeen miles, and in the Bol\u0101n Pass leases have been granted of small stretches of coal to five lessees, Government finding the supervising staff necessary for periodical inspection and to ensure safe and scientific working. The coal has to be transported on camels, and is all consumed in Quetta. About 100 men are employed daily.\n\nThe presence of petroleum is indicated at Shor\u0101n in Kachhi, in the Bol\u0101n Pass, in the Harnai valley, and at Khattan in the Marri country. A boring was made at Kirta in 1889 and a show of oil was struck at\n360 feet, but it was afterwards abandoned, as also was one at Spintangi. The borings so far undertaken have been made in far less promising strata than the Siwaliks, which have not been tested; and there is no prima facie reason why mineral oil should not be discovered in the natural reservoirs of this geological group, which has produced it in Burma and Persia. Operations were carried on by Government at Khattan for seven years from 1884 to 1892, and by a private company in 1893-4, but both ventures were ultimately abandoned. Thirteen bore-holes were put down, the deepest being 736 feet, but oil was not obtained below 332 feet. It was pumped to the surface. On analysis the oil was described as containing 45 to 55 per cent. of pitch, with 45 to 35 per cent. of lubricating oil, but no light oils whatever. The total output between 1886 and 1892 was 777,225 gallons, the largest annual amount being 309,990 gallons in 1889. The private company afterwards extracted 60,000 gallons of oil. The expenditure incurred by Government amounted to about 6\u00bd lakhs of rupees, and there was a net loss of about 4 lakhs; but the oil may yet prove valuable for the manufacture of patent fuel. The area prospected lies in the territory of the Marri chief, who was paid Rs. 300 a month by Government during the operations, but he afterwards compounded with the private company for a lower sum.\n\nLittle is known of the unworked minerals of the country. Chrysotile, also known as fibrous serpentine or Canadian asbestos, occurs in some quantities in the Zhob valley and in the Quetta-Pishin District. Samples of the fibre have been found to be of some commercial value. Experts have pronounced clays obtained from the Bolan Pass as fit for the production of good paint and terra-cotta and of fair Portland cement at remunerative rates. Oriental alabaster is obtainable in Chagai, and copper, lead, iron ores, and alunogen or hair-salt have also been found there. Ferrous sulphate (melanterite), known locally as zaghi, is obtainable in the east of the Jhalawan country, and is used by the natives for dyeing purposes. Carbonate of lead (cerussite) is found at Sekran near Khuzdar. A sulphur-mine was worked by the Afghan rulers near Sanni in Kachhi, but it has been abandoned since the British occupation. Iron bisulphide (marcasite) is of frequent occurrence, but it has nowhere been found in sufficiently large quantities to render it commercially valuable.\n\nExisting conditions in Baluchistan are still too primitive to admit of the organization of industries on commercial lines. Such as there are consist of handicrafts worked at home, and in the majority of cases the work is done by the women in their spare time. In all instances the same worker completes the article in hand from the raw material down to the finish. All Baluchistan art-work displays specially Persian characteristics.\nCotton-weaving is a moribund industry still existing in a few parts. The cloth, known as kora in the east and bist dasti in the west, is woven in pieces about 30 feet long by 28 inches broad. Coloured double sheetings called khes, which are fashionable among the natives, are also manufactured. Silk-weaving is done in Makran alone. The best specimens are tartans, known as man-o-bas, and a dark-green crape with crimson border called gushan. They resemble fabrics made at Purnea and Chittagong.\n\nEmbroidery is very common, especially among the Brahuis. It is highly artistic and of many varieties, but unfortunately the products have been injuriously affected by the introduction of aniline-dyed silks. Of the Brahui embroideries, that called mosam is the best. It consists of very close work in a form of satin stitch, the design being primarily geometric. Other kinds, which are not quite so fine, are known as parawez and pariwar. These embroideries are generally made in four pieces: a pair of cuffs, a breast-piece resembling the linen front of a European shirt, and a long panel forming the pocket. Another fine kind is the Kandahar embroidery, which is generally worked with a double satin stitch in ivory white. Padded or quilted embroidery is also not uncommon. In the Marri and Bugti hills the prevailing designs consist of medallions, made up of zones of herring-bone stitch separated by rings of chain stitch. In Las Bela a fine embroidery is done on silk and cloth with the crochet needle. In Kachhi, Kalat, Las Bela, and Makran, shoes, sword-belts, and other leathern goods embroidered in silk are popular. The Kachhi embroidery is exceedingly elaborate.\n\nThe articles known as Baloch rugs are not an indigenous product of Baluchistan. They are chiefly made at Adraskan, a place south of Herat, and in Seistan. Large quantities are, however, imported through Quetta. Saddle-bags and nose-bags made in this style are popular among Europeans for cushion covers, chair backs, &c. A few pile carpets are made in the Jhalawan country, but entirely for home use. Rugs in the dari stitch are manufactured in almost every nomad household. They are made for sale in some quantities by the Angarias of Las Bela and in the Barkhan tahsil of Loralai District. Saddle-bags and nose-bags richly ornamented with shells are also made there. The shufti, or long rug usually stretched in front of the bedding in a nomad tent, is manufactured in Kharan and the Sarawan country. Felts of excellent quality and richly embroidered are also made, but chiefly for home use. Among minor woollen products, manufactured chiefly from camels' and goats' hair, are ropes and grain-bags, blanketing for tents, girths, and camel gear.\n\nSince the British occupation four steam flour-mills have been opened. There are also two ice factories and a steam press for chopped straw,\nwool, and oil. Patent fuel is manufactured from coal-dust at Khost. A brewery has been started near Quetta, the out-turn of which has risen in the eighteen years between 1886 and 1903 from 86,000 to 347,000 gallons. A plentiful supply of unskilled labour is available for these industries, chiefly recruited from trans-border Afgh\u0101ns and Makr\u0101nis.\n\nAmong minor industries may be mentioned tanning, the manufacture of carbonate of soda, mat- and basket-making, and indigenous methods of dyeing. Tanning is in vogue chiefly in Kachhi, Las Bela, and Makr\u0101n. A good soft leather is produced by immersing the hides in lime and carbonate of soda, and afterwards tanning them with a decoction of the exudation of the tamarisk. The manufacture of carbonate of soda, chiefly from the saltworts known as *Haloxylon Griffithii* and *Haloxylon salicornicum*, is increasing. The white variety is preferred to the black. The saltworts are cut and after being partially dried are set on fire. Much matting and raw material for mat-making is exported from Baluchist\u0101n, especially from the lower highlands and Makr\u0101n. For this purpose the dwarf-palm (*Nannorrhops Ritchieana*, called *pish* or *dhor\u0101* in the vernacular) is employed. In 1900\u20131 the exports of mats and raw material to Sind were valued at Rs. 44,800. The people are well versed in the manufacture of natural dyes from lac, decoctions of willow and olive leaves, madder, &c. Pomegranate husks, alunogen or hair-salt, and lime are used as mordants. In Quetta rose-water and *attar* of roses are manufactured by Punjab Khojas from the common Persian rose. Experiments recently made in sericulture have proved successful, and Quetta silk has been pronounced of the best quality. Measures are now being taken to develop the industry.\n\nThe indigenous trade of the Province was insignificant in former times. The country owed such commercial importance as it possessed to its geographical position athwart the main lines of communication between Persia, Central Asia, and India. The routes followed by caravans lay through the Gomal Pass to Mult\u0101n, through the Harnai, Bol\u0101n, and M\u016bl\u0101 Passes to Shik\u0101rpur, and via Kal\u0101t and Bela to Sonmi\u0101ni; but trade was greatly hampered by the raiding proclivities of the adjacent tribes and the system of levying transit-dues. In the earliest engagement between the British and Kal\u0101t an attempt was made to regulate the latter, but without much success. The levy of transit-dues still constitutes one of the greatest impediments to trade in the Kal\u0101t State. In Administered areas the system has been broken down, generally by the expropriation of right-holders. The general character of the trade between India and Baluchist\u0101n in pre-British days resembled the land trade now carried on with Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n, exports from Baluchist\u0101n consisting of wool, dried fruits, medicinal drugs, and horses, and imports\nof metals, piece-goods, sugar, and indigo. The traders were chiefly B\u0101bi Afgh\u0101ns, Hindus of Sind, whose transactions extended far into Central Asia, and Powinda Afgh\u0101ns.\n\nExcluding internal trade, the commerce of Baluchist\u0101n divides itself naturally into two classes: trade borne by sea, land, and rail to and from other Provinces in India; and foreign maritime and land trade. Omitting land-borne trade with Indian Provinces, the total trade was valued in 1902-3 at more than 2 crores of rupees, a striking evidence of the prosperity engendered by British rule. Exports consist chiefly of wool, dried and fresh fruits, medicinal drugs, fish and shark-fins, raw cotton, and mats; imports, of piece-goods, food and other grains, metals, and sugar. The chief maritime centres of trade are Gw\u0101dar and Parni; inland marts are Quetta, Sibi, Nushki, Kila Abdullah, Bh\u0101g, and Gand\u0101va. Much trade also finds its way direct to large markets in Sind, such as Jacob\u0101b\u0101d, Shik\u0101rpur, and Kar\u0101chi.\n\n| Imports | By Sea | By Rail |\n|---------|--------|--------|\n|         | Rs.    | Rs.    | Rs.    | Rs.    | Rs.    |\n| Cotton\u2014 |        |        |        |        |        |\n| (a) Piece-goods | 2,57,366 | 2,95,475 | 2,32,133 | 29,84,083 | 26,87,840 |\n| (b) Other articles | 5,979 | 7,222 | 1,667 | 28,564 | 1,01,454 |\n| Grain and pulse | 2,97,631 | 1,81,433 | 3,21,389 | 7,74,424 | 18,09,222 |\n| Provisions | 145 | 1,919 | 815 | 5,40,891 | 6,43,812 |\n| Metals and manufactures of metal | ... | ... | ... | 2,48,890 | 7,27,740 |\n| Sugar | ... | 8,099 | 15,669 | 8,12,034 | 8,31,087 |\n| Woollen piece-goods | ... | ... | ... | 81,536 | 1,43,248 |\n| All other articles | 1,35,763 | 96,141 | 95,190 | 44,43,352 | 57,88,519 |\n| Total | 6,96,884 | 5,90,289 | 6,66,863 | 99,13,776 | 1,27,32,922 |\n\n| Exports |        |        |        |        |        |\n|---------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Animals, living\u2014 |        |        |        |        |        |\n| (a) Horses, ponies, mules, &c. | ... | ... | ... | 1,09,710 | 1,90,950 |\n| (b) Others | ... | 31 | ... | ... | 81,484 |\n| Cotton, raw | 69,749 | 74,075 | 1,66,279 | ... | ... |\n| Drugs, medicinal | ... | ... | ... | 5,49,750 | 7,32,780 |\n| Fruits | 27,105 | 21,023 | 20,661 | 7,72,902 | 7,19,400 |\n| Grain and pulse | 3,702 | 45,665 | 40 | 1,05,568 | 2,49,021 |\n| Provisions\u2014 |        |        |        |        |        |\n| (a) Fish, including shark-fins | 2,13,072 | 2,46,336 | 2,06,142 | ... | ... |\n| (b) Gh\u012b | 54,205 | 1,37,911 | 584 | 3,61,120 | 10,974 |\n| (c) Other kinds | 216 | 1,556 | ... | ... | ... |\n| Wool, raw | 1,215,95 | 96,923 | 96,320 | 22,30,095 | 14,66,016 |\n| All other articles | 3,71,745 | 1,59,688 | 2,04,877 | 23,82,643 | 41,98,364 |\n| Total | 8,61,389 | 7,83,208 | 6,94,903 | 65,11,788 | 76,48,089 |\n\nThe first year for which figures are available.\nAll goods moving within the country, otherwise than by rail, are carried on camels. They consist chiefly of wool, agricultural produce, and fruit, including dates. Trade is almost entirely conducted by Hindus from India, but there are a few Muhammadan traders from Kandah\u0101r, and along the coast Khojas are fairly numerous. The Hindus move with the Br\u0101huis, up in summer and down in winter, collecting produce at convenient centres whence they send it direct to the larger markets. Barter is common, food-grains being exchanged for salt, fish for dates, and cloth for gh\u012b and wool.\n\nThe maritime trade is carried on from the coast of Makr\u0101n chiefly with Bombay and Kar\u0101chi, salted fish, shark-fins, mats, wool, and raw cotton being exchanged for cotton piece-goods, food-grains (chiefly rice), and also sugar. Trade by land passes across the frontier to the Frontier Province, the Punjab, and Sind, but it is not fully registered. Wool, gh\u012b, dwarf-palm for mat-making, and sheep and goats are the chief exports, and piece-goods and food-grains the imports. Of trade carried by rail, raw wool, fruits, medicinal drugs, and gh\u012b constitute the largest articles of export; piece-goods, grain, metals, and sugar are the largest imports. The table on the opposite page exhibits the value of the maritime and rail-borne trade with other parts of India.\n\nNo statistics of foreign trade by sea are available; but native craft carry dates and matting from Makr\u0101n to the Persian Gulf, Arabia, and the east coast of Africa. Trade by land is carried on with Persia and Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n, but is much hampered by the fiscal policy of those countries. The export of wheat, gh\u012b, and horses from Afgh\u0101n territory is entirely prohibited, though a good deal of smuggling takes place. The export of almonds is a State monopoly, while imports are liable to heavy duties. Transport too is entirely on camels and donkeys. The trade is registered at Chaman and Nushki; but, as goods cross the frontier at many other points on both the north and the west, the statistics are far from complete. Trade along the newly opened route from Nushki to Persia has to face keen competition from Russian goods brought from the Trans-Caspian Railway through Meshed; but, in spite of these drawbacks, it exhibits a considerable expansion. The table on the next page shows the value of the chief imports and exports of foreign land trade. The decrease in 1902\u20133 was due to a long period of drought which culminated in 1900\u20131.\n\nThe impression created on the wild tribes of the frontier by the construction of railways and roads has been immense; and their civilizing influence has been felt far beyond the political frontier, Communications, for every year many thousands of trans-border Afgh\u0101ns travel to India by their means to find remunerative employment. All the railways and the best of the roads have had their origin in strategical needs. The necessity of a railway was forcibly demonstrated by the\nwaste of treasure and life which occurred during the second Afgh\u0101n War in the weary marches between Sind and Quetta, and the Sind-Pish\u012bn Railway owed its inception to this period. The critical year of 1885 caused the extension of the railway up the Bol\u0101n Pass, and shortly afterwards the Bol\u0101n road was bridged and metalled. The Pish\u012bn-Dera Gh\u0101zi Kh\u0101n road was constructed to control the country between Pish\u012bn and the Punjab, and to form an alternative line of communication with the Indus valley.\n\n| Imports | 1897-8 | 1900-1 | 1902-3 |\n|---------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Rs.     | Rs.    | Rs.    |        |\n| Animals, living | 1,37,214 | 3,00,107 | 2,02,670 |\n| Drugs and medicines | 75,853 | 85,522 | 1,64,011 |\n| Fruits | 4,59,995 | 3,89,256 | 2,40,038 |\n| Grain and pulse | 2,18,312 | 91,548 | 17,484 |\n| Provisions\u2014 |        |        |        |\n| (a) Gh\u012b | 1,15,897 | 4,75,412 | 90,778 |\n| (b) Other kinds | 24,014 | 7,262 | 640 |\n| Wool, raw | 2,08,536 | 2,62,125 | 1,71,588 |\n| All other articles | 39,084 | 2,23,299 | 2,23,646 |\n| Total | 12,69,005 | 18,34,534 | 11,10,855 |\n\n| Exports | 1897-8 | 1900-1 | 1902-3 |\n|---------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Rs.     | Rs.    | Rs.    |        |\n| Cotton piece-goods, &c. | 3,11,742 | 8,06,997 | 5,07,200 |\n| Dyeing materials | 55,943 | 2,62,026 | 52,527 |\n| Sugar | 6,217 | 42,575 | 47,878 |\n| Tea | 25 | 51,585 | 24,716 |\n| All other articles | 69,536 | 2,17,657 | 2,24,016 |\n| Total | 4,42,563 | 13,80,840 | 8,56,337 |\n\n* The first year for which figures are available.\n\nThe total length of railways open for traffic in 1891 was 277 miles, which had increased to 399 miles in 1901. The opening of the Nushki Railway, which was completed in 1905, has brought the total up to 481 miles. The railways, which are on the standard gauge, have been built at immense cost. The total capital outlay, excluding the Nushki Railway, has been 11 crores, equivalent to 7\u00b73 millions sterling, or an average cost of nearly 3 lakhs per mile. The Sind-Pish\u012bn line enters the Province near Jhatpat, traverses the Harnai valley, and has its terminus at Chaman. Its total length, including the branch line from Bost\u0101n to Quetta, is 312 miles. It was begun in 1879, but not completed to Chaman till 1892. The chief difficulties in construction were met with in the Chappar Rift, at Mud Gorge, and in excavating the Khojak tunnel. The Chappar Rift is a huge gorge traversing the Chappar mountain at right angles to its general strike. It is crossed by a single span bridge, 150 feet long and 234 feet high, which is reached by tunnels excavated in the solid rock with the aid of adits.\nhorizontal to the face of the cliffs. At Mud Gorge slips used to obliterate the line entirely at times, but, since 1894, the construction of a system of dams has prevented further subsidence. The surface line originally constructed from Rindli through the Bol\u0101n Pass was realigned in consequence of serious damage done by heavy floods in 1889 and 1890, and was taken from the N\u0101ri river to Mushk\u0101f and thence along the east of the valley. The tunnelling on this line, especially between Mushk\u0101f and Pishi, was extremely heavy. The gradients also are steeper than those on the Sind-Pishin line, and are as much as one in twenty-five between Mach and Kolepur. The length of the Quetta-Nushki Railway is 82 miles. The principal works are the Nishpa tunnel, half a mile long, and the excavation of the alignment through the Shaikh W\u0101sil gorge. The cost will probably be less than 1 lakh per mile.\n\nThere has been a continual increase of roads since the British occupation, connecting remote parts with the railways and the Punjab. The principal extension has taken place in the north-east corner of the Province. In the south and the west no cart-roads exist, and many of the routes are barely practicable even for camels. The following table gives statistics of the mileage and character of the roads maintained under the supervision of officers of the Military Works service, who are in charge of civil works in the Province:\n\n| Cart-roads bridged and metalled | 1901 Mileage | 1903 Mileage |\n|---------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Cart-roads partially bridged and metalled | 667 | 668 |\n| (a) Maintained from military funds | 420 | 421 |\n| (b) Maintained from civil funds | 247 | 247 |\n| Tracks and paths | 1,052 | 1,628 |\n| (a) Maintained from military funds | 128 | 134 |\n| (b) Maintained from civil funds | 1,474 | 1,494 |\n\nTotal roads and paths | 2,384 | 2,416 |\n\n*In 1891 the total mileage of roads and paths was 1,520. Details are not available.\n\n\u2020 These roads are maintained from military funds.\n\nThe total cost of maintenance of these roads in 1902\u20133 was Rs. 74,919. In addition, 1,128 miles of roads and paths are supervised by civil officers, of which 1,101 miles are maintained from Provincial revenues and 27 from Local funds. In directly Administered areas the more important roads are the Bol\u0101n-Quetta-Chaman road, the Pish\u012bn-Dera Gh\u0101zi Kh\u0101n road, and the Harnai-Fort Sandeman road. A road partially bridged and metalled runs from Quetta through Kach and Zi\u0101rat to Sm\u0101llan on the Harnai-Fort Sandeman road. All these roads are provided with resthouses or d\u0101k-bungalows at convenient stages. The roads from Sibi to Quetta, from Dera Gh\u0101zi Kh\u0101n to Pish\u012bn, and from Harnai to Loralai are maintained from military\nfunds. The maintenance of the remainder, with some minor exceptions, falls on Provincial revenues, Local funds being applied only to the maintenance of roads in the Quetta municipality and a few other headquarters stations.\n\nOf the more important roads, that in the Bol\u0101n Pass was commenced in 1886\u20138, and completed to Quetta in 1888, at a total cost of about 19 lakhs. The section between Quetta and Chaman (distance 78 miles) was improved and completed between 1887 and 1893. The Pishin-Dera Gh\u0101zi Kh\u0101n road was commenced in 1886 and completed in 1888, at a total cost of 7 lakhs. The length in Baluchist\u0101n is $224\\frac{1}{2}$ miles. The section of the Harnai-Fort Sandeman road between the former place and Loralai was constructed as a military road after the occupation of the Bori valley in 1886, and it cost Rs. 10,600 per mile. It traverses the fine Dilk\u016bna gorge, which has been negotiated by carrying the road along the cliffs above flood-level. The road has been extended by civil agency from Loralai to Fort Sandeman. An important link of communication between Zhob and the Punjab will shortly be secured by the road through the Dh\u0101na Sar in the Sulaim\u0101n range to Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n, which is now being realigned and reconstructed at great cost. It is 115 miles long, of which about $47\\frac{1}{2}$ miles lie within Baluchist\u0101n. The remaining fair-weather paths and tracks form a network connecting all the principal places in Administered areas, but they are, as a rule, fit only for camel carriage. On the west the Nushki-Seist\u0101n trade-route, 378 miles to Rob\u0101t Kila, has been aligned at a cost of Rs. 29,864. Camel carriage is everywhere the ordinary means of transport, but donkeys are largely employed for light loads. In Kachhi use is made of bullock-carts of the type in vogue in Sind.\n\nThe steamers of the British India Steam Navigation Company carry passengers, mails, and cargo between India and Pasni and Gw\u0101dar on the coast. These ports are visited on alternate weeks. Owing to shoal-water, a landing can be effected only in country boats.\n\nThe postal service is under the Deputy-Postmaster-General of the Sind and Baluchist\u0101n Circle. In 1881 there were 19 post offices and 453 miles of postal line, in addition to the railway. In 1902\u20133, 54 post offices and 27 letter-boxes were open, and the miles of communication numbered 2,281; the letters dealt with numbered 1,201,580; postcards, 811,030; packets, 150,745; newspapers, 208,050; and parcels, 27,740. The total amount of savings bank deposits was 7\u00b78 lakhs. The money-order system is generally utilized by the Indian population temporarily resident in the country, and also by Afgh\u0101n merchants trading with India. Beyond the railway, mails are carried by horsemen, who are appointed by the District officers, and whose\n\n---\n\n1 The figures for post offices and miles of communication do not include 372 miles of d\u0101k line from Nushki to Rob\u0101t Kila and the four post offices located thereon.\npay forms a Provincial charge. The levies so employed numbered 214 in 1903-4. A postal service in Las Bela has been organized by that State between Kar\u0101chi and Bela.\n\nThe first telegraph line constructed in Baluchist\u0101n was the Indo-European system, which reached Gw\u0101dar in 1863. Treaties and arrangements are in force with Las Bela and Kal\u0101t for the protection of the line. It skirts the coast for 399 miles. The rest of the country, especially the north-east, is well provided with telegraphs; and a line runs to Rob\u0101t Kila on the Persian frontier, which also connects with the Indo-European system. The tribesmen through whose country the lines pass are responsible for their protection, with the exception of the line to Kal\u0101t, for which a small establishment is maintained.\n\nActual famine is unknown, but scarcity is frequent. Cultivation depends either on permanent or on flood irrigation; and as k\u016br\u0113z are most numerous in the upper highlands, these areas are better protected than the lower parts. Everywhere, except in the plains, the principal harvest is reaped in the spring, the chief crop being wheat. In the plains, jow\u0101r is the staple food-grain. Trade returns show that the average aggregate imports of food-grains by rail exceed the exports by about one-third; but much of the imported grain must be consumed by the foreign residents, and a fair wheat harvest is probably sufficient to carry the native-born population through the year. Again, the majority of the people are both graziers and agriculturists, and though the season may be unfavourable to agriculture, it may still be one of fairly good pasturage. Only a combined failure of both crops and grazing for consecutive seasons causes a crisis. Recent experience indicates that, while the people can tide over two years of bad rainfall or snowfall, a third reduces them to straits. Prices rise and a large emigration takes place to more favoured tracts.\n\nLocal tradition speaks of constant scarcity, and Masson records a ten years' drought from 1830 to 1840. Between 1897 and 1901 a succession of bad years resulted in a deficit of land revenue of about 1\u00bd lakhs of rupees, an expenditure of Rs. 1,87,443 from special Imperial grants on works and relief, and of Rs. 30,000 from the Indian Famine Relief Fund. Large advances were also made for agricultural purposes. Produce revenue adjusts itself automatically; and during the first two years some remissions and suspensions in assessed areas, combined with assistance for the purchase of seed and stock, were found to be all that was required. But, on the culmination of the drought in 1900-1, relief works had to be opened, chiefly roads, and doles of grain were distributed to the Marri and Bugti tribes. Advances and doles to the amount of about Rs. 34,000 were also made by Native States. No mortality was recorded.\nThe greatest safeguard against famine consists in the migratory habits of the people, and the proximity of fully protected areas in Sind, where ample means of subsistence exist for all who are willing to work. The two state irrigation schemes in the upper highlands are dependent on rainfall, and cannot, therefore, be regarded as entirely protective. Except in Kachhi it is doubtful if there is much scope for other large schemes. The widest source of protection probably lies in the extension of embankments for catching the rain-water as it runs off the stony sides of the hills. There are indications that large resort was had to this method of retaining the moisture in prehistoric times, the gabrbands of the Jhalawan country having been undoubtedly intended for this purpose.\n\nThe head of the local administration is the officer styled Agent to the Governor-General and Chief Commissioner. The following is a list of those who have held the substantive appointment:\n\n**Administration.**\n\nColonel Sir Robert Sandeman (1877), Major-General Sir James Browne (1892), Mr. (now Sir Hugh) Barnes (1896), Colonel C. E. Yate (1900), Sir A. H. McMahon (1907). The Agent to the Governor-General exercises judicial powers under the Frontier Crimes Regulation, and conducts the political administration of Baluchistan. He is also Inspector-General of Police and Levies. He has two Assistants, who are officers of the Political Department, and a personal Native Assistant of the rank of an Extra Assistant Commissioner. Other members of his staff are the Agency Surgeon and the Officer Commanding the Royal Engineers at Quetta, who is the Civil Secretary in the Public Works department.\n\nNext in rank comes the Revenue Commissioner, who advises the Agent to the Governor-General in financial matters and generally controls the revenue administration. He combines the functions of Settlement Commissioner, Superintendent of Stamps, Commissioner of Excise, Inspector-General of Registration and Jails, Registrar-General, and Judicial Commissioner; and he has the powers of a Local Government in the disposition of Local funds. Forest administration is also in his hands. For local and rural administration the Political Agency or District is the unit. Each District is divided into tahsils, of which one or more constitute a subdivision. The village, which is often nothing more than the area occupied by a tribal subdivision, is the unit of management within the tahsil. The Political Agent, who is also Deputy-Commissioner for such portions of his District as form part of British India, is the Collector, District and Sessions Judge, and the administrative head of his charge. He has frequently to deal with important trans-border affairs of a political character. Assistant Political Agents and Extra Assistant Commissioners or Native Assistants are in charge of subdivisions, supervise the collection of\nrevenue, exercise civil and criminal powers, and have the subordinate political control of the tribes in their respective areas. Each tahsil is in charge of a tahsildar, with an assistant styled naib-tahsildar. A naib-tahsildar holds charge of each sub-tahsil. These officials are primarily responsible for the collection of the revenue, but they also exercise judicial powers. A tahsil is distributed into circles, in which the patwari represents the authority of Government. He is charged with the maintenance of settlement, crop and other records, supervises the maintenance of sources of irrigation, and assists in maintaining order. It is his duty to see that the headmen collect and pay the revenue demand punctually. The village headmen collect the revenue, assist in the appraisement of crops, and maintain order. They are generally remunerated by an allowance of 5 per cent. on the gross collections. The Sandeman system of offering allowances to headmen to maintain followers, by whose means they are expected to control their tribes, is freely employed. It is closely connected with the system of levy services referred to below. In 1904 five Political Agents, seven Assistant Political Agents, eight Extra Assistant Commissioners, and five Native Assistants were employed in District administration in the Province. There were also fourteen tahsildars and eighteen naib-tahsildars. A Cantonment Magistrate and an Assistant Cantonment Magistrate are posted to Quetta, and a Staff Officer performs the same duties in Loralai. A Munsif is stationed at Quetta and another at Sibi. The Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs, is a Justice of the Peace for places along the coast, and also exercises certain political powers as an Assistant to the Political Agent in Kalat.\n\nExcluding Native States, the Province is divided into two main portions: British Baluchistan, and the territories administered by the Agent to the Governor-General, the latter being generally known as the Agency Territories. British Baluchistan includes the tahsils of Sh\u0101hrig, Sibi, Duki, Pishin with Shorar\u016bd, and the Chaman subdivision, with a total area of 9,476 square miles. Agency Territories is an elastic term, including areas which are directly administered and also other tracts which are merely politically controlled. Of these, the directly administered areas cover 37,216 square miles, comprising the Quetta tahsil, the Bolan Pass District, and the Nushki and Nasirabad tahsils, all of which have been leased from the Kh\u0101n of Kalat; the lands occupied by the railway from Jhatpat to Mithri, N\u0101ri to Spintangi, and Spezand to Sorosham; the Ch\u0101gai and Western Sinjr\u0101ni country; and the whole of the Zhob and Loralai Agencies, except the Duki tahsil in the latter. The inhabitants of the last two tracts have placed themselves under British protection from time to time. Throughout these areas revenue is collected. The part of Baluchistan, therefore, including British Baluchistan, which is under direct administration,\ncovers 46,692 square miles, an area about the same size as Sind. It comprises six Districts\u2014Quetta-Pishin, Sibi, Loralai, Zhob, Chagai, and the Bolan Pass. Each of the first four is in charge of a Political Agent and the fifth of a Political Assistant, while the Bolan Pass is administered by the Political Agent in Kalat. The latter, with two Political Assistants, one of whom is ex-officio Commandant of the Makran Levy Corps, controls the affairs of the Kalat and Las Bela States. The Political Agent in Sibi exercises political control over the Marri and Bugti tribes and in the Lahri w\u0101bat of the Kalat State, which is inhabited by the Dombki, Umrani, and Kaheri tribes.\n\nThe Native States are two in number, Kalat and Las Bela, the latter being nominally a feudatory of the former. The Kalat State consists of a confederacy of tribal groups headed by the Khan of Kalat. These groups were originally organized into three great divisions: (1) the Khan's ulus, or following, which was scattered throughout the country; (2) the Saraw\u0101n tribesmen living to the north of Kalat under their hereditary chief, the Rais\u0101ni Sard\u0101r; and (3) the Jhalaw\u0101n tribesmen living to the south of Kalat under the Zahri Sard\u0101r. All were liable to the Khan for military service. Succession to the masnad of Kalat appears to have been by inheritance, subject to the approval of the chiefs and of the paramount power. Gross incompetence might exclude. In external affairs the Khan was supreme and absolute. Internally each of the Saraw\u0101n and Jhalaw\u0101n tribes retained the fullest rights of self-government, but by the unwritten rule of the constitution there was a general right of interference by the Khan. The Khan, through his naibs or deputy-governors, managed the affairs of those people from whom he collected revenue. Kh\u0101ran was, and still is, quasi-independent. These arrangements have, however, been modified by lapse of time.\n\nThe relations of Kalat with the British Government are governed by two treaties, those of 1854 and 1876. The treaty of 1876 reaffirmed the treaty of 1854. Under the terms of the earlier treaty a subsidy of Rs. 50,000 was payable to the Khan, which was raised to 1 lakh in 1876. At the same time the Khan agreed to act in subordinate co-operation with the British Government; a British Agency was re-established at the Khan's court with certain powers of arbitration; and the presence of British troops in Kalat was permitted. The construction of railways and telegraphs and freedom of trade were also provided for. There are further agreements with Kalat in connexion with the construction of the Indo-European Telegraph, the cession of jurisdiction on the railways and in the Bolan Pass, and the permanent lease of Quetta, Nushki, and Nasirabad. A Political Agent was permanently reappointed to Kalat in 1884, to keep touch with\nthe Kh\u0101n and to exercise the right of arbitration already referred to. The Kh\u0101n is entitled to a salute of nineteen guns.\n\nThe relations of the Br\u0101hui tribesmen with the Kh\u0101n are now regulated by the Mastung agreement, the treaty of 1876, and the custom which has arisen therefrom. In the Mastung agreement the Saraw\u0101n and Jhalaw\u0101n Sard\u0101rs declared their submission and allegiance to the Kh\u0101n, the Kh\u0101n on his part restoring to them their ancient rights and privileges and promising good treatment so long as they proved loyal and faithful. Difficulties having arisen in cases where disputes had occurred between the Kh\u0101n's deputies, as representing his subjects, and the Br\u0101hui tribesmen, such disputes were to be referred to the Kh\u0101n for inquiry and decision, and, in case of disagreement, the disputed point was to be left to the arbitration of the British Government. The rights of internal self-government previously possessed by the tribesmen remained intact. In 1879 service and allowances were granted by the British Government to the Saraw\u0101n chiefs, in personal recognition of their loyal behaviour during the second Afghan War. To assist in the administrative control of the tribes, a Native Assistant for Saraw\u0101n was appointed in 1902.\n\nThe Kh\u0101n is assisted in the general administration of his State by a Political Adviser, whose services are lent by the British Government. The affairs of the Jhalaw\u0101n country, in which certain tribal subsidies are paid by the Kh\u0101n, are supervised by a Native Assistant also lent by the British Government, who is stationed at Khuzd\u0101r. The country, other than tribal, in which the Kh\u0101n exercises control and collects revenue is divided into ni\u0101bats. Makr\u0101n is under the control of an officer known as the n\u0101zim. Each of the ni\u0101bats, of which there are nine, was formerly in charge of a naib or deputy-governor. The Mastung ni\u0101bat and the five ni\u0101bats of Kachhi are supervised by four tahsild\u0101rs or mustaufis, who are represented locally by deputies, called j\u0101-nashin. This system was introduced in 1902, but in some cases the naib has been retained and exercises jurisdiction concurrently with the j\u0101-nashin. Important civil cases are heard by the Political Adviser. The mustaufis hear civil suits up to Rs. 10,000 in value, and naibs and j\u0101-nashins suits of lower value on a graded scale. Court-fees are levied at 10 per cent. ad valorem. Criminal cases are dealt with by the Political Adviser on the basis of tribal custom.\n\nThe chief of Las Bela, known as the J\u0101m, is bound by agreement with the British Government to conduct the administration of his State in accordance with the advice of the Governor-General's Agent. This control is exercised through the Political Agent in Kal\u0101t. Sentences of death must be referred for confirmation. The J\u0101m also employs an approved Waz\u012br, to whose advice he is subject, and who generally assists him in the transaction of state business. For purposes of\nadministration the State is divided into seven niabats. The naib, or officer in charge, inquires into petty judicial cases, and collects transit-dues and the land revenue after it has been appraised by the revenue establishment. He submits all cases for the orders of the J\u0101m. The revenue arrangements are in the hands of a tahsild\u0101r, assisted by a head revenue naib and other naibs.\n\nActs and Regulations are extended to British Baluchist\u0101n either under the Scheduled Districts Act (XIV of 1874) or by special mention in the Act itself, and are applied to the Agency Territories by the Governor-General-in-Council under the Indian (Foreign Jurisdiction) Order in Council, 1902. Enactments peculiar to Baluchist\u0101n are the Laws Law, the Civil Justice Law and Regulation, the Criminal Justice Law and Regulation, and the Forest Law and Regulation, all passed in 1890. The Civil and Criminal Justice Laws and Regulations were modified in 1893, and re-enacted in 1896, when the post of Judicial Commissioner was created. He is the High Court for Baluchist\u0101n, but sentences of death passed or confirmed by him require the sanction of the Local Government. In proceedings against European British subjects the Punjab Chief Court is the High Court. Each District is a Sessions division, the District Magistrate being the Sessions Judge, who may take cognizance of any offence as a court of original jurisdiction without previous commitment by a magistrate. The trial may take place without jury or assessors. Assistant Political Agents, Extra Assistant Commissioners, and Native Assistants ordinarily have the powers of a magistrate of the first class; tahsild\u0101rs those of the second class, and naib-tahsild\u0101rs those of the third class. The Cantonment Magistrate, Quetta, exercises first-class powers; and the Cantonment Magistrate, Loralai, and the Assistant Cantonment Magistrate, Quetta, possess second-class powers. The limit within which sentences are not appealable has been raised in cases tried by Courts of Sessions and certain magistrates.\n\nThe civil courts are of five grades: courts of naib-tahsild\u0101rs, with jurisdiction up to Rs. 50; of tahsild\u0101rs and Munsifs, with jurisdiction up to Rs. 300; of Assistant Political Agents, Extra Assistant Commissioners, and Native Assistants, with jurisdiction which may extend up to Rs. 10,000; and of Political Agents, without limit of pecuniary jurisdiction. The Judicial Commissioner constitutes the highest appellate authority. Appeals from the orders of a naib-tahsild\u0101r, tahsild\u0101r, or Munsif ordinarily lie to the subdivisional officers concerned. The Cantonment Magistrate and Assistant Cantonment Magistrate at Quetta and certain other officers preside over Courts of Small Causes. In questions relating to certain specified subjects, the civil courts are bound to have regard to tribal custom, where such custom is inconsistent with ordinary Hindu or Muhammadan law. No legal practitioner can appear\nin any court without the sanction of the Local Government. The number of cases disposed of is shown in the following table. Nearly half the number of criminal cases are of a petty nature. The decline in the number of civil cases is due to the completion of the large railway and other works.\n\n|                | Criminal |          |          |          |          |          |          |\n|----------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|\n|                | Total    | Appellate.| Original.|          | Total    | Appellate.| Original.| Execution of decree. | Revenue and Miscellaneous. |\n| Annual average for five years ending 1897-8 | 3,700 | 119 | 3,581 | 10,848 | 258 | 6,767 | 3,823 | 2,397 |\n| Annual average for three years ending 1900-1 | 3,917 | 171 | 3,746 | 8,010 | 199 | 4,741 | 3,070 | 2,555 |\n| 1902-3         | 4,161 | 106 | 4,055 | 7,340 | 174 | 4,385 | 2,781 | 4,064 |\n\nThe indigenous system of referring disputes to a council of tribal elders or *jirga* has been developed under British administration, the Punjab Frontier Crimes Regulation\\(^1\\) having been applied for this purpose in 1890. Local cases are referred to local *jirgas*, while intertribal and other important cases are decided by *Sh\u0101hi jirgas* which meet twice a year at Sibi and Quetta. A *Sh\u0101hi jirga* is also held once a year at Fort Munro, for the disposal of inter-Provincial cases between the Punjab and Baluchist\u0101n. These periodical assemblies have to decide cases of blood-feud, murder, important land disputes, &c., which, if unadjusted, would probably lead to bloodshed, loss of life, and political complications. During the five years ending March, 1898, the average annual number of cases thus disposed of was 2,871; in the succeeding three years the average number was 3,049. The actual number of cases in 1902-3 was 4,230. The Murderous Outrages Regulation was extended to Baluchist\u0101n in 1902. Under its provisions a fanatic guilty of murder may be sentenced to death or transportation or imprisonment for life in India; to forfeiture of property; and to whipping, in addition to transportation or imprisonment. It also authorizes the enforcement of tribal and village responsibility. During the ten years ending 1902 the number of murderous outrages on Europeans was nine and on natives of India sixteen.\n\nThe registrars under the Indian Registration Act are District officers, and the sub-registrars are generally *tahsild\u0101rs*. In 1893-4 the number of registrars was 3 and of sub-registrars 12; 632 documents were registered, registration being compulsory in the case of 425. In 1902-3 the number of offices was 19 and the number of documents registered 868.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The Frontier Crimes Regulation III of 1901 has since been applied to Baluchist\u0101n, with certain modifications.\nThe Provincial finances are managed in accordance with a quasi-Provincial settlement framed by the Government of India. The first settlement was made for a period of five years commencing in 1897; the terms were slightly modified and renewed for a similar period in April, 1902.\n\nFinance.\n\nUnder native rule the only items of revenue, other than that derived from land, consisted of transit-dues (sung), fines, and, in some places, grazing tax. The amount realized cannot be ascertained. The transit-dues were either taken by the State, or shared between the State and the tribal chiefs, or pocketed by the chiefs themselves. They have now been abolished in all Administered areas. On the first arrival of the British, the ni\u0101bat of Quetta was managed by British officers on behalf of the Kh\u0101n of Khal\u0101t from 1877 to 1883. During this period the annual revenue averaged Rs. 47,674. From April 1, 1883, the revenues of Quetta were treated as an Excluded Local Fund for one year; but afterwards, up to 1891, they were brought into the regular accounts of the Government. During these years the revenue averaged Rs. 1,46,000 per annum. In April, 1891, the Agent to the Governor-General was permitted to exercise the powers of a Local Government for two years in respect of the revenues of Quetta District, which were entirely made over to him. Meanwhile the provincialization of the Police and Levies, except those in the Zhob valley, had been authorized; the Bori, B\u0101rkh\u0101n, and Zhob valleys had come under control and the Zhob Levy Corps had been constituted, and the general control of the revenue and expenditure in each case had also been made over to the Local Government. In 1893, therefore, a consolidated contract was sanctioned which included the four existing contracts, and an assignment of Rs. 8,65,000 per annum for a period of four years was granted. This was raised later on by Rs. 600 per annum. During the four years 1893-7 the receipts, excluding the Imperial assignment, averaged Rs. 5,70,550, and the expenditure Rs. 14,20,000 annually. The revenue and expenditure of Thal-Choti\u0101li\u2014i.e. Duki, Sibi, and Sh\u0101hr\u012bg\u2014and of Pishin, which areas had been declared to be British Baluchist\u0101n, had throughout this period been treated as Imperial. Their revenue from 1883 to 1890 averaged Rs. 3,40,000, and from 1890 to 1897 Rs. 3,67,000 per annum.\n\nFrom April 1, 1897, the whole revenue and expenditure of the Province, classified under certain specified heads, was provincialized, the settlement being sanctioned for a period of five years. The standard figure of revenue was fixed at Rs. 9,89,000, and that of expenditure at Rs. 22,34,000. The latter was afterwards increased to Rs. 22,74,000, owing to the arrangements made in connexion with Ch\u0101gai District. Under this settlement the Agent to the Governor-General exercises the powers usually given to Local Governments under the scheme of Pro-\nvincial finance, and is subject to the rules of financial procedure which have been applied to Local Governments. The balance at the close of each year is carried on to the next. The expenditure on levies may not be materially reduced below Rs. 8,27,000 per annum without special sanction. The revenue includes that from salt made locally, usually an Imperial item; the only head of revenue classed as Imperial is interest. Under expenditure, the items (a) Ecclesiastical, (b) Territorial and Political Pensions, and (c) Political Salaries, are treated as Imperial. Territorial and political pensions include sums payable to persons of political importance. The salaries of Political officers borne on the Foreign Department list, of the Agency Surgeon and Assistant Surgeon at Kal\u0101t, and of all Extra Assistant Commissioners and Native Assistants, except the Extra Assistant Commissioner, Quetta, and the Native Assistant, Saraw\u0101n, are debitable against the head Political Salaries.\n\nThe ultimate result of the first provincialized settlement was a debit balance of Rs. 43,312. The average revenue amounted to only Rs. 9,36,000, about half a lakh less than the standard figure; on the other hand the expenditure was reduced to an average of Rs. 22,39,000 per annum, against the estimated standard figure of Rs. 22,74,000. A decrease occurred under almost all heads of revenue, especially from land revenue and stamps. It was only from irrigation that an increase occurred, amounting to about Rs. 6,000. The standard figure of land revenue was Rs. 6,19,000; but, owing to a series of dry years, culminating in actual drought in 1900\u20131, the realizations averaged Rs. 5,85,000, or about Rs. 33,000 less than the estimate. Stamp revenue also fell below the estimate by about Rs. 31,000. Owing to the expansion of the Province, there have been increases in the establishments for the collection of land revenue and for general administration, and in the expenditure on levies. By the reorganization of the Forest department a saving of about Rs. 14,000 has been effected. Owing to the peculiar circumstances of the Province, the allotment for public works constitutes the only reserve from which expenditure in times of scarcity can be met. All other charges are practically fixed. During the quinquennial period the amount spent on public works was less than the standard by about Rs. 50,000. Of the average sum of Rs. 3,75,000 expended on public works, about one-third was devoted to repairs and the remainder to original works. The greater part of the assigned revenues was thus shown to be stationary, while the expenditure on public works, and especially on roads, was unduly curtailed. In the renewed settlement of 1902 an increase in the Provincial assignment was sanctioned, to enable the provincialized services to be maintained in a state of efficiency and internal communications to be developed. The annual assignment now amounts to a total of 15 lakhs per annum.\n\nThe following tables give the average revenue and expenditure\nunder main heads for the quinquennial period ending March, 1902, and the actuals for the two years 1900\u20131 and 1902\u20133:\n\n| Heads of revenue | Average for the quinquennial period ending 1902 | Actuals for 1900\u20131 | Actuals for 1902\u20133 |\n|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|                  | Total amount raised in Province. | Total amount credited to Provincial revenues. | Total amount raised in Province. | Total amount credited to Provincial revenues. |\n| Land revenue     | Rs. 5,85,000 | Rs. 5,85,000 | Rs. 6,05,000 | Rs. 6,25,000 | Rs. 5,40,000 | Rs. 5,40,000 |\n| Stamps           | Rs. 63,000   | Rs. 63,000   | Rs. 61,000   | Rs. 61,000   | Rs. 65,000   | Rs. 65,000   |\n| Excise           | Rs. 1,37,000 | Rs. 1,37,000 | Rs. 1,51,000 | Rs. 1,51,000 | Rs. 1,27,000 | Rs. 1,27,000 |\n| Forests          | Rs. 16,000   | Rs. 16,000   | Rs. 17,000   | Rs. 17,000   | Rs. 19,000   | Rs. 19,000   |\n| Interest         | Rs. 5,000    | Rs. 5,000    | Rs. 5,000    | Rs. 5,000    | Rs. 9,000    | Rs. 9,000    |\n| Other sources    | Rs. 1,35,000 | Rs. 1,35,000 | Rs. 1,20,000 | Rs. 1,20,000 | Rs. 1,02,000 | Rs. 1,02,000 |\n| **Total**        | Rs. 9,41,000 | Rs. 9,36,000 | Rs. 9,59,000 | Rs. 9,54,000 | Rs. 8,62,000 | Rs. 8,53,000 |\n| Assignment from Imperial revenues | ... | Rs. 12,74,000 | ... | Rs. 12,85,000 | ... | Rs. 16,98,000 |\n| **Grand total**  | Rs. 9,41,000 | Rs. 22,10,000 | Rs. 9,59,000 | Rs. 22,39,000 | Rs. 8,62,000 | Rs. 25,51,000 |\n\n| Heads of expenditure | Average for the quinquennial period ending 1902 | Actuals for 1900\u20131 | Actuals for 1902\u20133 |\n|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Opening balance      | Rs. 20,000 | Rs. 17,000 | Rs. 43,000 |\n| Charges in respect of collection (principally land revenue and forests) | Rs. 1,80,000 | Rs. 1,86,000 | Rs. 1,95,000 |\n| Salaries and expenses of civil departments\u2014 | | | |\n| (a) General administration | Rs. 3,36,000 | Rs. 3,34,000 | Rs. 3,52,000 |\n| (b) Law and justice | Rs. 71,000 | Rs. 77,000 | Rs. 70,000 |\n| (c) Police | Rs. 2,49,000 | Rs. 2,63,000 | Rs. 2,60,000 |\n| (d) Levies, including postal levies | Rs. 8,54,000 | Rs. 8,75,000 | Rs. 8,79,000 |\n| (e) Education | Rs. 9,000 | Rs. 9,000 | Rs. 10,000 |\n| (f) Medical | Rs. 50,000 | Rs. 57,000 | Rs. 57,000 |\n| (g) Other heads (scientific and minor departments) | Rs. 2,000 | Rs. 2,000 | Rs. 51,000 |\n| Pensions and miscellaneous civil charges (including political pensions) | Rs. 9,000 | Rs. 7,000 | Rs. 16,000 |\n| Irrigation | Rs. 30,000 | Rs. 21,000 | Rs. 81,000 |\n| Civil public works | Rs. 3,75,000 | Rs. 3,18,000 | Rs. 3,97,000 |\n| Other charges and adjustments, refunds and drawbacks | Rs. 2,000 | Rs. 2,000 | Rs. 1,000 |\n| Assignments and compensations | Rs. 72,000 | Rs. 77,000 | Rs. 78,000 |\n| **Total** | Rs. 22,39,000 | Rs. 22,28,000 | Rs. 24,47,000 |\n| Closing balance | Rs. 9,000 | Rs. 6,000 | Rs. 61,000 |\nThe land tenures of the Province are of a very simple character. In a few tracts the organized and corporate system originating in tribal conquest and territorial allotment, often in the shape of compensation for blood, still exists. The land appears to have been divided originally into groups of holdings forming the several shares of the different tribal subdivisions. In course of time, however, successive distributions have resulted in individual proprietorship, which is now almost universal. Such proprietors have full control over their property and the right of alienation. In some parts periodical division of land and water still takes place. In others, where there is little water in proportion to the amount of land, the water is permanently divided, while the land is owned jointly and apportioned for each crop. In irrigated tracts the proprietor is frequently the cultivator. If he leases his land, it is only as a temporary measure. In flood- and rains-crop areas, where cultivation is possible only by embanking, it was formerly usual in the highlands for an owner to assign the proprietary right in a portion of the land embanked, generally a half or a quarter, to the person making the embankment. This system is falling into desuetude in proportion as the value of land is appreciated, and temporary written leases are now generally granted. In low-lying tracts a cultivator who makes an embankment pays the proprietor a fixed share in the produce (hakki-topa) and acquires an alienable occupancy right.\n\nRevenue was levied in Mughal times partly in cash and partly in kind. The tribes were also required to furnish a specified number of horsemen and footmen. In 1590 Duki, Pishin, the Harnai valley, Shorarud, and Quetta were included in the sarkar of Kandahar, and Sibi in the sarkar of Bhakkar. Besides revenue in cash and kind, the value of which may be estimated at about $1\\frac{1}{2}$ lakhs of rupees, these areas furnished 4,750 armed horsemen and 6,400 footmen. Immediately previous to the advent of the British, various systems prevailed in different parts of the country. Tribes far remote from the head-quarters of the provincial governors paid only an occasional sheep or goat to the tribal chief, who carried a small nazarana or present to the local governor. In those districts which were under more immediate control and had originally furnished armed men, this service had been commuted into a cash payment known as gham-i-naukar. In some places a fixed amount in cash or kind, known as zar-i-kalang, was levied, but a complicated system of batai or sharing of grain was the more general method of taking revenue. The share realized varied from one-third to one-tenth, and resort was sometimes had to appraisement. A host of cesses were also levied, including payments for the naib or agent, the weighman, the seal-man, and the crop-watcher. The total amount thus exacted appears to have seldom\namounted to less than one-half of the produce. The batai system still survives in this form in the Kal\u0101t State.\n\nUnder British rule no attempt has yet been made to enforce entire uniformity in revenue management. Existing methods have been taken as the basis for introducing an improved system, and great care has been exercised not to cause discontent among the people. The present methods of realizing land revenue are as follows: (a) cash assessments fixed for a term of years (jamabast); (b) temporary assessments (tj\u0101ra); (c) division of the produce (batai); (d) appraisement of the standing crops and levy of revenue in kind (tashkhis or d\u0101nabandi); and (e) estimation of the Government share in cash after measurement of a portion of the crops (tashkhis-i-nakdi). In the last three cases the Government share varies, the highest rate being one-third and the lowest one-eighth. The usual rate is one-sixth. Where revenue is taken in kind, an amount of fodder equal to the grain is also generally realized.\n\nAs a result of inquiries into the existing revenue system made in 1882, orders were issued for making summary settlements, village by village, for the removal of irritating fees, and for the conversion in special cases of grain dues into cash. At this time the usual share of produce taken in irrigated lands was one-third; but in 1887 this rate was reduced, and about the same time the Government of India recommended the introduction of fixed assessments throughout the Agency. It was found impossible to effect this change immediately, and an option was therefore given to the cultivator to pay the revenue in kind or the equivalent of the crop assessment in cash. As new areas have come under control, batai revenue has usually been levied at one-sixth, and the cultivator is found to prefer this system with all its drawbacks to cash payment.\n\nSettlement work was begun in 1902 and is still in progress. The record-of-rights has covered the tahsils of Quetta, Pishin, Hindub\u0101gh, Kila Saifulla, Bori, Sh\u0101hrig, Sibi, and Sanj\u0101wi. A fixed cash assessment has been introduced only in the Quetta, Pishin, Sh\u0101hrig, and Sanj\u0101wi tahsils. This being the first settlement and the data available being scanty, the methods followed have been summary. Keeping in view the fact that only a light assessment was required, the Settlement officer fixed the revenue after personal inspection and after calculation of the average out-turn of the principal crops, the valuation of the Government share being ascertained at the average prevailing prices. Regard has also been had to the proximity of markets, the quality of irrigated lands, the nature of the soil, and the number of crops usually obtained. In rains-crop areas the introduction of a fluctuating grain assessment, proposed by the Government of India, has not yet been found practicable; and when a cultivable \u2018dry-crop\u2019 area forms even a large addition to an irrigated estate it has, as a rule, not been found worth while to assess it.\nExtensive tracts have been formed into separate estates, which are subject to *batai*. The period of assessment is usually ten years, but this has been extended to twenty in Pishin. In settled *tahsils* the incidence per acre on the irrigable area varies from about 7 annas to about Rs. 3\u20139\u20130, and on the area actually irrigated from Rs. 1\u20135\u20133 to Rs. 5. The assessments are on the whole low. They generally follow the shares in water, but are sometimes fixed on areas also. Individual holders are in all cases responsible for payment of the revenue. The ordinary term of exemption for a new source of irrigation is ten years, and land brought under cultivation during the term of the settlement is not liable to revenue. The planting of fruit-trees is also encouraged. The proprietary right in land acquired by confiscation under native rule has now passed to the British Government, and it has been granted to cultivators at rates which cover both land revenue and the proprietor\u2019s share of the produce. In pre-British days, the state was considered the owner of all grazing lands; and in the draft Land Revenue Regulation, which is now under consideration, a provision has been inserted giving the Government the presumptive right in all lands comprised in unclaimed and unoccupied waste. The Punjab Land Revenue Act, XVII of 1887, has been applied with modifications to Quetta and Pishin, and rules have been issued for the maintenance of records. For this purpose an establishment of *k\u0101nungos*, *patw\u0101ris*, &c., is maintained.\n\nGrazing tax (*tirni*) has been levied everywhere since 1890, except in the Bolan, the Nasirabad *tahsil*, and Nushki. In the latter District only nomads from Afghan territory are liable. Rates vary from one anna for a sheep or goat to Rs. 1\u20138\u20130 for a female camel. Plough and milch cattle are exempt. The tax is collected by annual enumeration or by annual contract without actual counting. It yielded Rs. 88,682 in 1903\u20134, or about 13 per cent. of the aggregate land revenue.\n\nThe total land revenue in 1900\u20131, including Rs. 4,394 collected as grazing tax from Powindas on their way to the Punjab, and payable to that Administration, was 6 lakhs, which gives an incidence of Rs. 1\u00b796 per head of total population and Rs. 2\u00b727 on the rural population. Of this, 1\u00b77 lakhs was collected by cash assessment and 3\u00b74 lakhs by division of crops. The annual value in 1901 of the Government revenue alienated in revenue-free grants was Rs. 88,783. Most of these grants constitute a relic of Afghan times, and are held by privileged classes, such as Saiyids. Under British rule they have sometimes been made to persons for services rendered, or to chiefs to enable them to support their position or compensate them for the loss of former privileges. They consist either of an assignment of the whole or of a fixed proportion of the revenue on certain lands, of fixed allowances in grain, or of remissions of grazing tax. Remissions or suspensions of revenue\nare given in tracts under fixed assessment only in years of drought or damaged crops, and are based on the proportion of the area in which crops have failed. Remissions of grazing tax are also allowed. Under the Civil Justice Law agricultural land may not be sold in execution of a decree without the sanction of the Local Government, and the draft Land Revenue Regulation contains provisions limiting the power of alienation of such land to non-agriculturists.\n\nThe opium revenue is derived entirely from vend fees. The cultivation of poppy is prohibited, and opium required for local consumption is imported from the Punjab by licensed vendors who make their own arrangements for procuring it. No import duty is levied. The exclusive right of retailing opium is disposed of annually by auction for each District, the number of shops being limited. The sale of opium and poppy-heads for medicinal purposes is also regulated. The consumption of opium in 1900\u20131 was about 16 maunds, and in 1902\u20133 about 15 maunds.\n\nThe salt consumed in Baluchist\u0101n consists of earth-salt manufactured in the Province, and rock-salt. The latter is imported by rail, in small quantities only, owing to the competition of untaxed local salt. The imports of rock-salt averaged about 800 maunds during the three years ending 1900; the imports in 1900\u20131 reached 1,142 maunds. The wholesale price at Sibi is about Rs. 3\u201312\u20130 and at Quetta Rs. 4\u20139\u20130 per maund. Punjab rock-salt is used in the towns and bazars by the non-indigenous civil and military population, while the local earth-salt is used by the tribesmen. The latter pays duty on importation into Administered areas at Rs. 1\u20138\u20130 per standard maund. Local salt on importation into Quetta town pays duty at Rs. 1\u20138\u20130, but in Pish\u012bn bazar and Kila Abdullah the rate is R. 1. No tax is levied on earth-salt produced in Zhob, Loralai, or Ch\u0101gai. In the Native States the right of manufacture is generally given on contract. No preventive establishments are anywhere maintained. The annual revenue from salt from 1897 to 1900 averaged Rs. 3,670. In 1900\u20131 it was Rs. 3,383, and in 1902\u20133 Rs. 3,151.\n\nThe cultivation of hemp has been absolutely prohibited in British Baluchist\u0101n since July, 1896. In the Kal\u0101t highlands its cultivation appears to be on the increase. Charas and bh\u0101ng are imported into British territory in small quantities from Afghanistan and Kal\u0101t, and have been subject to import duty since 1902. The main supply of charas comes from the Punjab, while bh\u0101ng and g\u0101nja are supplied by Sind. Bh\u0101ng is the only drug of which there is any considerable consumption. The consumption of intoxicating drugs in 1900\u20131 was as follows: poppy-heads, $3\\frac{1}{2}$ maunds; g\u0101nja, 34 seers; charas, 30 maunds; and bh\u0101ng, 119 maunds. In 1902\u20133 the consumption of poppy-heads amounted to $1\\frac{1}{8}$ maunds; of g\u0101nja to 8 seers; of charas to $29\\frac{1}{5}$ maunds;\nand of *bhang* to $40\\frac{3}{4}$ maunds. Separate annual contracts are given to licensed vendors for the wholesale and retail vend of intoxicating drugs. For medicinal purposes they are sold by licensed druggists. The incidence of revenue per head of population in 1900\u20131 was about one anna.\n\nThe manufacture and vend of country spirits are combined under a monopoly system. Each District forms a separate farm. The rights are generally disposed of annually by auction. The sale of rum is sometimes included in the contract. Manufacture is carried on under the out-still system.\n\nThe out-turn of the brewery at Quetta averaged 212,977 gallons of beer per annum between 1891 and 1900, of which 170,460 gallons were supplied to the local Commissariat department. The quantity brewed was 238,572 gallons in 1901, and 347,220 gallons in 1903. Up to 1897 malt liquors supplied to the Commissariat department were, as a special case, free of duty. One anna per gallon is now levied.\n\nForeign liquors, including spirit manufactured in other parts of India after the English method, are sold under wholesale and retail licences, which are granted on payment of fixed fees of Rs. 32 for wholesale vend and from Rs. 100 to Rs. 300 for retail vend. Retail vendors may not sell by the glass. Rates varying from Rs. 6 to Rs. 200 per annum are charged for licences for places of refreshment.\n\nThe excise revenue from various sources has been as follows:\n\n|                                | Average of ten years ending 1899-1900 | 1900-1 | 1902-3 |\n|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Country liquors, including beer and rum | Rs. 1,00,980                         | Rs. 1,05,177 | Rs. 94,239 |\n| Opium                           | Rs. 17,359                           | Rs. 17,490 | Rs. 12,495 |\n| Drugs                           | Rs. 18,569                           | Rs. 21,291 | Rs. 17,415 |\n| Foreign liquors                 | Rs. 3,998                            | Rs. 3,678 | Rs. 2,845 |\n| Total                           | Rs. 1,40,906                         | Rs. 1,47,636 | Rs. 1,26,994 |\n\nThe incidence per head is about seven annas. The consumption of intoxicating liquors and opium is confined to the foreign population. Hemp drugs are used to some extent by the people of the country. There appears to be a tendency among the educated classes to consume foreign liquors in preference to country spirits.\n\nThe net stamp revenue during the nine years 1891\u20131900 averaged Rs. 76,600. In 1900\u20131 it was Rs. 59,000, and in 1902\u20133 Rs. 62,600. About two-thirds of the total is derived from judicial and one-third from non-judicial stamps.\n\nThe Income Tax Act (II of 1886) has not been applied to Baluchistan. British subjects in the service of the Government of India or of\na local authority, or who may be serving within Native States in the Province, are alone liable to the tax. The receipts during the three years 1897-1900 averaged Rs. 15,400 per annum; in 1900-1 they were Rs. 16,200, and in 1902-3 Rs. 17,300.\n\nQuetta is the only municipality that has been formally constituted in Baluchist\u0101n. An octroi tax was levied by Kal\u0101t officials before British occupation, which was continued after Sir R. Sandeman's arrival, a conservancy cess being added in 1878. The site of the town and civil lines was purchased by Government, and was subsequently assigned to the municipality under certain conditions. Up to the year 1893 the affairs of the town and its funds were managed by the Extra Assistant Commissioner at Quetta, controlled by the Political Agent. The Quetta Municipal Law came into force on October 15, 1896. The municipal committee consists of a chairman and not less than six nominated members. The Political Agent is ex-officio chairman, and the term of office of the members is one year. In March, 1904, the committee included five European ex-officio members and eight natives. During the four years ending 1901 the municipal income averaged 1.7 lakhs. The principal item is octroi, the receipts from which are about a lakh annually. Half of the net receipts from this source are paid over to the Quetta cantonment committee. Taking the population of Quetta town alone, the incidence of taxation is Rs. 12-4-1 per head; including that of the cantonment, however, it drops to Rs. 6-11-10. Quetta being surrounded by open country, the cost of collection of octroi is necessarily costly, amounting to more than 19 per cent. of the gross receipts in 1901. In 1903-4 the total income of the municipality had increased to 2.2 lakhs.\n\nSeven 'excluded' Local funds have been created, known as the Sibi municipal fund, the Sh\u0101hrig District bazar fund (which includes the Zi\u0101rat improvement fund), the Pish\u012bn Sadar and District bazar fund, the Loralai town fund (including the Duki and B\u0101rkh\u0101n funds), the Fort Sandeman, the Nushki, and the Bol\u0101n bazar funds. These have been formed from time to time as new centres of trade sprang up and developed. The objects to which their income is devoted include local works and other measures of public utility, such as education and conservancy. The accounts, except in the case of the Sibi municipal fund, are governed by rules issued by the Government of India, and are audited by the Comptroller, India Treasuries. The Revenue Commissioner exercises with regard to their disposition the powers of a Local Government; the Political Agents are controlling officers, while the officers in charge of subdivisions (except in the Bol\u0101n, Pish\u012bn, and Chaman) are the administrators. The total income of these funds during the four years ending 1901 averaged Rs. 1,18,000 per annum, and the expenditure\nRs. 1,14,000. No local rates are levied; but the principal source of income is octroi, which contributed an average of Rs. 62,700. One-third of the octroi receipts at Chaman, Loralai, and Fort Sandeman is paid over to the military authorities at these stations. The income of the funds in 1903-4 amounted to Rs. 1,07,000, and the expenditure to Rs. 1,01,000.\n\nQuetta was declared a cantonment in 1883 and Loralai in 1897. The funds of each are administered by a cantonment committee. Their income consists chiefly of octroi and of grants-in-aid from Government, and is expended on objects similar to those of Local funds. During the four years ending 1901, the total income averaged Rs. 93,000 and the expenditure Rs. 92,000 per annum. In 1903 the income amounted to Rs. 1,25,600 and the expenditure to Rs. 1,39,700.\n\nThe Public Works department has had a chequered career. Up to 1882 a Superintending Engineer was appointed under the immediate orders of the Local Government. From 1882 to 1885 the execution of civil works was entrusted to the Director-General of Military Works, the military Superintending Engineer being Secretary to the Local Government. From 1885 to 1889 public works were carried out by both military and civil agency, the civil Superintending Engineer being Joint Secretary to the Agent to the Governor-General. From 1889 to 1893 the civil Superintending Engineer was made Secretary for Public Works to the Local Government, and three civil divisions were created; the military Superintending Engineer was Joint Secretary and also controlled two Military Works divisions.\n\nIn 1893 all civil works were again entrusted to the military; and, owing to the importance of training Royal Engineer officers on the frontier and to the evils of a dual system, this arrangement still continues. Thus, the executive officers of the department of Military Works carry out both the civil and military works falling within their charges. The Commanding Royal Engineer, Quetta, is Superintending Engineer for all works and Secretary for Public Works to the Agent to the Governor-General. The Agency is divided into two sub-districts, each in charge of a Sub-District Commanding Royal Engineer. Subordinate to the Sub-District Commanding Royal Engineers are Garrison Engineers, who have charge of local areas. All works carried out on behalf of the civil authorities are executed as contribution works to the Military Works department. For establishments, tools, and plant, and cost of audit a fixed sum of 24\u00bd per cent. on the cost of all works is credited to the Military Works services. A payment of Rs. 2,300 is also made on account of establishments engaged for the supervision of coal mines. A special irrigation Engineer has been recently appointed, whose pay is debitable to Provincial revenues.\nThe Commanding Royal Engineer, in his capacity as Superintending Engineer and Secretary to the Agent to the Governor-General, frames budget estimates, considers original 'major' works costing more than Rs. 2,500, and allots sums for 'minor' works. Sub-District Commanding Royal Engineers sanction original works costing not more than Rs. 2,500, which have been previously selected by the Governor-General's Agent, and dispose of the annual grants for repairs through Garrison Engineers. 'Minor' works costing not more than Rs. 200 in each case are disposed of by civil officers.\n\nIn the quarter of a century which has elapsed since its occupation, all the north-eastern part of the Province has been covered with a system of roads; bungalows and resthouses have been built at convenient places, and water-supplies have been provided in the principal headquarters stations. Many of the most important of these schemes owe their inception and execution to military needs. Such are the Bolan road; the buildings in the cantonments at Quetta and Loralai; and the water-supplies at Quetta, Sibi, and Loralai. The Pishin-Dera Ghazi Khan and Harnai-Loralai roads, though carried out as civil works, are now maintained from military funds.\n\nOf civil works, three canal systems, Shebo, Khushdil Khan, and the Anambar scheme, have been constructed at a total cost of 17.3 lakhs. An account of the most important roads and their cost has been given in the section on Communications. Among public buildings may be mentioned the Quetta Hospital, which consists of fifteen blocks for in-patients and has a splendidly equipped operating room, the whole erected at a cost of about Rs. 76,000; the administrative buildings at Quetta in which the District courts and treasury are located, which were completed in 1892 at a cost of about 2 lakhs, including later additions: the Church of England, which cost 2.8 lakhs; and the Roman Catholic Church, towards the erection of which a donation of Rs. 95,000 was given by Government. Two Residencies have been constructed for the Agent to the Governor-General. That at Quetta, which is one of the prettiest official residences in India, and cost 1.3 lakhs, was completed in 1893; the other is at Ziarat, the capital cost of which was about half a lakh. The Darbar Hall at Quetta, which contains a fine room for darbar purposes, was formerly used as the church, and cost about Rs. 92,000. The Public Works department has also constructed the Sandeman Memorial Hall at Quetta and the Victoria Memorial Hall at Sibi, in which the Shahi jirgas are held. The former cost 1.1 lakhs, of which rather less than half was raised by private subscription, and the latter Rs. 38,800.\n\nThe only municipal drainage scheme of importance is that in Quetta town, on which about 1.1 lakhs has been expended on capital account. Permanent open drains have also been constructed in Sibi and Fort\nSandeman. Piped water-supplies exist at Quetta, Fort Sandeman, Loralai, Sibi, Chaman, and Ziarat.\n\nQuetta was originally occupied in 1839, but was evacuated at the conclusion of the first Afghan War. On the outbreak of the second Afghan War in 1878 it was used as the base of operations, and troops held Pishin, Quetta, and the line of the Bolan from Sibi. Loralai was occupied in 1886, and Chaman in 1889. Fort Sandeman was garrisoned in 1890.\n\nQuetta is the head-quarters of the fourth division of the Western Command. The troops in Baluchistan are under the divisional headquarters direct, and a brigade under a colonel on the staff is located in Sind. The division is commanded by a major-general. The troops in the Province consisted in 1903 of three mountain batteries, two companies of garrison artillery, two British infantry regiments, three native cavalry regiments, six native infantry regiments, and one company of sappers and miners. The total strength of troops on June 1, 1903, was 2,650 British and 7,121 Native; total, 9,771. The greater part of the garrison is quartered at Quetta and in a number of outposts; the remainder is distributed at Loralai, Fort Sandeman, and Chaman, each of these stations being garrisoned by native infantry and cavalry. In addition to the regular troops, a local company of volunteers and a company of North-Western Railway volunteers have been raised. They possessed 175 members on their rolls in 1891, 196 in 1901, and 236 in 1903.\n\nQuetta itself is very strongly fortified by works which, with the support of the two lines of railway, render it practically impregnable. The fortifications were first designed in 1883, and have since been extended and improved. It contains an arsenal, and the Indian Staff College was opened in 1907.\n\nThe division possesses five local regiments, three of cavalry and two of infantry. The cavalry consists of the Scinde Horse, Jacob's Horse, and the Baloch Horse, which are borne on the Army List as the 35th, 36th, and 37th Cavalry, and were raised in 1839, 1846, and 1885 respectively. The two infantry regiments are the 124th (Duchess of Connaught's Own) and the 126th Baluchistan Regiment.\n\nThe Province has the distinction of possessing one of the first of those corps of local militia which now bear so large a part in frontier management. The Zhob Levy Corps was raised in 1890, and consists of four squadrons of cavalry, aggregating 423 men, and six companies of infantry, aggregating 632 men, under a commandant, second-in-command, and adjutant of the regular army. It guards a long line of frontier from Loiband on the west to Gul Kach on the east, a distance of about 180 miles, besides garrisoning several posts to protect Zhob from the\n\n---\n\nSince 1905 the corps has been strengthened by the addition of 200 mounted men and one British officer, its total strength being raised to 1,275 men.\nincursions of Mahs\u016bd and other raiders. In 1902\u20133 the expenditure on the corps amounted to more than 2\u00bd lakhs. Details of the irregular forces maintained in Kal\u0101t and Las Bela will be found in the articles on those States.\n\nThe policy of making the inhabitants responsible for the security of the country and frontier has been developed into what is known as the levy system. Both levies and police are worked side by side; but the duties of the latter are, so far as possible, confined to guards and escorts, and to maintaining order in the towns and on the railway. Crime is investigated by the local headmen and levies, who are assisted by experienced deputy-inspectors of police and levies. This system is supplemented by the reference of cases to jirgas for decision by tribal custom. In 1904, 2,022 levies and 1,173 police were employed in directly Administered areas, being one man to 109 persons or 15 square miles.\n\nThe levy system owes its origin to Sir Robert Sandeman, who, when Deputy-Commissioner of Dera Gh\u0101zi Kh\u0101n District in 1867, took into Government service a small number of tribal horsemen from the Marris and Bugtis. These men were employed chiefly in keeping up communications between the chiefs and the British authorities. The system was extended, on Sir Robert Sandeman's arrival in Baluchist\u0101n, by offering the headmen allowances for maintaining a certain number of armed horse and foot, by whose means they were expected to keep order in their tribes and to produce offenders when crime occurred. It was based on the assumptions: firstly, that in every tribe there exist headmen of influence who, if effectually supported, can compel obedience; and, secondly, that no frontier tribesman can be expected to work for Government unless paid for it. The system thus started was expanded in 1883, when the organization was fully considered by a committee. At this time the Baloch Guide Corps was disbanded. It had been raised for service in Kachhi at the time of the first Afgh\u0101n War in 1838, but was withdrawn within the Sind frontier in 1852 and transferred to Baluchist\u0101n in 1877\u00b9.\n\nThe District officers control the levies, whose duties are many and various. Besides the detection and arrest of criminals, they guard communications, bring in witnesses, make inquiries, carry letters, produce supplies, escort prisoners, and assist in the collection of revenue. They are exclusively recruited from the local tribes, and are ordinarily employed within their own tribal limits. Each man has his own weapon, generally a sword, and is distinguished by a badge or turban. In some places the men are armed with Snider carbines. At central posts writers are stationed to conduct correspondence. The system cannot be gauged by the actual numbers employed, as the\n\n\u00b9 For a short account of the duties performed by this corps in Sind see Baluchist\u0101n Blue Book No. 2, p. 70.\ngrant of service entitles the Government to the assistance of the whole tribe in times of emergency and not merely to that of the few enrolled individuals. It is also an axiom that all persons drawing pay, whether chiefs or others, who are not pensioners, must render an equivalent in service. A few personal grants have been made for long and tried service, but these are exceptional. Reference has already been made to the condition in the Provincial settlement that the expenditure on levies shall not be materially reduced below Rs. 8,27,000. This sum includes the cost of the Zhob Levy Corps, the expenditure on which amounts to more than 2\u00bd lakhs of rupees. Full statistics of the force of levies employed at different periods will be found in Table II at the end of this article (p. 342). In 1904 the total number of effective levies working in the Province, excluding the Zhob Levy Corps and those employed on postal duty, amounted to 2,130, and cost about Rs. 5,86,000 per annum.\n\nPolice have been recruited from time to time as necessity demanded. In 1882 the total number of police was 516, but no special officer had been appointed to supervise them. In 1889 the question of police administration was considered by a committee; but the system then initiated, by which the control of the force was handed over to Political Agents and Assistant Political Agents, was altered in 1897, when a European District Superintendent of police was appointed to Quetta-Pishin and the railway. He has since been placed in charge of the Sibi District police. The Agent to the Governor-General is the Inspector-General of Police and Levies. In Zhob and Loralai an Inspector of police, who is also an Honorary Assistant District Superintendent, holds charge of the force. Statistics of the total force at different periods will be found in Table II at the end of this article (p. 342). In 1904 the total strength of the police was 1,173 of all grades, or one policeman to 41 square miles of directly Administered areas. The number of officers, inspectors, and deputy-inspectors was forty-two.\n\nThe police are chiefly recruited from natives of India, but local men are now beginning to join. A tendency exists among the latter not to serve continuously for long periods. Efforts are being made to enlist local men of good family in the higher grades. Anthropometrical measurements and finger-prints are not taken. The armament has hitherto consisted of Snider rifles with side-arms, for which Martini rifles are to be substituted. Much use is made of trackers, who frequently exhibit remarkable talent. The railways are divided into two subdivisions for police purposes. The number of police employed on them is 147, posted at 42 stations. This number is supplemented by 160 levies, making an aggregate of 307 men employed on 399 miles of line.\nDuring the three years ending 1901, the average number of cognizable cases reported was 1,542. Of these cases, 1,055 were decided in the criminal courts, 948 ending in conviction and 107 in acquittal or discharge. Cases of serious crime, which would ordinarily be treated as cognizable in India, are, for political reasons, not always investigated by the police in Baluchist\u0101n, but are placed before tribal jirgas for award.\n\nThe Revenue Commissioner is Inspector-General of Jails. The Province possessed two District jails and fourteen subsidiary jails in 1900-1, capable of accommodating 490 male and 93 female prisoners. Details of the prison population, &c., are given in the following table:\n\n| Year | District jails | Subsidiary jails (Lock-ups) | Average daily jail population | Rate of jail mortality per 1,000 | Expenditure on jails and maintenance of prisoners | Cost per prisoner |\n|------|----------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------|\n|      |                |                            | Males | Females | Total | Rs. | Rs. |\n| 1891-2 | 1              | 5                           | 93*   | 3\u2020     | 96*   | 4\u2020  | 1,283 | 133 |\n| 1895-6 | 2              | 12                          | 127*  | 2\u2020     | 129*  | 42\u2020 | 14,320| 104 |\n| 1900-1 | 2              | 14                          | 247   | 11     | 258   | 47\u2020 | 23,034| 96  |\n\n* Includes figures for the Sibi and Harnai jails only in the Thal-Chotiali (now Sibi) District.\n\u2020 Includes figures for the Sibi subdivision only in the Thal-Chotiali (now Sibi) District.\n\nNote.\u2014No figures are available for the Bolan Pass.\n\nThe principal causes of sickness among the prisoners are malaria, dysentery, and pneumonia in winter. The diet is much the same as in the Punjab, the Jail Manual of which Province is followed mutatis mutandis. Prisoners whose term exceeds six months are ordinarily sent to Shikarpur in Sind, under arrangement with the Bombay Government.\n\nNo industries are carried on in the local jails, except in Quetta and Sibi, where coarse blankets are woven for the bedding and clothing of prisoners. Juvenile prisoners are sent to the reformatory at Shikarpur.\n\nEducation has as yet made little progress, and a department of Public Instruction is only now being organized by an Inspector-General of Education appointed jointly for the Frontier Province and Baluchist\u0101n. Secondary education is represented by one high and one Anglo-veracular middle school. The number of boys in these two schools was (1891) 27, (1901) 103, and (1903) 87. They are principally maintained from Local funds, but receive pecuniary aid from Government.\n\nThe primary schools attached to the middle schools are Anglo-veracular, in so far that English is taught in the two higher classes of the primary department. In all other primary schools the medium of instruction is Urd\u016b, and the subjects are Urd\u016b, Persian, geography,\nand arithmetic. The number of boys' schools has been three (1891), fourteen (1901), and twenty-one (1903). They contained 604 pupils in 1901 and 831 in 1903. Difficulties are experienced in obtaining qualified teachers, who generally have to be recruited from the Punjab. Their pay varies from Rs. 25 to Rs. 35 a month. A rough estimate shows that the number of pupils under instruction in mosque schools in 1901 was 2,256 boys and 313 girls.\n\nThe number of female schools and pupils has been one school with 61 pupils (1891), three schools with 170 pupils (1901), and four schools with 240 pupils (1903). Of the four schools, two are maintained from Local funds and two by private bodies. Of the latter, one is aided from Local funds and the other is a mission school. Each school is divided into three departments, Hindi, Gurmukhi, and Urdu, these languages being the medium of instruction. The Punjab system is followed, and sewing and knitting receive special attention. Almost all the girls attending these schools are from India. In 1901 the number of Hindu girls represented 82 per cent., and in 1903 72 per cent. of the total. The usual difficulties caused by early marriage and the parda system are the great hindrance to progress.\n\nTwo European schools contained 31 pupils (1901) and 53 (1903). Teaching on the Punjab system is given up to the middle department in one; the other is a primary school. In 1901 the total number of Muhammadan children under instruction was 434, including 28 girls. Indigenous children numbered 227. In 1903 the number of Muhammadan pupils had risen to 548, including 349 indigenous children.\n\nThe native population is too poor and uncivilized to appreciate the benefits of education, but special inducements are held out to them in the shape of stipends. The number of boarding-houses has risen from one accommodating nineteen residents (1901) to two accommodating thirty-two residents (1903). The census statistics afford no indication of the progress made in education. The Province is still very backward, absence of funds being the greatest drawback. It has not yet been found possible to charge fees in village primary schools. Educational expenditure during 1903-4 is exhibited in the table below:\n\n|                          | Provincial revenues | Local and municipal funds | Fees and other sources | Total |\n|--------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------|-------|\n| Secondary boys' schools  | Rs. 4,890           | Rs. 3,974                 | Rs. 3,840             | Rs. 12,704 |\n| Primary                  | Rs. 4,585           | Rs. 4,334                 | Rs. 3,198             | Rs. 12,117 |\n| Girls' schools           | Rs. 180             | Rs. 4,534                 | Rs. 2,468             | Rs. 7,182 |\n| **Total**                | Rs. 9,655           | Rs. 12,842                | Rs. 9,566             | Rs. 32,063 |\nThe *Baluchist\u0101n Gazette* is the only newspaper published in English, and is chiefly devoted to local news. No vernacular newspapers exist, and no books have been issued.\n\nDispensaries were first opened at Kal\u0101t and Quetta and a Medical Officer was appointed to the Agency in 1877. The department has since rapidly expanded. Statistics of the number of civil hospitals and dispensaries and of the patients treated are given below:\n\n| Year | Number of hospitals and dispensaries | Average daily number of patients |\n|------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n|      |                                     | Indoor | Outdoor |\n| 1891 | 12                                  | 86     | 525    |\n| 1896 | 15                                  | 113    | 659    |\n| 1901 | 16                                  | 113    | 703    |\n| 1903 | 17                                  | 120    | 725    |\n\nThese figures exclude the statistics for institutions maintained by the North-Western Railway, private bodies, and Native States, which numbered (1891) seven, (1896) nine, (1901) ten, and (1903) eleven. The total number of cases treated in all institutions has been (1881) 8,590, (1891) 112,809, (1901) 207,534, and (1903) 204,611. In 1887 the system of medical relief was remodelled, all medical institutions being placed under the Agency Surgeon and Administrative Medical Officer, who was made the central controlling authority. A Civil Surgeon is stationed at Quetta, and the military European medical officers at garrison stations have been appointed Civil Surgeons of those places. Seven Assistant Surgeons and twenty-eight Hospital Assistants are employed. The largest hospital is at Quetta. Two hospitals are supported by the Lady Dufferin Fund.\n\nThe principal source of income is a grant from Provincial revenues. The cost of medicines, diet, &c., has largely increased in recent years. The following figures indicate the income and expenditure of civil medical institutions maintained by Government:\n\n| Year | Income | Expenditure |\n|------|--------|-------------|\n|      | Total  | Government payments | Local and municipal payments | Fees, endowments, and other sources | Total | Establishment | Medicines, diet, buildings, &c. |\n|      | Rs.    | Rs.        | Rs.            | Rs.                  | Rs.    | Rs.          | Rs.               |\n| 1891 | 27,700 | 22,500     | 3,600          | 1,600                | 26,000 | 18,800       | 7,200             |\n| 1896 | 29,600 | 25,400     | 3,800          | 400                  | 30,800 | 21,200       | 9,600             |\n| 1901 | 43,100 | 35,700     | 6,700          | 700                  | 42,900 | 22,900       | 20,000            |\n| 1903 | 59,300 | 52,800     | 5,100          | 1,400                | 62,000 | 24,400       | 37,600            |\nThe commonest endemic diseases are malarial fevers and cachexia, bowel complaints, scurvy, chronic ulcers including 'frontier sores,' chronic inflammation of the eyes, dysentery, and rheumatism. They are caused chiefly by insufficient clothing, insanitary dwellings, poor diet, the absence of antiscorbutics, and the dust and dryness of the atmosphere. Of epidemics, small-pox, measles, cholera, and typhus fever are the most prevalent.\n\nTen outbreaks of cholera have occurred between 1887 and 1903. Contrary to general rule, it is quite possible to secure effective land quarantine in Baluchist\u0101n. There have been four known outbreaks of typhus fever since 1891, but the occurrence of this disease appears to have remained unidentified in several instances. An inspection camp established on the railway in 1896 has hitherto prevented the spread of plague to Upper Baluchist\u0101n, but an outbreak occurred in 1902 at Sonmi\u0101ni in Las Bela.\n\nThe Province possesses no lunatic asylum. Lunatics are sent to the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d Asylum in Sind. The following table shows the number of criminal and other lunatics from Baluchist\u0101n and the cost of each inmate:\n\n| Average daily number of\u2014 | 1891 | 1896 | 1901 | 1903 |\n|--------------------------|------|------|------|------|\n| (a) Criminal lunatics    | None | None | 0.6  | 1.5  |\n| (b) Other lunatics       | 7.3  | 13.9 | 6.1  | 12.3 |\n| Average cost of each inmate per annum | Rs. a. p. | Rs. a. p. | Rs. a. p. | Rs. a. p. |\n|                          | 70-7-9 | 103-9-10 | 109-6-5 | 104-8-6 |\n\nLunatics from Baluchist\u0101n are reported to be generally well-behaved, but to be specially subject to outbursts of passion and acts of violence.\n\nSince the introduction of vaccination the outbreaks of small-pox have been limited in both extent and virulence. Vaccination is available throughout directly Administered areas, but is compulsory only in Quetta. Inoculation is freely practised by Mull\u0101s, Saiyids and others, a small fee, generally four annas, being charged for the operation. The people are still ignorant and apathetic, and rarely resort to vaccination till an outbreak of small-pox occurs. Re-vaccination is seldom permitted. In 1896, 12,500 operations were performed, of which 11,000 were successful; in 1903 the number was 13,000, of which 10,500 were successful. The cost per successful case was two annas and two pies in 1896, and four annas and eight pies in 1903.\n\nThe sale of quinine in pice packets is progressing: 6,627 packets were sold in 1895\u20136; 8,694 in 1901\u20132; and 8,050 in 1902\u20133. Village sanitation is conspicuous by its absence. In the highlands manure is freely used in cultivation, and sweepings and dirt are thus removed to some extent from the neighbourhood of habitations. The nomads move\ntheir encampments when their surroundings become filthy beyond endurance.\n\nThe coast of the Province was originally surveyed by officers of the late Indian Navy between 1823 and 1829. These surveys were afterwards revised and corrected by Lieutenant A. W. Stiffe in 1874, and excellent charts have been published by the Admiralty. The charts are supplemented by a very complete and accurate account of the coast known as the Persian Gulf Pilot\u00b9.\n\nA systematic survey of the interior was commenced by the Survey department of the Government of India in 1879, and during the succeeding twenty years a triangulation connected with the Indus series of the Great Trigonometrical Survey was extended through the country. In spite of great difficulties, topographical surveys on the half-inch scale have been carried out up to the 66th east parallel, and maps have been published on that scale. Westward, the results of a reconnaissance survey have been embodied in published maps on the quarter-inch scale. Several special large-scale surveys have also been undertaken, including one for a railway in the Zhob Valley and another of the coal-bearing Sor range.\n\nIn connexion with the settlement operations, a cadastral survey of all irrigated villages in the Quetta, Pishin, Sh\u0101hrig, Sanj\u0101wi, Sibi, Hindub\u0101gh, Kila Saifulla, and Bori tahsils has been undertaken on the scale of 16 inches to 1 mile. These surveys are based on traverses carried out by the Survey of India department, and are being extended to the Duki and B\u0101rkh\u0101n tahsils. The agency employed is almost entirely foreign, and the local Afgh\u0101n has so far shown little aptitude for acquiring the principles of surveying.\n\n\u00b9 London, 1898. Sold by J. D.

The northern part of the subdivision is a flat alluvial plain; but to the south this merges in the B\u0101rind, where the ground is elevated and covered with brushwood, which is now yielding to the axe and plough. The subdivision was constituted in November, 1904, out of part of the old head-quarters subdivision. The population of this tract in 1901 was 386,630, compared with 338,545 in 1891, the density being 328 persons per square mile. In the sparsely populated B\u0101rind tract a rapid increase is now taking place. It contains 2,631 villages, one of which, B\u0101lurgh\u0101t, is the head-quarters, but no towns. There are interesting historical remains at Devikot.\n\nB\u0101lurgh\u0101t Village.\u2014Head-quarters of the subdivision of the same name in Din\u0101jpur District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, situated in $25^\\circ 13'$ N. and $88^\\circ 47'$ E., on the east bank of the Atrai river.

It was at one time under British management, supervised by the Deputy-Commissioner of Singhbh\u016bm, but was restored to the direct control of the R\u0101j\u0101 of May\u016brbhanj in 1878.\n\nB\u0101manw\u0101s (or B\u0101mniaw\u0101s).\u2014Head-quarters of the tahsil of the same name in the Gang\u0101pur niz\u0101mat of the State of Jaipur, R\u0101jput\u0101na, situated in $26^\\circ 33'$ N. and $76^\\circ 34'$ E., about 55 miles south-east of Jaipur city. Population (1901), 5,294. The town contains a lower primary vernacular school attended by 35 boys, and two elementary indigenous schools.

Up to 1905 the State was under the political control of the Central Provinces. The eastern portion of the State consists of a mass of hill and jungle, but to the west and north there is open and fertile\ncountry. The total area is 1,988 square miles, and the capital is Deogarh. The only important river is the Brahmani, which flows through a small strip on the eastern border. Wild elephants are found in the State. The ruling family are Gang\u0101bansi R\u0101jputs. They have a genealogy dating back to A.D. 1602; and according to their traditions the first R\u0101j\u0101 of B\u0101mra belonged to the royal family of Patn\u0101 State, and was stolen from his home and made king of B\u0101mra by the Bhuiy\u0101s and Khonds. The late R\u0101j\u0101, Sir S\u016bdhal Deo, K.C.I.E., was a gentleman of advanced education and enlightened views who did much to improve his State. He died in 1903 and was succeeded by his son, R\u0101j\u0101 Tribhuvan Deo. The relations of the State with Government are controlled by a Political Agent subordinate to the Commissioner of Orissa. The population in 1901 numbered 123,378 persons, showing an increase since 1891 of 18 per cent. About 77 per cent. of the population speak Oriy\u0101 and 18 per cent. the Oraon and Mund\u0101r\u012b dialects. As is shown by the language, the population is mainly Oriy\u0101, Ch\u0101s\u0101s, Kis\u0101ns, Gabr\u0101s, and G\u0101ndas being the most important castes numerically. There are also a number of Gonds and Bhuiy\u0101s.\n\nThe soil is light and sandy, the best quality being found under the hills. The area cultivated in 1905 was 227 square miles, or 11 per cent. of the total, having largely increased during the last decade. The principal crops are rice, til, and castor, about 140 square miles being always under rice. There are 974 irrigation tanks. The State forests cover 1,734 square miles, and contain valuable sal timber (Shorea robusta), which has only been exploited within recent years. Saw-mills have been established at Sirid, 20 miles from Deogarh, at which about 50,000 sleepers are at present annually produced for export. Lac, silk cocoons, catechu, and myrabolams are other forest products. The State also contains considerable deposits of iron ore and mica. At Balam, 10 miles from Deogarh, the late chief established a factory with an irrigation pump, and also flour-mills, sugar-cane-mills, and an oil-mill worked by two portable engines. There are 23 miles of metalled and 183 miles of unmetalled roads, maintained from the State funds under the direct supervision of the chief. The Bengal-N\u0101gpur Railway passes through the north-eastern corner of the State with two stations\u2014B\u0101mra Road and Garpos\u2014within its borders.\n\nThe revenue from all sources amounted in 1904 to Rs. 1,54,000, the principal items being land revenue, Rs. 68,000; forests, Rs. 16,000; and excise, Rs. 10,000. The taxation of land is about 10 annas per cultivated acre. A regular assessment has been made on the basis of soil classification. The expenditure in 1904 was Rs. 1,48,000, the principal items being the private expenses of the chief\u2019s family, Rs. 50,000; general administration, Rs. 8,200; police, Rs. 12,000; and education and medical, Rs. 5,000 each. Rs. 1,500 is paid as tribute to\nthe British Government. In 1904 the State had 28 schools with 1,005 pupils, including a high school at Deogarh. At the Census of 1901, 5,011 persons were shown as literate, all in Oriy\u0101, and 4 per cent. of the population (7\u00b76 males and 0\u00b73 females) were able to read and write. The State maintains two dispensaries, at Deogarh and Kuchind\u0101, in which nearly 19,000 cases were treated during 1904.\n\nBan\u0101s ('Hope of the forest').\u2014A river of R\u0101jput\u0101na. It rises in the Ar\u0101valli Hills (25\u00b0 3' N. and 73\u00b0 28' E.) in Udaipur, about three miles from the fort of K\u016bmbhalgarh, and after a tortuous course, generally north-east, of about 300 miles through the territories of Udaipur, Jaipur, B\u016bndi, Tonk, and Karauli, and the British District of Ajmer, falls into the Chambal (25\u00b0 55' N. and 76\u00b0 44' E.) at the holy sangam, R\u0101meswar. From its source the river flows south, till it meets the Gog\u016bnda plateau, when it turns eastward and, cutting through the outlying ridges of the Ar\u0101vallis, bursts into the open country. Here on the right bank is the famous Vaishnava shrine of N\u0101thdw\u0101ra; and a little farther on the Ban\u0101s forms for a mile or so the boundary between Udaipur and a small outlying portion of Gwalior territory, while near Hamirgarh the R\u0101jput\u0101na-M\u0101lw\u0101 Railway crosses it by a bridge. Continuing east by north-east, and still in Udaipur territory, it receives two tributaries, the Berach and Koth\u0101ri, and passing within three miles of Jah\u0101zpur, it reaches the Ajmer border. For nine miles it forms the boundary between Udaipur and Ajmer; and after a further course of five miles in the latter District it is joined by the Kh\u0101ri river, close to the village of Negria, and not far from the cantonment of Deoli. At this point it is crossed by the Nas\u012br\u0101b\u0101d-Deoli road and immediately after enters Jaipur territory.\n\nNear the picturesque village of Bisalpur, where it is joined by the Dain river, it turns first east and then south-east, and instead of flanking the Toda range of hills, forces for itself a narrow passage through them at right angles to the direction of the range, entering it at Bisalpur, and leaving it at R\u0101jmahal. At both places the torrent in flood has scoured deep holes; and in these and other pools mahseer, l\u0101nchi, and other kinds of fish are to be found. The scenery is exceedingly wild and beautiful. The hills on either side are crowned with the remains of old forts with their zigzag approaches meandering through the forest which covers them, while the old palace of the ancient rulers of R\u0101jmahal, in fair preservation notwithstanding the lapse of time, and the little village nestling at the foot of the hills on the verge of the stream, give life and character to the whole scene. Lower down the Ban\u0101s passes through an outlying portion of B\u016bndi territory, and later is for thirty miles or so a river of Tonk. On being joined by the M\u0101shi river it turns east, and passes about three miles north of Tonk city, where it is crossed by the metalled road which runs to Jaipur. Here again\nsome very fair fishing is to be had. Soon after re-entering Jaipur it is crossed by a fine bridge, constructed in connexion with the railway from Jaipur to Sawai M\u0101dhopur now in progress; and after receiving the Dhil and Morel rivers it turns south, forming for a short distance the boundary with Karauli, and as it approaches the Chambal passes through the wild hills of Ranthambhor and Kh\u0101ndhar, two ancient forts of the Jaipur State.\n\nThe river is generally impassable in flood, and there are ferries at Negria, R\u0101jmahal, and Tonk, which are required for four or five months in the year. The bed, which is generally dry in the hot months, is in the upper parts hard and rocky, but lower down there are dangerous quicksands, and the river should not be crossed by a stranger without a guide. The banks are well defined, and on an average 30 feet high, while the breadth of the channel varies from less than 100 to 1,000 yards.\n\n**Ban\u0101s.**\u2014A river of Western India, which rises in the Ar\u0101valli Hills to the north-east of Mount Abu, flows south-westwards through the P\u0101lanpur Agency past the flourishing town and cantonment of Deesa, and falls into the Rann of Cutch by two mouths, near Gokh\u0101tar in V\u0101r\u0101hi and Agich\u0101na in S\u0101ntalpur, about 170 miles from its source. It is fordable almost everywhere, and its lower course is dry in the hot season, but at times it brings down from Abu great volumes of flood-water that cover the Little Rann to a depth of 8 feet.\n\n**Banav\u0101si.**\u2014A 'twelve thousand' province, corresponding generally with the Shimoga District of Mysore, formed under the Ch\u0101lukyas (sixth century) and subsequent rulers, with its capital at Ballig\u0101ve (Belg\u0101mi in the Shik\u0101rpur t\u0101luk). Banav\u0101si, from which the province took its name, was an ancient city on the north-west border of Mysore State. It was the capital of the Kadambas from the second to the fifth century, and even later remained identified with them. It is mentioned by Ptolemy, and before that, in the third century B.C., was one of the places to which Asoka is said to have sent a Buddhist missionary.\n\n**Banav\u0101si (Vanav\u0101si).**\u2014Village in the Sirsi t\u0101luka of North Kanara District, Bombay, situated in 14\u00b0 32\u2032 N. and 75\u00b0 1\u2032 E., on the banks of the Varad\u0101 river, 14 miles from Sirsi town. Population (1901), 2,260. It was formerly a place of considerable importance, but is now merely a village. The temple to Siva, though a mean building, had once very large endowments, and is still much frequented; it contains a very fine figure of Nandi, and a table made from black granite, and in or near it are twelve inscriptions, dating from the second to the seventeenth century A.D. The car-drawing ceremony takes place here every year about March or April, and is attended by about 4,000 people, chiefly Haiga or Havik Br\u0101hmans. The name of the town is mentioned by\nPtolemy; it is also referred to in Buddhist records of the third century B.C. Banav\u0101si was the capital of the Kadamba kings until the early part of the thirteenth century. In 1220 and in 1278 the Banav\u0101si 'twelve thousand' was held by the Deogiri V\u0101davas; from the fourteenth century until 1560 it was under the Vijayanagar kings, and then passed to the Sonda chief.\n\nBancoora.\u2014District, subdivision, and town in Bengal. See Band\u0101 District.\n\nBand\u0101 District.\u2014District in the Allah\u0101b\u0101d Division of the United Provinces, lying south-west of the Jumna, between $24^\\circ 53'$ and $25^\\circ 55'$ N. and $79^\\circ 59'$ and $81^\\circ 34'$ E., with an area of 3,060 square miles. On the north and north-east the Jumna divides it from Fatehpur and Allah\u0101b\u0101d; Allah\u0101b\u0101d and the State of Rewah lie on its eastern border; the States of Pann\u0101, Soh\u0101wal, Kothi, P\u0101tharkachh\u0101r, Chaube j\u0101girs, Charkh\u0101ri, and Ajaigarh form the southern boundary; and the States of Charkh\u0101ri and Gaurih\u0101r and Ham\u012brpur District lie on the west. Band\u0101 consists of a varied country, sloping downwards from the Vindhyan range on the south and west to the valley of the Jumna on the north and north-east. The south-eastern or highest portion is composed of the sandstone hills which form the northward escarpment of the great table-land of Central India. These hills are well wooded and are arranged in a series of terraces with bold and abrupt scarps facing the north, their highest elevations being 1,300 feet above the sea. Their sides are scored by the beds of mountain torrents, which during the rainy months form affluents of the Jumna, but in the dry season gradually diminish, until by the month of May their channels are mostly empty. The Ken, B\u0101ghain, and Paisun\u012b, however, the most important among them, are never quite dry. North of this hilly region lies a tract of undulating plains, at first thickly studded with rocky isolated hills, sometimes crowned by ruined fortresses, which rapidly decrease in number and size. The plain itself, the most fertile portion of the District, is widest at its western extremity, and narrows like a wedge as it runs eastward. The Jumna valley rises by a series of terraces, broken by ravines, to the level of the table-land above.\n\nIn the greater part of the District the older rocks are concealed by the alluvium of the Gangetic plain. The northern or Bindh\u0101chal range of the Vindhyan plateau consists of Kaimur sandstone, while the southern or Pann\u0101 range is composed of the overlying upper Rewah sandstone, and the space between is made up of the Pann\u0101 and Jhir\u012b shales. Below the sandstone lies the Archaean gneiss, which is visible only in a few places.\n\nThe hills in the south-east are covered with 'reserved' forest, while the rest of the District is fairly well wooded. The flora of Band\u0101 has\nbeen fully described\\(^1\\). The characteristic feature is that it forms the northern limit of many Central and Southern Indian species, which here meet the plants of the Do\u0101b. *Ailantus excelsa* and teak are not found farther north in a wild state. The *mahua* tree (*Bassia latifolia*) is of great economic value, and is largely planted.\n\nTigers are occasionally found in the 'reserved' forest, and leopards, hyenas, wolves, and bears are more common in the same tract. *Sambar* haunt the forests, and antelope are common in the plains, while wild hog abound in many parts. Sand-grouse, partridges, quail, duck, teal, and geese are the commonest game-birds. Fish, including small mahseer and Indian trout, abound in the Ken, B\u0101ghain, and Paisuni, and many kinds are common in the Jumna. The crocodile and the porpoise are also found in several rivers.\n\nThe cold season is less intense than in the neighbouring Districts of the Do\u0101b, frost being rare. The hot season commences in the middle of March, and is distinguished by the absence of dust-storms and comparative clearness of the atmosphere. The heat soon becomes intense and lasts till late in October. The climate is unhealthy for both Europeans and natives, and deaths from exposure to the sun are unusually frequent.\n\nThe annual rainfall averages more than 40 inches, but the west of the District receives less than the south near the hills and the east near the Jumna. Large variations from the average are frequent. In 1894 the rainfall was about 82 inches, and in 1896 only 18 inches.\n\nAccording to tradition, R\u0101ma and S\u012bt\u0101 during their exile stayed a while at Chitrak\u016b\u1e6d. The history of the District is that of Bun-\n\n**History.** South of Band\u0101 stands the magnificent hill fortress of K\u0101linjar, one of the chief strongholds of the Chandels, who ruled from about 850 till the rise of Musalm\u0101n influence. About 1182 Prithvi R\u0101j of Delhi defeated Parm\u0101l Deva, the last great Chandel ruler, and in 1203 the Chandels were finally overthrown by Kutb-ud-d\u012bn, and became petty R\u0101j\u0101s. Mew\u0101t\u012bs and Bhars then overran the country, and its history for several hundred years is scanty. Though the Muhammadans had overthrown the ruling dynasty, they never acquired a firm hold, and Sher Sh\u0101h lost his life at the siege of K\u0101linjar in 1545. Under Mughal rule the District formed part of the *S\u016bbah* of Allah\u0101b\u0101d; but early in the eighteenth century the Bundel\u0101s, whose power hitherto had not extended permanently as far east as Band\u0101, took K\u0101linjar, and Chhatar S\u0101l, their leader, was recognized by Sh\u0101h Alam Bah\u0101dur as ruler of Bundelkhand. Contests with the imperial troops under Muhammad Kh\u0101n, the Bangash Naw\u0101b of Farrukh\u0101b\u0101d, who was governor of Allah\u0101b\u0101d, led to the calling in of the Mar\u0101th\u0101s, and by the middle of the eighteenth\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) M. P. Edgeworth in *Journal, Asiatic Society of Bengal*, vol. xxi.\ncentury the Bundel\u0101 dominions gradually split up into small states. Internal dissensions favoured the extension of Mar\u0101th\u0101 power, and in 1776 British troops marched south from K\u0101lp\u012b against the intruders. During the rest of the century misrule increased; and the Mar\u0101th\u0101s overran B\u0101nd\u0101 under Ali Bah\u0101dur, an illegitimate son of the Peshw\u0101 B\u0101j\u012b Rao, in alliance with Himmat Bah\u0101dur, a religious mendicant who had turned soldier. Ali Bah\u0101dur fell at a siege of K\u0101linjar in 1802. The District was ceded to the British by the Treaty of Poona in 1803; but Shamsher Bah\u0101dur, son of Ali Bah\u0101dur, and several independent chiefs had to be reduced. Himmat Bah\u0101dur, on the other hand, yielded and received a large j\u0101g\u012br along the Jumna, which lapsed to the British shortly after. The District remained quiet under British rule, but its fiscal history, which will be related later, was unfortunate.\n\nOn the outbreak of the Mutiny in May, 1857, the ignorant inhabitants were easily incited to revolt by the Cawnpore and Allah\u0101b\u0101d mutineers. The 1st Native Infantry seized on the magazine and public buildings at B\u0101nd\u0101, and were joined by the troops of the Naw\u0101b. Until June 14 every effort was made by the British residents to retain the town, but on that date it was abandoned. The Naw\u0101b of B\u0101nd\u0101, a descendant of Ali Bah\u0101dur, whose name he bore, then put himself at the head of the rebellious movement. The Joint-Magistrate of Karwi, Mr. Cockerell, was murdered at the gate of the Naw\u0101b\u2019s palace on June 15. The rural population, with a few notable exceptions, rose en masse, and a period of absolute anarchy followed. The Naw\u0101b attempted to organize a feeble government; but his claims were disputed by other pretenders, and he was quite unable to hold in check the mob of plunderers whom the Mutiny had let loose upon the District. The fort of K\u0101linjar, however, was held throughout by the British forces, aided by the R\u0101j\u0101 of Pann\u0101. The town of B\u0101nd\u0101 was recovered by General Whitlock on April 20, 1858.\n\nThe most striking remains in B\u0101nd\u0101 District are contained in the great fort of K\u0101linjar; but Chandel temples have survived in many places, and the fort of Marph\u0101 also deserves mention. The town of K\u0101linjar contains a few Muhammadan buildings, and the Mar\u0101th\u0101s have left some memorials at B\u0101nd\u0101 and Karwi. Stone implements have been found at several places in or near the hills, and are collected in many village shrines. A few caves contain ancient rude drawings.\n\nThere are 5 towns and 1,188 villages. The population, which had been increasing steadily, received a sudden check in the disastrous series of years from 1892 to 1897. The numbers at the last four enumerations were as follows: (1872) 697,684, (1881) 698,608, (1891) 705,832, and (1901) 631,058. B\u0101nd\u0101 is divided into eight tahs\u012bls\u2014B\u0101nd\u0101, Pailani, Baber\u016b, Kamasin, Mau, Karwi, Badaus\u0101, and Girw\u0101n\u2014the head-quarters of each\nbeing at a town of the same name. The principal towns are the municipality of B\u0101nd\u0101, the District head-quarters, and Karw\u012b, the head-quarters of a tahsil and subdivision. The following table gives the chief statistics of population in 1901:\n\n| Tahsil | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|--------|---------------------|-----------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| B\u0101nd\u0101  | 427                 | 1               | 113      | 98,574     | 231                       | -12.7                                                       | 4,548                                  |\n| Pail\u0101n\u012b| 362                 | ...             | 121      | 80,524     | 222                       | -9.1                                                        | 2,319                                  |\n| Baber\u016b | 363                 | ...             | 121      | 77,395     | 213                       | -19.6                                                       | 1,674                                  |\n| Kam\u0101sin| 358                 | ...             | 169      | 78,773     | 220                       | -5.4                                                        | 1,953                                  |\n| Mau    | 316                 | 1               | 164      | 64,921     | 205                       | -11.9                                                       | 2,411                                  |\n| Karw\u012b  | 567                 | 2               | 189      | 78,410     | 138                       | -10.6                                                       | 2,912                                  |\n| Badaus\u0101| 333                 | ...             | 132      | 74,755     | 224                       | -4.1                                                        | 1,881                                  |\n| Girw\u0101n | 334                 | 1               | 179      | 77,706     | 233                       | -9.1                                                        | 1,950                                  |\n| District total | 3,060 | 5               | 1,188    | 631,058    | 209                       | -10.6                                                       | 19,648                                 |\n\nAbout 94 per cent. of the population are Hindus and less than 6 per cent. Musalm\u0101ns. As in all the Bundelkhand Districts, the density of population is less than half the Provincial average. Eastern Hindi is the prevailing language; but it is much mixed with the Bundeli dialect of Western Hindi. Various dialects are recognized locally, such as Kundr\u012b, T\u012brh\u0101r\u012b, Gahor\u0101, and Jur\u0101r.\n\nCham\u0101rs (leather-workers and cultivators), 98,000, are the most numerous Hindu caste. The following are also important: Br\u0101hmans, 92,000; Ahirs, 59,000; R\u0101jputs, 49,000; Koris (weavers), 28,000; and Kurmis, 24,000. The Kols, a jungle tribe more common in Central India, number 5,700; and the Dom\u0101rs, a depressed labouring caste, 5,000. Among Musalm\u0101ns the Shaikhs number 17,000 and the Path\u0101ns 8,000. Agriculture supports 70 per cent. of the population, and general labour 6 per cent. Br\u0101hmans, R\u0101jputs, and Kurmis are the chief holders of land; and the same castes, together with K\u0101chh\u012bs and Ah\u012brs, are the principal cultivators.\n\nIn 1901 there were 147 native Christians, of whom 82 were Anglicans, 30 Presbyterians, and 11 Methodists. The Society for the Propagation of the Gospel Mission commenced work about the time of the Mutiny, and a missionary has been stationed at B\u0101nd\u0101 town since 1873. The American Methodist Mission has two branches in the District.\n\nLike the whole of Bundelkhand, B\u0101nd\u0101 is specially liable to fluctuations in agricultural prosperity, and cultivation advances or declines in alternate cycles. The prevailing soils differ considerably in composition and fertility. M\u0101r is a rich black soil, which can be easily tilled in favourable seasons and is often very fertile. It is retentive of moisture and can thus, with ordinary\nrain, produce wheat and other spring crops without irrigation. An excess or too great deficiency of rain makes m\u0101r unworkable. Kabar is stiffer and more difficult to work than m\u0101r; and although it is also capable of producing spring crops, it is more easily rendered unworkable by variations in the rainfall. M\u0101r and kabar are found in most parts of the District, but especially in the northern plain. A red or yellow loam called puriv\u0101, resembling the ordinary loam soil of the Do\u0101b, occurs in many parts. Where the surface is uneven, and especially near the ravines and watercourses which drain into the larger rivers, the natural soil is deprived of its more fertile constituents, and produces only a scanty autumn harvest. The level tracts in the beds of the larger rivers, called tar\u012b or kachh\u0101r, often consist of very fertile alluvium. Near the hills, and on the Vindhyan terraces, a thin layer of red soil is found, which soon becomes exhausted by cultivation. One of the greatest difficulties which the cultivator has to contend with is the growth of a coarse grass called k\u0101ns (Saccharum spontaneum), which spreads rapidly. The spring crops are also liable to be attacked by rust in damp and cloudy cold weather.\n\nAt cession the prevailing tenure was ryotw\u0101ri, which under the policy adopted became pattid\u0101ri and bhaiy\u0101ch\u0101r\u0101, with a variety of the latter known as bhej bar\u0101r. The transfers of property during the early period of British rule led to an increase in zamind\u0101ri villages, which are gradually disintegrating into pattid\u0101ri, though they still include nearly half the estates in the District. A peculiar tenure, named pauth, exists, chiefly in alluvial land, in accordance with which a plot of land passes in annual succession to a different co-sharer or cultivator. The privilege of cultivating land on payment of revenue rates and not rent rates has also survived. The main agricultural statistics for 1903\u20134 are shown below, in square miles:\n\n| Tahsil | Total | Cultivated | Irrigated | Cultivable waste |\n|--------|-------|------------|-----------|-----------------|\n| B\u0101nd\u0101  | 427   | 207        | 1         | 140             |\n| Pail\u0101ni| 362   | 188        | ...       | 89              |\n| Baber\u016b | 363   | 189        | 1         | 116             |\n| Kam\u0101sin| 358   | 205        | ...       | 83              |\n| Mau    | 316   | 132        | 1         | 105             |\n| Karwi  | 567   | 126        | 3         | 187             |\n| Badaus\u0101| 333   | 165        | 1         | 92              |\n| Girw\u0101n | 334   | 168        | 2         | 93              |\n| **Total** | **3,060** | **1,380** | **9**     | **905**         |\n\nNote.\u2014Statistics for the B\u0101nd\u0101 and Pail\u0101ni tahsils are for 1902\u20133.\n\nThe chief food crops, with their areas in 1903\u20134, were gram (519 square miles) and jow\u0101r (299), covering 38 and 22 per cent., respectively, of the net cultivated area; rice, wheat, bajra, and barley are\nalso of importance. Oilseeds (137 square miles) and cotton (75 square miles) are the principal non-food crops.\n\nAs in the other Bundelkhand Districts, there has been no improvement in agricultural practice in B\u0101nd\u0101. The area under cultivation varies considerably. Attempts have been made to eradicate k\u0101ns by a steam-plough and by flooding; but the former method was too costly, and the latter is difficult owing to the scarcity of water. Nearly 6 lakhs was advanced under the Land Improvement and Agriculturists\u2019 Loans Acts between 1891 and 1900, of which 3\u00b74 lakhs was lent in the bad years, 1895\u20137. In the four more favourable years, 1900\u20134, the total advances amounted to Rs. 86,000.\n\nThere is one well-defined breed of cattle called Kenwariy\u0101, chiefly found along the river Ken. The cattle are small, but hardy and active, and thrive on poor food. Attempts are now being made to improve the strain. A little horse-breeding is conducted in the Pail\u0101n\u012b tahsil, and the experiment of maintaining a stallion at B\u0101nd\u0101 town has met with considerable success. The goats are of distinctly high standard, and sheep-breeding is an industry of some importance, both for wool and for supplying meat to Cawnpore and Allah\u0101b\u0101d.\n\nAt the present time there is very little irrigation in B\u0101nd\u0101, owing to the difficulty of obtaining a supply of water, and the unsuitability of m\u0101r soil for well-irrigation. The spring-level is 60 to 100 feet below the surface, and temporary wells can be made only in few places. The rivers flow in deep channels through broken country. Thus in 1903\u20134 only 9 square miles were irrigated. Wells supplied two-thirds of this, a few fields in which garden crops are grown being found in many villages. Many scattered fields, however, are kept sufficiently moist by means of small embankments, and the extension of this system is being tried. A canal, which was begun in 1903 and opened in 1906, draws its supply from the Ken by means of a dam and reservoir. It is designed to serve the tract between the Ken and B\u0101ghain rivers, and will protect an area containing 65 per cent. of the total population, in which 3\u00b73 lakhs was spent on famine relief in 1896\u20137. The estimated cost of the canal is 37 lakhs.\n\nThe forests in the south-east of the District cover an area of 114 square miles, of which 84 are \u2018reserved.\u2019 They are of small commercial importance, but serve to prevent further erosion, and supply the wants of the neighbouring villages for grazing and minor produce. Teak, bamboos, Boswellia thurifera, Buchanania latifolia, Ficus latifolia, Lagerstroemia parviflora, Odina Wodier, Sterculia urens, and Terminalia tomentosa are the principal trees.\n\nThe sandstone in the south of the District is, in places, well adapted for building, for millstones, and for other purposes. Greenstone, pipe-clay, and limestone are also worked. Iron is found and was formerly\nworked at several places; but the reservation of the forests has increased the cost of fuel. There was formerly a diamond mine in the Bindh\u0101chal range, but it has been closed.\n\nThe industries of the District are few and unimportant. Coarse cotton cloth, cotton prints, metal cooking-vessels, and rough cotton carpets are made in several places for the local market. Agate pebbles, imported from the Narbad\u0101, are cut and polished, and used for a variety of ornaments. There is a small production of silk-embroidered plush or velvet articles at Karwi. A single cotton gin at the same place employed 180 hands in 1903.\n\nThe trade of B\u0101nd\u0101 is chiefly in agricultural produce and in the few articles required by the population. In favourable years gram, millet, and wheat are largely exported. Cotton is a considerable item of export, and the produce of this District has a good reputation. Rice, sugar, tobacco, salt, and metals are the chief imports. Traffic from the greater part of the District was formerly directed towards the Jumna, and was then either carried by river, or taken to Fatehpur on the East Indian Railway; but the opening of a line through the District has partly diverted this trade, though BINDK\u012a and Cawnpore still attract a large share of the commerce of the District. B\u0100ND\u0100, KARWI, and R\u0100J\u0100PUR are the most flourishing trade centres.\n\nA branch of the East Indian Railway from Allah\u0101b\u0101d to Jubbulpore has a length of 47 miles in the south-east of the District. At M\u0101nikpur this is met by the Midland section of the Great Indian Peninsula line from Jh\u0101nsi, which passes through B\u0101nd\u0101 and Karwi. Communications have been greatly improved in recent years; and the District contains 131 miles of metalled roads, of which 56 are maintained at the cost of Provincial revenues, and 587 miles of unmetalled roads. Avenues of trees are kept up on 120 miles. The chief routes are from B\u0101nd\u0101 town to Chill\u0101 on the Jumna, from B\u0101nd\u0101 towards Saugor, and from B\u0101nd\u0101 through Karwi to M\u0101nikpur.\n\nDistress in B\u0101nd\u0101 District may be due to excess or deficiency of rain. The former causes a spread of k\u0101ns or rust, while the latter prevents cultivation. Bundelkhand suffered from famine in 1813\u20134 and again in 1819, when over-assessment aggravated the distress. A series of bad years necessitated large remissions between 1833 and 1837. In 1837\u20138, however, the people escaped more lightly than in the neighbouring Districts to the north and east. The next famine of 1869 was due to excessive rain in 1867 and a deficiency in 1868. In May, 11,000 persons were employed on relief works, and the people lost many of their cattle. The District was depressed till 1873, when there was a recovery; and\nthe drought of 1877 was beneficial, inasmuch as it checked the growth of k\u0101ns. Another period of depression commenced in 1884, when excessive rain damaged the autumn harvest for several years in succession. In 1888 the rains ceased early and k\u0101ns again spread. Remissions of revenue were given; but rust and heavy rain in 1894, and a short fall in 1895, caused actual famine. The misery of the people was completed by the failure of the rains in 1896, when B\u0101nd\u0101 suffered more than any other District in the Provinces.\n\nThe three eastern tahsils\u2014Mau, Kam\u0101sin, and Karw\u012b\u2014form a subdivision, usually in charge of a member of the Indian Civil Service, who is stationed at Karw\u012b. The Collector is assisted by a member of the Indian Civil Service and by three Deputy-Collectors recruited in India, and a tahsild\u0101r is stationed at the head-quarters of each tahsil. The Ken Canal, completed in 1906, is now in charge of an Executive Engineer.\n\nThe District Judge and Sub-Judge of B\u0101nd\u0101 exercise civil jurisdiction throughout B\u0101nd\u0101 and Ham\u012brpur Districts. The former is also Sessions Judge of both Districts, and in addition tries the sessions cases of Fatehpur. B\u0101nd\u0101 is singularly free from crime. A Special Judge is at present inquiring into the cases of estates brought under the Bundelkhand Encumbered Estates Act.\n\nAt cession most of the present Districts of B\u0101nd\u0101 and Ham\u012brpur and part of J\u0101laun were formed into a single District called Bundelkhand. This was divided into Northern and Southern Districts in 1819, B\u0101nd\u0101 forming most of the latter. Under the Mar\u0101th\u0101s the revenue system had been ryotw\u0101ri, and the assessment was a rack-rent pitched at the highest figure that could be collected. The early British assessments were fixed for short periods as usual, and at first were moderate and well distributed. From 1809, however, a period of over-taxation commenced. The revenue was enhanced nominally by 12 per cent.; but a change in currency made the increase really as much as 29 per cent. The severity of the assessments was only surpassed by the methods of collection, and corrupt native officials and speculators acquired large areas. A period of agricultural prosperity led to still larger enhancements in 1815. The mistake was partly due to excessive reliance on the existing prosperity, and to ignorance of the peculiarities of Bundelkhand soils; and it was aggravated by the policy of the time. Bad seasons, commencing in 1819, were not accepted as a sufficient reason for reduction; but in 1835 remission became absolutely necessary. In 1828 the rains failed, and by 1830 the District was reduced to a condition of almost general bankruptcy. A great part of B\u0101nd\u0101 was then taken for a time under direct management, and collections were made from the cultivators with some success. A survey was commenced in 1836, and\nin 1843-4 the first regular settlement was made; average rent rates were fixed for all the well-known classes of soil, and were applied without sufficient allowance for variations, the total demand being 16.3 lakhs. Bad seasons and rigorous administration had at last led to the sanction of a reduction of revenue when the Mutiny broke out. In 1858-9 the demand was reduced by nearly 18 per cent., and the District recovered rapidly, only to suffer again from excessive rainfall in 1867 and the following years. The next revision of settlement, which commenced in 1874, thus coincided with a period of great depression. The assessment, as usual, was based primarily on assumed rates for each class of soil; but these were modified according to the actual condition of each village. The area to which these rates were applied was not, however (except in the Karwi subdivision, which was separately settled), the actual cultivated area, but an assumed standard area which was carefully worked out for each village, and which allowed for a margin of fallow. The result was an assessment of 11.3 lakhs, which was sanctioned for twenty years only. It has already been stated that a cycle of adverse seasons commenced again in 1888. In 1893 reductions of revenue, amounting to Rs. 19,000, were made, and the settlement was extended for ten years in 1894. Deterioration was already setting in, and large reductions have been made since the famine of 1896-7. The revenue demand in 1903-4 was only 9 lakhs. The District is now under the operation of the Bundelkhand Alienation of Land Act, and in 1905 a system of fluctuating assessments was commenced.\n\nCollections on account of land revenue and total revenue have been, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 12.07  | 11.42  | 11.21  | 8.74   |\n| Total revenue  | 12.95  | 14.89  | 14.66  | 12.03  |\n\nBanda town is the only municipality in the District, but four towns are administered under Act XX of 1856. Local affairs beyond the limits of these places are managed by the District board, which in 1903-4 had an income and expenditure of 1.5 lakhs. The expenditure includes Rs. 91,000 on roads and buildings.\n\nThere are 23 police stations. The District Superintendent of police has an Assistant stationed at Karwi, and commands a force of 4 inspectors, 110 subordinate officers, and 420 constables, besides 78 municipal and town police, and 1,731 rural and road police. The District jail at Banda contained a daily average of 262 prisoners in 1903, and the jail at Karwi 32 in the same year.\n\nAllowing for the absence of towns, Banda is not very backward as\nregards literacy, compared with other Districts in the United Provinces. In 1901, 3 per cent. (5.9 males and 0.1 females) could read and write. The number of public schools rose from 142 with 3,884 pupils in 1880-1 to 149 with 4,953 pupils in 1900-1. In 1903-4 there were 172 such institutions with 6,192 pupils, including 198 girls, besides 10 private schools with 204 boys. Two schools were managed by Government, and most of the others by the District or municipal boards. Out of a total expenditure on education of Rs. 37,000, fees supplied only Rs. 2,800, the balance being met from Local funds.\n\nThere are 6 hospitals and dispensaries, with accommodation for 157 in-patients. In 1903 the number of cases treated was 38,000, including 900 in-patients, and 2,000 operations were performed. The total expenditure was Rs. 11,500, chiefly met from Local funds.\n\nAbout 21,000 persons were successfully vaccinated in 1903-4, representing a proportion of 33 per 1,000 of population. Vaccination is compulsory only in the municipality of B\u0101nd\u0101.\n\n[District Gazetteer (1874, under revision); A. Cadell, Settlement Report (excluding Karwi) (1881); A. B. Patterson, Settlement Report Karwi Subdivision (1883).]\n\nB\u0101nd\u0101 Tahsil.\u2014Western tahsil of B\u0101nd\u0101 District, United Provinces, conterminous with the pargana of the same name, lying between 25\u00b0 20' and 25\u00b0 38' N. and 79\u00b0 59' and 80\u00b0 32' E., with an area of 427 square miles. Population fell from 112,912 in 1891 to 98,574 in 1901. There are 113 villages and one town, B\u0101nd\u0101 (population, 22,565), the District and tahsil head-quarters. The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was Rs. 1,48,000, and for cesses Rs. 24,000. The density of population, 231 persons per square mile, is slightly above the District average. The Ken flows through the centre of the tahsil, which lies almost entirely in the level plain north of the Vindhyas. In 1902-3 only 1 square mile was irrigated, out of 207 square miles under cultivation. The Ken Canal, recently opened, serves part of this tahsil.\n\nB\u0101nd\u0101 Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the District and tahsil of the same name, United Provinces, situated in 25\u00b0 28' N. and 80\u00b0 20' E., near the river Ken, on the Midland section of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, and on a metalled road from Fatehpur to Saugor. Population (1901), 22,565. B\u0101nd\u0101 was a mere village till the commencement of the nineteenth century, when the Naw\u0101b, Shamsher Bah\u0101dur, settled here. Its importance was increased by its selection as head-quarters of a District, and by a flourishing trade in cotton. After the removal of the Naw\u0101b in 1858, owing to his disloyalty in the Mutiny (see B\u0101nd\u0101 District), the town began to decline, while the growth first of R\u0101j\u0101pur, and then of Karwi, has largely deprived B\u0101nd\u0101 of its principal trade. It is a straggling and ill-built town, but with clean wide streets, and contains 65 mosques, 168 Hindu, 1 Sikh, and 5 Jain temples. Besides\nthe usual public offices, there are a dispensary and stations of the Church Missionary Society and American Methodist Missions. The chief mosque is that built by Ali Bah\u0101dur, the last Naw\u0101b. Portions of the former palace are now used as public offices or as native residences. A mile from B\u0101nd\u0101 stand the ruins of a fort called Bhur\u0101garh, which was built in 1784, and stormed by British levies in 1804. B\u0101nd\u0101 has been a municipality since 1865. During the ten years ending 1901 the income and expenditure averaged Rs. 23,000. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 28,000, chiefly derived from octroi (Rs. 21,000); and the expenditure was Rs. 25,000. The only local industries are the preparation of articles made of agate, and the manufacture of lithis or staves. There are 11 schools, attended by 840 pupils.\n\n**Band\u0101.**\u2014North-eastern tahsil of Saugor District, Central Provinces, lying between 23\u00b0 53' and 24\u00b0 37' N. and 78\u00b0 40' and 79\u00b0 13' E., with an area of 704 square miles. The population decreased from 87,193 in 1891 to 72,829 in 1901. The density in the latter year was 103 persons per square mile. The tahsil contains 269 inhabited villages. The head-quarters are at Band\u0101, a village of 1,406 inhabitants, distant 19 miles from Saugor by road. Excluding 180 square miles of Government forest, 54 per cent. of the available area is occupied for cultivation. The cultivated area in 1903-4 was 227 square miles. The demand for land revenue in the same year was Rs. 67,000, and for cesses Rs. 7,000. Band\u0101 is the poorest tahsil in the District, containing a large area of hill and rock with some open plains of limited extent in the south.\n\n**Bandalike** (or Bandanike).\u2014Ruined and deserted village in the Shik\u0101rpur taluk of Shimoga District, Mysore, situated about 14\u00b0 27' N. and 75\u00b0 18' E., 16 miles from Shik\u0101rpur town. It was in the earliest times the capital of the N\u0101garakhand\u0101 \u2018seventy\u2019 province, which an inscription says was ruled by the wise Chandra Gupta. Its Pur\u0101nic name was B\u0101ndhavapura. It contains many ruined temples of large dimensions and wonderful sculpture. More than thirty inscriptions, dating from the ninth to the sixteenth century, bear records of the R\u0101shtrak\u016btas, Ch\u0101lukyas, Kalachuris, Hoysalas, Seunas, and Vijayanagar kings. The place was probably destroyed by the Muhammadans after the fall of Vijayanagar in 1565.\n\n**Bandam\u016brlanka.**\u2014Village in the Amal\u0101puram taluk of God\u0101vari District, Madras, situated in 16\u00b0 27' N. and 81\u00b0 58' E., at the mouth of the Vainateyam, a branch of the God\u0101vari, 12 miles by road from Amal\u0101puram. It is attached to Kom\u0101ragiripatnam (population, 5,757). A factory was established here early in the eighteenth century by the East India Company, but was soon abandoned.\n\n**Bandar T\u0101luk.**\u2014Taluk of Kistna District, Madras, lying between 15\u00b0 45' and 16\u00b0 26' N. and 80\u00b0 48' and 81\u00b0 33' E. Area, 740 square\nmiles; population (1901), 214,316, compared with 198,384 in 1891; demand on account of land revenue and cesses (1903-4), Rs. 6,45,000. The name is derived from bandar = 'port,' the popular appellation of Masulipatam (population, 39,507), the capital of the District and head-quarters of the taluk. The taluk also contains 191 villages. It extends from the Kistna embouchure (including the fertile island of Divi) past Masulipatam along the coast to the north. Much of this country is uncultivated, probably because of the injury done to the soil by the inundation of the sea in 1864, and consists of sandy wastes interspersed with swamps. The climate is the most equable in the District, the great heat of the summer months being tempered by sea-breezes.\n\nBandarban.\u2014Village in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, Eastern Bengal and Assam, situated in 22\u00b0 13' N. and 92\u00b0 14' E., on the banks of the Sangu river. Population (1901), 2,370. It is the residence of the Bomong chief.\n\nBandel (from bandar, 'a wharf').\u2014Suburb of Hooghly town in Hooghly District, Bengal, situated in 22\u00b0 55' N. and 88\u00b0 24' E., on the right bank of the Hooghly river, about a mile north of the town and within its municipal jurisdiction. It contains a Roman Catholic convent, said to be the oldest Christian church in Bengal. Over the gateway is a stone bearing the date 1599, which, however, records the foundation not of the present but of the original building, sacked and destroyed by the Muhammadans about the year 1629. It was rebuilt in 1660 by Gomez de Soto, and called the convent of Nossa Senhora D'Rojario; the large hall on the east of the church was added about 1820. The title on which the property is held is a farm\u00edn assigning 777 bishas of land to the community, granted by the emperor Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n in 1633 and subsequently confirmed in 1646. The Circuit House is a fine building, which was formerly the residence of the Dacoity Commissioner. Bandel is famous for its cream cheeses.\n\nBandhogarh.\u2014Old fort in Rewah State, and a place of considerable archaeological and historical importance. The fort stands on a hill, 2,664 feet above sea-level, in 23\u00b0 41' N. and 81\u00b0 3' E., and includes the neighbouring B\u0101mnia hill, also enclosed by a rampart and considered part of the fort. It is undoubtedly a place of antiquity, and was an important stronghold long before the Baghel dynasty acquired the country. Ptolemy mentions a Balantipyrgon as one of the towns of the Adeisathroi, and Cunningham has suggested that Adeisathroi is a Greek rendering of Haya Kshetra, the country of the Haihayas. Tradition assigns the early rule of this country to the Baland tribe, which would give some support to the identification, the names Balandipur and Balantipura being practically identical. In the thirteenth century it passed to the Baghelas as part of the\ndowry of the Kalachuri bride of Karan Deo Baghela, and became\nthe centre from which this clan gradually extended their sway.\nMuhammadan historians refer to it as B\u0101ndhu, and to the Baghel\nchief as R\u0101j\u0101 of B\u0101ndhu. In 1498\u20139 Sikandar Lod\u012b, annoyed at the\nR\u0101j\u0101\u2019s refusing him his daughter in marriage, invested B\u0101ndhogarh, but\nineffectually, and was obliged to retire, taking his revenge by sacking\nthe country as far as B\u0101nd\u0101. The fort was invested by Asaf Kh\u0101n\nin 1563, but the siege was raised on the intercession of other R\u0101j\u0101s at\nDelhi. In 1597 disturbances arose at B\u0101ndhogarh and R\u0101j\u0101 Patr D\u0101s\nwas sent to besiege the fort. After an investment of eight months\nand five days he took it, and subsequently became its governor.\nB\u0101ndhogarh remained a Muhammadan possession till 1658, when it\nwas restored to R\u0101j\u0101 An\u016bp Singh of Rewah. It was, however, no\nlonger the capital of the State, that position having been given to\nRewah. A curious local legend that Akbar was born here is firmly\nbelieved. Many old remains are said to exist in the neigh-\nbourhood.\n\n[A. Cunningham, Archaeological Survey of Northern India, vol. vii,\np. 22.]\n\nB\u0101ndra (W\u0101ndren, B\u0101ndora, V\u0101ndra).\u2014Town in the Salsette\nt\u0101luka of Th\u0101na District, Bombay, situated in $19^\\circ 3' N.$ and $72^\\circ 50' E.$,\non the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway, at the southern\nextremity of Salsette island, at the point where that island is connected\nwith the island of Bombay by a causeway and arched stone bridge,\n9 miles north of Bombay city. Population (1901), 22,075, including\n11,358 Hindus, 3,189 Musalm\u0101ns, 1,307 P\u0101rs\u012bs, and 6,117 Christians.\nWith a few exceptions, the Christians are descended from local\nconverts made by the Portuguese during the sixteenth and seventeenth\ncenturies. There are numerous Roman Catholic churches in Salsette,\nmany of which were destroyed by the Mar\u0101th\u0101s after conquering the\nisland in 1738. The buildings of special interest are the English\nChurch and the Chapel of Our Lady of the Mount. B\u0101ndra was con-\nstituted a municipality in 1876. The municipal receipts during the\ndecade ending 1901 averaged Rs. 71,000. In 1903\u20134 the income was\na lakh, derived chiefly from water rate (Rs. 32,000) and house and\nland tax (Rs. 22,000). In the municipal limits are included B\u0101ndra\nhill, 150 feet in height, with a flat, wooded crest, B\u0101ndra town, and the\nvillages of Naup\u0101da, Kh\u0101r, P\u0101li, V\u0101roda, Chimbai, Katwadi, M\u0101la\nSherli, R\u0101jan, and D\u0101nda. The local industries are the tapping of\npalm-trees and fishing. The Bombay municipal slaughter-house is\nsituated at the north end of the causeway. Since the opening of\nrailway communication, B\u0101ndra has become a favourite place of resort\nfor the citizens of Bombay. It possesses an orphanage and a convent\nknown as St. Joseph\u2019s. The town contains a dispensary, a high\nschool, a middle school for girls with 602 pupils, and two middle schools for boys with 575 pupils. There are also five vernacular schools, four for boys with 267 pupils, and one for girls with 119. Public conveyances ply between the station and B\u0101ndra and P\u0101li hills, where the European and P\u0101rs\u012b residents chiefly live.\n\n**Baned.**\u2014Capital of the Suket State, Punjab, situated in $31^\\circ 30' N.$ and $76^\\circ 56' E.$, 3,050 feet above sea-level. Population (1901), 2,237. The town is picturesquely situated in a valley. It was founded by Gahr\u016br Sen, R\u0101j\u0101 of Suket, after Kart\u0101rpur ceased to be the capital of the State.\n\n**Banera.**\u2014Chief town of an estate of the same name in the State of Udaipur, R\u0101jput\u0101na, situated in $25^\\circ 30' N.$ and $74^\\circ 41' E.$, about 90 miles north-east of Udaipur city, and five miles east of M\u0101ndal station on the R\u0101jput\u0101na-M\u0101lw\u0101 Railway. Population (1901), 4,261. The town is walled; and on a hill to the west, 1,903 feet above sea-level, and included within the ramparts, stand the fort and palace, the latter being one of the most imposing edifices in Mew\u0101r. The estate, which is held by one of the chief nobles, who is styled R\u0101j\u0101, includes the town and 111 villages. The income is about Rs. 88,000, and a tribute of Rs. 4,900 is paid to the Darb\u0101r. Banera has formed part of Mew\u0101r from very ancient times. Akbar took it about 1567, and during the succeeding hundred years it frequently changed hands. During the latter half of the seventeenth century, Bhim Singh, the younger son of R\u0101n\u0101 R\u0101j Singh I of Udaipur, proceeded to the court of Aurangzeb and, for services rendered, received Banera in j\u0101g\u012br and the title of R\u0101j\u0101. The fort, which was built about 1726, was taken by the R\u0101j\u0101 of Sh\u0101hpura about thirty years later, but was recovered by R\u0101n\u0101 R\u0101j Singh II and restored to its rightful owner.\n\n**Banga** (or Vanga, also called Samatata).\u2014Ancient name for the deltaic tract of Bengal, south of the Padm\u0101 river and lying between the Bh\u0101girathi and the old course of the Brahmaputra, corresponding with the southern portion of what is now known as Eastern Bengal. It was bounded on the north by the old kingdom of Pundr\u0101. The inhabitants are described in the *Raghubansa* as possessing many boats, and they are clearly the ancestors of the Chand\u0101ls, who at the present day inhabit this part of the country. This tract gave its name to the Province of Bengal.\n\n**Banga.**\u2014Town in the Naw\u0101shahr tahsil of Jullundur District, Punjab, situated in $31^\\circ 11' N.$ and $76^\\circ 0' E.$ Population (1901), 4,697. The principal trade is in sugar, manufactures of brass-ware, and carpenters\u2019 work. The municipality was created in 1867. The income during the ten years ending 1902\u20133 averaged Rs. 5,900, and the expenditure Rs. 5,700. The income in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 8,000,\nchiefly from octroi; and the expenditure was Rs. 7,200. The town possesses a vernacular middle school maintained by the municipality and a Government dispensary.\n\nBang\u0101hal.\u2014Canton of the Outer Him\u0101layas in K\u0101ngra District, Punjab, lying between $32^\\circ 15'$ and $32^\\circ 29'$ N. and $76^\\circ 49'$ and $76^\\circ 55'$ E., and separating K\u0101ngra proper from the outlying subdivision of Kul\u016b. The Dhaola Dh\u0101r divides the canton into two main valleys, the northern of which is called Bar\u0101 or Greater Bang\u0101hal, and the southern Chhot\u0101 or Lesser Bang\u0101hal. The former, with an area of 290 square miles, contains but a single village, with a few Kanet families, 8,500 feet above sea-level. The R\u0101vi river has its source in this valley, and is a considerable stream before it issues into the State of Chamba, the mountains rising steeply from its banks into peaks of 17,000 and even 20,000 feet, covered with glaciers and perpetual snow. The lower ravines contain much pine forest, and the upper slopes afford grazing for large flocks. Chhot\u0101 Bang\u0101hal is again divided by a range, 10,000 feet in height, into two glens. In the eastern, which contains eighteen scattered hamlets of Kanets and D\u0101ghis, rises the Ul river; and the western, known as Bir Bang\u0101hal, resembles the higher valleys of K\u0101ngra proper.\n\nBangalore District.\u2014District in the south-east of Mysore State, lying between $12^\\circ 15'$ and $13^\\circ 30'$ N. and $77^\\circ 4'$ and $77^\\circ 59'$ E., with an area of 3,092 square miles. It is bounded north and east by Kol\u0101r and the Salem District of Madras; west by Tumk\u016br and Mysore Districts; south by the Coimbatore District of Madras.\n\nThe main portion of the District consists of the valley of the Ark\u0101vati, with the Cauvery flowing at the southern base. The east includes the upper basin of the Ponnaiy\u0101r, the southwest a part of the basin of the Shimsha. The central, southern, and eastern parts are mostly open and undulating. Westward the country is broken and rugged, with a succession of hills, the eastern watershed of the Cauvery rising in places to lofty mountain peaks, such as Sivaganga (4,559 feet) and S\u0101vandurga (4,024 feet). The low-lying lands contain series of tanks; the uplands are often bare or covered with scrub jungle. The hills in the south, as well as S\u0101vandurga, are surrounded with forest.\n\nThe prevailing rock is gneiss, disrupted by trap seams, dikes, and large outcrops, and also by porphyritic and fine-grained granite rocks, rock crystal, amethystic smoky and milky quartz. Adularia, pink felspar, chert, corundum, chalcedony, mica, and hornblende are found. Hematitic iron ore is abundant. Nodular limestone is found in the valleys, and near K\u0101nk\u0101nhalli is a formation of industrial lime. Kaolinitic clays occur, and laterite is found as a flat capping, resting on the denuded surface of gneiss.\nThe hilly parts to the west contain many plants of the Malnad, but of smaller size, such as Sterculia, Erythrina, &c. But the greater part of the vegetation of the District is made up of plants such as Alangium Lamarckii, Heptapleurum venulosum, Cassias, Bassias, Acacias, Ficus, Bauhinias, Mangifera, Pongamia, &c. Casuarina equisetifolia is a common exotic, and Lantana Camara is spreading in rank growth.\n\nThe climate of Bangalore city is noted for its salubrity, and the tracts north and east are healthy; but the taluks traversed by the western range of hills are subject to malarious fever. The annual rainfall at Bangalore averages 35 inches. The southern taluks get more, and Nelamangala less. The wettest months are generally September and October. The average mean temperature and diurnal range at Bangalore are: in January, $69^\\circ$ and $23^\\circ$; in May, $80^\\circ$ and $22^\\circ$; in July, $74^\\circ$ and $16^\\circ$; in November, $71^\\circ$ and $17^\\circ$.\n\nTill 1004 the District was a part of the Ganga kingdom of Ganga-vadi. In the seventh century Mankunda (in the Channapatna taluk) was the royal residence, and in the eighth century M\u00e2nyapura (Manne, in the Nelamangala taluk).\n\nTraces also exist of the Pallavas in the east, and of the R\u00e2shtrak\u00fbtras in the north. The Cholas next held the District until 1116, giving it the name of Vikramachola-mandala. The Hoysalas followed until 1336, when the Vijayanagar kingdom was established. Early in the next century certain Morasu Wokkaligas from the east formed states tributary to Vijayanagar, those in this District being Yelahanka, Devanahalli, and Dod-Ballapur. Hoskote belonged to a chief in Kol\u00e2r District. Kempe Gauda, a Yelahanka chief, founded Bangalore in 1537, and his son acquired M\u00e2gadi and S\u00e2vandurga. Meanwhile, under the name of the Sivasamudram country, much of the District seems to have been subject to the chief of Ummatt\u00fbr (Mysore District), till he was put down by the Vijayanagar king in 1510. After the fall of Vijayanagar in 1565, Jagadeva R\u00e2ya, the chief of B\u00e2ramah\u00e2l (Salem District), repelled the Musulm\u00e2n attack on Penukonda in 1577, and was rewarded with territory in Mysore, his capital being fixed at Channapatna. In 1644 the District came under the rule of Bij\u00e2pur, and was given, with other neighbouring tracts, as a j\u00e2g\u00eer to Sh\u00e2hji, father of the Mar\u00e2th\u00e2 leader Sivaji. In 1687 the Mughals overran the country to the north, and formed the province of S\u00eera (Tumk\u00fbr District). At this time Bangalore was sold to the Mysore R\u00e2j\u00e2s, who by the end of the seventeenth century had gained possession of the whole District, except Hoskote and Dod-Ballapur, which were acquired soon after.\n\n1 The name is that of the island at the Falls of the Cauvery, where the chief had his fortress and the temple of his family god.\nKistvaens have been explored near J\u0101la and S\u0101vandurga, and found to contain the usual articles of pottery. A find of Roman coins at Yesvantpur in 1891 yielded silver denarii of the early emperors Augustus to Claudius. In the Museum is an inscribed stone of the end of the ninth century, brought from Beg\u016br, elaborately sculptured with a battle scene. In the Bangalore fort are the remains of Tip\u016b Sultan\u2019s palace. The inscriptions of the District have been translated and published.\n\nThe population was 842,233 in 1871, 679,664 in 1881, 802,994 in 1891, and 879,263 in 1901. The decrease in 1881 was due to the famine of 1876\u20138. By religion, in 1901 there were 767,413 Hindus, 73,944 Musalm\u0101ns, 25,705 Christians, 11,269 Animists, 837 Jains, and 95 \u2018others.\u2019 The density was 284 persons per square mile, that for the whole State being 185. Bangalore City (population, 159,046), the District head-quarters, is the only place with more than 20,000 inhabitants.\n\nThe following are the principal statistics of population in 1901:\n\n| Taluk          | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|----------------|----------------------|-----------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Bangalore      | 347                  | 4               | 367      | 264,049    | 763                       | - 2.1                                                    | 37,044                                 |\n| Nelamangala    | 272                  | 2               | 337      | 71,952     | 264                       | + 14.0                                                  | 3,544                                  |\n| M\u0101gadi         | 359                  | 1               | 334      | 76,986     | 215                       | + 19.7                                                  | 3,295                                  |\n| Dod-Ballapur   | 341                  | 1               | 342      | 74,609     | 219                       | + 13.7                                                  | 3,478                                  |\n| Devanhalli     | 235                  | 2               | 284      | 60,537     | 257                       | + 12.9                                                  | 2,792                                  |\n| Hoskote        | 272                  | 2               | 365      | 72,855     | 269                       | + 20.1                                                  | 3,094                                  |\n| Anekal         | 190                  | 3               | 202      | 60,071     | 316                       | + 9.5                                                   | 2,484                                  |\n| K\u0101lk\u0101nhalli    | 623                  | 1               | 252      | 83,577     | 134                       | + 16.3                                                  | 2,902                                  |\n| Channapatna    | 453                  | 2               | 207      | 114,627    | 253                       | + 15.4                                                  | 4,891                                  |\n\nDistrict total | 3,092                | 18              | 2,750    | 879,263    | 284                       | + 9.4                                                   | 63,434                                 |\n\nThe numerically strongest caste is the Wokkaligas or cultivators, 244,000; next, the outcaste Holeyas and M\u0101digas, 95,000 and 51,000; then Kurubas or shepherds, 39,000; Tigalas or market gardeners, 32,000; Woddas or stonemasons, and Neygi or weavers, 24,000 each. Of Ling\u0101yats there are 39,000 and of Br\u0101hmans 30,000. Among Musalm\u0101ns there are 36,000 Shaikhs, 12,300 Saiyids, and 12,000 Path\u0101ns. The nomad tribes are represented by 5,300 Koracha or Korama, and 3,800 Lamb\u0101nis. As regards occupation, 54 per cent. of the population are engaged in pasture and agriculture, 15 per cent. in the preparation and supply of material substances, 7 per cent. in unskilled labour not agricultural, and 6 per cent. in the State service.\n\nBangalore District contains more than half of the 50,000 Christians in the State of Mysore, and nearly one-third of the total are in the\nCivil an Military Station of Bangalore. Of native Christians the great majority are Roman Catholics. A chapel is said to have been built by a Dominican friar at Anekal so far back as 1400. Bangalore and Devanhalli were occupied by Jesuit priests in 1702, and K\u0101nk\u0101nhalli in 1704. A bishop resides at Bangalore, where the Roman Catholics have important educational and medical institutions, while they have formed two agricultural settlements in the District for famine orphans. The Anglican and Scottish churches are mainly for the European garrison of Bangalore, but the chaplains also visit Whitefield and Chik-B\u0101n\u0101var. For natives, the Church of England S.P.G. Mission has a church, and the Zan\u0101na Mission has a gosha hospital for females and schools. The latter has also established a gosha hospital at Channapatna. The London and the Wesleyan Missions began work among the natives, in Bangalore, in 1820 and 1822 respectively. The sphere of the former is to the east and north of the District, and that of the latter to the west and south. They have places of worship and large schools in Bangalore. The Wesleyan Mission press was for many years of great importance, but has now been removed to Mysore. The American Methodist Episcopal Mission was established in Bangalore in 1880, in the parts mostly occupied by Eurasians. There are also small communities of Baptists and Lutherans, both at Bangalore.\n\nThe prevailing soil is a fertile red loam, found in every shade from light to dark red and deep chocolate. It overlies the metamorphic granite, and varies from a few inches to several feet in depth. The darker rich red and chocolate soils are supposed to be mould weathered from the trap rocks. The decomposition of the normal gneissose rock gives the grey, sandy, and sterile soils, and the kaolinitic clays. There are a few isolated tracts of black soil, but not sufficient for the special cultivation usual in such ground.\n\nThe following are the statistics of cultivation in 1903-4:\n\n| Taluk       | Total | Cultivated | Irrigated | Forests | Cultivable waste |\n|-------------|-------|------------|-----------|---------|-----------------|\n| Bangalore   | 255   | 130        | 22        | 6       | 22              |\n| Nelamangala | 232   | 125        | 11        | 6       | 15              |\n| M\u0101gadi      | 301   | 123        | 11        | 17      | 16              |\n| Dod-Ballapur| 290   | 110        | 11        | 20      | 41              |\n| Devanhalli  | 179   | 67         | 15        | 2       | 16              |\n| Hoskote     | 210   | 75         | 19        | 6       | 12              |\n| Anekal      | 161   | 78         | 13        | 8       | 6               |\n| K\u0101nk\u0101nhalli | 591   | 141        | 2         | 197     | 7               |\n| Channapatna | 408   | 153        | 16        | 106     | 5               |\n| **Total**   | **2,627** | **1,002** | **120**   | **368** | **140**         |\n\nR\u0101gi is the principal crop. In 1903-4 r\u0101gi occupied 601 square\nmiles, rice 98, gram 91, other food-grains 107, oilseeds 36, orchards and garden produce 16, fodder crops 11. Coffee has been successfully grown in the plains, with irrigation, but the fall in prices has stopped its cultivation. Numerous private plantations have been formed of grafted mango-trees, and of casuarina for fuel.\n\nFrom 1891 to 1904, 1.37 lakhs was advanced for irrigation wells. Loans for land improvement during the eight years ending 1904 amounted to Rs. 55,000.\n\nThere are no irrigation canals, but 109 square miles are supplied from tanks and wells, and 11 from other sources. The number of tanks is 1,969, of which 402 are classed as 'major.'\n\nThe area of State forests in 1904 was 322 square miles, of 'reserved' lands 74, and of plantations 19. Teak grows, but not at its best. Casuarinas supply scaffolding poles and fuel. Sandal-wood and bamboos are important products. The forest receipts in 1903-4 were Rs. 77,000.\n\nThere are no mines. Gneissose stone is everywhere quarried for building purposes, and broken up for road-metal. Limestone is found, as well as pottery clay.\n\nBangalore city contains woollen, cotton, and silk-mills, tile and brick works, oil-mills, coffee-curing works, an iron foundry, and brass and copper works, under European management; breweries, partly under European and partly under native management; and tanneries, under Muhammadans.\n\nThe number of private looms or small works in the District is: for silk, 370; cotton, 4,647; wool, 681; other fibres, 25; wood, 92; iron, 209; brass and copper, 28; building materials, 94; oil-mills, 481; jaggery and sugar, 597.\n\nThe chief articles of commerce are grain, cloth, silk, and oilseeds. Cotton cloth and coarse woollen blankets are woven in all parts. Tape for bedsteads and cotton carpets are made at Sarjapur. Good drugged carpets are produced in Bangalore, but the demand for them is not so great as in former days. Silks of stout texture and costly patterns are also woven in Bangalore. The production of raw silk is a reviving industry; and inspectors of sericulture, trained in Japanese methods at Mr. Tata's silk farm in Bangalore, have been appointed for its improvement. Steel wire of a superior quality, for strings of musical instruments, is made at Channapatna, where also lacquered ware and toys are manufactured. Iron and steel are produced to some extent in M\u0101gadi. Oilpressing from castor, ground-nuts, and gingelly seed is general. Bangalore city is a centre for numerous industries ministering to the wants of Europeans. In addition to the city, the chief marts of trade in the District are Channapatna, Dod-Ballapur, Sarjapur, Vadigenhalli, Ty\u0101magondal, and Hindigin\u0101l.\n\nThe railway system radiates from Bangalore city, and the total length\nof railways in the District is 130 miles. The Bangalore branch of the Madras Railway, broad gauge, runs east to Jal\u0101rpet. The remaining lines, metre gauge, are the Mysore State Railway, south-west to Mysore and Nanjang\u016bd; and the Southern Mahratta Railway, north to Guntakal and north-west to Poona. A light railway, 2 feet gauge, is projected to run north to Chik-Ball\u0101pur. Provincial roads, leading to Madras, Salem, Hindupur, Bellary, Mangalore, and Cannanore, have a total length of 230 miles. The total length of District roads is 448 miles. All main roads are metalled.\n\nSince the great famine which ended in 1878, scarcity owing to failure of the rainfall has been felt in parts of the District in 1884\u20135, in 1891\u20132, and in 1896\u20137; but remedial measures were adopted, principally in providing facilities for grazing in \u2018reserved\u2019 lands, and distress was not serious.\n\nThe District is divided into nine t\u0101luks: Anekal, Bangalore, Channapatna, Devanhalli, Dod-Ballapur, Hoskote, K\u0101nk\u0101nballi, M\u0101gadi, and Nelamangala. The District is under a Deputy-Commissioner; and since 1903 the t\u0101luks have been formed into three groups under Assistant Commissioners. The groups are: Dod-Ballapur, Devanhalli, and Nelamangala, with head-quarters at Nelamangala; Bangalore, Hoskote, and Anekal, with head-quarters at Bangalore; K\u0101nk\u0101nballi, Channapatna, and M\u0101gadi, with head-quarters at Closepet.\n\nBesides the Chief Court, whose jurisdiction extends over the whole State, there are the District court and the Subordinate Judge\u2019s court, both with jurisdiction over Bangalore, Kol\u0101r, and Tumk\u016br Districts, and three Munsifs\u2019 courts. All are in Bangalore, except one Munsif\u2019s court at Dod-Ballapur. Serious crime is not common.\n\nThe land revenue and total revenue are shown below, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1830-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 8,60   | 10,62  | 12,17  | 12,29  |\n| Total revenue  | 16,74  | 22,71  | 23,17  | 24,77  |\n\nThe revenue survey and settlement were carried out in Bangalore and the west of the District between 1872 and 1879, in the north and east between 1881 and 1886, and in the south between 1891 and 1896. The incidence of land revenue per acre of cultivated area in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 1\u201310\u20133. The average assessment per acre on \u2018dry\u2019 land is Rs. 1\u20131\u20138 (maximum scale Rs. 2\u201312\u20130, minimum scale R. 0\u20131\u20130); on \u2018wet\u2019 land, Rs. 4\u201312\u201310 (maximum scale Rs. 10\u20130\u20130, minimum scale R. 0\u20137\u20130); and on garden land, Rs. 4\u201315\u20138 (maximum scale Rs. 20, minimum scale Rs. 2).\nExcluding the Civil and Military Station of Bangalore, which is under British administration, there were 13 municipal boards in 1904, and 4 Unions. The municipalities are Bangalore city, Hoskote, Dodd-Ballapur, Nelamangala, Ty\u0101mgondal, K\u0101nk\u0101nhalli, M\u0101gadi, Closepet, Channapatna, Anekal, Sarj\u0101pur, Devanhalli, and Vadigenhalli. The Unions are Yelahanka, Kengeri, S\u016blibele, and Dommasandra. Apart from Bangalore city, the total municipal income in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 37,000, and the expenditure Rs. 39,000; those of the Unions were Rs. 3,900 and Rs. 7,400. The District and t\u0101luk boards in that year had an income of Rs. 73,000 and an expenditure of Rs. 70,000, the cost of public works being Rs. 61,000.\n\nThe police force in 1903\u20134 consisted of 3 superior officers, 132 subordinate officers, and 826 constables, of whom 38 officers and 289 constables form the city police. The Bangalore Central jail has accommodation for 892 prisoners. The daily average in 1904 was 684. There are also nine lock-ups, with a daily average of seven prisoners.\n\nThe percentage of literate persons (excluding the Civil and Military Station of Bangalore) in 1901 was 20.5 in the city and 4.3 in the District (10.4 males and 0.9 females). The number of schools increased from 520 with 19,811 pupils in 1890\u20131 to 563 with 19,819 pupils in 1900\u20131. In 1903\u20134 there were 588 schools (409 public and 179 private) with 20,186 pupils, of whom 3,977 were girls. The Civil and Military Station of Bangalore contained in 1903\u20134, in addition, 117 schools (62 public and 55 private) with 6,931 pupils (4,234 male, 2,697 female), besides schools under the military authorities. The colleges are the Central, of the first grade, and St. Joseph\u2019s, of the second grade, with college classes for girls at the Sacred Heart. Of special schools, there are two industrial, one commercial, and one training school.\n\nBesides the large hospitals in Bangalore, there were 16 dispensaries in the District in 1904, at which 226,000 patients were treated, of whom 4,520 were in-patients, the beds available being 123 for men and 83 for women. The total expenditure was 1.57 lakhs.\n\nThe number of persons vaccinated in 1904 was 8,797, or only 10 per 1,000 of the population.\n\nBangalore T\u0101luk.\u2014Central t\u0101luk of Bangalore District, Mysore, lying between 12\u00b0 48\u2032 and 13\u00b0 10\u2032 N. and 77\u00b0 25\u2032 and 77\u00b0 47\u2032 E., with an area of 347 square miles. The population fell from 269,683 in 1891 to 264,049 in 1901, the decrease being chiefly due to plague. The t\u0101luk contains one city, BANGALORE (population, 159,046), the headquarters; two towns, YELAHANKA (2,437) and Kengeri (1,608); and 367 villages. Excluding the Civil and Military Station, the land revenue demand in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 1,65,000. The greater part of the t\u0101luk drains to the east into the Ponnaiy\u0101r, through two streams which\nform continuous chains of tanks. In the west a stream rising at the Bull temple, south of Bangalore, flows into the Ark\u0101vati. The southwest is rocky and hilly; the remainder is an open, well-cultivated country, undulating much towards the north-west.\n\nBangalore.\u2014The seat of government of the Mysore State, and head-quarters of the Bangalore Brigade of the Indian army, situated in $12^\\circ 58' N.$ and $77^\\circ 35' E.$, 219 miles by rail from Madras, and 692 from Bombay. Total population (1901), 159,046. It covers an area of 25 square miles, and is composed of two separate but adjacent parts: Bangalore city (the Petta, Pete, or original native town of Bangalore proper), under the Mysore State; and the Civil and Military Station (formerly called the cantonment), an 'assigned' tract under British administration through the Resident at Mysore.\n\nBangalore city has been largely extended of recent years, especially since the outbreak of plague in 1898, and now covers an area of 11 to 12 square miles, extending from the Imperial Service Lancer lines in the north to the Bull temple in the south, a distance of 7 miles, and from Cubbon Park in the east to Chamarajpet in the west, about 4 miles. The population during the last thirty years has been: (1871) 60,703, (1881) 62,317, (1891) 80,285, and (1901) 69,447; the decrease since 1891 is due to plague. Hindus number 57,000, Musalmans 8,500, and Christians 3,200; of the rest, 565 are Animists. The city is divided into nine municipal divisions: namely, Palace, Balepete, Manivartapete, Hals\u016brpete, Nagartapete, L\u0101l B\u0101gh, Fort, Basavangudi, and Mallesvaram. The municipal board is composed of a president, five other ex-officio and five nominated members, appointed by the State, and thirteen elected members. The privilege of election was granted in 1892. The income and expenditure during the ten years ending 1901 averaged 1\u00b76 lakhs. In 1903\u20134 the income was 2\u00b74 lakhs, including octroi (Rs. 55,000), house tax (Rs. 42,000), and tolls (Rs. 22,000). The expenditure was 2\u00bd lakhs, the chief items being Rs. 87,000 for public works, Rs. 35,000 for conservancy, and Rs. 33,000 for charitable grants and education.\n\nThe name is properly Bengal\u016bru, the \u016bru or 'town' of bengalu or 'beans.' The Hoysala king V\u012bra Ball\u0101la, it is said, became separated from his attendants when hunting and was benighted. Faint and weary, he came upon a solitary hut, in which was an old woman, who could give him only some bengalu or beans boiled in a little water. Sharing this humble fare with his horse, he passed the night at the hut. The incident soon became known, and the \u016bru or village which sprang up was called the Bengal-\u016bru. It was situated to the north, beyond Kodigehalli, and is now known as Old or Hale Bengal\u016bru. Bangalore was founded in 1537 by Kempe Gauda, the chief of Yelahanka, and a watch-tower at each of the cardinal points marks the limits to which it\nwas predicted it would extend, a prophecy now more than fulfilled. The first extension was Ch\u0101mr\u0101jpet, from the fort westwards, in 1892. In 1899 were added the Basavangudi extension, south from the fort, and the Mallesvaram extension, north from the city railway station. The fort, which lies south of the original town, has not been used for any military purpose since 1888. First constructed of mud, it was enlarged and built of stone in 1761, under Haidar Ali, captured by the British in 1791, subsequently dismantled by Tip\u016b Sult\u0101n, but restored in 1799. The walls have now been pierced for roads, a part pulled down, and the moat filled up, providing a site for the Victoria Hospital. The most important buildings included in the city are the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101\u2019s Palace to the north, and the range of public offices in Cubbon Park. East from the fort is the L\u0101l B\u0101gh, or State Botanical gardens, which date from the time of Haidar Ali. The Central College is the principal educational institution, and a site to the north of the city has been selected for the Indian Institute of Research for post-graduate study, founded from Mr. Tata\u2019s endowment.\n\nOn the west of the city are large spinning and manufacturing mills, woollen, cotton, and silk-mills, oil-mills and soap factory, brick and tile works; southwards, a silkworm farm under Japanese management; and to the south-west, the distillery. Near the city railway station are locomotive workshops and an iron foundry. Near the cantonment railway station are large coffee-curing works, where also artificial manures are prepared.\n\nThe water-supply, which was provided in 1896, is pure and abundant. The water is drawn from the Hesarghatta tank on the Ark\u0101vati, 13 miles to the north-west, and pumped to the top of a small hill at B\u0101navar, whence it runs by gravitation through cast-iron pipes to settling and filtering beds near the city, and thence to a subterranean reservoir at the race-course, from which it is distributed to all parts. The daily supply provided is a million gallons. The drainage of the city is collected into one main channel, which runs out from the southern side of the old town and is continued as far as the Sunnakal tank, a distance of 2 or 3 miles, where the sewage is applied to agricultural purposes. Since 1905 the city has been lighted by electricity transmitted from the Cauvery Falls at Sivasamudram, and power from the same source works the woollen and cotton-mills.\n\nThe Civil and Military Station of Bangalore adjoins the city on the east, and covers an area of 13 square miles, extending from the Residency on the west to Binnamangala on the east, about 4 miles, and from the Tanneries on the north to Agram on the south, about 5 miles. It is intended to remove the sapper lines to a new site on the north-west, which will allow of the congested parts being opened out by an extension northwards, similar measures in Bangalore city and\nMysore having virtually freed those cities from plague. The population at each Census in the last thirty years has been: (1871) 81,810, (1881) 839,540, (1891) 100,081, and (1901) 89,599. The decrease since 1891 is due chiefly to plague, but also partly to the absence of troops in 1901 at the seats of war in South Africa and China. By religion there are 51,000 Hindus, 21,500 Musalm\u0101ns, and 17,000 Christians. The cantonment was established in 1809 on the removal here of the British garrison from Seringapatam, which had proved too unhealthy for the troops. But the head-quarters were at first in the fort, where also the principal Europeans lived. The name \u2018cantonment\u2019 was applied till 1881. On the rendition of Mysore in that year, the area was made over to the British as an \u2018assigned\u2019 tract, and under the present designation became subject to the administration of the Resident.\n\nThe garrison includes three batteries of artillery, and regiments of British cavalry and infantry, Native cavalry, sappers and miners, pioneers, and Native infantry (2), mounted infantry, supply and transport corps, and mule corps. There are, besides, the Bangalore Rifle Volunteers; and, in Bangalore city, under the jurisdiction of the Darb\u0101r, the Mysore Imperial Service Lancers transport corps and the Mysore Barr infantry.\n\nThe Station municipal board is composed of 6 ex-officio and 18 non-official members, the latter being elected, with the District Magistrate as president. There are six divisions or wards: Hals\u016br (Ulsoor), Southern, East General Bazar, West General Bazar, Cleveland Town, and High Ground. The elected commissioners are so apportioned among them as to represent the several classes in each. There are thus 6 Europeans and Eurasians, 4 Muhammadans, and 8 Hindus and others. The income and expenditure during the ten years ending 1901 averaged 3\u00b72 lakhs. In 1903-4 the income was 3\u00b77 lakhs, including 2\u00b74 lakhs from rates and taxes, and Rs. 85,000 from rents and fees. The expenditure was 3\u00b75 lakhs, the chief items being 1\u00b73 lakhs for public works, and 1\u00b72 lakhs for the medical and health department.\n\nThe water-supply is drawn from the same source as for the city, namely, the Hesarghatta tank, but by an independent system of pumping-works, filter-beds, and pipes, to a reservoir on the High Ground. The daily supply is calculated at a million and a half gallons. The drainage of a large area of the Station is carried by a sewer passing through a tunnel to some distance beyond Hals\u016br, where it is applied to cultivation. The most noticeable public buildings are the Residency, the District offices, and the Bowring Institute.\n\nThe \u2018assigned\u2019 tract occupied by the Civil and Military Station is under the control of the Resident, and is provided with the various departments of administration separate from those of the Mysore State. Revenue work is performed by the Collector and District Magistrate.\nFor police there is a Superintendent, with 39 officers and 238 constables. The police jurisdiction extends also over railways (327 miles), for which purpose there are 18 additional officers and 118 men. The criminal courts include the bench of honorary magistrates, the courts of the second magistrate, who is the officer in charge of the Resident's treasury, of the Railway first-class magistrate, who is the Superintendent of railway police, of the District Magistrate, and of the Sessions Judge, who is the First Assistant Resident. The District Judge exercises civil jurisdiction, under the control of the Resident's Court, which is the High Court for the station, for both criminal and civil purposes. There is no separate jail, prisoners under sentences not exceeding one year's imprisonment being detained in the Bangalore Central jail of the Mysore State, while others are sent to jails in the Madras Presidency. The medical institutions are under the Residency Surgeon; and the educational institutions, most of which are aided (60 with 4,877 pupils), are under the departmental control of the Director of Public Instruction, Madras.\n\nThe revenue of the 'assigned' tract in 1903-4 was nearly 7\u00bd lakhs, and the expenditure exceeded 7\u00be lakhs.\n\n**Banganapalle.**\u2014One of the five Native States in political relations with the Madras Government, the Political Agent being the Collector of Kurnool. It lies between 15\u00b0 3' and 15\u00b0 29' N. and 77\u00b0 59' and 78\u00b0 22' E., on the table-land of the Southern Deccan within Kurnool District, at a height of about 800 feet above sea-level. It is bounded on the north by the R\u0101mallakota and Nandy\u0101l t\u0101luks of that District, on the east and south by Nandy\u0101l and Koilkuntla, and on the west by Pattikonda and Koilkuntla. The total area is 255 square miles. The State consists of two detached portions. The main part is a straggling area beginning at the R\u0101mpur pass over the Erramala hills on the west and extending eastwards to Banganapalle town, and thence southwards almost parallel to the Kunderu river through a tract of rich black cotton soil. The detached portion consists of three hill villages, comprising an area of about 20 square miles surrounded by part of the Koilkuntla t\u0101luk. Except the Erramalas, which skirt the country on the west, two long spurs running parallel to one another in the western portion and enclosing the valley of the Jurr\u0113ru, there are no hills of importance in the State. Even these are low and tame in appearance. The country is generally flat; but the western arm, extending from the R\u0101mpur pass to Banganapalle town, is hilly. It is also generally bare, except in the west and round Banganapalle, where the Naw\u0101b has planted groves of trees. The surface is covered with black cotton soil in the south, and in the other parts with red gravelly earth, sometimes very stony. The whole country slopes eastward to the Kunderu, and is well drained by\nthat river and the Jurreru, which are the chief streams. The Jurreru rises in the Erramalas, flows past Banganapalle town, and enters the Kunderu after a course of 45 miles. A small stream called the Paleru crosses the southern limb of the territory. The Jurreru alone, which is perennial, is used for irrigation.\n\nThe geology of Banganapalle is simple. The lowest rocks are of the Cuddapah formation, and occupy the bottom of the Jurreru valley between Banganapalle town westward and Pasupula. They consist chiefly of argillites, with intercalated trap flows of the Cheyy\u00e4r group. Resting on them is a strip of conglomerate, west of the town, which has been mined for diamonds for many generations. There are no forests yielding revenue.\n\nThe larger game include leopard, hyena, wolf, antelope, and wild hog; and the feathered game, partridge, quail, and jungle-fowl. The streams abound in fish of inferior kinds.\n\nThe climate is hot, but healthier than the surrounding portions of Kurnool District. November, December, and January are pleasantly cool and dry; February, March, April, and May are increasingly hot; in June, July, August, and September the south-west monsoon brings heavy rain and high winds. The annual rainfall averages about 30 inches. Fever is endemic, but is nowhere of a severe type.\n\nThe oldest extant title-deed of the family, which is dated in 1761, records the fact that the Niz\u0101m in that year appointed one Husain Ali Kh\u0101n as Kilad\u0101r (commandant) and Faujd\u0101r (magistrate) of Banganapalle. This document refers to the removal of one Muhammad Beg Kh\u0101n, apparently from the post given to Husain Ali Kh\u0101n; but the nature of that transaction is not indicated. It would seem, however, from the manuscript records of the family that Muhammad Beg Kh\u0101n was the great-grandfather of Husain Ali Kh\u0101n, and the adopted son of a person of the same name appointed Kilad\u0101r of Banganapalle by the Sult\u0101n of Bij\u0101pur in the last half of the seventeenth century. A document still preserved at Banganapalle bears the seal of Muhammad Beg Kh\u0101n and the date 1131 Hijra (A.D. 1718\u20139).\n\nWithin a few years the country fell under the dominion of Mysore. A translation of a letter of confirmation, dated 1783, at the beginning of Tip\u016b\u2019s reign, is preserved in the archives of the Madras Government. In this letter Tip\u016b refers to the assiduity of the recently deceased Husain Al\u012b Kh\u0101n in the Sark\u0101r affairs, and confers the j\u0101g\u012br of Banganapalle on his son Ghul\u0101m Al\u012b Kh\u0101n. As a matter of fact, it would appear that, notwithstanding this grant, Tip\u016b at once resumed the j\u0101g\u012br, and expelled Ghul\u0101m Al\u012b Kh\u0101n. Letters written by Tip\u016b in the same year summon Ghul\u0101m Al\u012b Kh\u0101n to his presence and refuse to accept his excuses for not coming. Another, dated 1790, to the Kilad\u0101r of\nBanganapalle, is addressed to one Y\u016bsuf. According to the traditions of the family, Tip\u016b\u2019s deputy was defeated in a pitched battle by Ghul\u0101m Al\u012b Kh\u0101n and his uncle Asad Al\u012b Kh\u0101n about seven years after Ghul\u0101m Al\u012b Khan\u2019s expulsion. A document is extant purporting to be an order of the Niz\u0101m, dated 1790, conferring Banganapalle on Asad Al\u012b Kh\u0101n and Ghul\u0101m Al\u012b Kh\u0101n. It is, however, of doubtful authenticity. These two persons are referred to as joint j\u0101gird\u0101rs in the correspondence of the year 1800. The present family traces its descent from Ghul\u0101m Al\u012b Kh\u0101n, who survived his uncle. In 1800, when the Niz\u0101m handed over Kurnool and the other Ceded Districts to the East India Company in exchange for a subsidiary force to be stationed in his territories, he transferred to the Madras Government his control over Banganapalle. At the same time he stipulated that, as it was the sole means of subsistence of a numerous family, the j\u0101g\u012br should be continued to Asad Al\u012b Kh\u0101n and Ghul\u0101m Al\u012b Kh\u0101n; and this was agreed to by the British representative.\n\nWhatever had been the precise relations of the j\u0101gird\u0101rs to the court of Hyder\u0101b\u0101d, the British at first neither levied tribute from them nor, as far as can be ascertained, exercised any authority over them. Indeed the j\u0101gird\u0101r as late as 1821 seemed to consider himself still dependent on the Niz\u0101m. He usually resided at Hyder\u0101b\u0101d, and civil and criminal justice were nearly at a standstill. Internal government went from bad to worse, and at times shameful disorder prevailed. Finally (1831) the j\u0101gird\u0101r was driven out of the country and took refuge in British territory. These disturbances induced the British Government to resume the j\u0101g\u012br in 1832. The Government did not at this time consider that they were pledged to its continuance, and a proclamation notifying the resumption was issued in 1835. From 1835 to 1848 the State was accordingly administered by the Madras Government. The stipulation of the Niz\u0101m for the continuance of the j\u0101g\u012br was, however, brought to notice in 1837; and the Court of Directors decided in the following year that the Niz\u0101m\u2019s stipulation entitled the holder of the estate to be treated as an hereditary j\u0101gird\u0101r, that the resumption must be cancelled, and the j\u0101g\u012br given back as soon as it was free from debt. Accordingly in 1848 it was restored to the head of the family, Ghul\u0101m Muhammad Al\u012b, grandson of Ghul\u0101m Al\u012b Kh\u0101n; and, as had been the case before 1831, he was permitted to enjoy the j\u0101g\u012br without payment of tribute and to administer its civil and criminal justice with certain restrictions. A sanad conferring these powers was issued in 1849. In 1862 another sanad was granted to him, guaranteeing that the British Government would permit any succession to the j\u0101g\u012br which might be legitimate according to Muhammedan law.\n\nGhul\u0101m Muhammad Al\u012b died in 1868, and was succeeded by his nephew Fateh Al\u012b Kh\u0101n, who received the hereditary title of Naw\u0101b\nin 1876. In consequence of his misgovernment, he was removed in January, 1905, from the direct administration of the State, which was placed under the management of an Assistant Political Agent. Fateh Ali Khan died three months later, and was succeeded by his son Saiyid Ghulam Ali Khan, thirty-one years of age, who had been educated privately at Banganapalle and Kurnool. His succession has been recognized, but he has not yet received a sanad, and the Assistant Political Agent meanwhile continues to conduct the administration.\n\nThe number of villages in the State is 63, and there are no towns. The population was 45,208 in 1871, 30,754 in 1881, 34,596 in 1891, and 32,264 in 1901. It will be seen that the State has not yet regained the inhabitants lost during the great famine of 1876\u20138, and that even the last decade shows a decline. Banganapalle town was formerly a place of some importance, owing to its position on the main road from Gooty to Cumbum; but it has declined greatly since the opening of the Southern Mahratta Railway, and its present population is less than 4,000.\n\nThough the density of the population is a little higher than in the surrounding District of Kurnool, the State is most sparsely peopled, there being only 127 persons per square mile against an average of 270 for the Presidency. The ruler is a Muhammadan; but the majority of the population are Hindus, who number 25,735, or nearly 80 per cent. of the total. The Muhammadans come next, being 6,232, or 19 per cent.; many of them live in Banganapalle town. The Christians number only 297, and there are no missions in the State. Telugu is the prevailing language, being spoken by 81 per cent. of the population, and Hindustani is more prevalent than in Kurnool, being the vernacular of 17 per cent.\n\nThe Kapus, the chief agriculturist caste of the Telugu country, are the most numerous community among the Hindus, forming nearly 21 per cent. of the total. Next in order come the Malas and Madigas, who correspond to the Paraiyans and Chakkiliyans of the south. The Gollas (shepherds) number 2,421, and the Boyas or hunting caste 2,286.\n\nAmong Musalmans, the Shaikhs are the most numerous tribe, being 77 per cent. of the total. Next come the Saiyids, who number 16 per cent. The Musalmans in the State are mostly Sunnis, though the Nawab himself is a Shia. The Christian population consists almost wholly of natives.\n\nThe general agricultural conditions and practice differ but little from those in the neighbouring British taluks of Kurnool District. The chief food-grains grown are cholam (Sorghum vulgare), cambu (Pennisetum typhoideum), ragi (Eleusine coracana), rice, korra (Setaria italica), and wheat. Bengal gram is the most\nimportant of the pulses, and cotton is the most widely cultivated industrial crop.\n\nNo accurate statistics are available of the total area of the State, or of the forest, arable, occupied, and cultivated areas. The Naw\u0101b had the j\u0101g\u012br surveyed recently by a British survey party working under the Deputy-Superintendent of Revenue Survey, Kurnool. The total area, excluding hill blocks, was found to be 218 square miles, but further details are not available. The total occupied area is returned as 74,284 acres, of which 72,333 acres are 'dry' land, 1,277 acres 'wet,' and 674 acres garden. These figures include 21,870 acres of sub-j\u0101g\u012brs which till recently were enjoyed as estates by the relations of former Naw\u0101bs. No reliable statistics of cultivation exist.\n\nThere are no irrigation works of importance. About twenty dams are periodically constructed across the Jurreru and water is diverted to small tanks. Only one tank is of any importance, but a good deal of cultivation is supplied by wells sunk on the banks of the Jurreru.\n\nLime is found at Palk\u016br and among the hills. Many years ago, copper is said to have been obtained; and quite recently a Madras merchant stated that he had found traces of copper and coal and diamond shale, and he has obtained a lease for the mining of these over 18 square miles. About a mile to the east of Banganapalle town is a small diamond mine, which formerly yielded some stones but is not worked now. The revenue from diamonds is estimated at Rs. 2,300 in the schedule to the sanad of 1761.\n\nThe principal exports are cholam, ghi, skins, mangoes, oranges, and lacquer-ware. For the last three of these the town of Banganapalle is noted. The principal imports are rice, sugar, cloths, salt, jaggery (coarse sugar), and kerosene oil.\n\nThe only roads are the R\u0101mpur pass, over the Erramalas, running from west to east through the heart of the State, and the Paniem-Owk connecting the Paniem railway station with Banganapalle town. These two join within a mile of Banganapalle. The former was constructed by the Kurnool District board, and was once an important trade route between the east coast and the Districts of Anantapur and Bellary. It crosses the Nallamalais by the Nandikanama pass and the Erramalas by the R\u0101mpur pass. It is now very little used and consequently neglected. The other road was constructed by the Naw\u0101b to connect his capital with Paniem railway station, which is 17 miles distant, and was continued to the south to link it with the Owk-T\u0101dpatri frontier road. It is maintained in good condition. The total length of the roads is 53 miles, but they have till now been very badly maintained. A road cess is levied for the purpose.\nThe State is situated within the famine zone of the Presidency and suffered severely in the great distress of 1876\u20138. It was also affected by all the other bad seasons which have afflicted Kurnool.\n\nThe administration was till recently conducted by the Naw\u0101b in person with the assistance of a Diw\u0101n, who was an officer in the British service with a salary of Rs. 250 a month. The removal, at the beginning of 1905, of the Naw\u0101b from the direct management of the j\u0101g\u012br and the temporary substitution of an Assistant Political Agent have already been mentioned. The latter is now administering the State personally without a Diw\u0101n. He is assisted by a tahsild\u0101r, who is responsible for the revenue administration.\n\nThere are two civil courts, called the Ad\u0101lat Court and the Sadr Court. The former is presided over by a Munsif, who is empowered to decide suits up to the value of Rs. 3,000. Original suits above that amount should only be filed in the Sadr Court, which used to be presided over nominally by the Naw\u0101b, but in practice by the Diw\u0101n. The Assistant Political Agent is now president. All appeals from the Munsif\u2019s decisions lie to this court. No special authority exists by which the civil courts exercise power over natives of British India or European British subjects.\n\nTwo courts exist for the administration of criminal justice: namely, the magistrate\u2019s court and the Sadr Court. The former is presided over by a magistrate, who is empowered to award imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year, a fine not exceeding Rs. 500, and whipping up to twelve stripes. The Sadr Court, presided over formerly by the Naw\u0101b or Diw\u0101n but now by the Assistant Political Agent, is both a Court of Session and an Appellate Court to which appeals from the magistrate\u2019s decisions are preferred. The powers of the Sadr Court are unlimited, except that sentences of mutilation are absolutely prohibited and that capital sentences must be confirmed by the Government of Madras.\n\nThe law relating to offences and criminal procedure which applies in British India is followed in Banganapalle. The powers of the courts are absolute, subject to the limitations mentioned above, as regards natives of the State and natives of British India who have committed offences and remain in the State. As regards natives of India who have escaped into British territory after committing offences in the State, the Political Agent may either certify that the case should be prosecuted in British India or surrender the accused to the Banganapalle authorities for trial in that State, subject to certain exceptions. The Banganapalle criminal courts cannot exercise any authority over European British subjects. Except housebreaking and theft, grave crime is not prevalent.\nNo laws and regulations have been framed by the Naw\u0101b separately for the State. The Indian Penal Code and the Civil and Criminal Procedure Codes of British India are in force, having been adopted by the Naw\u0101b as laws of the State, and other British enactments are similarly adopted as occasion requires.\n\nAs regards salt, the Naw\u0101b has undertaken absolutely to prohibit the manufacture of earth-salt in his State on receipt of an annual compensation of Rs. 3,000. No opium is grown, and the Naw\u0101b gets his supply from Madras on licences countersigned by the Political Agent. He has his own arrangements for the administration of the \u0101bk\u0101ri revenue. The import of spirits manufactured in the State into British territory is prohibited. Toddy may, however, be imported from Banganapalle on payment of one anna per gallon by a fixed route, on which there is a chauki or customs station. Until 1904 the Naw\u0101b controlled his own g\u0101nja revenue; but he has since agreed to prohibit absolutely g\u0101nja cultivation, in return for an annual payment of Rs. 3,060 as compensation.\n\nThe Naw\u0101b administers his own stamp revenue, adopting the Indian Stamp Act as his model. There are no telegraphs in the State. The State post office was amalgamated with the British postal system on January 1, 1900, when the Naw\u0101b issued a regulation applying the provisions of the Indian Post Office Act to Banganapalle. The only post office is at Banganapalle town.\n\nGhul\u0101m Ali Kh\u0101n, the sole j\u0101gird\u0101r after 1815, made a settlement in 1820 with a view to prevent future disputes among his relatives, by which he assigned certain villages (called sub-j\u0101girs) to each of his cousins and other members of the family. These sub-j\u0101girs were, from the beginning, resumable at will; they were resumed under the Government management of 1835\u201348, were granted again when the estate was restored, and have recently (1905) been finally resumed by the Madras Government. The sub-j\u0101gird\u0101rs owned twenty-eight villages, and generally enjoyed the land revenue without paying any peshkash to the Naw\u0101b.\n\nVery little is known of the land revenue history of the rest of the State. The rates of assessment are not settled, but vary with the will of the Naw\u0101b. To remove the present uncertainties of tenure and land assessment and to place the land revenue administration upon a satisfactory and intelligible basis, the late Naw\u0101b, as already mentioned, recently had the State surveyed by a British survey party and contemplated introducing a revenue settlement.\n\nThe total revenue in 1904\u20135 amounted to Rs. 96,000, of which Rs. 21,700, or nearly one-fourth, was made up of deposits and loans. Of the remainder, land revenue contributed Rs. 24,000; salt, excise, mohtarfa, and stamps, Rs. 23,500; Rs. 9,200 was received from\nmiscellaneous sources, and Rs. 5,000 and Rs. 3,200 from road cess and forests respectively. The total expenditure amounted to 1\u00b72 lakhs, of which Rs. 62,500, or more than one-half, was incurred on account of the Naw\u0101b\u2019s household and family. The next considerable item is the establishment, which cost Rs. 23,100, or a little less than one-fifth. About Rs. 12,000 was given by way of pensions in lieu of sub-jagirs.\n\nThe police force consisted in 1904\u20135 of 5 head constables, 59 constables, and one bugler, assisted by 131 talaiy\u0101ris. There are five police stations. A jail is maintained at Banganapalle, the local medical officer being ex-officio superintendent.\n\nEducation is very backward. The State maintains two schools, one of which teaches up to the first and the other up to the fourth standard. In 1904\u20135 the number of pupils was 120 (all boys), and the cost to the State was Rs. 1,022. Some village schools are maintained in rural tracts, but no statistics are available regarding them.\n\nThe State possesses only one hospital, at Banganapalle town. The total number of cases treated in 1904\u20135 was 13,169; 106 surgical operations were performed, and the expenditure was Rs. 2,535.\n\nThe number of children vaccinated in 1904\u20135 was 763, of which only 621 cases, or 19 per 1,000 of the population, were successful. The results are unsatisfactory when compared with those of the adjoining British territory, where the corresponding figure was 25\u00b76 per 1,000.\n\nB\u0101ngang\u0101.\u2014An old bed of the Ganges in Benares and Gh\u0101zipur Districts, United Provinces.\n\nB\u0101ngang\u0101 ('Arrow-river').\u2014A hill stream rising in the south of Nep\u0101l (27\u00b0 42\u2032 N., 83\u00b0 6\u2032 E.), which flows for about 18 miles through Bast\u012b District and joins the B\u016brh\u012b R\u0101pti ('old' R\u0101pti) at Kabrah\u012b Gh\u0101t, where the road from Bast\u012b through B\u0101nsi to Nep\u0101l crosses the latter river. Timber from Nep\u0101l is floated down. Traces of the bed of another river of the same name still exist south of the R\u0101pti and the upper course of the Katnehi\u0101. A tributary of the Kuw\u0101n\u0101 in Bast\u012b, which formed one branch of this, is still called B\u0101ngang\u0101.\n\n[Cunningham, Archaeological Survey Reports, vol. xxii, p. 4.]\n\nB\u0101ngang\u0101 (or Utangan).\u2014A river of Northern India, rising in Jaipur territory near Bair\u0101t (27\u00b0 24\u2032 N. and 76\u00b0 10\u2032 E.). It flows, generally in an easterly direction, through the States of Jaipur, Bharatpur, and Dholpur, and the District of Agra in the United Provinces, and after a course of about 235 miles joins the Jumna 10 miles east of Fateh\u0101b\u0101d in Agra District.\n\nThe word B\u0101ngang\u0101 (V\u0101nagang\u0101) means literally 'arrow river.' The story goes that the five P\u0101ndava brothers, on going into hiding at Bair\u0101t (Vair\u0101ta), concealed their sacred weapons in a tree, and swore that before using them again they would purify them by washing them\nin the Ganges. One of the brothers, Arjun, had occasion to use his weapons against the Kurus. The Ganges being far off, he shot an arrow into the ground, and immediately a spring of the sacred Ganges water issued, which became the source of the B\u0101ngang\u0101.\n\nBetween 1848 and 1856 small irrigation works were made in Agra District and in Bharatpur State; but these had the effect of diverting the course of the B\u0101ngang\u0101, and did so much damage that in 1864 the works in Agra were totally closed, and in 1869 operations were undertaken in Bharatpur to bring back the river to its old course. Near the village of Gop\u0101lgarh in the R\u0101mgarh hills, about 25 miles below the source, the waters of the river are impounded by a dam 80 feet in height to form the R\u0101mgarh reservoir, the most important irrigation work in the Jaipur State. This lake when full covers an area of six square miles, and can under exceptional circumstances contain 3,000 million cubic feet of water; but ordinarily about half this quantity, or sufficient to irrigate more than 13,000 acres, is impounded. The project is practically complete and has cost nearly five lakhs of rupees. Some smaller works have been carried out in the Bharatpur State. R\u0101mgarh is said to have once been the capital of the Jaipur State under the name of M\u0101shi; there is a temple in the gorge called Jumwa Dev\u012b which is visited by the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101s of Jaipur on their accession to the gaddi. Here they are shaved, the process being part of the ceremony connected with the accession.\n\nThe stream in the gorge near R\u0101mgarh is perennial, but lower down the bed dries up except during the rains. The banks are for the most part low, and in Bharatpur are covered, often to a distance of two or three miles from the stream, with a dense growth of jungle grass and tamarisk. In Dholpur territory ravines run inland from either bank, sometimes for a distance of two miles or more. Where it first touches the United Provinces, the B\u0101ngang\u0101 is a mountain torrent with a bed of sand mixed with gravel. The principal tributaries are the Gambh\u012br, Kaw\u0101r or Koela, and P\u0101rvat\u012b on the right bank, and the Kh\u0101r\u012b on the left. The B\u0101ngang\u0101 and Kh\u0101r\u012b often bring down disastrous floods. In Bharatpur the violence of these has given the river the name of Ghora-pachh\u0101r or \u2018overthrower of horses.\u2019\n\n[Papers relating to the Irrigation of the Agra District from the Utangan River (Roorkee, 1853\u20134).]\n\nBangaon Subdivision.\u2014Western subdivision of Jessore District, Bengal, lying between 22\u00b0 52\u2032 and 23\u00b0 26\u2032 N. and 88\u00b0 40\u2032 and 89\u00b0 2\u2032 E., with an area of 649 square miles. The population in 1901 was 317,352, compared with 330,201 in 1891. It is a land of semi-stagnant rivers, the soil is comparatively poor, and the subdivision is more thinly populated (489 persons to the square mile) than the rest of the District. It contains one town, Mah\u0113spur (population, 4,180),\nand 798 villages, including Bangaon, the head-quarters. The principal marts are at Bangaon and Mahespur.\n\n**Bangaon Village.**\u2014Head-quarters of the subdivision of the same name in Jessore District, Bengal, situated in $23^\\circ 3' N.$ and $88^\\circ 50' E.$ on the Ich\u0101mat\u012b. Population (1901), 3,660. Bangaon is a station on the central section of the Eastern Bengal State Railway, and is also connected with the eastern section of that railway by a branch to R\u0101n\u0101gh\u0101t. It contains the usual public offices; the sub-jail has accommodation for 12 prisoners.\n\n**B\u0101ngarmau.**\u2014Town in the Safipur tahsil of Unao District, United Provinces, situated in $26^\\circ 54' N.$ and $80^\\circ 13' E.$, near the Kaly\u0101ni river, and on the road from Unao town to Hardoi. Population (1901), 6,051. About two miles away are a number of ancient mounds called Nawal, which have been identified with the ruins of a place visited by Hiuen Tsiang. Tradition relates that a Saiyid from Kanauj came to Nawal and was inhospitably received, whereupon he cursed the R\u0101j\u0101 and his people and the town perished, after which B\u0101ngarmau was founded. The tomb of the saint, whose name was Al\u0101-ud-din, bears an inscription dated in 1302, and another tomb was erected in 1374 by Firoz Sh\u0101h Tughlak. B\u0101ngarmau lies at the crossing of two old thoroughfares, the road from Kanauj to Fyz\u0101b\u0101d and Jaunpur, and the road from Delhi to Benares on the north bank of the Ganges. It is administered under Act XX of 1856, with an income of about Rs. 1,000. There is little trade now, but a market is held twice a week. There is a school with 90 pupils.\n\n**B\u0101niy\u0101chung.**\u2014Village in the Habiganj subdivision of Sylhet District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, situated in $24^\\circ 31' N.$ and $91^\\circ 21' E.$ It is the largest village in Assam; population (1901), 28,883. It is said to have been founded in the first half of the eighteenth century by Abid Reza, the first of the converted Hindu R\u0101j\u0101s of Laur, who submitted to pay tribute to the Mughals. The village contains a mosque of great local repute, a dispensary, a high school, two bazars, and about two hundred shops. It is surrounded by a moat, and the houses are closely packed together on islets of high land separated from one another by marshy ground and watercourses.\n\n**B\u0101nka Subdivision.**\u2014Southern subdivision of Bh\u0101galpur District, Bengal, lying between $24^\\circ 33'$ and $25^\\circ 7' N.$ and $86^\\circ 19'$ and $87^\\circ 11' E.$, with an area of 1,182 square miles. It is situated on the fringe of the Sant\u0101l Parganas, and the country rises from the dead level of the northern alluvial plain by a series of rolling ridges, valleys, and jungle-clad hills. The population in 1901 was 433,499, compared with 423,350 in 1891. It contains 994 villages, one of which, B\u0101nka, is its head-quarters; but no town. The subdivision is less densely populated than the remainder of the District, supporting only 367 persons to the\nsquare mile. Mand\u0101rgiri hill possesses some archaeological interest, and there are also remains at Bausi in its neighbourhood.\n\nBanka Village.\u2014Head-quarters of the subdivision of the same name in Bhagalpur District, Bengal, situated in $24^\\circ 53'$ N. and $86^\\circ 56'$ E., on the Chandan river. Population (1901), 1,091. It contains the usual public offices; the sub-jail has accommodation for twelve prisoners. Gur is made and exported to Lower Bengal.\n\nBank\u0101-Pah\u0101ri.\u2014A petty sanad State in Central India, under the Bundelkhand Agency, belonging to the Hasht-Bhaiya J\u0101g\u012brs, consisting of a single village, with an area of 4 square miles. Population (1901), 1,056. The first portion of its name is said to be derived from the epithet of b\u0101nk\u0101 (literally \u2018crooked\u2019), applied to a rakish method of wearing the head-dress, and commonly used in the sense of \u2018spirited\u2019 or \u2018gallant.\u2019 The original holder of the j\u0101g\u012br was thus designated, and the epithet has become a family title. The first holder of this estate was Diw\u0101n Umed Singh, a Bundel\u0101 R\u0101jput, son of Diw\u0101n Rai Singh of Bar\u0101gaon, near Jh\u0101nsi. The estate originally consisted of five villages, but four were lost during the Mar\u0101th\u0101 invasion. The territory was confirmed to Diw\u0101n Bank\u0101 Ishr\u012b Singh by a sanad granted in 1823. The present holder is Diw\u0101n Bank\u0101 Mihrb\u0101n Singh, who succeeded in 1890. The revenue is Rs. 4,000. The village is situated in $25^\\circ 22'$ N. and $80^\\circ 14'$ E.\n\nBank\u0101pur T\u0101luka.\u2014Western t\u0101luka of Dh\u0101rw\u0101r District, Bombay, lying between $14^\\circ 51'$ and $15^\\circ 10'$ N. and $75^\\circ 4'$ and $75^\\circ 28'$ E., with an area of 344 square miles. There is one town, Bank\u0101pur (population, 6,360), and 144 villages, including Shiggaoon (5,232), the head-quarters. The population in 1901 was 90,361, compared with 85,602 in 1891. The density, 263 persons per square mile, is above the District average. The demand for land revenue in 1903\u20134 was 2.09 lakhs, and for cesses Rs. 16,000. In the west the soil is chiefly red, in the south and north chiefly black, and in the east a mixed black and red. The climate is healthy.\n\nBank\u0101pur Town.\u2014Town in the t\u0101luka of the same name in Dh\u0101rw\u0101r District, Bombay, situated in $14^\\circ 55'$ N. and $75^\\circ 16'$ E. Population (1901), 6,360. It has a ruined fort and two temples. A weekly market is held on Tuesdays, when coarse cloth, blankets, oil, and metal vessels are sold. The earliest mention of Bank\u0101pur is in a Kolh\u0101pur Jain manuscript dated 898, where \u2018the famous city of Bank\u0101pur, the greatest among cities,\u2019 is described as having been called after himself by the Chellaketan chief Bankey\u0101rasa, the Dh\u0101rw\u0101r underlord of the R\u0101shtrak\u016bta king Amoghavarsha (851\u201369). In 1071 Uday\u0101ditya of the Gang\u0101 family was reigning at this city. In 1406 it was besieged by the Bahmani Sultan, Firoz Sh\u0101h, an ancestor of the Naw\u0101b of Savan\u016br. In 1776 it fell to Haidar Al\u012b. From Mar\u0101th\u0101 records of 1790 Bank\u0101pur\nseems to have been the head-quarters of a sark\u0101r of sixteen parganas. In 1802 it was ceded to the British by the Peshw\u0101 under the Treaty of Bassein. It contains a fine Jain temple of Rangasw\u0101mi, with a number of inscriptions. There are four schools, of which two are for girls.\n\nB\u0101nkib\u0101z\u0101r.\u2014Ancient village in the District of the Twenty-four Parganas, Bengal, on the Hooghly river near the modern Palt\u0101, 3 miles above Barrackpore. The name of this village has disappeared from the map, and its site can be identified only from old charts. It formed the principal settlement in India of the ill-fated Ostend Company which was chartered by the Emperor of Austria in 1722. This settlement was regarded with great jealousy by the English, French, and Dutch; and the result was that, when the Court of Vienna was anxious to obtain the European guarantee for the Pragmatic Sanction in 1727, the Company\u2019s charter was suspended. In 1733 the Muhammadan general (faujdar) at Hooghly, at the instigation of the Dutch and English, besieged B\u0101nkib\u0101z\u0101r; and the small garrison, after a despairing resistance against overwhelming numbers, abandoned the place and set sail for Europe\u00b9.\n\nBankipore Subdivision.\u2014Head-quarters subdivision of Patna District, Bengal, lying between $25^\\circ 12'$ and $25^\\circ 40'$ N. and $84^\\circ 42'$ and $85^\\circ 17'$ E., with an area of 334 square miles. Owing to plague mortality and defective enumeration consequent on the prevalence of that disease at the time of the Census of 1901, the population recorded in that year was only 341,054, compared with 404,304 in 1891, the density being 1,021 persons per square mile. The subdivision is a flat alluvial tract, bounded on the north by the Ganges. It contains two towns, Patna City (population, 134,785) and Phulw\u0101ri (3,415); and 975 villages. Its head-quarters are at Bankipore, which is included within the municipal limits of Patna city.\n\nBankipore Town (B\u0101nkipur).\u2014Head-quarters of the Division and District of Patna, Bengal, situated in $25^\\circ 37'$ N. and $85^\\circ 8'$ E., on the right bank of the Ganges. It forms part of the Patna municipality, and is the western suburb of that city in which most of the Europeans reside. Their houses and the police lines, judicial courts, and other public buildings extend along the river bank. Bankipore possesses a spacious maid\u0101n and a race-course. To the south of this lies the railway station, which is 338 miles from Calcutta and is the junction for the Patna-Gay\u0101 line and also for the Digha Gh\u0101\u1e6d branch line connecting the East Indian with the Bengal and North-Western Railway. At once the most prominent and the most curious building in Bankipore is the old Government gol\u0101 or granary, a brick building in the shape of a bee-hive, with two winding staircases on the outside, which have been ascended on horse-\n\n\u00b9 The \u2018Ostenders\u2019 were again expelled from B\u0101nkib\u0101z\u0101r in 1744 (Bengal Public Consultations, October 14, 1744).\nback; it was erected by Warren Hastings shortly after the great famine of 1769-70 as a storehouse for grain. This storehouse has never been filled, though during the scarcity of 1874 a good deal of grain was temporarily stored here. In times of famine, proposals to fill it are still made by the native press; but the loss from damp, rats, and insects renders such a scheme of storing grain wasteful and impracticable. The jail, which is situated near the railway station, has accommodation for 453 prisoners, who are chiefly employed in the preparation of mustard oil, carpets, and road-metal. The Bih\u0101r National college, founded in 1883, teaches up to the B.A. standard, and the Bankipore female high school, founded in 1867, teaches up to the Entrance standard of the Calcutta University.\n\nB\u0101nkot (or Fort Victoria).\u2014Village and old fort in the D\u0101poli t\u0101luka of Ratn\u0101giri District, Bombay, situated in 17\u00b0 59' N. and 73\u00b0 3' E., at the mouth of the S\u0101vitri river, 73 miles south-east from Bombay. Population (1901), 276. In the beginning of the eighteenth century 'Ban-coote' was a pirate nest of the Mar\u0101th\u0101 chief Angri\u0101. It was ceded by the Mar\u0101th\u0101s in exchange for the conquered fortress of Gheria in 1756, and thus became the first British possession on the mainland of Western India. It was renamed Fort Victoria, and was highly valued as supplying Bombay with provisions, and also as affording the inhabitants a change of air and scene. James Forbes (Oriental Memoirs) visited it in 1771. B\u0101nkot lies at the foot of a rocky headland in the extreme north of the District. The river is navigable by vessels of 16 feet draught 18 miles to Mah\u0101pral, and by vessels drawing 7 feet 10 miles farther to Mah\u0101d in Kol\u0101ba District. Until 1822 B\u0101nkot was the chief town of Ratn\u0101giri District. It is now little more than a large fishing village with no manufactures. Coasting steamers call daily during the fair season, but the port is closed in the south-west monsoon. The value of the imports and exports is trifling. B\u0101nkot contains 7 schools, attended by 100 boys and 22 girls.\n\nB\u0101nkur\u0101 District.\u2014District in the Burdw\u0101n Division of Bengal, lying between 22\u00b0 38' and 23\u00b0 38' N. and 86\u00b0 36' and 87\u00b0 46' E., with an area of 2,621 square miles. The D\u0101modar river on the north separates it from Burdw\u0101n; while it is bounded on the south by Midnapore, on the east by Burdw\u0101n and Hooghly, and on the west by M\u0101nbhum.\n\nThe District forms part of the eastern fringe of the Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur plateau. In the north and west it consists of broken rocky country with isolated spurs, of which the highest are the Susunia hill (1,442 feet) and Bih\u0101ri Nath. To the east the elevation is lower; the country has an undulating park-like aspect, and eventually merges in the alluvial plains of the Gangetic delta.\n\nThe chief rivers are the D\u0101modar, which forms the northern\nboundary, and the Dw\u0101rkeswar or Dhalkisor, which traverses the centre of the District. They are insignificant streams during the hot season, but in the rains become navigable by boats of 50 to 60 tons burden. During this season they sometimes rise so suddenly, owing to the rapid drainage from the neighbouring hills, that a head wave is formed, called the hurp\u0101 b\u0101n, not unlike the bore or tidal wave in the Hooghly, which often causes loss of life and great destruction of property. The Silai and K\u0101sai cross the south of the District.\n\nGneiss appears in the western hills, especially in the neighbourhood of B\u0101nkur\u0101 town; and in the north-west metamorphic rocks stand up boldly in well-marked hornblendic ridges, the general strike of which is nearly east and west. South of B\u0101nkur\u0101 town veins of granite occur, especially in the metamorphic rocks along the Silai river, cutting through the gneissic rocks. The Gondw\u0101na system is represented in the north, on the banks of the D\u0101modar river, by beds which belong to the R\u0101niganj group and may contain useful seams of coal. Elsewhere the surface consists of gently undulating ground, covered by laterite and alluvium. The former is invariably detrital, and contains such quantities of quartz pebbles as to resemble a coarse ferruginous conglomerate. The laterite is extensively overlaid by a sandy clay, which is often intermixed with kankar\\(^1\\).\n\nThe uplands are bare or clothed with a scrub jungle of Zizyphus and other thorny shrubs, which sometimes gives way to s\u0101l (Shorea robusta) forest, while the low hills are covered by a dense mixed forest, which contains species of Miliusa, Schrebera, Schleichera, and Diospyros. In the low-lying land to the east, the swamp vegetation of the West Bengal rice plain is found. In the neighbourhood of villages are thickets, in which the most common species are bamboos, pipal (Ficus religiosa), banyan (Ficus indica), red cotton-tree (Bombax malabaricum), Mangifera, Moringa, and Odina Wodier. The District contains no Government forests.\n\nBlack bears are common in the western jungles; and hyenas, leopards, wolves, deer, and wild hog are also occasionally found. Pythons are often met with in the hills, while the cobra, karait, and other deadly snakes are common.\n\nExceptionally high day temperatures are a feature of the hot months, the mean maximum rising to 93\u00b0 in March and 102\u00b0 in April. The mean temperature for the year is 80\u00b0. The annual rainfall averages 56 inches, of which 10\u00b74 inches fall in June, 12\u00b77 in July, 12\u00b74 in August, and 8\u00b72 in September.\n\n\\(^1\\) Memoirs, Geological Survey of India, vol. i, pt. iii, \u2018The Geological Structure and Physical Features of the Districts of B\u0101nkur\u0101, Midnapore, and Orissa\u2019; also vol. iii, pt. i, \u2018The Raniganj Coalfield,\u2019 by W. T. Blanford. This section was supplied by Mr. P. N. Bose, of the Geological Survey of India.\nIn prehistoric times B\u0101nkur\u0101 formed part of the old kingdom of Karna Suvarna, and subsequently of the R\u0101rh division of Bengal. The local legends centre round Bishnupur. Here was founded, in the beginning of the eighth century A.D., one of the eight petty dynasties of Hindu rulers who formerly held the Bengal frontier against the jungle tribes of the western plateau. Under Muhammadan rule the Bishnupur family appears sometimes as the enemy, sometimes as the ally, and sometimes as the tributary of the Musalm\u0101n Naw\u0101b. In the rent-roll of Todar Mal in 1582 the country held by the family was assessed at a fixed tribute. In 1715, under the administration of Jafar Kh\u0101n, it was reduced to the status of a zam\u012bnd\u0101ri. It was at that time included within the chakla of Burdwan, and was with that District ceded to the East India Company in 1760. From that date the fortunes of the family rapidly declined. They were impoverished by Mar\u0101th\u0101 raids, and the famine of 1770 left few inhabitants to till the soil. Meanwhile the British Government added to their public burdens and treated them as mere land stewards, and thus completed their ruin. The present representative of the family is dependent for his subsistence on a few debottar estates. When the Bishnupur zam\u012bnd\u0101ri first passed into the hands of the British, it was administered from Murshid\u0101b\u0101d; but its lawless condition soon necessitated a more direct administration, and in 1787 it was constituted, with Birbh\u016bm, into a separate District. In 1793 it was separated from Birbh\u016bm and added to Burdwan; but in 1805 it was incorporated with the newly constituted Jungle Mah\u0101ls, of which it continued to form part until 1833. B\u0101nkur\u0101 was created a separate revenue District in 1835; but discrepancies long existed between the revenue, judicial, and police jurisdictions, which were not completely removed until 1879. Interesting archaeological remains are found at BISHNUPUR.\n\nThe population of the present District area increased steadily from 968,597 in 1872 to 1,041,752 in 1881, to 1,069,668 in 1891, and to 1,116,411 in 1901. The undulating uplands are well drained and form one of the most salubrious tracts in Bengal. The Bishnupur subdivision is less healthy, and here the notorious Burdwan fever formerly caused great ravages. Mortality is chiefly due to fever. Cholera is always present in a sporadic form and sometimes becomes epidemic. Leprosy is more prevalent than in any other part of India, and more than 3 males per 1,000 were recorded as suffering from it in 1901. The principal statistics of the Census of 1901 are shown in the table on the next page.\n\nThe District is less densely peopled than any other in the Burdwan Division. The population is very sparse in the south and west, where the land is undulating, rocky, and barren; farther east, in the Bishnupur subdivision, the soil is alluvial and the density is much greater. The\nincrease of population at the last Census is less than half what it would have been but for the large emigration which takes place. The emigrants are for the most part hardy aborigines from the south and west of the District, who are attracted by the high wages paid in the coal-fields of Asansol and in the Assam tea gardens, or who supplement their scanty harvests by working as labourers in the metropolitan Districts in the off-season. The three towns are B\u0101nkur\u0101, the head-quarters, Bishnupur, and Son\u0101mukh\u012b. The vernacular of the District is the dialect known as R\u0101rhi boli or Western Bengali, but Sant\u0101li is spoken by nearly 9 per cent. of the population. By religion 975,746 are Hindus, 51,114 Musalm\u0101ns, and 89,157 Animists. The last mentioned are chiefly Sant\u0101ls of the head-quarters subdivision, who number altogether 106,000.\n\n| Subdivision | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|-------------|---------------------|----------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| B\u0101nkur\u0101     | 1,921               | 1              | 4,069    | 712,055    | 371                       | + 2.85                                          | 57,926                                 |\n| Bishnupur   | 700                 | 2              | 1,523    | 404,356    | 578                       | + 7.17                                          | 45,753                                 |\n| District total | 2,621             | 3              | 5,592    | 1,116,411  | 426                       | + 4.37                                          | 103,679                                |\n\nThe Musalm\u0101ns are almost all Shaikhs (44,000). Among Hindus the semiaboriginal castes of Bauri (113,000) and B\u0101gdi (91,000) are largely represented, the former predominating in the west and the latter towards the east of the District. Br\u0101hmans (93,000) and Telis (74,000) are also numerous. Of the total population, 60.7 per cent. are supported by agriculture, 15.9 per cent. by industries, 0.7 by commerce, and 2.2 by the professions. The proportion of agriculturists is considerably below the general average for Bengal.\n\nChristians number 363. A Wesleyan mission, which commenced work in 1877, maintains several schools. It has opened classes in B\u0101nkur\u0101 town to teach carpentry, weaving, and basket-making, and also built a public library in 1899 and a leper asylum with accommodation for 72 inmates in 1902. An Armenian mission possesses an orphanage near Mejia.\n\nThe alluvial soil in the east of the Bishnupur subdivision is fertile; elsewhere valleys are generally rich and productive, while the higher lands are comparatively barren, and are for the most part covered with jungle.\n\nThe chief agricultural statistics for 1903\u20134 are shown in the table on the next page, in square miles.\n\nThe chief crop is rice, covering 535 square miles. By far the most important harvest is the \u0101man or winter rice, which is sown in April\nor May, after three or four ploughings, transplanted in July or August, and reaped in December. The aus or early rice is sown broadcast in May and reaped in September. Sugar-cane covers 20 square miles; maize is cultivated on the higher lands, and oilseeds, pulses, wheat, flax, and cotton are also grown. Indigo, formerly an important crop, has now almost disappeared. Rich black mud, scraped from the bottom of tanks or reservoirs, is used as manure mixed with ashes and stubble, while for the more valuable crops cow-dung is added. In the case of lands growing sugar-cane and other exhausting staples, rotation is observed, sugar-cane being generally followed by til (Sesamum indicum), after which a crop of early rice is taken, followed by mustard and peas mixed.\n\n| Subdivision | Total | Cultivated | Cultivable waste |\n|-------------|-------|------------|------------------|\n| B\u0101nkur\u0101     | 1,921 | 451        | 865              |\n| Bishnupur   | 700   | 195        | 433              |\n| **Total**   | **2,621** | **646**    | **1,298**        |\n\n**Note.**\u2014It is estimated that 51 square miles are twice cropped.\n\nThe cultivated area is being gradually extended. During the last decade Rs. 62,000 was advanced under the Land Improvement and Agriculturists' Loans Acts for the excavation and re-excavation of irrigation tanks and other miscellaneous improvements.\n\nThe local cattle are weak and poor, though the pasturage is ample except in the east of the District.\n\nIrrigation is necessary everywhere except in the low country to the east, and it is estimated that one-third of the cultivated area is artificially irrigated. The usual method is to throw a dam across a watercourse, but wells and tanks are also utilized.\n\nThere are two small coal-mines in the north of the District, the output in 1903-4 being 10,634 tons. Ferruginous laterite is common, and the quartz, sandstone, trap, gravel, and clay which it produces are largely utilized for road-making and brick-burning. Building stone exists in unlimited quantities in the hills. A white lithomarge is obtained under the laterite at a point about 12 miles north-east of B\u0101nkur\u0101 town. Gold occurs in small quantities in the sands of the Dhalkisor and K\u0101sai rivers.\n\nSilk-spinning, silk and cotton-weaving, the manufacture of brass and bell-metal ware, and the preparation of shellac are the principal industries. Bishnupur town contains a large weaving population, and is noted for its prettily embroidered scarves and fine silk cloth. Tasar silk is manufactured at B\u0101nkur\u0101 town, Bishnupur, and Birsinghpur, and coarse cotton cloths at B\u0101nkur\u0101 town, Gopin\u0101thpur, Barjor\u0101, R\u0101jgr\u0101m, and\n\nTrade and communications.\nBirsinghpur, though they are being ousted from the market by cheap Manchester goods. Son\u0101mukh\u012b is the centre of the shellac industry, but profits have been reduced by a fall in prices; about 5,000 maunds were sent to Calcutta in 1903-4. Other industries are the manufacture of gold and silver ornaments, iron implements, shell bangles, and lac beads.\n\nRice, brass and bell-metal ware, silk stuffs, and hides are the chief articles of export, while the imports are tobacco, salt, spices, betel-nuts, poppy-heads, cotton and cotton twist, and European piece-goods. A small part of the trade passes through the R\u0101n\u012bganj and P\u0101n\u0101garh stations of the East Indian Railway, but most of it is conveyed by the Midnapore-Jherri\u0101 extension of the Bengal-N\u0101gpur Railway, which passes through the District. There is some bullock-cart traffic with Gh\u0101\u1e6d\u0101l in Midnapore District.\n\nThe East Indian Railway skirts the north-east boundary. The Midnapore-Jherri\u0101 extension of the Bengal-N\u0101gpur Railway, which passes through the District, has recently been opened, and a chord-line from Howrah to B\u0101nkur\u0101 is under construction. The chief roads are the R\u0101n\u012bganj-Midnapore road maintained from Provincial funds, the old military grand trunk road which runs across the District, the B\u0101nkur\u0101-Burdw\u0101n road via Son\u0101mukh\u012b, the B\u0101nkur\u0101-Raipur road, and the Bishnupur-P\u0101n\u0101garh road. These are maintained by the District board, which has altogether under its charge 24 miles of metalled and 575 miles of unmetalled roads, in addition to 105 miles of village tracks.\n\nRiver-borne traffic is practically confined to the floating of long rafts (locally called murs) down the D\u0101modar; the trade is declining, owing to the supply of timber near the river having been practically exhausted.\n\nThe District is subject to drought and required Government relief in 1866 and 1874, and again in 1897. On the last occasion a daily average of 2,377 persons were employed on relief works, and 6,528 were gratuitously relieved from May to September at a cost of Rs. 1,20,000, of which Rs. 35,000 was contributed by the District board, while the balance was met by Government.\n\nFor administrative purposes the District is divided into two subdivisions, with head-quarters at B\u0101nkur\u0101 and Bishnupur. The District Magistrate has at B\u0101nkur\u0101 a staff of three Deputy-Magistrate Collectors, while a fourth, assisted by a Sub-Deputy-Collector, is in charge of the Bishnupur subdivision.\n\nFor civil judicial work there are, subordinate to the District and Sessions Judge, a Sub-Judge and three Munsifs at B\u0101nkur\u0101, one Munsif at Kh\u0101\u1e6dra, one at Kotalpur, and two at Bishnupur, one of\nwhom occasionally sits at Kotalpur. For many years past the District has been notorious as a centre of gangs of professional dacoits, one of which has been traced back as far as the Mutiny of 1857. These gangs, which mainly commit their crimes in the neighbouring Districts, are now being broken up.\n\nNearly the whole of the District, as at present constituted, was originally comprised in the Bishnupur pargana, which formed the estate of the Raja. This was gradually broken up, owing to his unpunctuality in paying the land revenue; but in 1835-6, when Bankura was first constituted a separate Collectorate, it still contained only 56 estates. The number had by 1903-4 increased to 1,046, with a current demand of 4.74 lakhs. Of these, 983, paying a revenue of 4.73 lakhs, are permanently settled; 51 are temporarily settled estates, consisting of the surplus side lands of the Raniganj-Midnapore road; and 12 petty estates are the property of Government. The incidence of the land revenue is lower than elsewhere in the Division, being only R. 0-12-4 per cultivated acre. Tenures peculiar to the District are: nayabadi, under which a tenant who takes up waste land is allowed to hold a certain portion of it free of rent or to obtain a deduction from the rent of the entire tenure; jalsasan, an improvement lease under which a tenant constructs tanks or reservoirs on similar terms; and itmamdari, under which the tenure-holder enjoys the land rent-free as remuneration for performing the duties of a rent-collector. Ghatwali estates were formerly held for services rendered in defending the ghats or frontier passes against the inroads of Marathas and other plunderers. A quit-rent was originally payable to the Raja of Bishnupur, and was included in the 'assets' of the Decennial Settlement, but on the Raja's application these lands were subsequently resumed by Government. The ghatwals have now been abolished and their estates settled. The maximum, minimum, and average rates per acre assessed on the ghatwali lands were Rs. 7-8, Rs. 3-12, and Rs. 5-10 for low lands, and Rs. 12, Rs. 3, and Rs. 7-8 for high lands. Throughout the District generally, the average holding of a tenant is 6 acres. Rents rule higher in the east than in the west of the District, rice land bringing in from Rs. 3-12 to Rs. 6 an acre in the west, and from Rs. 4-8 to Rs. 7-8 in the Bishnupur subdivision. For rabi land the rates vary between Rs. 5-4 and Rs. 12 per acre, though as little as Rs. 3 per acre is paid for the less fertile lands in the north-west.\n\nThe collections of land revenue and of total revenue (principal heads only), in thousands of rupees, are shown in the following table:\n\n|                | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 4.59   | 4.58   | 4.60   | 4.79   |\n| Total revenue  | 7.16   | 8.11   | 9.45   | 10.02  |\nOutside the municipalities of B\u0101nkur\u0101, Bishnupur, and Son\u0101mukh\u012b, local affairs are managed by the District board and the two subdivisional local boards subordinate to it. The income of the board in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 1,31,000, of which Rs. 52,500 was derived from rates; and the expenditure was Rs. 1,16,000, half of which was spent on public works and Rs. 40,000 on education.\n\nThe District contains 13 police stations and 9 outposts. The force subordinate to the District Superintendent in 1903 consisted of 2 inspectors, 27 sub-inspectors, 25 head constables, and 321 constables. There was in addition a village police consisting of 250 daffad\u0101rs and 2,931 chaukid\u0101rs, of whom 401 are remunerated by service tenures. The cost of maintenance of the regular force was Rs. 77,000, and there was one policeman to every 10.1 square miles and to every 4,327 persons. The District jail at B\u0101nkur\u0101 has accommodation for 309 prisoners, and a subsidiary jail at Bishnupur for 15.\n\nEducation is making steady progress, and 9.3 per cent. of the population (18.3 males and 0.5 females) were literate in 1901. The total number of pupils under instruction increased from 38,512 in 1892\u20133 to 39,092 in 1900\u20131. In 1903\u20134 37,695 boys and 4,708 girls were at school, being respectively 45.7 and 5.5 per cent. of the children of school-going age. The number of educational institutions, public and private, in that year was 1,388, including one Arts college, 65 secondary, 1,241 primary, and 81 special schools. The last-mentioned institutions include two Sant\u0101l schools under mission management, and two aided music schools at B\u0101nkur\u0101 and Bishnupur, at which both vocal and instrumental music are taught. The total expenditure on education was Rs. 1,84,000, of which Rs. 22,000 was met from Provincial funds, Rs. 38,000 from District funds, Rs. 2,000 from municipal funds, and Rs. 84,000 from fees.\n\nIn 1903 the District contained 10 dispensaries, of which 3 had accommodation for 34 in-patients. The cases of 38,000 out-patients and 318 in-patients were treated, and 2,890 operations were performed. The expenditure was Rs. 11,000, of which Rs. 2,000 was met from Government contributions, Rs. 4,000 from Local and Rs. 3,000 from municipal funds, and Rs. 2,000 from subscriptions. A leper asylum is maintained at B\u0101nkur\u0101 town.\n\nVaccination is compulsory only within municipal areas; it appears to be gaining ground, though the number of operations varies widely from year to year. In 1903\u20134 the number of persons successfully vaccinated was 38,450, representing 36 per 1,000 of the population.\n\n[Sir W. W. Hunter, Statistical Account of Bengal, vol. iv (1876); and Annals of Rural Bengal (1868).]\n\nB\u0101nkur\u0101 Subdivision.\u2014Western subdivision of B\u0101nkur\u0101 District, Bengal, lying between 22\u00b0 38' and 23\u00b0 38' N. and 86\u00b0 36' and\n87\u00b0 25' E., with an area of 1,921 square miles. The subdivision is composed of undulating country, covered in places with low scrubby jungle and coppice wood. To the east it merges in the alluvial plain, but to the west the surface is more irregular, the undulations become more marked, and numerous isolated hills appear. The population in 1901 was 712,055, compared with 692,357 in 1891. It contains one town, B\u0101nkur\u0101 (population, 20,737), its head-quarters; and 4,069 villages. The subdivision, which lies on the fringe of the Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur plateau, is much less fertile and less densely populated than the Bishnupur subdivision, and supports only 371 persons to the square mile.\n\nB\u0101nkur\u0101 Town.\u2014Head-quarters of B\u0101nkur\u0101 District, Bengal, situated in 23\u00b0 14' N. and 87\u00b0 4' E., on the north bank of the Dhalkisor river. The population in 1901 was 20,737, of whom 19,553 were Hindus, 993 Muhammadans, and 158 Christians. B\u0101nkur\u0101 is said to be named after an early settler named Banku Rai, whose descendants still reside in the town. The climate is dry and very healthy. The town lies on the grand trunk road from Calcutta to the north-west. The newly-constructed Midnapore-Jherri\u0101 branch of the Bengal-N\u0101gpur Railway passes through it, and a direct line from Howrah is contemplated. Tasar silk is largely manufactured. Considerable trade is carried on, the chief exports being rice, oilseeds, lac, cotton and silk cloth, silk cocoons, &c., and the imports English piece-goods, salt, tobacco, spices, coco-nuts, and pulses. B\u0101nkur\u0101 was constituted a municipality in 1869. The income during the decade ending 1901-2 averaged Rs. 13,000, and the expenditure Rs. 12,000. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 20,000, a third of which was derived from a tax on persons (or property tax); and the expenditure was Rs. 14,000. The town contains the usual public offices. The District jail has accommodation for 309 prisoners, the chief industries being mustard-oil pressing, brick-making, dari and cloth-weaving, and cane and bamboo work. A leper asylum built in 1902 is administered by the Wesleyan Mission; it has accommodation for 72 inmates.\n\nBanmauk.\u2014North-western subdivision and township of Kath\u0101 District, Upper Burma, lying between 24\u00b0 10' and 24\u00b0 59' N. and 95\u00b0 15' and 95\u00b0 59' E., with an area of 1,235 square miles. It was formerly part of the Wuntho State and was annexed in 1891. The population in 1901 was 28,360, distributed in 338 villages. The headquarters are at Banmauk (population, 389), near the south-eastern corner. The township is hilly throughout, especially in the north, in the old Mansi township. Near Mansi may still be seen the stockades constructed by the Wuntho Sawbwa during his rebellion. The principal occupations of the inhabitants are rice and tea cultivation. The cultivated area under supplementary survey in 1903-4 was 23 square miles, and the land revenue and thathameda amounted to Rs. 82,500.\nBannu District.\u2014One of the four trans-Indus Districts of the North-West Frontier Province, lying between $32^\\circ 16'$ and $33^\\circ 5'$ N. and $70^\\circ 23'$ and $71^\\circ 16'$ E., with an area of 1,670 square miles. The District forms a basin drained by two rivers from the hills of Waziristan, the Kurram and the Gambila or Tochi, which unite at Lakki and flow into the Indus south of Kalabagh. It is shut in on every side by mountains: on the north by those in the Teri tahsil of Kohat District; on the east by the southern extremity of the Maidani Pahar or Khattak Niazi range and the northern spur of the Marwat range, which separate the District from the Isa Khel tahsil of Mianwali District in the Punjab; on the south-east and south the Marwat and Bhittanni ranges divide it from Dera Ismail Khan; and on the west and north-west lie Waziristan and independent territory inhabited by the Bhittanni tribe. These hills nowhere attain any great height. The highest point of the Maidani range at its centre, near the hamlet and valley of Maidan, has an altitude of only 4,256 feet. The Marwat range culminates in Sheikh Budin, the hill which rises abruptly from its south-west end to a height of 4,516 feet, and forms the summer retreat for this District and Dera Ismail Khan. From these ranges numerous spurs jut out into the Bannu plains, but no other hills break their level expanse. Of the rivers the larger is the Kurram, which, entering the District at its north-western corner close to Bannu town, runs at first south-east, then south, and finally winds eastward through the Darra Tang or \u2018narrow gorge\u2019 which lies between the extremities of the Maidani Pahar and Marwat ranges. The Tochi river enters the District about 6 miles south of the Kurram and flows in the same direction, gradually drawing closer to it until their streams unite about 6 or 7 miles west of the Darra Tang. Between these rivers, and on the left bank of the Kurram in the upper portion of its course, lie the only tracts which are perennially irrigated. For the first 10 miles of its passage through the District the Kurram runs between banks of stiff clay which rise abruptly to a height of 10 to 30 feet, and its bed is full of stones and boulders; but lower down it spreads over long stretches of marsh land. Its flow is rapid, but it is highly charged with a rich silt which renders it most valuable for irrigation.\n\nAt the south-east edge the western flanks of the hills bounding Mianwali and Dera Ismail Khan Districts expose Tertiary lower Siwalik soft sandstone and upper Siwalik conglomerates, a thickness of which dips regularly under the alluvium and gravels forming the greater part of the great Bannu plain. On its western side the border area has been examined along one line of route only, namely, the Tochi valley.\n\n1 F. H. Smith, \u2018Geology of the Tochi Valley,\u2019 Records, Geological Survey of India, vol. xxviii, pt. ii.\nHere long ridges striking north and south expose upper and lower Siwaliks, Nummulitic limestone, sandstone and shales, some mesozoic limestone in the ridge east of Mir\u0101m Sh\u0101h, and a great mass of Tertiary igneous rocks (diorites, gabbros, and serpentines) west of Muhammad Khel.\n\nIn the irrigated portions of the District trees abound of the same species as are common in Pesh\u0101war; elsewhere there is little but thorny shrubs of the same kinds as are found in Koh\u0101t. The more common plants are *Reptonia buxifolia*, *Dodonaea viscosa*, *Capparis aphylla*, *Flacourtia sapida*, *F. sepiaria*, several species of *Grewia*, *Zizyphus nummularia*, *Acacia Jacuemonitii*, *Alhagi camelorum*, *Crotalaria Burhia*, *Prosopis spicigera*, several species of *Tamarix*, *Nerium odorum*, *Rhazya stricta*, *Calotropis procera*, *Periploca aphylla*, *Tecoma undulata*, *Lycium europaeum*, *Withania coagulans*, *W. somnifera*, *Nannorhops Ritchieana*, *Fagonia*, *Tribulus*, *Peganum Harmala*, *Calligonum polygonoides*, *Polygonum aviculare*, *P. plebejum*, *Rumex vesicarius*, *Chrozophora plicata*, and species of *Aristida*, *Anthistiria*, *Cenchrus*, and *Pennisetum*.\n\nBears occasionally come from Waz\u012brist\u0101n and leopards still frequent the hills, while hyenas are sometimes found where there are ravines. Wolves are common, rewards having been paid for destroying 168 from 1900 to 1904. The Sulaim\u0101n m\u0101rkhor is found on all the higher hills, including Sheikh Budin. *Uri\u0101l* are also to be found on the hills, and \u2018ravine deer\u2019 (gazelle) in the neighbourhood of J\u0101ni Khel.\n\nThe general elevation of the plains is about 1,000 feet, and the temperature would be much the same all over the District did not special local causes affect it. Trees, excessive irrigation round the town, and the closeness of the hills combine to make Bannu moist and close in the hot season, and to equalize the temperature throughout the twenty-four hours. The sandy plain of Marwat is hotter by day and cooler by night, and far more healthy in spite of the intense heat. Fevers are common from September to November, and respiratory diseases cause considerable mortality.\n\nThe annual rainfall averages $12\\frac{1}{2}$ inches, rarely rising above 16, but at Bannu in 1891\u20132 less than 5 inches fell in the year. The fall is frequently unseasonable.\n\nThe population of Bannu is, and has been for many centuries, essentially Afgh\u0101n. There are, however, remains which tell of an older Hindu population, and afford proof that the District came within the pale of the ancient Graeco-Bactrian civilization of the Punjab. The close of the era of prosperity indicated by these remains is attributed in local tradition to the ravages of Mahm\u016bd of Ghazni, who is said to have utterly demolished the ancient Hindu strongholds, leaving no stone standing upon another. For upwards of a century the country appears to have lain waste, till at length the\nBannu valley was gradually colonized by immigrants from the western hills, the Bannuw\u0101ls or Bann\u016bchis, who still remain, and the Ni\u0101zai, who subsequently gave place to the Marwats. The advent of the Marwats is placed in the reign of Akbar. The Ni\u0101zai, whom they expelled, spread across the Khattak-Ni\u0101zai hills, and colonized the plains upon both banks of the Indus. The Marwats still hold the southern portion of the Bannu valley.\n\nAt this time, and for two centuries later, the country paid a nominal allegiance to the Delhi emperors. In 1738 it was conquered by N\u0101dir Shah, who laid it completely waste. Ahmad Sh\u0101h Durr\u0101ni subsequently led his army three or four times through the Bannu valley, levying what he could by way of tribute on each occasion. So stubborn, however, was the opposition of the inhabitants, that neither conqueror made any attempt to establish a permanent government. In 1818 the Naw\u0101b of Manker\u0101 annexed Marwat, but was speedily forced to give way to Ranjit Singh, who first crossed the Indus in 1823. From that year to 1836 the Sikh troops and those of the Naw\u0101b in turn harried the country. In 1838 the valley passed by cession to the Sikhs. Ranjit Singh lost no time in attempting to occupy his new territory. Elsewhere in the District he had met with little opposition; but in the Bannu valley he was forced, after several efforts, to fall back upon the expedient of his predecessors, and to content himself with the periodical dispatch of a force to levy what he was pleased to term arrears of revenue: in reality to devastate the country, and carry off whatever booty could be secured.\n\nSuch was the state of affairs when, after the first Sikh War, the District first came under British influence. In the winter months of 1847\u20138, Lieutenant (afterwards Sir Herbert) Edwardes was dispatched to the frontier as the representative of the Lahore Darb\u0101r, and accompanied by a Sikh army under General Van Cortlandt. Arrived in Bannu, he found a large portion of the District practically independent. In the Bannu valley every village was a fort, and frequently at war with its neighbours, while the Wazir tribes on the frontier were ever seeking opportunities for aggression. Within a few months Edwardes reduced the country to order, effecting a peaceful revolution by the force of his personal character, and without the firing of a single shot. The forts were levelled; arrangements were made for the collection of a regular revenue; and so effectual were his measures that on the outbreak at Mult\u0101n he was able to hurry to the scene of action with a force of levies from this District, who served loyally throughout the campaign. The Sikhs in garrison at Edwardes\u0101b\u0101d meanwhile rose against their officers, and, having murdered them, marched to join their brethren in arms. A force from the hills at the same time invaded the District, but was held at bay by Lieutenant Reynell Taylor, Edwardes\u2019s successor. In\nthe following year the Punjab was annexed, and the District passed without a blow under British administration. The area covered by the present District at first belonged to Dera Ismail Khan. In 1861 the District of Bannu was constituted, comprising the present District and the Mi\u0101nw\u0101li and Isa Khel tahsils of what is now the Mi\u0101nw\u0101li District of the Punjab, which were taken away on the creation of the Frontier Province in 1901. The even tenor of administration has been at times disturbed by frontier raids, but no trouble has at any period been given by the inhabitants of the District itself. During the Mutiny of 1857 the country remained perfectly quiet. The border is guarded by a chain of outposts, eleven in number.\n\nAt Akra and other places in the Bannu valley mounds of various sizes exist where, amid fragments of burnt brick and tiles, of broken images and Hindu ornaments, coins occur with Greek or pseudo-Greek inscriptions. The Akra mound near Bannu presents features of great antiquarian interest. This mound, which at its highest point does not rise more than 70 feet above the surrounding plain, has long been excavated by the inhabitants of the neighbouring villages, who find the soil of its 'culture stratum,' generally about 2 to 3 feet in thickness and composed of ashes, rubbish, and bones, to be possessed of valuable properties as manure. Above this 'culture stratum' are layers of earth lighter in colour, and ranging from 8 to 20 feet in thickness. These probably represent the d\u00e9bris accumulated during centuries from structures of clay or sun-dried brick. In these layers are found plentiful fragments of ancient pottery and hard bricks, as well as rubble. The coins, terra-cotta figures, and fragments of small sculptures representing Hindu deities, which have been unearthed from this mound, point to the period from the first century B.C. down almost to the advent of the Muhammadan conquerors as that in which the site was inhabited. There is a curious resemblance in character and contents between the layers composing the Akra mound and the 'culture strata' of the ancient capital of Khotan in Chinese Turkestan.\n\nBannu District contains 2 towns and 362 villages. The population at the last three enumerations was: (1881) 182,740, (1891) 204,469, and (1901) 226,776. It increased by 10.9 per cent. during the last decade, the increase being greater in the Marwat tahsil than in that of Bannu. It is divided into two tahsils, of which the head-quarters are at the municipalities of BANNU, the head-quarters of the District, and LAKKI. Statistics according to the Census of 1901 are shown in the table on the next page.\n\nMuhammadans number 201,720, or more than 89 per cent. of the total; Hindus, 22,178; and Sikhs, 2,673. Pasht\u016b is the language of the District, but Hindki is also spoken among the non-Path\u0101n element. About 129,000 persons, or 56 per cent. of the population,\nare Path\u0101ns. Of these, the most numerous group is that of the Marwats (52,000), who live mainly in the tahsil named after them. In person, they are tall and muscular; in bearing, frank and open. Almost every officer who has administered the District has left on record a favourable mention of them. To these the Bann\u016bchis (30,000) form a painful contrast. They are indubitably of mixed descent, and exhibit every Afgh\u0101n vice, without possessing the compensating virtues of bravery and self-confidence. They are generally small in stature and inferior in physique, sallow and wizened in appearance, and in disposition mean and revengeful. They are, on the other hand, industrious cultivators, and have been uniformly quiet and submissive subjects to the British Government. The Waz\u012brs in this District, all Darwesh Khel, number 24,000. They are divided into two great sections, the Utmanzai and the Ahmadzai. Last come the Bhittannis (2,000), who live on the border of the District on the southern slopes of the Gabar mountain. In the District itself they are recent settlers. Besides the Path\u0101n races, the chief of the Hindk\u012bs, as they are called, are the Jats (15,000) and Aw\u0101ns (9,000), all of whom live by agriculture, as do also the B\u0101ghb\u0101ns (2,000) and R\u0101jp\u016bts (3,000). Saiyids number 12,000. The Aroras, the only important commercial and money-lending class, number 15,000; other castes of this class are the Bh\u0101tias and Khatris, numbering 2,000 and 1,000 respectively. Of the artisan classes, the Tarkh\u0101ns (carpenters, 5,000), Loh\u0101rs (blacksmiths, 4,000), Rangrez (dyers, 3,000), Kumh\u0101rs (potters, 3,000), Son\u0101rs (goldsmiths, 2,000), and Moch\u012bs (shoemakers and leather-workers, 2,000) are the most important; and of the menials only the Nais (barbers, 3,000) and Ch\u016bhr\u0101s and Kut\u0101nas (sweepers, 2,000) appear in some strength. Agriculture supports 75 per cent. of the population.\n\n| Tahsil | Area in square miles | Number of | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|--------|---------------------|-----------|------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n|        |                     | Towns.    | Villages.  |                          |                                                  |                                        |\n| Bannu  | 443                 | 1         | 217        | 139,444                  | + 8\u00b74                                           | 5,557                                  |\n| Marwat | 1,198               | 1         | 145        | 96,332                   | + 14\u00b75                                          | 3,980                                  |\n| Total  | 1,641*              | 2         | 362        | 226,776                  | + 10\u00b79                                          | 9,537                                  |\n\n* The difference between this figure and that given on p. 392 is due to the exclusion here of the non-revenue paying portion of the administrative District.\n\nThe Church Missionary Society began work in Bannu in 1864, and has a hospital which possesses a wide reputation on both sides of the frontier. The District contained 63 native Christians in 1901.\nThe prevailing soil is a sandy gravel, sometimes degenerating into mere sand, as in the Marwat tahsil, and sometimes affording a light and easy cultivation. The central portion of the Bannu valley, between the Kurram and the Tochi, is highly irrigated, and the demands on the soil are incessant. It is preserved, however, from exhaustion by the use of manure and the deposits of silt brought down by the Kurram river. Their fertility being thus renewed, the lands of a great majority of villages are sown year after year, for two harvests, without showing signs of deterioration. The rest of the District, with the exception of the tract between the Bhittanni hills and the Tochi, is sandy and entirely dependent on the rainfall. Saline efflorescence is common in parts of the District. The spring crop, which in 1903-4 occupied 80 per cent. of the area matured in the year, is sown chiefly from the beginning of October to the end of January; the autumn crop from May to July, though sugar-cane is planted as early as March.\n\nThe village tenures of this District as a rule present few peculiar features, and fall naturally under the standard communal types recognized throughout the Province. An exception, however, exists in the custom, once general and still surviving in a few Marwat villages, of the periodical redistribution of holdings among the shareholders. This custom is called khulla vesh, literally 'mouth division,' and received official sanction at the last revenue settlement. Cultivation is chiefly carried on by peasant proprietors, and money-rents between tenant and landlord are rare. There are no large proprietors, and the land is minutely subdivided. The following table shows the main agricultural statistics in 1903-4, according to the revenue returns, areas being in square miles:\n\n| Tahsil | Total | Cultivated | Irrigated | Cultivable waste |\n|--------|-------|------------|-----------|----------------|\n| Bannu  | 443   | 277        | 175       | 54             |\n| Marwat | 1,198 | 534        | 67        | 268            |\n| Total  | 1,641 | 811        | 242       | 322            |\n\nWheat is by far the most important crop, covering 334 square miles in 1903-4, or 49 per cent. of the net cultivated area. Next in importance is gram (158), after which the areas occupied by individual crops diminish rapidly, but maize (52) and bajra (41) may be mentioned. Sugar-cane, cotton, and rice are grown to a small extent.\n\nThe area cultivated in 1903-4 had risen by 43 per cent. above that cultivated at the settlement of 1872-9, the increase being chiefly due to the more peaceful state of the District. Little has been done as yet in the way of improving the quality of the crops grown. The amount\nof advances outstanding under the Land Improvement Loans Act at the end of 1903\u20134 was Rs. 14,267, while that of advances under the Agriculturists\u2019 Loans Act was Rs. 15,483. The amounts advanced in 1903\u20134 under these two Acts were Rs. 300 and Rs. 9,270 respectively. There is a constant demand for loans to buy plough bullocks.\n\nThe quality of the cattle is poor, and the attempt to introduce Hissar bulls into the District was a failure. The buffaloes, however, are of an excellent breed. Large numbers of camels and donkeys are kept in the Marwat tahsil, and of fat-tailed sheep in the Bannu tahsil. The Wazir breed of horses used to be popular, but is now virtually extinct, though the District is well adapted for horse-breeding. The District Board maintains 2 horse and 2 donkey stallions.\n\nOf the total area cultivated in 1903\u20134, 242 square miles, or 30 per cent., were classed as irrigated; of this, all but 93 acres irrigated from wells was supplied by canals. The canals take off from the Kurram and other hill streams, and are mostly the property of the people themselves, though in some cases the water belongs to the Government. Many date from an extreme antiquity. Babar, writing in 1505, says: \u2018The Bangash [Kurram] river runs through the Bannu territory, and by means of it chiefly the country is irrigated.\u2019 Many centuries of contention and compromise have evolved a most elaborate system of irrigation and rights in water, which is now administered by the Deputy-Commissioner.\n\nThe forest lands are quite insignificant, and outside the Bannu oasis the District is badly wooded.\n\nBannu possesses few minerals of commercial value. Rock-salt exists, but is not worked; and limestone, building stone, and flint are the only mineral products utilized. Impure carbonate of soda is made from the ashes of the Caroxylon Griffithii.\n\nCotton is woven in most villages, but in quantities only sufficient for local requirements. The woollen-pile rugs locally known as nakhais and the silk-embroidered phulkaris of the District have some artistic merit, but are not largely made. The lac work is inferior in technique to that of Dera Ismail Khan. Otherwise the District is destitute of any arts and manufactures, beyond the wares turned out to supply the everyday wants of the people. The clay used in unglazed pottery work at Bannu is of a superior quality and some of the designs are quaint.\n\nThe chief exports are raw cotton, wool, gram, wheat, oilseeds, millet, and pulses; and the chief imports are sugar, piece-goods, indigo, ghi, wood, oil, iron, and tobacco. Bannu and Lakki are the only centres of commerce. The District has a surplus of agricultural produce, but depends on the Punjab for all manufactured articles.\n\nNo railway traverses the District, but the North-Western Railway has\nan out-station at Bannu for forwarding goods. This town is connected with Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n and Koh\u0101t by a metalled road under the Military Works department, on which a line of tongas runs. The road up the Tochi is also metalled and possesses a tonga service. All other roads are unmetalled and are managed for the most part by the District board. Some of the roads are little better than sandy tracts; others, however, passing over firmer soil, are well defined, having a clayey surface, which is as hard as iron in dry weather but quickly becomes cut up after heavy rain. In the Bannu tahsil the roads are much intersected by irrigation channels and the courses of mountain streams. The most important are the road between Lakki and Naurang Sarai, and the frontier road, a mule track connecting the outposts on the border. There are 81 miles of metalled roads, all under the Military Works department, and 432 miles of unmetalled roads, of which 22 miles are Imperial, 91 Provincial, and 319 District.\n\nThough the District was classed by the Irrigation Commission as secure from famine, the Marwat tahsil has recently been declared insecure. The area of crops that matured in the famine year 1899-1900 amounted to 77 per cent. of the average of the preceding five years.\n\nFor administrative purposes the District is divided into the two tahsils of Bannu and Marwat, each under a tahsild\u0101r and a naib-tahsild\u0101r. The Deputy-Commissioner is aided by an Assistant Commissioner (who holds the office of District Judge of Bannu and Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n, and also that of additional District Magistrate of Bannu), an Assistant Commissioner in charge of the border military police, and two Extra Assistant Commissioners, one of whom is in charge of the District treasury.\n\nThe Deputy-Commissioner, as District Magistrate, and the District Judge are both supervised in judicial matters by the Divisional Judge of the Deraj\u0101t Civil Division. The District Judge has one Munsif under him and one honorary Munsif, both at head-quarters. Violent crime used to be the chief characteristic of the District; and murder, dacoity, highway robbery, and armed burglary were common, being carried out by the trans-border outlaws with the connivance of the leading men of the District. The military operations, however, against the K\u0101bul Khel in November, 1902, which ended in the surrender of a large number of outlaws, had an excellent effect in tranquillizing the border, and crime has much diminished since that year. Rigorous enforcement of the preventive sections of the Frontier Crimes Regulation and Penal Code does much to preserve the security of the border. The inhabitants of Bannu are notoriously litigious, civil cases being more frequently instituted than in any other District on the frontier.\n\nOur knowledge of the Bannu tahsil before annexation is of the vaguest\ndescription. The administrative unit, political or fiscal, was the tappa, a block of villages whose limits varied with the authority of its chief. Each tappa was a little independent state, warring with its neighbours from time to time and gaining or losing territory as the case might be. Force was the only method of revenue collection. When the tax-gatherer, whether Durr\u0101ni or Sikh, came with his army and demanded tribute or revenue, he levied his demand on the chief man of the tappa, who proceeded to exact the sum required from such of the landholders as had not absconded, bribing the Saiyids to help by exempting them from contributions, and rewarding any one who paid a defaulter's share with that defaulter's land. For the first four years of British rule (1849\u201353) the revenue was collected by crop appraisement of each field. In 1852\u20133 the first summary settlement was made on the average of these collections. This was revised, with a slight increase, in 1859. The first demand was Rs. 1,04,000 and the second Rs. 1,13,000. Marwat under native rule was administered with a firmer hand. Under the Durr\u0101nis the Marwats paid a sum varying from Rs. 12,000 to Rs. 40,000 as revenue or tribute, generally exacted at the point of the sword, while under the Naw\u0101b of Mankera or the Sikh rulers of Mult\u0101n, both of them uncomfortably near neighbours, a full demand was exacted. Herbert Edwardes took over Marwat from Malik Fateh Kh\u0101n Tiw\u0101n\u0101, the Sikh lessee, in 1847, and imposed a revenue of one-fourth of the gross produce in cash. This proportion was maintained by John Nicholson, who made the first summary settlement in 1853. The demand was severe and large remissions were necessary. The second summary settlement was made on the same lines in 1858, and pressed unequally on the people, besides raising the total demand from 2\u00b72 lakhs to nearly 2\u00b74.\n\nIn 1872 the regular settlement of the District began. Although the actual assessments fell very much below the standard rate of half the net 'assets,' the new demand for the two tahsils was 3 lakhs (including cesses), while the revenue of the preceding year had been 2\u00be lakhs. The settlement has nowhere pressed severely, but suspensions have been found necessary in years of scarcity.\n\nThe latest revision began in 1903, when it was found that the area under cultivation had increased since settlement by 43 per cent. and the irrigated area had doubled in Marwat and increased by 46 per cent. in Bannu, while prices had risen at least 25 per cent. After allowing for frontier remissions and considerations of general policy, it is estimated that the result will be an increase of Rs. 1,17,000, or 47 per cent., of which Rs. 1,10,000 will be realized by Government. The rates of assessment at the last settlement were, per acre: 'dry' land, R. 0-6-6 (maximum, 12 annas; minimum, 1 anna); and 'wet' land, R. 0-9-6 (maximum, 15 annas; minimum, 3 annas).\nThe collections of land revenue alone and of total revenue have been as follows, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1880-1.* | 1890-1.* | 1900-1.* | 1903-4. |\n|----------------|----------|----------|----------|---------|\n| Land revenue   | 3.06     | 4.37     | 4.97     | 2.55    |\n| Total revenue  | 4.79     | 5.77     | 7.15     | 2.59    |\n\n* These figures are for the old District, including the Mi\u0101nw\u0101li and Isa Khel tahsils.\n\nThe District contains the two municipalities of Bannu (Edwardes\u0101b\u0101d) and Lakki. Local affairs elsewhere are managed by the District board. Its income in 1903-4 amounted to Rs. 36,300, chiefly derived from cesses, and its expenditure to Rs. 33,400, public works forming the largest item.\n\nThe regular police force consists of 410 of all ranks, of whom 58 are municipal police. The village watchmen number 334. There are 8 police stations, 2 outposts, and 7 road-posts. The border military police number 421, under a commandant who is an Assistant Commissioner. The force is directly under the orders of the Deputy-Commissioner, and is chiefly employed on the watch and ward of the border. The District jail at head-quarters can accommodate about 320 prisoners.\n\nOnly 4.1 per cent. of the population were able to read and write in 1901, the proportion being 7.3 among males, 0.2 among females. The Sikhs, with 53.7 per cent., are by far the most advanced community. Next come the Hindus (21.8), while the Muhammadan cultivators are still markedly backward (1.5). The District is, however, making distinct progress in literacy, and even Wazirs are sometimes met with who appreciate the value of reading and writing. The spread of female education, due mainly to the missionaries but partly also to the Arya Sam\u0101j, has been steady.\n\nThe number of pupils under instruction was 6,501 in 1880-1, 5,166 in 1890-1, 7,234 in 1900-1, and 3,447 in 1903-4. In the last year the District possessed 3 secondary and 22 primary (public) schools, and 48 advanced and 127 elementary (private) schools, with 55 girls in the public schools. The total expenditure on education was Rs. 25,000, of which Government contributed Rs. 4,700, Local funds Rs. 5,100, municipal funds Rs. 11,200, and fees Rs. 3,900.\n\nBesides the civil hospital at Bannu, the District possesses one dispensary at Lakki, with 53 beds in all. In 1904 the number of cases treated was 31,888, including 687 in-patients, and 1,330 operations were performed. The income was Rs. 7,400, of which Local funds contributed Rs. 1,500 and municipal funds Rs. 5,900.\n\n* These figures are for the old District, including the Mi\u0101nw\u0101li and Isa Khel tahsils.\nThe number of successful vaccinations in 1903-4 amounted to 10,424, representing 45 per 1,000 of the population. Vaccination is compulsory only in the town of Bannu.\n\n[District Gazetteer (1877, under revision).]\n\n**Bannu Tahsil.**\u2014Tahsil of Bannu District, North-West Frontier Province, lying between 32\u00b0 41' and 33\u00b0 5' N. and 70\u00b0 22' and 70\u00b0 58' E., with an area of 443 square miles. The tahsil is a green, fertile oasis, well wooded and watered, and much intersected by water-channels. Its population in 1901 was 130,444, compared with 129,324 in 1891. It contains the town of Bannu (population, 14,291), the tahsil and District head-quarters; and 217 villages. The land revenue and cesses amounted in 1903-4 to Rs. 1,62,930.\n\n**Bannu Town** (or Edwardes\u0101b\u0101d).\u2014Head-quarters of the District and tahsil of Bannu, North-West Frontier Province, situated in 33\u00b0 0' N. and 70\u00b0 36' E., near the north-west corner of the District, one mile south of the Kurram river, 79 south of Koh\u0101t, and 89 north of Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n. Population (1901), 14,291, including cantonment and civil lines (4,349). It was founded in 1848 by Lieutenant (afterwards Sir Herbert) Edwardes, who selected the site for political reasons. The fort, erected at the same time, bore the name of Dhulipgarh (Dalipgarh), in honour of the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 of Lahore; and the bazar was also known as Dhulipnagar (Dalipnagar). A town gradually grew up around the bazar, and many Hindu traders removed hither from B\u0101z\u0101r Ahmad Kh\u0101n, which had formed the commercial centre of the Bannu valley prior to annexation. The Church Missionary Society supports a small church and a high school founded in 1865. The cantonment centres in the fort of Dhulipgarh. Its garrison consists of a mountain battery, a regiment of native cavalry, and two regiments of infantry. The municipality was constituted in 1867. The municipal receipts and expenditure during the ten years ending 1903-4 averaged Rs. 46,000. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 47,000, chiefly derived from octroi; and the expenditure was Rs. 55,000. The receipts and expenditure of cantonment funds during the ten years ending 1902-3 averaged Rs. 4,200 and Rs. 3,700. The profuse irrigation and insufficient drainage of the surrounding fields render Bannu an unhealthy station. The town has a considerable trade, embracing the whole traffic in local produce of the Bannu valley. The nearest railway station is at Koh\u0101t on the Khush\u0101lgarh-Thal branch of the North-Western Railway, 79 miles distant by road. A weekly fair collects an average number of 8,000 buyers and sellers. The chief articles of trade are cloth, live-stock; wool, cotton, tobacco, and grain. Bannu possesses a dispensary and two high schools, a public library, and a town hall known as the Nicholson Memorial.\n\n**Bann\u016br.**\u2014Town in the Tirumak\u016bdal-Narsipur t\u0101luk of Mysore District, Mysore, situated in 12\u00b0 20' N. and 76\u00b0 52' E., 16 miles south-east\nof Seringapatam. Population (1901), 5,119. The Sanskrit name was Vahnipura, which became Banniyur, and now Bannur. This was an important place in the eighth and tenth centuries under the Gangas. In the twelfth century it was a great agrah\u0101ra named Janan\u0101thachaturvedimangala, with 1,200 Br\u0101hmans. Under Vijayanagar rule grants were made there by the Mysore R\u0101j\u0101s and local chiefs. The municipality dates from 1899. The receipts and expenditure during the two years ending 1901 averaged Rs. 2,100 and Rs. 1,700. In 1903\u20134 they were Rs. 1,800 and Rs. 1,000.\n\nBanp\u0101s.\u2014Village in the head-quarters subdivision of Burdwan District, Bengal, situated in 23\u00b0 23' N. and 87\u00b0 49' E. Population (1901), 1,425. It is noted for its manufactures of brass and bell-metal ware and cutlery.\n\nB\u0101nsb\u0101ria (B\u0101nsb\u0101ti, 'the place of bamboos').\u2014Town in the head-quarters subdivision of Hooghly District, Bengal, situated in 22\u00b0 58' N. and 88\u00b0 24' E., on the west bank of the Hooghly. Population (1901), 6,473. The town contains a group of three temples, of which the best known is that of Hanseswari, with thirteen pinnacles and an image of Siva in each. It was built in 1819 by R\u0101n\u012b Sankar\u012b D\u0101s\u012b, the wife of a zamind\u0101r of the place, at a cost of 5 lakhs of rupees, and was formerly protected against the Mar\u0101th\u0101s by a fort armed with four cannon. The group of temples occupies 15 acres of ground. Several tols or Sanskrit schools were formerly maintained at B\u0101nsb\u0101ria, but Sanskrit studies are now on the decline. A considerable trade in brass and bell-metal ware and bricks is carried on. B\u0101nsb\u0101ria was constituted a municipality in 1869. The income during the decade ending 1901\u20132 averaged Rs. 6,600, and the expenditure Rs. 5,600. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 9,000, of which Rs. 4,000 was derived from a tax on persons; and the expenditure was Rs. 6,600. The old village of Tribeni is included in the municipal area.\n\nB\u0101nsda State (W\u0101nsda).\u2014State in the Political Agency of Surat, Bombay, lying between 20\u00b0 42' and 20\u00b0 56' N. and 73\u00b0 18' and 73\u00b0 34' E., with an area of 215 square miles. It is bounded on the west by Surat District; on the north by the State of Baroda; on the east by the D\u0101ng States; and on the south by the State of Dharampur. With the exception of a few villages bordering on Surat, almost the whole country is covered with forest, the surface in some places being level and in others rising into rocks and small hills. The annual rainfall averages about 80 inches. The climate is unhealthy, fevers and other diseases prevailing throughout the year. At Unai, on the border of B\u0101nsda and Baroda territory and 7 miles from B\u0101nsda, is a hot spring, the temperature of which is generally but little below boiling-point; but once a year, at the time of the March full moon, the heat abates sufficiently to allow a company of pilgrims and devotees to bathe in it.\nThe fair at this period is attended by 6,000 or 7,000 people and lasts for six days.\n\nThe family of the chief are Hindus of R\u0101jput extraction, claiming descent from the Solanki race. The ruins of the fortified enclosure near B\u0101nsda, and of several temples and works of irrigation, point to a former period of prosperity. At one time the chiefs probably had possessions extending to the sea-coast; but by the advance of the Musalm\u0101ns they were gradually driven to seek refuge in the more thickly wooded part of their dominions. The Mar\u0101th\u0101s seem to have been the first to bring the chiefs entirely into subjection and to impose a tribute upon them. The right of levying this tribute was transferred by the Peshw\u0101 to the British under the Treaty of Bassein (1802). The State now pays to the Government a tribute of Rs. 7,351 and a chauth of Rs. 1,500. The chief bears the title of R\u0101j\u0101 and is entitled to a salute of 9 guns. The family follows the rule of primogeniture and has received a sanad authorizing adoption.\n\nAccording to the Census of 1901, the population numbered 40,382: namely, 39,256 Hindus, 974 Musalm\u0101ns, and 104 P\u0101rsis, distributed in one town (B\u0100NSDA) and 86 villages. The population consists almost entirely of wild tribes, such as Koknas, Chodhr\u0101s, Dhondias, and Gamtas, who speak a corrupt Gujar\u0101t\u012b.\n\nThere are some tracts of black soil, but over the greater part of the State the soil is light-coloured. The total cultivable area is 109 square miles, of which 56\u00bd square miles were cultivated in 1903\u20134, 50 remained waste, and the remainder had been alienated. The chief crops are rice, n\u0101gli, kodra, and pulse. Cotton and wheat have recently been introduced and are progressing well. Seventy-five square miles of land are under forest, managed on the British system of conservancy. The chief manufactures are cotton tape, mats, fans, baskets, and coarse woollen carpets and cloths.\n\nThe R\u0101j\u0101 has power to try his own subjects for capital offences. He maintains no regular troops, but has a force consisting of 34 mounted men and 33 Arabs who perform miscellaneous duties about the court. The number of police is 131. The State contains one jail, with a daily average of seven prisoners in 1903\u20134. Formerly the land revenue system consisted in leasing groups of villages to contractors (ij\u0101rad\u0101rs) for terms of five years. But when in 1876 B\u0101nsda came under British administration on account of the minority of the chief, it was determined, as the leases fell in, to replace them by a settlement direct with the cultivators. Since the introduction of survey operations, which were completed in 1884, the lands have been systematically classed and assessed. The rates per acre now in force range from Rs. 2\u20135 to Rs. 11\u20134 for rice land, and from 2 annas to Rs. 4\u20136 for \u2018dry crops.\u2019 The gross revenue and expenditure of the State in 1903\u20134 were about\n3\u00bd lakhs and 2\u00bd lakhs, including one lakh spent as special charges. The principal items of revenue are land and excise, each over a lakh; forests, Rs. 10,000; and a sum of about Rs. 3,400 paid by the Baroda State and the British Government. In 1873 the R\u0101j\u0101 agreed to abolish transit duties for an annual payment of Rs. 8,698 from the British Government. There are fourteen boys' schools and one girls' school in the State, maintained at a cost of Rs. 5,271, with an average daily attendance in 1903\u20134 of 416. Only 1,289 persons were returned as literate in 1901. The boys of the wild tribes are allowed free education in the State schools. B\u0101nsda contains a hospital and a travelling dispensary, which together treated 28,000 persons in 1903\u20134. The expenditure of the B\u0101nsda municipality is wholly borne by the State.\n\n**B\u0101nsda Town.**\u2014Chief town of the State of the same name in the Surat Agency, Bombay, situated in 20\u00b0 47\u2032 N. and 73\u00b0 28\u2032 E. Population (1901), 3,760. The town contains a dispensary, and is administered as a municipality at the cost of the State.\n\n**B\u0101nsd\u012bh Tahsil.**\u2014North-central tahsil of Balli\u0101 District, United Provinces, comprising the parganas of Kharid and Sikandarpur (East), and lying south of the Gogra between 25\u00b0 47\u2032 and 26\u00b0 7\u2032 N. and 83\u00b0 54\u2032 and 84\u00b0 31\u2032 E., with an area of 371 square miles. Population increased from 281,531 in 1891 to 293,919 in 1901. There are 515 villages and five towns: Sahatw\u0101r (population, 10,784), B\u0101nsd\u012bh, the tahsil headquarters (10,024), Maniar (9,483), Reot\u012b (8,631), and Sikandarpur (7,414). The demand for land revenue in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 1,74,000, and for cesses Rs. 47,000. The density of population, 792 persons per square mile, is about the District average. The tahsil is much intersected by side channels from the Gogra, and a considerable portion is flooded annually. The area under cultivation in 1903\u20134 was 256 square miles, of which 92 were irrigated. Irrigation is more required in this tahsil than in the alluvial tract bordering on the Ganges. Wells supply about eight-ninths of the irrigated area, and tanks and streams the remainder.\n\n**B\u0101nsd\u012bh Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of the tahsil of the same name in Balli\u0101 District, United Provinces, situated in 25\u00b0 53\u2032 N. and 84\u00b0 14\u2032 E., 10 miles north of Balli\u0101 town. Population (1901), 10,024. The town formerly belonged to Narauli\u0101 R\u0101jputs, whose possessions have been bought up by the Bhuinh\u0101rs. It is administered under Act XX of 1856, with an income of about Rs. 1,200. Besides the ordinary offices, B\u0101nsd\u012bh contains a dispensary and a town school with 84 pupils. There is little or no trade.\n\n**B\u0101nsgaon Tahsil.**\u2014South-western tahsil of Gorakhpur District, United Provinces, comprising the parganas of Bhau\u0101p\u0101r, Unaula, Dhuri\u0101p\u0101r, and Chill\u016bp\u0101r, and lying between 26\u00b0 14\u2032 and 26\u00b0 43\u2032 N. and 83\u00b0 4\u2032 and 83\u00b0 44\u2032 E., with an area of 614 square miles. Popu-\nlation fell from 451,606 in 1891 to 438,364 in 1901. There are 1,667 villages and four towns, of which Barhalganj (population, 5,181) and B\u0101nsgaon (5,034), the tahsil head-quarters, are the largest. The demand for land revenue in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 3,59,000, and for cesses Rs. 72,000. In 1904 the tahsil was reduced from the limits described above by the transfer of 115 villages with an area of 52 square miles, which lay south of the Gogra, to Azamgarh District. The land revenue and cesses due from these villages amounted to Rs. 18,000 and Rs. 3,000 respectively. The density of population, 714 persons per square mile, is above the District average. B\u0101nsgaon is bounded on the north by the Am\u012b river, on the south by the Gogra, and on the east by the R\u0101pt\u012b. After heavy rains a considerable area near the Am\u012b and R\u0101pt\u012b is flooded, owing to the inability of the rivers to carry off the drainage. The Kuw\u0101n\u0101 flows across the south-west corner. The area under cultivation in 1903\u20134 was 429 square miles, of which 199 were irrigated. Wells supply about a quarter of the irrigated area, and tanks, swamps, and small streams the remainder.\n\nB\u0101nsgaon Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the tahsil of the same name in Gorakhpur District, United Provinces, situated in 26\u00b0 33' N. and 83\u00b0 22' E., 19 miles south of Gorakhpur city. Population (1901), 5,034. The town is composed of ten hamlets, and is purely agricultural. There is no trade, and the place derives its only importance from its position as head-quarters of a tahsildar and a Munsif. The town school has about 275 pupils, and a girls' school has 17.\n\nBansgaw\u0101.\u2014Village in the Padraun\u0101 tahsil of Gorakhpur District, United Provinces, situated in 26\u00b0 48' N. and 84\u00b0 12' E., 64 miles east of Gorakhpur city. Population (1901), 5,009. An aided school has 31 pupils.\n\nB\u0101nsi.\u2014North-eastern tahsil of Basti District, United Provinces, comprising the parganas of Bin\u0101yakpur and B\u0101nsi (East), and lying between 27\u00b0 and 27\u00b0 28' N. and 82\u00b0 46' and 83\u00b0 14' E., with an area of 621 square miles. Population increased from 362,724 in 1891 to 402,277 in 1901, the rate of increase being the highest in the District. There are 1,343 villages and only one town, Usk\u0101 (population, 6,718). The demand for land revenue in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 3,96,000, and for cesses Rs. 77,000. The density of population, 648 persons per square mile, is almost the District average. The tahsil extends from the border of Nep\u0101l to the south of the R\u0101pt\u012b river. The northern portion is intersected by a number of small streams, and chiefly produces rice. The area under cultivation in 1903\u20134 was 463 square miles, of which 144 were irrigated. Tanks and swamps are the chief sources of supply; but the smaller rivers are also largely used, and an extensive system of dams and irrigation channels has been constructed by European zamind\u0101rs.\nB\u0101ns\u012b.\u2014Principal town of an estate of the same name in the State of Udaipur, R\u0101jput\u0101na, situated in $24^\\circ 20'$ N. and $74^\\circ 24'$ E., about 47 miles south-east of Udaipur city. Population (1901), 1,265. The estate, which is held by one of the first-class nobles of Mew\u0101r, who is styled R\u0101wat, consists of 59 villages, containing 5,736 inhabitants, of whom over 41 per cent. are Bhils. The income is about Rs. 24,000, and a tribute of about Rs. 162 is paid to the Darb\u0101r. The R\u0101wats of B\u0101ns\u012b belong to the Shaktawat family of the Sesodia R\u0101jputs.\n\nB\u0101nsror.\u2014Estate and head-quarters thereof in the State of Udaipur, R\u0101jput\u0101na. See BHAINSRORGARH.\n\nB\u0101nsw\u0101da.\u2014Formerly a t\u0101luk in Ind\u016br (now Niz\u0101m\u0101b\u0101d) District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State. In 1901 the area was 542 square miles, and the population, including j\u0101girs, was 80,888, compared with 78,657 in 1891. It contained 141 villages, of which 76 were j\u0101gir. The land revenue in 1901 was 2\u00b74 lakhs. In 1905 the t\u0101luk was divided between the Degl\u016br t\u0101luk of N\u0101nder District and Bodhan and Yell\u0101reddipet in Niz\u0101m\u0101b\u0101d.\n\nB\u0101nsw\u0101ra State.\u2014The southernmost State in R\u0101jput\u0101na, lying between $23^\\circ 3'$ and $23^\\circ 55'$ N. and $73^\\circ 58'$ and $74^\\circ 47'$ E., with an area of 1,946 square miles. It is bounded on the north by Part\u0101bgarh and Mew\u0101r; on the west by Dungarpur and Sunth; on the south by Jh\u0101lod, Jh\u0101bua, and a portion of the Petl\u0101wad pargana of Indore; and on the east by Sail\u0101na, Ratl\u0101m, and Part\u0101bgarh. It is said to take its name from a Bhil chieftain named W\u0101sna, whose p\u0101l or village was on the site of the present town of B\u0101nsw\u0101ra, and who was defeated and slain about 1530 by Jagm\u0101l, the first chief of this State. Others say the word means the country of the bamboo (b\u0101ns).\n\nThe western portion of the State is comparatively open and well cultivated; but the rest of the country, especially in the south and east, is covered with rugged hills, rocks, scrub jungle, and woodland. A line of hills runs all through the eastern part, attaining in places an altitude of from 1,700 to 1,900 feet. After heavy rains, the principal river, the Mahi, is impassable even by rafts, sometimes for days together. It is said to have overflowed its banks in 1858, inundating the neighbouring lands and causing much loss of life. Its chief tributary is the An\u0101s, which enters the State in the south, and flows first in a northerly direction forming the boundary with Jh\u0101lod, and next west, the total course in or along the border of B\u0101nsw\u0101ra being about 50 miles. There are numerous minor rivers or streams, the more important being the Erau or Air\u0101v and the Ch\u0101p. The country has been described as the most beautiful portion of R\u0101jput\u0101na. It looks its best just after the rains, when the varied hues of the foliage, the luxuriant growth of the tall\ngrasses, and the streams dashing down the hill-sides or purling through shady glens, between banks fringed with ferns and flowers, present a most pleasing picture.\n\nIn the western part of the State the rocks consist of gneiss, upon which rest unconformably a few outliers of the schists and quartzites of the Aravalli and Delhi systems respectively, while in the east these rocks are covered by Deccan trap.\n\nBesides the ordinary small game, including jungle-fowl, a few tigers, leopards, bears, sambhar (Cervus unicolor), and chital (C. axis) are to be found, and occasionally wild dogs and wolves.\n\nThe climate is relaxing and generally unpleasant; fevers of a malignant nature prevail during the two months succeeding the rains. The temperature at the capital varies from $58^\\circ$ in the winter to $108^\\circ$ in the summer, while the annual rainfall averages nearly 38 inches, ranging from over 65 inches in 1893 to about 14 inches in 1899. The fall in the south-east of the State is generally slightly heavier than at the capital.\n\nFrom about the beginning of the thirteenth to the beginning of the sixteenth century the greater part of the country now styled Banswara was ruled by the chiefs of Dungarpur or Bagar, as the entire tract was, and is even now frequently, called; and it became a separate State about 1530. Two accounts are given of the manner in which this occurred. One story relates that Udai Singh, chief of Bagar, who was killed at the battle of Khanua in March, 1527, ordered that, on his death, his territory should be divided between his two sons, Prithwi Raj and Jagmal, and that this was done, the latter receiving the eastern portion as his share. The other account is that Jagmal was left for dead at Khanua, but recovered, and, on returning to his country, was disowned and treated as an impostor. He thereupon betook himself to the hills north of the present town of Banswara, and proceeded to harass his elder brother, Prithwi Raj. Finding this continual border warfare intolerable, the two brothers agreed to accept a partition of their lands by the Rajah of Dh\u00e4r, and accordingly the river Mahi was fixed as the boundary between the two States of Banswara and Dungarpur. Whichever account be correct, and the latter is believed to be the more trustworthy, the chiefs of Banswara are a junior branch of the Dungarpur family, and consequently Sesodia Rajputs of the Ahariya sept. Of subsequent chiefs, two are worthy of mention: namely, Kushal Singh, who, towards the end of the seventeenth century, is said to have wrested from the Bhils the country in the south-east and called it Kushalgarh after himself; and Prithwi Singh (1747\u201386), who plundered the neighbouring State of Sunth and seized its district of Chilkari or Shergarh in the south-west of Banswara. These two tracts are now held respec-\ntively by the Raos of Kush\u0101lgarh and Garhi, two of the principal nobles. Towards the end of the eighteenth century B\u0101nsw\u0101ra became more or less subject to the Mar\u0101th\u0101s, and paid tribute to the R\u0101j\u0101 of Dh\u0101r. In 1812 the Mah\u0101r\u0101wal offered to become tributary to the British Government on condition of the expulsion of the Mar\u0101th\u0101s, but no definite relations were formed with him till the end of 1818. By the treaty then concluded he agreed to act in subordinate co-operation to, and settle his affairs in accordance with the advice of, the British Government, and to pay to it all arrears of tribute due to Dh\u0101r or any other State, besides whatever tribute Government might deem adequate, provided it did not exceed three-eighths of his revenue. The tribute proper has varied from time to time, but for a good many years it was S\u0101lim sh\u0101h\u012b Rs. 35,000. Since 1904 it has been fixed at Rs. 17,500, British coin. In addition to tribute proper, the State has paid annually, since 1889, a sum of Rs. 5,000 towards the cost of additional political supervision rendered necessary by the disorders of its administration. The late Mah\u0101r\u0101wal, Lachhman Singh, died in 1905, after a rule of sixty-one years, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Shambhu Singh, who was born in October, 1868. The chief of this State bears the title of Mah\u0101r\u0101wal, and receives a salute of 15 guns.\n\nThere is not much of archaeological interest in B\u0101nsw\u0101ra, apart from the ruins of a fine Jain temple at K\u0101linjara and the remains of about a dozen Hindu and Jain temples at the village of Arthuna in the south-west. An inscription dated 1080, found in the Mandanesh or Mandlesar temple at Arthuna, shows that the latter place was once an extensive city (Uchhunak Nagar or P\u0101tan), the capital of the Param\u0101ra chiefs of B\u0101gar.\n\nThe number of towns and villages in the State is 1,287, and the population at the three enumerations was: (1881) 152,045, (1891) 211,641, and (1901) 165,350. The last Census was the first regular one ever taken; for, in 1881, the population of the Kush\u0101lgarh estate and many of the Bhils in the rest of the territory were not actually counted, their numbers being roughly guessed, while in 1891 a similar procedure was followed as regards the Bhils of Kush\u0101lgarh. The decline in 1901 was due in part to more accurate enumeration at that Census, and in part to excessive mortality during, and immediately after, the famine of 1899-1900. The State, which in 1901 was split up into an unnecessarily large number of districts or th\u0101nas, now consists of two divisions, the northern and the southern, more or less equal in area and population. The headquarters of the former are at Bhongra, and of the latter at K\u0101linjara. More than 63 per cent. of the people are Animists and 30 per cent. Hindus. The language mainly spoken is Bhili or V\u0101gdi.\nBy far the most numerous tribe is that of the Bh\u012bls, who, in 1901, numbered 104,329, or 63 per cent. of the total; they are to be found throughout the State, and are especially troublesome in the south. Next come the Kunbis (11,000), the Br\u0101hmans (9,600), the Mah\u0101jans (7,000), and the R\u0101jputs (5,000). About 67 per cent. of the population are dependent on the land.\n\nAgriculture does not flourish as well as might be expected in a country so favoured by nature as B\u0101nsw\u0101ra. The soil is, for the most part, excellent. The black cotton variety in the west, especially near the Mah\u012b river, is said to be sufficiently fertile to yield two full crops annually without artificial irrigation, while in the north a rich red loam is found. But almost all of the agriculturists are Bhils, who, besides being unskilled, are lazy; they cultivate chiefly in the rains, and are conservative or shy, confining their operations to small patches round their huts. The Br\u0101hmans and P\u0101tels, found mostly in the west, are industrious cultivators, but few in number; without much trouble or expense they gather fine crops of maize and rice in the autumn, and wheat, barley, gram, and sugar-cane in the spring; but the Bhils prefer the w\u0101lar or walra system of cultivation, so injurious to the forests. It consists of cutting down trees and shrubs and strewing them over the ground, where they are left to dry till the end of the hot season, when they are burnt. After the first fall of rain the land is ploughed once, and sown generally with maize or inferior millets known locally as kuri and kodra.\n\nIrrigation is mainly from wells and tanks, but only a small area is supplied. Large stretches of fertile land, in which water could easily be obtained, do not possess a single well, while tanks are few and far between, though something has been done in this direction during recent years.\n\nMore than half of the State is covered with jungle, the forests being most dense in the north-east. The best trees are teak, black-wood, ebony, pipal (Ficus religiosa), haldu (Adina cordifolia), s\u0101l\u0101r (Boswellia serrata), dh\u0101k (Butea frondosa), and kadamb (Anthocephalus Cadamba); but they are in no way preserved and are of little benefit to the Darb\u0101r. The fruit trees include the mango and the mahu\u0101 (Bassia latifolia); the wild date-palm is to be found in all low-lying ground, and the bamboo on the hills. The Bhil, however, spares none but sacred groves and fruit trees, and the forests are being gradually ruined.\n\nThe mineral products are unimportant, the old iron mines at Kh\u0101mera and Loh\u0101ria have long been abandoned, and the quarries at Talw\u0101ra and Chh\u012bnch are only occasionally worked, yielding a hard white stone fairly suitable for building.\nManufactures are primitive, consisting of the production of coarse cotton cloth, a little silver jewellery, lac bangles, and wooden toys.\n\nThe trade is with the neighbouring tracts, the chief exports in good years being grain, wood, honey, and *mahua* flowers, and the chief imports piece-goods, salt, and tobacco.\n\nThere is no railway in the State, the nearest stations being Naml\u012b and Ratl\u0101m on the R\u0101jput\u0101na-M\u0101lw\u0101 Railway to the east, and Bhairongarh on the Godhra-Ratl\u0101m line to the south. The roads are all unmetalled, but are generally practicable for carts during the greater part of the year. There are four British post offices (at B\u0101nsw\u0101ra town, Chh\u012bnch, Garhi, and Kush\u0101lgarh) and one telegraph office (at B\u0101nsw\u0101ra).\n\nNo records exist of any severe famine save that of 1899\u20131900; but 1836, 1861, 1865, and 1877\u20138 were years of scarcity and high prices. In 1899\u20131900 the rainfall was only about 14 inches, and the harvest was more or less a failure. Little or nothing was at first done for the Bh\u012bls, who suffered severely and took to crime. Subsequent relief measures did a good deal to allay the distress, but the mortality among human beings was higher than it should have been and from 30 to 50 per cent. of the cattle perished. The expenditure, including advances to agriculturists and land revenue remitted and suspended, was about 3 lakhs. The distress in 1901\u20132 was not so acute, and was due as much to a plague of rats as to short rainfall. The expenditure on this occasion approached a lakh.\n\nThe State is ordinarily governed by the chief with the assistance of a K\u0101md\u0101r or minister and a *th\u0101nad\u0101r*, possessing very limited powers, in each of the districts. In consequence of the advanced age of the late chief, the indebtedness of the State, and misgovernment generally, it was found necessary in 1904 to place the administration in the hands of a council under the direct control of a Political officer; and this arrangement continued till 1906, when Mah\u0101r\u0101wal Shambhu Singh was invested with powers. The territory is divided into two districts, each of which is under a *tahsild\u0101r*.\n\nThe judicial machinery was formerly of the rudest kind. The *th\u0101nad\u0101rs* imposed fines for petty offences, but their main duty was to arrest accused persons, hold a preliminary inquiry, and forward the cases to the capital. The powers of the Faujd\u0101r at the capital were similar; and in this way all criminal cases were decided by the K\u0101md\u0101r, subject, at uncertain periods, to the approval or otherwise of the chief. Most of the civil suits were decided by *panch\u0101yat*, a tribunal well adapted to the feelings of the people, as the decisions generally gave satisfaction. Under the system recently introduced, the *tahsild\u0101rs* are third-class magistrates, the Faujd\u0101r is a first-class magistrate, and the\ncouncil, presided over by the Mah\u0101r\u0101wal, is a Sessions Court, and also the final court of appeal. Sentences of death for the present require the confirmation of the Governor-General's Agent in R\u0101jput\u0101na. On the civil side, the Faujd\u0101r tries suits not decided by panch\u0101yats, provided their value does not exceed Rs. 10,000, while the council deals with suits beyond his powers.\n\nThe normal revenue of the State, excluding the income of the nobles, is about 1\u00b775 lakhs, of which Rs. 85,000 is derived from land, Rs. 40,000 from customs, and Rs. 15,000 as tribute from j\u0101gird\u0101rs. The normal expenditure is about 1\u00b735 lakhs, the main items being cost of administration (Rs. 32,000), privy purse and palace (Rs. 27,000), army and police (Rs. 25,000), and tribute to Government, including cost of additional political supervision (Rs. 22,500). The State owes a little less than 2 lakhs to the Government of India.\n\nThe coins most commonly used are the S\u0101lim sh\u0101hi, minted across the border in Part\u0101bgarh. In 1904 an attempt was made to introduce the British currency; but as the exchange rate fixed by Government was below the actual market rate during the period of conversion operations, only 202 S\u0101lim sh\u0101hi rupees were tendered by the public for exchange.\n\nThe land revenue system is primitive, and there is no fixed method of assessment or collection. In some cases the demand is fixed and levied in cash; in other cases the amount to be paid is determined after an inspection of the crops either before or after they have been cut, and is levied in cash or in kind, or both. Again, whole villages may be given in contract for a fixed sum, or the land may be leased to, and the revenue collected from, individual cultivators. The holders of j\u0101gir lands pay tribute (t\u012bnka); they have to perform service, and can be dispossessed for misconduct. Khair\u0101t villages, or religious and charitable allotments, are held rent-free and the holders pay no tribute. These villages are inalienable and may be said to have been granted practically in perpetuity. The first cadastral survey was started in 1904, and was followed by a rough settlement to be finished by the end of 1906.\n\nPolice duties used to be performed by a so-called army of 19 cavalry and 461 infantry, all irregulars; but this army has been abolished, and an efficient police force of 180 of all ranks, including 15 mounted men, has recently been substituted. The State jail at the capital is perhaps the most unhealthy prison in R\u0101jput\u0101na, and a new one is to be built when funds are available. Lock-ups are maintained in the districts and at Kush\u0101lgarh.\n\nIn 1901 about 2 per cent. of the population were returned as literate (4 per cent. males and 0\u00b71 per cent. females). There were four primary schools, in which Hindi was taught to about 250 boys. In 1903 an\nAnglo-vernacular school was started at the capital, and three Hindi schools were opened at other places. The State now contains fourteen schools, including one in the Garhi estate and one in Kush\u0101lgarh, and they are attended by 440 boys.\n\nThere are two hospitals, one of which has accommodation for 4 in-patients. In 1905 the number of cases treated was 18,664, of whom 29 were in-patients, and 328 operations were performed. The cost of these institutions was about Rs. 1,920.\n\nVaccination is nowhere compulsory, and, though apparently popular in Kush\u0101lgarh, is very backward in B\u0101nsw\u0101ra proper. Two vaccinators are employed, and in 1904\u20135 they vaccinated 938 persons, or nearly 6 per 1,000 of the population. In B\u0101nsw\u0101ra proper about 2 per 1,000 of the population were successfully vaccinated, and in Kush\u0101lgarh nearly 35 per 1,000.\n\n[R\u0101jput\u0101na Gazetteer, vol. i (1879, under revision).]\n\nB\u0101nsw\u0101ra Town.\u2014Capital of the State of the same name in R\u0101jput\u0101na, situated in 23\u00b0 33\u2032 N. and 74\u00b0 27\u2032 E., 42 miles from Namli and Ratl\u0101m stations on the R\u0101jput\u0101na-M\u0101lw\u0101 Railway. The population in 1901 was 7,038, of whom nearly 60 per cent. were Hindus and 28 per cent. Musalm\u0101ns. The town was founded in the early part of the sixteenth century by Jagm\u0101l, the first chief of B\u0101nsw\u0101ra, and is said to have been named after a Bhil chieftain, W\u0101sna, whom he defeated and killed. It is surrounded by a wall which, except on the south, is in very fair repair. The palace stands on rising ground to the south, and on the crest of a low ridge in its vicinity is a double-storeyed building, called the Sh\u0101hi Bil\u0101s: to the east among the low hills lies the Bai T\u0101l, on the embankment of which is a small summer palace, while in a garden about half a mile distant are the chhatris or cenotaphs of the rulers of the State. Some old ruins on the top of a hill two miles to the south are said to be the remains of a palace which was the residence of Jagm\u0101l. A fair is held annually in October, which lasts for fifteen days and is attended by some 2,000 visitors. The town possesses a post and telegraph office, a jail which has accommodation for 54 convicts and 14 under-trial prisoners and is quite unsuited for a prison, an Anglo-vernacular school opened in 1903 and attended by about 180 boys, and a hospital with accommodation for 4 in-patients.\n\nB\u0101ntva (or Gid\u0101d).\u2014Petty State in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, Bombay.\n\nB\u0101ntva.\u2014Chief town of the State of the same name in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, Bombay, situated in 21\u00b0 28\u2032 N. and 70\u00b0 7\u2032 E. Population (1901), 8,591. The town is fortified.\n\nBan\u016br Tahsil.\u2014North-eastern tahsil of the Pinjaur niz\u0101mat, Pati\u0101la State, Punjab, lying between 30\u00b0 23\u2032 and 30\u00b0 39\u2032 N. and 76\u00b0 40\u2032 and 77\u00b0 E., with an area of 163 square miles. The population in 1901 was\n56,674, compared with 60,185 in 1891. The tahsil contains the town of Ban\u016br (population, 5,610), the head-quarters, and 135 villages. The land revenue and cesses amounted in 1903-4 to 1.7 lakhs.\n\nBan\u016br Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the tahsil of the same name in the Pinjaur niz\u0101mat, Pati\u0101la State, Punjab, situated in 30\u00b0 34' N. and 76\u00b0 47' E., 10 miles north-east of R\u0101jpura. Population (1901), 5,610, compared with 6,671 in 1881, a decrease due to its distance from the railway and an unhealthy climate. The ruins that surround it testify to its former importance. Its ancient name is said to have been Pushpa or Popa Nagri or Pushp\u0101wati, 'the city of flowers'; and it was once famous for the scent distilled from its chambeli gardens, an industry which has all but disappeared. First mentioned in B\u0101bar's memoirs, it became a mah\u0101l of the government of Sirhind under Akbar. It was wrested from the Mughal empire by the Singhpuria Sikhs and Amar Singh, R\u0101j\u0101 of Pati\u0101la, after the fall of Sirhind in 1763; and eventually it came into the exclusive possession of Pati\u0101la. It was defended by the old imperial fort of Zulimgarh and one of more recent date. The tomb of Malik Sulaim\u0101n, father of the Saiyid ruler Khizr Kh\u0101n, is shown in the town. Ban\u016br has now no trade worth mention, but contains a vernacular middle school and a dispensary.\n\nBaoni (or Kadaura).\u2014A petty sanad State in Central India, under the Bundelkhand Agency, lying between 25\u00b0 54' and 26\u00b0 10' N. and 79\u00b0 45' and 80\u00b0 2' E., with an area of about 122 square miles. It is bounded north by Cawnpore District, west by J\u0101laun, and on all other sides by the Ham\u012brpur District of the United Provinces. It takes its name from b\u0101zwan, 'fifty-two,' the number of villages granted by the original sanad. The climate is hot but healthy, and the annual rainfall averages 32 inches.\n\nBaoni is the only Muhammadan State in Bundelkhand. Its chiefs are descendants of the brilliant but unscrupulous Im\u0101d-ul-mulk Gh\u0101zi-ud-din, the grandson of Asaf Jah, Niz\u0101m of Hyder\u0101b\u0101d, and Wazir of the empire for a time. Gh\u0101zi-ud-din made terms with the Peshw\u0101, and obtained a j\u0101g\u012br of 52 villages near K\u0101lp\u012b about 1784. When the British supremacy was established, Naw\u0101b Nas\u012br-ud-daula was found in possession of 49 villages, 3 having been sequestrated by Mar\u0101th\u0101 officials. The Naw\u0101b in 1806 petitioned for their restoration; and after some discussion the validity of the Peshw\u0101's grant was recognized, and the original holding of 52 villages restored. He was succeeded in 1815 by Amir-ul-mulk, who was followed by his son Naw\u0101b Muhammad Husain Kh\u0101n. During the Mutiny of 1857, Naw\u0101b Muhammad Husain Kh\u0101n and his son Mahdi Hasan Kh\u0101n, who was actually carrying on the administration, were instrumental in saving the lives of several Europeans at great risk to themselves. In 1862 a sanad was granted to the chief guaranteeing the succession, in case of failure\nof issue, to his heirs as recognized by Muhammadan law; and in 1863, as a reward for various liberal measures adopted, the chief's titles were increased. In 1874, at the special request of the Naw\u0101b, who was in bad health, the management of the State was taken over by the Government until 1883, when he abdicated in favour of his son, Muhammad Hasan Kh\u0101n. Land was ceded for the Betw\u0101 Canal in 1884. Muhammad Hasan Kh\u0101n died of cholera in 1893, while on a pilgrimage to Mecca, and was succeeded by the present chief, Muhammad Ri\u0101z-ul-Hasan Kh\u0101n, his nephew, the State remaining under superintendence until 1902. The chief bears the titles of His Highness and Azam-ul-umara, S\u0101hib J\u0101h, Mih\u012bn Sard\u0101r Naw\u0101b, and receives a salute of 11 guns.\n\nThe population at the last three enumerations was: (1881) 17,055, (1891) 18,441, and (1901) 19,780, giving a density of 162 persons per square mile. There has been an increase of 7 per cent. during the last decade. The State contains 52 villages. Hindus number 17,341, or 87 per cent., and Musulm\u0101ns 2,415, or 12 per cent. The Ban\u0101phari dialect of Bundelkhandi is the prevailing form of speech. The principal castes are Bundel\u0101 Th\u0101kurs, 1,900; Ah\u012brs, 1,500; K\u0101chhis, 1,500; Br\u0101hmans, 1,200; Dh\u012bmars and Kol\u012bs, 1,100 each. Among Musalm\u0101ns, Shaikhs number 1,400. Agriculture supports 40 per cent. and general labour 32 per cent. of the population.\n\nOf the total area, 66 square miles, or 54 per cent., are cultivated, of which 854 acres are irrigable; 21 square miles are cultivable; 15 square miles are under scrub jungle; and the rest waste. The State lies in a fairly fertile region, growing good crops of all the ordinary grains.\n\nA metalled road is under construction from the chief town of Kadaura to K\u0101lp\u012b on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, a distance of 15 miles. A British combined post and telegraph office is situated at Kadaura.\n\nThe chief personally directs the administration, and in criminal matters exercises the powers of a District Magistrate, all cases beyond these powers being dwelt with by the Political Agent.\n\nThe total revenue of the State is one lakh, of which Rs. 95,000 is derived from land. The cost of administration is Rs. 75,000.\n\nThe police force consists of 14 men, with 46 chaukid\u0101rs. A jail, three vernacular schools, and a hospital are maintained, and the State has lately been surveyed and settled on the same lines as adjoining British territory.\n\nB\u0101panattam.\u2014Village in the Palmaner t\u0101luk of North Arcot District, Madras, situated in 13\u00b0 5' N. and 78\u00b0 41' E., 17 miles from Palmaner. It is noteworthy for its extraordinary collection of prehistoric kistvaens, which are called by the natives the temples of the Five\nP\u0101ndavas. There are others elsewhere in the t\u0101luk, but nowhere are they so numerous as near this village. A few of them were explored by Lieut.-Colonel Branfil of the Trigonometrical Survey, who described the result in a paper in vol. x of the Indian Antiquary. They are of unusual interest from the size, shape, and arrangement of the slabs of which they are composed, as well as from their great number. It has been suggested that these kistvaens are tombs of the Kurumbas, a tribe who are still very numerous in this neighbourhood and were once, according to tradition, a powerful clan. They are sometimes called kurumbarkudi ('Kurumbas' houses') in Tamil.\n\nB\u0101patla T\u0101luk.\u2014T\u0101luk of Gunt\u016br District, Madras, situated on the coast between 15\u00b0 37' and 16\u00b0 16' N. and 80\u00b0 8' and 80\u00b0 37' E., with an area of 679 square miles. The population in 1901 was 213,456, compared with 181,940 in 1891. It contains three towns\u2014B\u0101patla (population, 8,595), the head-quarters, Ch\u012brala (16,264), and V\u0113tap\u0101lemu (9,547)\u2014and 111 villages. The demand on account of land revenue and cesses in 1903\u20134 amounted to Rs. 9,33,000. Its physical features differ greatly in different parts. The north-west portion is black cotton soil, flooded in wet weather but terribly dried up during the hot season, when the villagers in some places have to carry water for miles to their houses. A large portion is deltaic alluvium and is irrigated, the contrast between the expanse of green rice-fields here and the barren-looking villages a few miles north-west being very striking. Parallel to the coast and for some miles inland runs a long sand ridge, which shuts in the drainage flowing towards the sea and causes an enormous swamp communicating with the sea at Chinna Ganj\u0101m.\n\nB\u0101patla Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the t\u0101luk of the same name in Gunt\u016br District, Madras, situated in 15\u00b0 55' N. and 80\u00b0 28' E., on an elevated sand ridge about 5 miles from the sea. Population (1901), 8,595. It is a station on the East Coast Railway, and contains the offices of a District Munsif and tahsild\u0101r, and a good travellers' bungalow. The place is administered as a Union.\n\nB\u0101r\u0101 River.\u2014A small river in the North-West Frontier Province, which rises in the highlands of Tir\u0101h, and flows eastward between the Safed Koh and its offshoot the Surghar range on the north and the Torghar or Zi\u0101-ud-din range, which divides it from the Mast\u016bra valley, on the south. In Tir\u0101h the B\u0101r\u0101 valley is closely confined between these lofty, rugged, and pine-clad ranges; but it is thickly dotted with fortified homesteads, and the passage by the British force in 1897 was most arduous. Entering Pesh\u0101war District near Fort B\u0101r\u0101, a few miles south-west of Pesh\u0101war city, the B\u0101r\u0101 takes a north-easterly course and falls into the K\u0101bul river after a total length of about 100 miles. The water-supply of Pesh\u0101war is drawn from this river by a closed masonry flume taking off 2 miles above the fort. The river has cut its way\nthrough the soft soil of the Pesh\u0101war valley to a considerable depth and now runs far below the level of the surrounding country, but from time immemorial it has been used for irrigation on both banks. The supply of water is, however, small, not exceeding 158 cubic feet per second as a rule, though after rain in the Tir\u0101h hills it is greatly increased, and the stream then brings down a reddish silt which is extremely fertilizing. In 1898 a weir was constructed near the Afridi village of Ilm Gudr at a cost of Rs. 20,000. The B\u0101ra canal, taking off here on the north bank, has two branches named after the tribes whose lands they command: the Khalil or Sangu, which cost Rs. 23,500; and the Mohmand or Shaikh\u0101n, which cost Rs. 20,600. These branches were so designed as not to interfere with the ancient watercourses, over which they were carried by means of aqueducts. Both branches run through tunnels in conglomerate rock immediately above the weir, the Sangu tunnel being 1,600 feet in length and the Shaikh\u0101n 710 feet. The head-works are protected by a blockhouse. The canal is managed by the Deputy-Commissioner under the Pesh\u0101war Canal Regulation of 1898. It irrigated 57 square miles in 1903\u20134.\n\nB\u0101ra Tahsil.\u2014The westernmost of the three trans-Jumna tahsils in Allah\u0101b\u0101d District, United Provinces, conterminous with the pargana of the same name, lying between 25\u00b0 2' and 25\u00b0 22' N. and 81\u00b0 31' and 81\u00b0 49' E., with an area of 253 square miles. Population fell from 63,816 in 1891 to 55,503 in 1901. There are 237 villages, but no town. The demand for land revenue in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 1,24,000, and for cesses Rs. 20,000; but the revenue demand has since been reduced to Rs. 1,02,000, and in future will be liable to revision every five years. The density of population, 219 persons per square mile, is the lowest in the District. This tahsil presents the characteristic features of Bundelkhand\u2014low ranges of hills dipping in plains of m\u0101r or black soil, and stretches of barren stony ground. Rice is largely grown in the best m\u0101r soil. Kis\u016br\u012b d\u0101l (Lathyrus sativus) is also common, and the effects of its consumption are seen in the number of cripples in every village. In 1903\u20134 the area under cultivation was 122 square miles, of which only 2 were irrigated.\n\nB\u0101ra Town.\u2014Town in the Zam\u0101nia tahsil of Gh\u0101zipur District, United Provinces, situated in 25\u00b0 31' N. and 83\u00b0 52' E., on the Ganges, 18 miles south-east of Gh\u0101zipur town. Population (1901), 5,260. B\u0101ra is a long, narrow, straggling town at the confluence of the Karamn\u0101s\u0101 with the Ganges. Close by, on the banks of the smaller river, was fought the battle, usually known as Chaus\u0101 Gh\u0101t, between Hum\u0101y\u016bn and Sher Sh\u0101h in 1539, which ended in the defeat and flight of the former. There are some old Hindu temples and a spacious \u012bdg\u0101h. B\u0101ra has no trade; it contains two schools with about 77 pupils, of whom 22 are girls.\nB\u0101ra Bank\u012b District.\u2014District in the Fyz\u0101b\u0101d Division of the United Provinces, lying between $26^\\circ 31'$ and $27^\\circ 21'$ N. and $80^\\circ 56'$ and $81^\\circ 52'$ E., south-west of the Gogra, with an area of 1,758 square miles. It is bounded on the north-west by Sit\u0101pur; on the north-east by the Gogra, which separates it from Bahraich and Gond\u0101; on the south-east by Fyz\u0101b\u0101d and Sult\u0101npur; on the south by R\u0101\u0113 Barel\u012b; and on the west by Lucknow. B\u0101ra Bank\u012b consists of an almost level upland plain sloping gently from north-west to south-east.\n\nAlong the Gogra is found a strip of alluvial soil, which in the north becomes broader and includes the whole valley of the Chauk\u0101 as far as its junction with the Gogra at Bahr\u0101mg\u0101t. This low area is liable to flooding, and exposes great areas of loose white river sand. The uplands, however, present a broad sheet of level cultivation, dotted with many small villages and hamlets, and set so thick with groves of mango that they seem to meet in every direction and form a background to a landscape full of quiet charm. The District is one of the most prosperous in the United Provinces. It possesses a fertile soil, excellent drainage, ample facilities for irrigation, and a thrifty and industrious peasantry. Excluding the Gogra, the chief river is the Gumti, whose winding course traverses the south of the District, while the central portion is drained by its two tributaries, the Reth and Kaly\u0101ni. The banks of these streams are to some extent broken by ravines. Small shallow lakes and jhils are numerous everywhere.\n\nB\u0101ra Bank\u012b exposes nothing but alluvium, and kankar is the only stony formation.\n\nThe flora generally is that of the Gangetic plain. Scattered patches of dh\u0101k (Butea frondosa) jungle occur, but their area has been much reduced by the spread of cultivation. A very large area is occupied by mango groves.\n\nClose cultivation has reduced the number and variety of wild animals. Hog are still numerous in the tamarisk jungle along the Gogra and Chauk\u0101, and nilgai are occasionally seen in the same region. Jackals are common everywhere. During the cold season geese and duck abound, but other game-birds are rare. Fish are caught in the tanks, but the plentiful supply in the rivers is hardly touched.\n\nExcluding the low-lying tracts near the Gogra, B\u0101ra Bank\u012b has a very healthy climate. Statistics of temperature are not kept; but the extremes of heat and cold are less marked than in the Districts farther west.\n\nThe annual rainfall averages nearly 40 inches, the eastern portion receiving the largest amount. Large fluctuations occur, and the recorded fall has varied from 23 to 64 inches.\nNothing is known of the ancient history of the District; but popular tradition connects the mounds, which are found in many places, with the Bhars. The Muhammadan conquest was effected earlier and more thoroughly than in most parts of Oudh. Sajyid Salar, the hero of many popular ballads, is said to have fixed his head-quarters for a time at Satrikh, and several Musalm\u0101n families assign the settlement of their ancestors to this period. Other settlements were made in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, the Bhars being gradually crushed. It is noticeable that traditions of the occupation of large tracts by clans of Rajputs are less frequent here than in other parts of Oudh; and their conquests do not appear to have been made till the fifteenth century, when the country was the battle-ground between the kingdoms of Jaunpur and Delhi. Under Akbar the present District was divided between the sark\u0101rs of Lucknow and Oudh in the S\u016bbah of Oudh, and M\u0101nikpur which belonged to Allah\u0101b\u0101d. Its later history is chiefly a chronicle of the varying fortunes of the great families. In 1751 the Raikw\u0101rs, who had entered Bar\u0101 Bank\u012b during the reign of Akbar, rose against the rule of the Naw\u0101b of Oudh, but were crushed after a fierce battle. For many years they remained out of possession of their former estates; but in the first half of the nineteenth century the lax government of the Oudh kings enabled them to recover a larger domain than had been theirs in 1751. The District, indeed, bore an evil reputation for turbulence and disorder. In jungles and ravines along the Gumti and Kaly\u0101n\u012b lay the strongholds of many banditti whose crimes are recorded in Sir W. Sleeman\u2019s Diary.\n\nIn 1856 the District, with the rest of Oudh, came under British rule. During the Mutiny of 1857\u20138 the whole of the B\u0101ra Banki talukd\u0101rs joined the mutineers, but offered no serious resistance after the capture of Lucknow. At the battle of Naw\u0101bganj (June, 1858) the Raikw\u0101r zamind\u0101rs of Sit\u0101pur and Bahraich fought and fell with all the historic heroism of Rajputs. The Begam of Oudh, driven from Lucknow, had fled for refuge to their fort at Baundi, and these chivalrous chiefs were devoted to her cause. \u2018I have seen,\u2019 wrote the British general, \u2018many battles in India and many brave fellows fighting with a determination to conquer or die; but I never witnessed anything more magnificent than the conduct of these zamind\u0101rs.\u2019 Order was re-established in July, 1858. In 1869\u201370 the District originally formed was increased by the addition of parts of Bahraich, Lucknow, Sult\u0101npur, and R\u0101e Bareli.\n\nThe ancient sites of the District still await exploration. Numerous deposits of coins and a copperplate grant of Gobind Chand of Kanauj, dated in 1151, have been discovered. There are many tombs, mosques, and buildings dating from the Muhammadan period, but none of importance to the archaeologist.\nB\u0101ra Bank\u012b contains 10 towns and 2,952 villages. The population at the four enumerations was as follows: (1869) 1,113,430, (1881) 1,026,788, (1891) 1,130,906, and (1901) 1,179,323. It is probable that the Census of 1869 overstated the truth, but B\u0101ra Bank\u012b suffered from scarcity in 1877\u20138. The increase during the last decade was comparatively high in all parts of the District, which is very densely populated. There are four tahsils\u2014R\u0101msaneh\u012bgh\u0101t, Naw\u0101bganj, Fatehpur, and Haidargarh. The last three are named from the places at which their head-quarters are situated, while the tahsild\u0101r of R\u0101msaneh\u012bgh\u0101t resides at Chamierganj. The principal town is the municipality of Naw\u0101bganj, a mile from the town of B\u0101ra Bank\u012b, which contains the District courts and civil station. The following table gives the chief statistics of population in 1901:\n\n| Tahsil          | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of Persons able to read and write |\n|-----------------|----------------------|-----------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Ramsaneh\u012bgh\u0101t   | 585                  | 3               | 616      | 387,670    | 662                       | + 2.7                                                       | 9,476                                  |\n| Naw\u0101bganj       | 361                  | 5               | 390      | 254,160    | 704                       | + 4.6                                                       | 6,883                                  |\n| Fatehpur        | 521                  | 2               | 673      | 335,407    | 644                       | + 6.2                                                       | 8,213                                  |\n| Haidargarh      | 291                  | ...             | 373      | 202,086    | 694                       | + 3.7                                                       | 5,397                                  |\n| District total  | 1,758                | 10              | 2,052    | 1,179,323  | 671                       | + 4.2                                                       | 29,879                                 |\n\nHindus form 83 per cent. of the total, and Musalm\u0101ns 17 per cent. About 92 per cent. of the population speak the Awadh\u012b dialect of Eastern Hind\u012b, while Hindust\u0101ni is used by the remainder.\n\nKurm\u012bs (agriculturists), 162,000, are the most numerous of the Hindu castes. Others largely represented are: Ah\u012brs (graziers and cultivators), 140,000; P\u0101s\u012bs (toddy-drawers and labourers), 135,000; Cham\u0101rs (tanners and labourers), 92,000; Br\u0101hmans, 86,000; Rajputs, 41,000; Lodhas (cultivators), 37,000; and Kor\u012bs (weavers), 25,000. Musalm\u0101ns include Shaikhs, 34,000; Jul\u0101h\u0101s (weavers), 31,000; Behn\u0101s (cotton-carders), 14,000; and Path\u0101ns, 13,000. Agriculture supports 73 per cent. of the total population, and cotton-weaving nearly 3 per cent. Kurm\u012bs, Br\u0101hmans, Rajputs, Muraos, and Ah\u012brs are the principal cultivators.\n\nOut of 144 native Christians enumerated in 1901, 139 were Methodists. The American Methodist Mission commenced work soon after the Mutiny and is the only missionary body in the District.\n\nIn the lowland area between the Chauk\u0101 and the Gogra cultivation is very precarious, owing to the liability to flooding. West of the Chauk\u0101 and lower down the Gogra the alluvial soil is better, especially in dry years. The central part of the District forms the valley of the Kaly\u0101n\u012b, which consists of rich loam.\nor clay, plentifully supplied with means of irrigation. The soil becomes more sandy as the Gumti is approached. In the extreme south a tract of clay land is found resembling that in the adjoining District of R\u0101e Bareli. The Gumti valley is flooded after heavy rain, which occasionally damages the low land near the bed of the river, but recovery is rapid.\n\nThe District is held on the tenures usually found in Oudh. Talukd\u0101ri estates include about 47 per cent. of the total area, while sub-settlement holders have about 8 per cent. The main agricultural statistics for 1903\u20134 are given below, in square miles:\n\n| Tahsil          | Total | Cultivated | Irrigated | Cultivable waste |\n|-----------------|-------|------------|-----------|------------------|\n| R\u0101msaneh\u012bgh\u0101t   | 585   | 400        | 144       | 59               |\n| Naw\u0101l ganj      | 361   | 252        | 101       | 50               |\n| Fatehpur        | 521   | 353        | 113       | 69               |\n| Haidargarh      | 291   | 189        | 75        | 37               |\n| **Total**       | **1,758** | **1,194** | **433**   | **215**          |\n\nRice, gram, and wheat are the crops most largely grown, covering 339, 301, and 295 square miles, or 28 to 25 per cent. of the net cultivated area, respectively. Pulses (171 square miles), kodon and small millets (166), barley (89), peas and mas\u016br (68), and maize (56) are also important. Poppy is grown on 44, and sugar-cane on 36 square miles.\n\nThe large area under the more valuable crops, such as poppy, rice, and wheat, testifies to the high standard of cultivation, which is hardly surpassed in any District of the United Provinces. There has been a considerable increase in the cultivated area during the last forty years, amounting to 15 or 20 per cent., and this has been attended by a still larger rise in the area double cropped. Barley has been replaced by wheat, and jow\u0101r by maize, while the area under rice, sugar-cane, and poppy has risen considerably. Drains have recently been made in one or two places where drainage was defective. Advances are readily taken under the Land Improvement and Agriculturists' Loans Acts, and amounted to a total of 4\u00b79 lakhs during the ten years ending 1900, out of which 1\u00b76 lakhs was advanced in 1896\u20137. Increased prosperity accounts for the falling off in the next four years, when an average of Rs. 2,000 was lent.\n\nThe cattle bred locally are of inferior quality, and the best are imported from Bahraich. There is no horse-breeding. Sheep are kept in comparatively small numbers, but goats are largely bred for food and for their hair.\n\nAlthough it contains no canals, the District is unusually well protected by means of irrigation. In 1903\u20134 tanks and jhilis supplied 268 square miles, wells 153, and other sources 12. Practically speaking, every field which requires water gets it. The jhilis fail in exceptionally dry\nyears, but temporary wells can be made in nearly all parts. Thus in the autumn of 1896 about 20,000 earthen wells were dug by tenants with their own resources, or by aid of loans from Government and from estates under the Court of Wards. Irrigation from wells is increasing, and the District is now much less dependent on tanks than formerly. The lever or the pot and pulley is used in most parts to raise water; but in places where the spring-level is low a leathern bucket worked by bullocks is employed. Water is raised from tanks by the swing-basket.\n\n*Kankar* or calcareous limestone is common in all parts, and is used for metalling roads and for making lime. Glass is manufactured from saline efflorescences.\n\nThe most important industry of the District is the weaving of cotton cloth. Cotton rugs are also manufactured, and an excellent class of cotton prints is turned out at Naw\u0101bganj. Iron sugar-mills are made at a factory at Bahr\u0101mg\u0101t; and brass vessels and small articles of metal, such as locks, betel-nut cutters, and tobacco-cutters, are made at one or two places. A little furniture is manufactured at Bahr\u0101mg\u0101t.\n\nB\u0101ra Bank\u012b exports grain, raw sugar, hides, and cotton cloth of local manufacture, while it imports piece-goods and yarn, metals and hardware, and refined sugar. The trade is chiefly carried by railway; but there is also an immense traffic by cart with Lucknow, which absorbs much of the surplus grain of the District. A large quantity of timber passes through Bahr\u0101mg\u0101t. Naw\u0101bganj is the most considerable commercial centre, but bazars are springing up at the railway stations and taking the place of the older markets.\n\nThe loop line of the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway from Benares to Lucknow passes across the District, and a branch from Naw\u0101bganj runs to Bahr\u0101mg\u0101t on the Gogra. A narrow-gauge line belonging to the same railway runs from Lucknow to Burhwal, where it meets the Bengal and North-Western Railway, which crosses the Gogra by a magnificent bridge, 3,695 feet in length. A branch of the Bengal and North-Western Railway from Burhwal to Sit\u0101pur is under consideration. The District is well supplied with roads. Out of a total length of 632 miles, 161 are metalled. The latter are in charge of the Public Works department, but the cost of all but 47 miles is charged to Local funds. Avenues of trees are maintained on 274 miles. The chief routes are the roads from Lucknow to Fyz\u0101b\u0101d, and from Naw\u0101bganj to Fatehpur, Bahr\u0101mg\u0101t, and Haidargarh.\n\nThe increase in well-irrigation and improved communications have prevented the District from suffering severely from the effects of drought. Tradition relates that in 1837 famine was intense. B\u0101ra Bank\u012b escaped lightly in subsequent years of scarcity till 1877\u20138. Relief works were then opened, but\nthe numbers never rose above 6,500 in a day, and distress was severe only in the tract south of the Gumti. The failure of the rains in 1896 actually benefited the lowlands, which had recently been damaged by the excessive rain of 1894. Much loss was, however, caused in the central tract, and still more in the south. Relief works were opened and the numbers rose as high as 42,000; but the spring crop of 1897 was saved by the number of wells made, and the total expenditure on relief was only 1\u00b75 lakhs.\n\nThe Deputy-Commissioner is usually assisted by four Deputy-Collectors recruited in India. Two officers of the Administration, Opium department are stationed in the District, and a tahsildar resides at the head-quarters of each tahsil.\n\nThere are two Munsifs and a Subordinate Judge for civil work. The District is included in the Civil Judgeship of Fyzabad and in the Sessions Judgeship of Lucknow. Crime is not on the whole of a serious nature, though rioting is more than usually prevalent, and murders occur with some frequency. Dacoities by regular gangs have taken place recently. Female infanticide was once common, but is not suspected now.\n\nThe first summary settlement involved the setting aside of talukdars to a large extent. After the Mutiny their estates were restored and a second summary settlement was made, the demand being fixed at 11\u00b79 lakhs. A survey was then carried out, which was followed by the first regular settlement between 1863 and 1868. The assessment was largely based on the actual rent-rolls, checked by rough estimates of the apparent value of each village and by rates applied to the area of different classes of soil. A revenue demand of 15\u00b78 lakhs was proposed, which was reduced to 15\u00b73 lakhs before confirmation. The latest revision was made between 1893 and 1898, preceded by a partial resurvey. The pargana of Bhitauli is permanently settled with the Rajah of Kapurthala State as a reward for services in the Mutiny. Assessment was based as usual on the actual rent-rolls, the rates of money rents being applied to value the 'assets' of similar land where money rents were not paid. The result of the revision was to fix a revenue of 20\u00b73 lakhs, the incidence being Rs. 1\u00b78 per acre, varying from Rs. 1\u00b75 to Rs. 2\u00b74 in different parganas.\n\nCollections on account of land revenue and revenue from all sources have been, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 16,77  | 15,58  | 18,93  | 19,72  |\n| Total revenue  | 18,39  | 20,88  | 25,02  | 26,68  |\n\nThere is one municipality, Nawabganj, and nine towns are adminis-\ntered under Act XX of 1856. Beyond the limits of these, local affairs are managed by the District board, which in 1903-4 had an income of 1\u00b73 lakhs, chiefly derived from rates, and an expenditure of 1\u00b74 lakhs, of which Rs. 80,000 was spent on roads and buildings.\n\nThe District Superintendent of police has under him a force of 3 inspectors, 85 subordinate officers, and 312 constables, distributed in 12 police stations, besides 142 municipal and town police, and 2,626 rural and road police. The District jail had a daily average of 425 prisoners in 1903.\n\nB\u0101ra Bank\u012b does not take a very high place as regards the literacy of its population, of whom 2\u00b75 per cent. (4\u00b78 males and 0\u00b71 females) could read and write in 1901. The number of public schools fell from 145 in 1880-1 to 140 in 1900-1, but the number of pupils increased from 5,129 to 7,647. In 1903-4 there were 170 such schools with 8,317 pupils, of whom 401 were girls, besides 280 private schools with 1,998 pupils, including 96 girls. All of the pupils but 1,262 were in primary classes. Three schools are managed by Government and 127 by the District and municipal boards. The total expenditure on education was Rs. 54,000, of which Rs. 44,000 was provided from Local funds, and Rs. 8,000 by fees.\n\nThere are twelve hospitals and dispensaries, with accommodation for 68 in-patients. In 1903 the number of cases treated was 86,000, including 860 in-patients, and 3,881 operations were performed. The expenditure amounted to Rs. 17,000, chiefly met from Local funds.\n\nIn 1903-4, 30,000 persons were successfully vaccinated, representing the low average of 26 per 1,000 of population. Vaccination is compulsory only in the municipality of Naw\u0101bganj.\n\n[C. W. W. Hope, Settlement Report (1899); H. R. Nevill, District Gazetteer (1904).]\n\nB\u0101ra Bank\u012b Town.\u2014Town in the Naw\u0101bganj tahsil of B\u0101ra Banki District, situated in 26\u00b0 56' N. and 81\u00b0 12' E., on the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway and on the Lucknow-Fyz\u0101b\u0101d road. Population (1901), 3,020. The place lies a mile north of Naw\u0101bganj Town, and is chiefly notable as giving its name to the District, and containing the courts, offices, and residences of the District officials. It is administered under Act XX of 1856, with an income of about Rs. 500.\n\nBar\u0101bar Hills.\u2014Hills on the northern boundary of the head-quarters subdivision of Gay\u0101 District, Bengal, lying between 25\u00b0 0' and 25\u00b0 3' N. and 85\u00b0 1' and 85\u00b0 5' E., 6 to 8 miles east of the Bel\u0101 railway station on the Patna-Gay\u0101 branch of the East Indian Railway. The range contains many remarkable antiquarian remains. On the highest peak (Bar\u0101bar) is an ancient temple sacred to Sidheswara, containing a lingam said to have been placed there by B\u0101na R\u0101j\u0101, the Asura king\nof K\u0101mar\u016bpa, whose bloody wars with Krishna still live in the remembrance of the people. A large fair, attended on an average by 15,000 persons, chiefly men, is held here in the month of Bh\u0101dra (September). The pilgrims begin to arrive at daybreak, and spend the day on the hill; the night is devoted to the worship of the image, and in the morning the crowd begins to disperse. To the south and near the base of this hill, the path up which is freely adorned with images of all kinds, lies a small recess enclosed on two sides by the mountain, on the third by an artificial barrier of stone, and on the fourth by a long low ridge of granite. Here in the solid rock have been cut the remarkable caves from which, it has been held, the glen derives its name of S\u0101\u1e6dghar ('seven houses'). The four caves found in this part of the mountain average 32 feet by 14 feet; three of them are chiselled to a wonderful polish, but the fourth was never finished. Inscriptions show that the oldest was cut in 252 B.C., and the others within the next thirty-six years; these are on another spur of the hill called Nagarjoni. Not far off is the sacred spring of Patalgang\u0101, and at the base of the rugged peak of Kow\u0101dol ('crow's rocking stone') is an enormous figure of Buddha. The Kow\u0101dol peak is identified as the site of the ancient Buddhist monastery of Sil\u0101bhadra visited by Hiuen Tsiang. Many other figures and sculptures are found among these hills, which have been fully described by Buchanan-Hamilton and General Cunningham. In the Bengal Atlas of Major Rennell, this cluster is called the Currumshaw hills; this name is a corruption of Karn\u0101-champar or 'Karna's seat,' the name of an ancient ruin on the hill.\n\n**Bara Gali.**\u2014Small cantonment in Haz\u0101ra District, North-West Frontier Province, situated in 34\u00b0 10' N. and 73\u00b0 30' E., on the road between Abbott\u0101b\u0101d and Murree, 15 miles from Abbott\u0101b\u0101d and 25 from Murree. During the summer months it is occupied by one of the British mountain batteries which are stationed at R\u0101walpindi in the winter.\n\n**Baragaon.**\u2014Village in the Bih\u0101r subdivision of Patna District, Bengal, situated in 25\u00b0 8' N. and 85\u00b0 26' E. Population (1901), 597. With the neighbouring village of Begampur, Baragaon contains masses of ruins. It has been identified with Vih\u0101ragr\u0101m, on the outskirts of which, more than a thousand years ago, flourished the N\u0101landa monastery, at that time the most magnificent and the most celebrated seat of Buddhist learning in the world. It was here that the Chinese traveller Hiuen Tsiang spent a great portion of his pilgrimage in receiving religious instruction.\n\n[Archaeological Survey Reports of India, vol. i, pp. 16-34.]\n\n**Baragaon.**\u2014Town in the District and tahsil of Balli\u0101, United Provinces. See Ch\u012bt F\u012brozpur.\n\n**Barail** ('big dike').\u2014Range of hills in North Cach\u0101r, Eastern\nBengal and Assam, running east and west between $25^\\circ 5'$ and $25^\\circ 26'$ N. and $92^\\circ 32'$ and $93^\\circ 29'$ E., and connecting the Jaintia and N\u0101g\u0101 Hills. The range, which is for the most part composed of soft greenish sandstone, has sharply serrated ridges, and is covered with dense forest and bamboo jungle. Several of the peaks are nearly 6,000 feet in height. The J\u0101ting\u0101 river makes its way through these hills to the Bar\u0101k, and the Assam-Bengal Railway has been carried up the valley of that river.\n\n**Bar\u0101k.**\u2014River of Assam. *See Surm\u0101.*\n\n**Bar\u0101kar.**\u2014River of Bengal. Rising on the north face of the central plateau of Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur in $24^\\circ 7'$ N. and $85^\\circ 18'$ E., it flows in a northerly direction as far as the grand trunk road, after crossing which it turns east, and then south-east, until it leaves Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh District and enters M\u0101nbh\u016bm. About 32 miles lower down it joins the D\u0101modar, on the boundary of Burdw\u0101n and M\u0101nbh\u016bm Districts, in $23^\\circ 42'$ N. and $86^\\circ 48'$ E. In its course through M\u0101nbh\u016bm District, it recrosses the grand trunk road about 3 miles above the point of junction with the D\u0101modar. Though everywhere fordable during the dry season, the Bar\u0101kar is remarkable for the suddenness with which it rises during the rains, as well as for the strength of its current; and the construction of a bridge across it presents difficulties much more serious than could be inferred from its size. Boat traffic is impossible. The principal tributary is the Khud\u0101 in M\u0101nbh\u016bm.\n\n**Bar\u0101kar.**\u2014Village in the Asansol subdivision of Burdw\u0101n District, Bengal, situated in $23^\\circ 45'$ N. and $86^\\circ 49'$ E., on the left bank of the Bar\u0101kar river. The population of Bar\u0101kar proper in 1901 was 385, but the name is ordinarily understood to include several other villages with an aggregate population of nearly 5,000. Bar\u0101kar is the site of the Bengal Iron and Steel Works, which employ 1,900 hands and had a total output in 1903-4 of 43,737 tons, valued at 24.6 lakhs. The main business is the manufacture of railway plant. The manufacture of steel was tried, but was abandoned as unprofitable in 1906. Messrs. John King & Co., Engineers and Founders, of Howrah, have also a branch here. Bar\u0101kar contains several interesting remains, including some ancient stone temples.\n\n*[Archaeological Survey Reports, vol. viii, pp. 150-4]*\n\n**B\u0101r\u0101 L\u0101cha.**\u2014Mountain pass in the L\u0101hul canton of the Kul\u016b subdivision of K\u0101ngra District, Punjab, situated in $32^\\circ 49'$ N. and $77^\\circ 28'$ E., on the Central Asian trade route over the Western Him\u0101layas, from D\u0101rcha in L\u0101hul to the Rupshu country in Lad\u0101kh. The pass is 16,500 feet above the sea; but though the ascent on both sides is easy, it can be crossed by laden yaks and ponies only during the summer. The Chandra and Bh\u0101ga rivers (Chen\u0101b) rise on either side of the pass.\nB\u0101ramah\u0101l.\u2014A name loosely applied in English histories to the north-eastern corner of Salem District, Madras, but no longer in use. The exact boundaries of the tract have been the subject of some discussion. It apparently included the t\u0101luks of Tiruppatt\u016br, Krishnagiri, Dharmapuri, and Uttangarai in Salem, and the Kangundi zamind\u0101ri in North Arcot. Though usually called B\u0101ramah\u0101l, the name is explained as meaning \u2018twelve palaces\u2019 (ma\u1e25al), and tradition says that it was derived from the fact that twelve hills within it were fortified by local chieftains; but of the various lists of these twelve forts no two agree. The first separate ruler of the tract is supposed to have been Jagadeva R\u0101ya, father-in-law of one of the fallen kings of Vijayanagar, to whom it was granted by the king as a reward for his heroic defence of the fort of Penukonda against a Musalm\u0101n force. Later, Jagadeva\u2019s family fell upon evil days, and the B\u0101ramah\u0101l passed into the possession of Haidar Ali of Mysore, whose son ceded it to the British at the partition treaty of 1792. The name soon afterwards dropped out of use.\n\nB\u0101r\u0101mati.\u2014Town in the Bh\u012bmthadi t\u0101luka of Poona District, Bombay, situated in 18\u00b0 9' N. and 74\u00b0 34' E., about 50 miles southeast of Poona city. Population (1901), 9,407. The municipality, which was established in 1865, had an average income during the decade ending 1901 of Rs. 14,000. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 32,000, chiefly derived from octroi (Rs. 18,000) and tolls (Rs. 4,000). The town contains a Subordinate Judge\u2019s court, a dispensary, and two English schools, including one for girls.\n\nBar\u0101mb\u0101.\u2014One of the Tributary States of Orissa, Bengal, lying between 20\u00b0 21' and 20\u00b0 31' N. and 85\u00b0 12' and 85\u00b0 31' E., with an area of 134 square miles. It is bounded on the north by Hindol; on the east by Tigiri\u0101; on the south by Cuttack District and Khandpar\u0101 (the boundary line being formed by the Mah\u0101nadi river); and on the west by Narsinghpur. Kanak\u0101 Peak (2,038 feet), the highest point of a hill range of the same name, is situated on the northern border. A legend attributes the foundation of the State to a celebrated wrestler, to whom the Orissa monarch presented two villages which were owned and inhabited by Khonds; the wrestler speedily drove out the aborigines and then extended his territory, which received further accessions in the time of his successors. The State yields a revenue of Rs. 43,000, and pays Rs. 1,398 as tribute to the British Government. The population increased from 32,526 in 1891 to 38,260 in 1901, of whom 37,441 were Hindus. A few Buddhists are still found in one or two villages. The most numerous castes are Ch\u0101sas (11,000) and P\u0101ns (4,000). The population reside in 181 villages, and the density is 285 persons per square mile. The Mah\u0101nadi affords excellent water-carriage, and logs of timber and bamboos are floated down the river to Cuttack and\nPuri Districts. A good fair-weather road connects Bar\u0101mb\u0101 with Narsinghpur on one side and Tigiri\u0101 on the other, joining the old Cuttack-Sambalpur road above Sankarpur in the Dhenk\u0101n\u0101l State. Excellent cotton and silk cloth is manufactured at the village of M\u0101ni\u0101bundha. The State maintains a charitable dispensary, a middle vernacular school, and 2 upper primary and 44 lower primary schools.\n\nB\u0101ram\u016bla.\u2014Town in the State of Kashmir, situated in $34^\\circ 13' \\text{N.}$ and $74^\\circ 23' \\text{E.}$ Population (1901), 5,866. Owing to its position as the river port of Kashmir, this is a place of some importance; but in consequence of the opening of the cart-road from B\u0101ram\u016bla to Srinagar, the boat traffic, on which the inhabitants chiefly depend, may in time decrease. It is situated on the left bank of the Jhelum, which is crossed at the east end of the town by an excellent bridge. The inhabitants are for the most part traders or shopkeepers. B\u0101ram\u016bla is very liable to earthquakes, and in 1885 it was almost reduced to ruins. The name is derived from the ancient city V\u0101rahm\u016bla, which stood on the right bank of the river along which the old route down the Jhelum used to run. Opposite, on the bank where the present B\u0101ram\u016bla stands, was the town of Hushkapura, founded by king Huvi\u0161ka, the Kushan ruler, who succeeded Kanishka. The site of the ancient Hushkapura is about two miles to the south-east of the modern B\u0101ram\u016bla.\n\nB\u0101ran.\u2014Head-quarters of the district of the same name in the State of Kotah, R\u0101jput\u0101na, situated in $25^\\circ 6' \\text{N.}$ and $79^\\circ 31' \\text{E.}$, on the left bank of the B\u0101ngang\u0101 rivulet, a tributary of the P\u0101rbat\u012b, about 45 miles by metalled road almost due east of Kotah city. About half a mile to the west is the railway station, the present terminus of the B\u012bna-B\u0101ran branch of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway. Population (1901), 7,892. The town, which is said to have been founded by the Solanki R\u0101jputs in the fourteenth or fifteenth century, and to have been called by its present name because it was populated by the inhabitants of twelve (b\u0101ra\u1e25) adjacent villages, is now the principal trade centre of the State, and possesses a combined post and telegraph office, two primary schools (one of them for girls), and a hospital with accommodation for twelve in-patients. A Government opium agency was established here in 1904, and in the following season 1,094 chests, or about 68 tons of opium, passed through the scales. B\u0101ran is noted for its chindri bandish or tie and dye work. The pattern is produced by knotting up with thread any portion of the cloth which is to escape being dyed; and as a separate knotting is required for each of the numerous colours, in the case of an elaborate design the delicacy and labour involved are enormous.\n\nBaran.\u2014Old name of Bulandshahr town and tahsil, United Provinces.\nBaranagar (Bar\u0101hanagar).\u2014Town in the Barrackpore subdivision of the District of the Twenty-four Parganas, Bengal, situated in $22^\\circ 39'$ N. and $88^\\circ 22'$ E., on the east bank of the Hooghly river, 6 miles north of Calcutta. Population (1901), 25,432. Hindus number 19,581; Musalmans, 5,697; and Christians, 142. Baranagar seems to have been originally a Portuguese settlement; but it afterwards became the seat of a Dutch factory, and during the greater part of the eighteenth century Dutch vessels anchored here on their way up to Chinsura. Old Dutch tiles of artistic design are still found in some of the native buildings in the neighbourhood. The town was ceded by the Dutch Government to the British in 1795, and the lands are comprised in the Government estate of Baranagar, contiguous to the Panchannagram estate. The lands are rented at Rs. 3 per bigha (about one-third of an acre). Baranagar was formerly a favourite pleasure resort for European residents of Calcutta; but it is now a busy industrial suburb and contains two of the largest jute-mills on the Hooghly, while large quantities of castor-oil are manufactured for export to Europe.\n\nA municipality was constituted in 1869, which was known for many years as the North Suburban municipality. On the formation of the Cossipore-Chitpur municipality in 1889, the name was changed to Baranagar. In 1899 the municipality was divided into two portions, of which the northern became the K\u0101m\u0101r\u0101h\u0101ti municipality. Since the partition, the average income has been Rs. 42,000 and the expenditure Rs. 41,000. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 43,000, including Rs. 19,000 derived from a tax on houses and lands, and Rs. 16,000 from a conservancy rate; and the expenditure was Rs. 49,000. The Victoria high school is situated within the town.\n\nBarapole.\u2014River in the south-west of Coorg, Southern India, with various local names in different parts. It rises in the Brahmagiri range in the south, and flows west through a deep mountain gorge. It forms a fine waterfall near the frontier of Coorg, along which it runs for some distance till joined by the Kalluhole descending from the north through the Heggala pass. The united stream enters Malabar, where it is called the Iritti and subsequently the Valarpattanam, and falls into the sea near Chirakkal.\n\nB\u0101r\u0101sat Subdivision.\u2014Subdivision of the District of the Twenty-four Parganas, Bengal, lying between $22^\\circ 33'$ and $22^\\circ 56'$ N. and $88^\\circ 25'$ and $88^\\circ 47'$ E., with an area of 275 square miles. The subdivision consists of a water-logged deltaic tract, which is very malarious, as many of the drainage channels are blocked, and there are numerous swamps and thick jungle. The population in 1901 was 264,300, the density being 961 persons per square mile. It contains two towns, B\u0101r\u0101sat (population, 8,634), the head-quarters, and Gobard\u0101nga (5,865); and 724 villages. B\u0101r\u0101sat was formerly a separate magisterial District in\ncharge of a Joint-Magistrate. In 1861 the Joint-Magistracy was abolished, and B\u0101r\u0101sat became one of the subdivisions of the Twenty-four Parganas.\n\n**B\u0101r\u0101sat Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of the subdivision of the same name in the District of the Twenty-four Parganas, Bengal, situated in $22^\\circ 43' N.$ and $88^\\circ 29' E.$, 14 miles north-east of Calcutta. Population (1901), 8,634. The town is very unhealthy, and the inhabitants are gradually moving to Calcutta and the higher country on the banks of the Hooghly. In the early years of the nineteenth century, there was a college here for cadets on their first arrival from Europe; and, until 1861, B\u0101r\u0101sat was the head-quarters of a separate District. It was constituted a municipality in 1869. The income and expenditure during the decade ending 1901\u20132 averaged Rs. 10,500 and Rs. 10,000 respectively. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 12,400, half of which was derived from a tax on vehicles, while a tax on persons brought in Rs. 3,000; the expenditure was Rs. 12,600. The town contains the usual public offices; the jail, which has accommodation for 130 prisoners, is a three-storeyed building, popularly known as 'Vansittart Villa,' as it was formerly the country residence of Mr. Vansittart, a civil servant in the time of Warren Hastings. K\u0101zip\u0101ra, a suburb of the town, is the scene of an annual fair held in honour of a Musalm\u0101n saint, named Pir Ekdil S\u0101hib, which is attended by Hindus as well as Muhammadans. A light railway has recently been constructed between the town and Basirh\u0101t.\n\n**Barauda** *(Baroda).*\u2014Village in the Goh\u0101na tahsil of Rohtak District, Punjab, situated in $29^\\circ 9' N.$ and $76^\\circ 37' E.$, on the But\u0101na branch of the Western Jumna Canal. Population (1901), 5,836.\n\n**Baraunda** *(or P\u0101thar-Kachh\u0101r).*\u2014A petty sanad State in Central India, under the Political Agent in Baghelkhand. It is now a small holding with an area of about 218 square miles, but was in former days much larger, and comprised most of the present District of B\u0101nd\u0101, the family having held the country for at least 400 years. The name P\u0101thar-Kachh\u0101r is derived from its position on the skirts of the Vindhyas.\n\nThe family is an old one, and claims to belong to the Raghuvansi clan of the Solar division of R\u0101jputs. The original seat of the family was R\u0101sin in B\u0101nd\u0101 District, originally called R\u0101j\u0101 V\u0101sini, where there are many old remains. The early history is, however, very obscure. During the Bundel\u0101 supremacy the State appears to have been held on a sanad from Hirde S\u0101h of Pann\u0101. On the accession of the British to the paramount power, R\u0101j\u0101 Mohan Singh was recognized and confirmed in his territory by a sanad granted in 1807. Dying childless in 1827, he left the estate by will to his nephew, Sarabjit Singh, who, although not formally adopted, was recognized by the\nBritish Government, to the exclusion of his two elder brothers. In 1862 the chief received an adoption sanad, and in 1863 he ceded all land required for railways through his territory. Raghubar Day\u0101l Singh, who was chief in 1877, obtained the personal distinction of R\u0101j\u0101 Bah\u0101dur and a salute of 9 guns, the latter distinction being made hereditary in 1878. He died in 1885 without issue, and without exercising the right of adoption; but the Government selected the present chief, R\u0101j\u0101 Th\u0101kur Pras\u0101d Singh, who succeeded in 1886. The ruler of the State bears the title of R\u0101j\u0101 and receives a salute of 9 guns.\n\nPopulation has been: (1881) 17,283, (1891) 18,596, and (1901) 15,724. The population decreased by 15 per cent. during the last decade owing to famine. Hindus number 14,189, or 90 per cent.; and Animists, 1,351, or 9 per cent. The State contains 70 villages. The prevailing language is Baghelkhandi, spoken by 91 per cent. of the inhabitants. Agriculture supports 90 per cent. of the total population. Of the total area, 31 square miles, or 14 per cent., are cultivated; 57 square miles are cultivable but uncultivated; and the rest is forest and waste land. The total revenue is Rs. 15,000, of which Rs. 14,000 is derived from land. Baraund\u0101, the capital, is situated in 25\u00b0 3' N. and 80\u00b0 38' E., in a somewhat rugged tract 10 miles north of K\u0101linjar; it contains a vernacular school. Population (1901), 1,365.\n\nBaraut.\u2014Town in the B\u0101ghpat tahsil of Meerut District, United Provinces, situated in 29\u00b0 6' N. and 77\u00b0 16' E., 27 miles north-west of Meerut city. Population (1901), 7,703. During the Mutiny some of the J\u0101ts who owned the town were conspicuous for disloyalty, and their property was confiscated and now forms part of the Sardhana Estate. The town is situated in a network of canal distributaries, and irrigation is forbidden near it for sanitary considerations. The American Presbyterian Mission has a branch here. Baraut was administered as a municipality from 1870 to 1904, the average income and expenditure being about Rs. 6,500. Under its new constitution as a \u2018notified area,\u2019 a tax on circumstances and property has been substituted for octroi. Iron buckets and cauldrons are made here, and there was formerly a large trade in ghi and safflower. In 1904 the town contained a middle school with 120 pupils, and three aided primary schools with 140 pupils.\n\nBard\u0101 Hills.\u2014Hills in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, Bombay, about 18 miles distant from the coast, near Porbandar. They form a circular cluster about 30 miles in circumference, and are visible from a distance of from 25 to 30 miles. From the north they appear grouped in three distinct peaks. The most westerly, called Venu, is the highest, rising to about 1,730 feet above the sea. The well-watered and bamboo-covered slopes of the Bard\u0101 Hills formed in the disturbed times a favourable refuge for outlaws.\nBard\u012b.\u2014Tahsil of the Rewah State, Central India, lying between 23\u00b0 47' and 24\u00b0 41' N. and 81\u00b0 37' and 82\u00b0 51' E., with an area of 2,912 square miles. The country is for the most part cut up by a series of parallel ridges covered with heavy forest. Cultivation is but little practised, except on the plateau and in the valleys. The Son river, its tributary the Gopat, and many smaller streams flow through the tahsil. Population fell from 243,203 in 1891 to 198,821 in 1901, giving a density of 68 persons per square mile. There are 848 villages, the head-quarters being at Sih\u0101wal. The land revenue is 1\u00b76 lakhs.\n\nB\u0101rdoli T\u0101luka.\u2014T\u0101luka of Surat District, Bombay, lying between 20\u00b0 56' and 21\u00b0 14' N. and 73\u00b0 0' and 73\u00b0 21' E., with an area of 222 square miles. The population in 1901 was 80,678, compared with 84,111 in 1891. The t\u0101luka contains one town, B\u0101rdoli (population, 5,172), the head-quarters; and 123 villages. Land revenue and cesses amounted in 1903-4 to more than 5 lakhs. There are no alienated villages in B\u0101rdoli, which forms a richly wooded plain, with stretches of grass land covered with date-palm and bab\u016bl-trees. Towards the west the t\u0101luka has the benefit of the sea-breeze, and is well supplied with water. The climate of the eastern part is hotter and somewhat feverish.\n\nB\u0101rdoli Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the t\u0101luka of the same name in Surat District, Bombay, situated in 21\u00b0 7' N. and 73\u00b0 7' E., on the T\u0101pti Valley Railway, 19 miles from Surat city. Population (1901), 5,172. It has a temple of Kedareshwar about four centuries old, on the site of a previously existing shrine of great antiquity. A fair, held annually, is attended by over 5,000 pilgrims. The town contains a dispensary and three schools, two for boys and one for girls, attended by 241 and 86 pupils respectively.\n\nB\u0101rdw\u0101n.\u2014Division, District, subdivision, estate, and town in Bengal.
