A similar grant was made in clearer terms by Charles II, who (1668) ceded Bombay to the Company in full sovereignty, with power to make laws and to administer justice according to the laws of England. The following orders to provide for the administration of justice were issued at a Consultation held in Bombay on the 2nd February 1670:\n\nThe Governor and Council, in pursuance of the Honourable Company's order concerning a Court of Judicature for deciding of differences between party and party, as also concerning justices of the peace and constables for the cause and ends therein specified, have seriously considered the present state of affairs within this island together with the number and qualifications of Englishmen thereon, who being able for such a trust can be spared from other necessary service. Likewise the convenience in this juncture of time and promulgation of new laws of suiting the present Government to the natives by a concurrence with Englishmen in matters of smaller importance to the end that justice may be duly administered, that the inhabitants may have the greater satisfaction in the execution of the laws, and that all things may proceed the more regular. After mature deliberation and debate, they resolve and conclude as follows: The island of Bombay to be divided into two distinct precincts, one comprehending Bombay M\u00e1zgaon and Girgaon; and the other M\u00e1him Parel Sion Warli and the Puckerys (P\u00e1kh\u00e1dis or hamlets) thereunto belonging. In each of those precincts there shall be five justices who besides the particulars expressed in the laws shall have power to receive, hear, try, and determine all bills plaints petitions and actions for sums of money not exceeding the value of five Xeraphins (Rs. 3\u00bd). To this end those of the first precincts shall convene in the Custom House of Bombay (near the present Town Barracks) every Friday at eight o'clock in the morning and those of the second precincts in the Custom House of M\u00e1him on every Wednesday at the same hour. Provided always that the respective customers (customs officers) of Bombay and M\u00e1him being Englishmen be always present and preside as chairmen in these respective courts\u00b9 and three to make a quorum. Further that the said Courts shall choose their own Perbes (Parbhu clerks) and other officers necessary; and appoint them such moderate\n\n\u00b9 It will be seen below (page 2) that a special paid officer was afterwards appointed (1675) to preside, and was given the title of Judge.\nfees as shall not be burdensome or grievous to the people; and shall keep an exact register of all their sentences, resolutions, executions, and judgments whatsoever; and deliver authentic copy thereof quarterly to the Deputy Governor and Council. Moreover that in every parish within either of these precincts above mentioned there shall be one constable who for an ensign of his office shall carry a staff tipped with silver and the Company's arms thereupon engraved, and shall attend those Courts as necessity requires. And lastly in regard there is to be no other Court of judicature for decision of other cause and difference between party and party through want of men able and understanding in the laws, the Deputy Governor and Council shall convene in Court every Tuesday from 8 to 11 in the forenoon and from 1 to 3 in the afternoon within the fort then and there to receive, try, and decide all appeals (if any shall be made) from inferior courts, as also all actions treasonable, felonious, capital, or criminal, which in any way relate to the public government and civil polity of the island and the Company's interest and estate thereupon, as well as all suits and actions whatsoever between man and man for lands, goods, and sums of money above the value of 200 Xeraphins. In this Court as provided in the laws, all trials shall be by a jury, and exact registers of their proceedings shall be kept that the equity thereof may appear to all whom it may concern.\n\nThe same Consultation, 2nd February 1670, contains the following orders relating to the publication of a code of laws, of which code no trace seems to be extant: It is unanimously resolved that those laws which concern the administration of justice and common right, the form of judicature, and the penalties appointed against profaneness, breaches of morality, and civil government, shall be translated into the Portuguese and Kanarese languages and be published with all convenient speed, and the others deferred till further consideration.\n\nA Bombay Consultation dated 31st January 1670 refers to an order of the Honourable Company that all cases of difference between English and Portugals be decided by a jury half English half Portugal.\n\nRegarding the first Bombay Procedure Code a Surat letter dated 16th May 1672 has the following: Mr. George Wilcox has informed that he hath drawn up a form of legal proceedings which he intended to present to the Governor Mr. Aungier on his arrival at Bombay. This form we would have Mr. Wilcox send up hither that we may debate and consider thereof.\n\nA Surat letter to Bombay, dated the 18th December 1675, has the following regarding the appointment of a Judge to preside over the sittings of the justices: As to the judge's salary, having respect as well to our Masters' orders as also to his present condition and the\n\n---\n\n1 Consultation held in Bombay 2nd Feb. 1670, Surat Factory Diary 1 of 1660 - 1696.\n2 Consultation held in Bombay 2nd Feb. 1670, Surat Factory Diary 1 of 1660 - 1696.\n3 Surat Factory Diary 1 of 1660 - 1696.\n4 Surat to Bombay 16th May 1672, Surat Factory Outward Letter Book 1 of 1630 - 1673, 262.

The judge is required to keep an exact account of all moneys and fines received. From these receipts he is to discharge what is laid out for the Sessions dinners, officers' fees, and public expenses paying the remainder into the Honourable Company's cash.\n\nA Surat letter of the 8th February 1676 contains the following instructions to the judge: As we desire that justice may be done, so we would have you take care that vexatious suits and contrivances laid by common barristers to disturb the quiet of good people, may be discouraged and prevented. And let the judge know from us that we expect he maintain the gravity integrity and authority of his office, and that he doth not bring a disrepute on the Court of Bombay by lightness, partiality, selfseeking or countenancing common barristers in which sort of vermin they say Bombay is very unhappy.\n\nThe provision of a proper court house was the next subject that required the attention of the Council. Originally the justices held their sittings in the Custom houses of Bombay and of Mahim. When a judge was appointed some house was taken as a Court of Judicature. But after about a year it was decided to buy the Deputy Governor's house, apparently the building part of which still exists in the Castle and which was then private property belonging to a Portuguese lady. Eventually the Court was housed in a new building in the bazar the fair common house which Governor Aungier planned and of which traces remain at Mopla Por in Bohora Baz\u00e1r Street.\n\nSurat letters of the 19th July and 21st August 1676 have the following: We like well your proposition of making the present court of judicature an hospital and of taking the Deputy Governor's and Mr. Petit's house for the Court of Judicature. We read the valuation you have made of the Deputy Governor's house which you have thought fit for the court of judicature. As we do not see there will be any occasion for the garden and the ground adjoining, we desire that the house by itself may be valued. This is all that we have in answer to that letter.\n\nOn the 24th August the Surat Council continue: We have received your original of the 9th current (August 1676) together with the certificate or valuation of the Deputy Governor's house. This at Rs. 2400 we think to be a dear pennyworth. You shall in due time receive our positive answer regarding it.\n\n---\n\n1 Surat to Bombay 18th Dec. 1675, Surat Fact. Out. L.

Forrest's Home Series, I. 101.\nThe subject is resumed on the 10th October 1676: We have discoursed with the Deputy Governor touching the house proposed for a court of judicature. As he has given us a very satisfactory account, we have concluded to take it on the Honourable Company's behalf and shall make good the money here to the persons concerned. We desire you to take possession; and now without delay to go forward in fitting up the present court of judicature for an hospital. The sooner that so necessary a work is finished the better.\n\nThree weeks later (4th November 1676) the Surat Council makes the following further concession: As to the new house bought for the court of judicature you are to take notice that the ground belonging thereto is bought together with the house. You must take in the ground for a back yard.\n\nApparently the only effect of this purchase was to make the Company the owners of the Portuguese lady's and Mr. Petit's houses in the Castle. These houses seem to have continued in use as residences. The Common House in Bohora Baz\u00e1r Street, which was begun in consequence of Mr. Aungier's proposals of 1671, was, in 1677, so far advanced that (24th January) the Deputy Governor Mr. Petit wrote to the Directors that the buildings in the Castle should not be used as a Court. He says: The court of judicature we have built in the baz\u00e1r is a far more convenient place for a Court being of greater ease for all sorts of people to repair thither, and more fitting for prisons where prisoners may beg relief of passengers.\n\nBefore the Judge had been two years in office, 24th August 1677, the Bombay Council became so dissatisfied with him as to write to Surat in the following terms: We have long forbore upon just sentiments to say anything concerning the Judge. We do now find that the good of the island, the content of the inhabitants, and the discharge of the trust reposed in us, enforce us to seek a prevention of the bad consequences his carriage eminently does threaten. Your Honours will perceive how little he has merited the honour of so great a charge, and how dissonant his carriage has been to those rules and principles which we had thought the weight and gravity of his employ would have prompted him to. Not to mention the several slightings and plain abuses of most of the members of this Council, which perhaps their charity might have obliterated had not more public affronts awakened the remembrance of them, his contempt of the Government, his slighting and scandalizing our Councils and authority, the passion and prejudice which have been the masters and guide of his actions, and the general dissatisfaction of all people with him, have been so notorious that we cannot but imagine the world has taken notice of it much to our prejudice. He did once say that nothing had been acted since\n\n---\n\n1 Surat to Bombay 10th Oct. 1676, Surat Fact. Out. L. B. 2 of 1675-76, 229.

Petit and Council to the Court of Directors, dated Bombay 24th Jan. 1677, Sec. Out. L. B. 4 of 1677 - 1687, 6. Forrest's Home Series, I. 120.\nthe President Mr. Aungier went off the island. And now lately in a case of Chancery decided by us, wherein the cause was not adjudged to his liking, he did not stick to say that he now plainly saw that any man that would, might swear himself out of a debt and that a knave should never want a friend in Court. We leave it to your Honour to interpret how little master of reason and conscience we should be, and how unfit for that great trust reposed in us, should so much injustice be the effect of our Councils. We cannot but take notice that the bill exhibited to us in the forementioned cause, which, the judge did confess he himself had drawn up, is full of nothing but slanders defamations and privately taunting of his superiors' action. Besides how unbecoming it is to the gravity of such a place and indeed how contrary to equity for a judge to act the part of an attorney. In the face of the whole Court he told us, though we were afraid of Captain Adderton, yet he was not. A bill in chancery was lately exhibited to us against the judge by twelve men who were of a jury at Justice Hall. These men having brought in a verdict according to equity and good conscience, were nevertheless publicly checked and rated by the judge, telling them they were men of large consciences. They desired us to exempt them in future from the like duties except they can be protected in the free discharge of their consciences. This action may be of very prejudicial consequence. Either juries will deny to be empannelled and consequently a due and just trial of all causes will be omitted, or else they may be overawed to bring in illegal verdicts. Copy of both the bills go here enclosed. Also of a trial wherein though the same jury had brought in judgment for the defendant, the judge yet ordered the clerk of the papers to enter verdict for the plaintiff for the cost and charges of the Court. To tell your worships how much the judge has suffered his officers and servants to grind and oppress the people, may seem dubious whether our connivance merits more blame than his. It is not many months since we did in a general letter hint our resentment of his opinion of our partiality, which made him appeal to a higher Court for justice in the business between Mr. Child and him. All these considerations being duly weighed, we found ourselves obliged, for the discharge of that trust reposed in us, to suspend his commission, and have ordered that he act no longer as Judge till we receive your further orders concerning him. If our humble advices might be credited in this particular, the general benefit and satisfaction of the whole island will be much advanced by the election of a new judge. For the present we have ordered the remaining justices jointly to officiate till your Honours shall please otherwise to dispose thereof.\n\nIn reply the Surat Council write to Bombay on the 11th September 1677: We are very sorry that Judge Niccols hath behaved himself so ill that he has given so general a dissatisfaction to the whole island. We do approve of what you have done in suspending him from his place and shall not countenance in the least any one under your Gov-\n\n---\n\n1 Bombay to Surat 24th Aug. 1677, Sec. Out. L. R. 4 of 1677-1687, 44-45. Forrest's Home Series, I. 135-136.\nernment that are so far forgetful of the (respect) they owe their superiors. As yet we (do not) determine of a qualified person for judge but reserve it to the decision of a fuller Council. In the meantime the justices of peace may officiate as you have ordered and we would have you advise us who you have on the island fitting for the employ.\n\nA little later (11th November 1677) the Bombay Council extended their objections from the person to the office: We do not see the absolute necessity of allowing 120 pounds to a Judge. Not that we would have the island destitute of a person invested with authority to determine the weightiest causes, but the very name sounds too great for the place. It looks like the great gates of Little Pendus that made Diogenes afraid the city would run out at them. The lawyers who come to these parts are commonly mean persons or young men but very little skilled in our law. And the name of a Judge does fill them with such a pride that they lose their reason in the contemplation of their greatness and think no man their superior, scarcely their equal. If the principal justice be invested by the same power and act by a full commission, why is it not the same thing as Judge. It is not the name that makes any difference. The Governments of provinces are committed to persons who are sometimes styled lieutenants, sometimes deputies, and sometimes viceroys though their power is equal. The Company formerly ordered that only some one of their factors that was a sober and discreet person might officiate in the place of chief justice. Such a person we suppose would be well satisfied to have only the profit of the seals allowed him to his salary which the former Judge had in addition to his salary. Mr. Gary or Mr. Robert Harbin, or whom else your Worship shall please to appoint, are very fitting persons for such an employment. Please to issue orders so soon as may be; for by the commissions none of the justices can sit upon life and death but only as assistants. We imagine a joint commission for so many justices of quorum will do better than a commission invested in any single person. This is only our opinion which your Worship's better judgment can correct.\n\nA month later (12th December 1677) the Bombay Government resume: A justice of peace does not receive a penny of salary. As to the registrar we have no such office on the island; nor, should a registrar be created, would the office without a salary be worth him a groat a day. He that is Judge or Chief Justice (which is the same thing) keeps the register, and if another have salary for that place, it is giving two men wages for carrying on the same duties. For we suppose a Judge will be made and a convenient salary settled on him whose commission hitherto has always been joined with that of registrar, the business of registrar being so very small. What your worships shall order in this particular we shall readily perform.\n\n---\n\n1 Surat Fact. Out. L. B. 3 of 1677-1700, 61.\n2 Bombay to Surat 11th Nov. 1677, Sec. Out. L.

Forrest's Home Series, I. 142.\nThe charter of 1683 authorised the Company to set up Courts consisting of a lawyer and two merchants, in such places as they might appoint. It does not appear whether any action was taken under this charter at Bombay. The following is an example of the provision made for non-European residents of the island. A commission of the 30th May 1694 to K\u00e1ji Ibr\u00e1him to be chief judge of the Moors or Muhammadans runs as follows: The Right Honourable Sir John Gayer Kt., General of all India, by virtue of the authority given to me by the commission I bear from the Right Honourable Society of Merchants trading to the East Indies, do constitute and appoint you K\u00e1ji Ibr\u00e1him to be chief judge and decider of all difference that may happen in your caste\u2014the Moors\u2014on the island of Bombay, willing and commanding all your said caste to obey you in the said station according to the commission given you. Sealed with the Right Honourable Company\u2019s seal and given under my hand in Bombay Castle the 30th May 1694.\n\nThe following extract from a Bombay letter to Surat, dated the 9th October 1696, seems to show that the authorities of Bombay had not succeeded in bringing the administration of justice into a satisfactory state: We are in hourly expectation of our ships which we hope will bring out some person learned in the laws qualified for a Judge whereby we may erect a Court of Judicature.\n\nThe following extracts relate to criminal proceedings during this period. On the 8th February 1676 the Surat Council write: We approve what you have done touching the condemned thieves. Hereafter we have thought good to make the standing order that whatever thieves are condemned in Court shall be kept in chains and at constant work in Bombay till they can be transported to St. Helena. If they be slaves and do belong to any proprietor on the island, the Company shall allow 30 Xeraphins a head. This we do require you to observe as a standing order amongst you.\n\nRegarding the trial of English criminals in India, on the 6th May 1685, the Court write to Surat: Robert Johnson, sent home a prisoner, is but a trouble to us. For the future send no such malefactors home. Punish them according to their demerits in India, where you have despotical power as well as martial law and the living witnesses to justify any charge. Our courts at law love not to be troubled with such remote causes, nor can admit for evidence in criminal causes, any written attestation affidavits or certificates, nor any other testimony than viva voce.\n\nOn the 24th March 1721 the Court of Directors write: All corporal punishments and fines should be settled in Council, except such reason-\n\n---\n\n1 Sec.

We require you at all times to be in a readiness to execute the said office when you shall be thereunto called, and we do hereby empower you to summon a jury of the next inhabitants to make inquest of the death of any person or persons that shall come to their deaths by any unnatural or extraordinary means whatsoever. And that you take no more for the execution of your office than 13s. 4d. for sitting on the corpse of any one person and that the same sum be levied of the murderer's estate if it may be found. If not, that there then be an assessment made by the chamber of the caste that the defunct is of, for the said sum of 13s. 4d. and no more. We do also hereby further require you, as you will answer the contrary at your peril, that you be not of counsel with any person whatsoever in hiding the murder of any person. Nor that you, either directly or indirectly, take any bribe of any person whatsoever to mitigate or lessen any offence. But that you proceed in your said office with integrity and honesty as in the sight of God Almighty who will certainly require innocent blood at your hands if you conceal the same.

Honourable Company's seal, this 13th day of June A.D. 1701.\\(^2\\)\n\nSome information regarding police will be found above in the orders referring to the Courts of Justice.

You are likewise to take care that no cattle corn or other provisions be carried off the island, but may suffer any sort of provisions or cattle to be brought on the island. If you find any one carrying letters off the island, stop them and send them to me, and be sure you search all. Suffer poor people to come and inhabit on the island; and call the militia to watch with you every night-sparing the Padre of Parel's servants. You are to apply yourself to the storekeeper for three spare muskets, bandoleers (leather bags for firearms), and swords together with what powder shot match and flints you shall have occasion of.\\(^3\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Court to Bombay 24th March 1721 para 99.

Subhed\u00e1r of Warli: Being informed that certain ill people on this island go about in the night to the number of ten or twelve or more, designing some mischief or disturbance to the inhabitants, these are to enorder you to go the rounds every night with twenty men at all places which you think most suitable to intercept such persons. If you meet any of them these are to empower you to bring them perforce or otherwise to this Castle.

Therefore these are to enorder you not to molest the subhed\u00e1rs in the performance of their duty. If any of your rounds meets with any such persons or any one else that appears suspicious commit them, and at a convenient time send them to me.\n\nOn the petition of the Company, King George I. (24th September 1726) created Mayor's Courts for Madras Bombay and Fort William, each consisting of a Mayor and nine aldermen. These Courts were declared Courts of Record and were empowered to hear civil cases of all kinds, subject to an appeal to the Governor and Council. At the same time the Governor and Council were authorised to hold quarter sessions for the trial of all offences except high treason.\n\n---\n\n1 Sec. Out. L. B. 5 of 1694-1696, 12-13.\n2 Sec. Out.

As this poor expedient met with the royal approbation, Letters Patent were issued the same year (1726), on the 24th September, the date of the new Charter. By these it was decreed that the new Court should consist of a Mayor and nine Aldermen, eight of whom, including the Mayor, were required to be naturalised subjects of the British Crown, but the other two might be subjects of any friendly nation. All the Aldermen were to be selected from the principal inhabitants of the place, were to hold office for life unless suspended for misconduct, and were to elect the Mayor annually from amongst their number. Appeals against the Court's decisions might be carried up to the President in Council and in civil suits involving a certain amount, to His Majesty's Privy Council. The same Letters Patent reconstituted the President and Senior Members of Council, Justices of the Peace and empowered them to hold quarter sessions.\n\nThe new charter did not reach Bombay until February 1728. The 10th of that month it was publicly read on the recently built pier in the presence of the Europeans and leading men of native castes. The President and Council, Sheriff, Mayor, and Aldermen then took the oaths of allegiance, after which the President harangued the assembly, pointing out to all the value of their new privileges and setting before the members of the corporation the duties which they had that day undertaken to discharge.\n\nThe Mayor's Court had to encounter all the jealousy and prejudice which stand in the way of new institutions, and they bitterly complained that the chief officers of Government were the worst obstacles to their administration of justice. Lowther, the Chief of Surat, being called upon by them to execute a Commission for examin-\nThe Mayor's Court was opened at the Town Hall on Thursday the 15th February 1727-28 with William Henry Draper Esquire first and modern Mayor and Edward Massey, John Lambton, Arthur Ephraim Bendall, Henry Albert, and Allan Chambre Merchants first and modern Aldermen. The Court being set the Mayor opened it with a short congratulatory speech and appointed two Attorneys of the Court one the Register the other Mr. John Sarson. It was ordered the Register prepare two petitions suggesting to the Governor a provision for the expenses of the Court. At a Consultation, the 1st March 1728, two petitions from the Mayor's Court are read setting forth that upon a due calculate made of the necessary expenses and charges they have been and are obliged to bear in opening the said Court and paying the salaries to the several officers, they find the present cash very insufficient and unequal thereto, praying this Board would relieve them by placing some of the officers, namely a clerk, a sergeant, six sepoys on the military list; and that the fine of Rs. 2000 now standing upon the books to be appropriated towards a new prison, be taken out of the treasury and employed in the bank at interest or entrusted in the hands of the said Court for answering the most necessary occasions of the said Court. Agreed that the officers there mentioned be supplied from the military list as the Court desires and that the Rs. 2000 be paid into the treasury of the Court to be disposed of as they shall think proper. A Consultation held the 28th June 1728 ordered that the yearly salary of Rs. 500 formerly allowed the Chief Justice be now conferred on the Mayor for the time being.\n\nTwo months later (23rd August 1728) a Consultation records that the list of fees to the Sheriff and the officers of the Mayor's Court\n\ning witnesses blufly questioned their authority and did not even condescend to treat them with courtesy. Government, it is true, took up their quarrel on that occasion and reprimanded the chief, but at other times they interfered with the Court's proceedings and fettered their proceedings. The consequence was that although the Mayor's salary was \u00a362 10s. a year, the same as that of the Chief Justice had been, and the office would under other circumstances have been coveted by senior civilians as a valuable addition to their fortune and influence, it yet became so extremely difficult to find qualified persons for it that frequently when the 20th December, the day of election, arrived no candidates appeared. After repeatedly re-electing the Mayor as often as his term had expired, it became necessary to raise the fine for refusing to serve from one to four hundred rupees and this again led to disputes between the Court and Government, each insisting upon their supposed right to enforce this penalty. Government, however, in this instance had the forbearance to waive their claim until a reference could be made to the Court of Directors and proper regulations be received.\n\nThe criminal justice which the Court dealt was severe in accordance with and beyond the spirit of the age. The ordinary punishment for petty thefts and larcenies was whipping, which was either inflicted at a cart's tail as the delinquent was led round the town wall or else at the public whipping post before crowds of spectators on a market day. Felony was a capital crime and when Mr. Jenkinson's escritoir had been robbed of 15 guineas by his slave boy in connivance with his horsekeeper, the wretched Alexander and Fakirrao were both sentenced to be hanged. About the same time a native woman, who had conspired with her paramour to murder her husband, was ordered to be burnt, a mode of execution by which only female criminals seem to have suffered. Bom.

The same Consultation continues: The Court of Aldermen having elected Mr. Anthony Upton their Mayor for the ensuing year, he was this day (4th January 1742) sworn into office in the presence of the said Court. Similar entries occur in 1744, 1746, and 1747.\n\nThe two following extracts relate to the allowance for palanquins made to officers of the Mayor's Court. On the 23rd January 1740 the Mayor's Court ordered that every alderman resident on this island be in future allowed the monthly sum of Rs. 12 out of the moneys arising by commission on causes determined in the Mayor's Court and the interest on the money belonging to that Court, to keep palanquins for their greater convenience in attending on the said Court. A year later, on the 7th January 1741, this palanquin allowance was raised to Rs. 14.\n\nThe following extracts relate to matters of account and to the appointment of an Accountant General: A Consultation on the 20th August 1736 directed that copy of part of Mr. Browne's letter as well as of the paragraphs of the Company's letter relating to the Mayor's Court be sent the Court by the Secretary, and that he demand of them that the amount of all the fines they have received be paid into the Company's treasury.\n\nA Consultation held a month later (18th September 1736) records a letter from the Mayor's Court stating they had ordered all fines to be paid into the treasury.\n\n---\n\n1 Bom.

On the 5th October 1778 Mr. Daniel Draper writes to the President: It is evident from the records of the Mayor's Court in 1728 that the members then thought it necessary, notwithstanding the then different circumstances of the inhabitants in general, to agree to fine themselves in order to promote their attendance in the business though they were allowed Rs. 14 a month for palanquins.

The Court has always esteemed it so necessary to prevent delays that they have obliged even executors (before the granting of probates) to take an oath to deliver in their accounts within a year, and on granting Letters of Administration have made it a standing rule to take proper security and administer the same oath. Whenever it appears to the Court that the parties are remiss in making good the balance due, they will compel them to do it, and as some have either through forgetfulness or otherwise omitted to deliver their accounts at the proper time, the Court has made an order that their Registrar for the time being call on all executors and administrators for their accounts and in case of neglect acquaint them thereof, which they hope will prevent any delays in future.\n\nThree years later, in 1744, the subject of accounts was again brought forward in a despatch from the Directors, dated the 30th March 1744. The Directors wrote: It being a matter of great importance to the honour of the Mayor's Court and the security of the suitors that the moneys and effects which are ordered to be brought into Court should be kept in a secure manner, and the legislature here having thought by Act of Parliament to establish a method for keeping the money and effects of the suitors of the Court of Chancery under the name of the Accountant General of that Court, and as the same has from experience been found to be useful, we therefore offer it to your consideration whether it may not be proper to put the money and effects of the suitors of the Mayor's Court under a like regulation, by appointing one of our covenant servants to be Accountant General and ordering the money and effects to be paid into our cash. In that case we agree to be answerable to the suitors for such money and effects as shall be so paid into our cash except in case of fire, foreign invasions, or other unavoidable accidents whereby the said moneys and effects or securities may be lost. We likewise agree to be at the charge of such an officer, so that the suitors may not be burdened with any additional fees. This we think should be done under an order to be made by the Mayor's Court, the form whereof we send you herewith. In this order you will find it explained in what manner the moneys and effects are to be paid in and taken out, and how and by whom the accounts thereof are to be kept, which we think\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 14 of 1740-41, 69.\nare so plain as not to admit of any mistake. For your further satisfaction therein we send you the forms in what manner the accounts of the Court of Chancery are kept with the Bank and of the certificates used upon paying in or taking out any moneys or effects. If you should not think proper to fall into the method we propose, then we desire you will inform us in what manner and under what checks the money and effects of the suitors are at present; and we likewise order you annually to send us an account what moneys and securities remain in the Mayor's Court for our notice and observation.\u00b9 This extract was duly forwarded to the Mayor's Court, who in a letter dated the 9th June 1747 reply: Being truly sensible that the office of Accountant General is for the real advantage and benefit of the suitors, we not only readily accept of the Honourable Company's proposal in regard thereto but shall willingly act in conjunction with you for establishing that office whenever your Honour thinks proper to fix a day for that purpose.\u00b2\n\nAt a Consultation held the same day (9th June 1747) the Board after reading the Registrar's letter judge Mr. John Spencer a very proper person for the office of Accountant General, and doubting not of the Mayor's Court's concurrence and as the Honourable Company are willing to be at the charge thereof, it is agreed that his salary be fixed at \u00a350 a year. Mention of this will be made to the Mayor's Court, who will be informed that the Board are ready to receive into the Honourable Company's treasury whatever deposits they may have to lodge there through the Accountant General.\u00b3\n\nIn reply on 14th July 1747 the Mayor's Court write: We are to acquaint you that we have nominated and appointed Mr. John Spencer our Accountant General agreeable to your recommendation, and have this day settled the said office between him the said accountant general and the treasurer of this Court, agreeable to the instructions received on that head from the Honourable Company to which we shall strictly adhere in the regulation and management of that office. We have delivered to Mr. Spencer a schedule or inventory of all deposits and have directed the amount thereof being Rs. 5851-1-71 to be paid into the Honourable Company's treasury.\u2074\n\nThe following extracts give the history of a dispute regarding the form of oath administered in the Mayor's Court:\n\nAt a Consultation on the 22nd April 1746 the Board read a petition from the merchants of the Gentu caste on this island setting forth their uneasiness at the late proceedings of the Mayor's Court. The first ground of complaint was seizing Dharamd\u00e1s N\u00e1gar's books and papers, and suffering them to be removed to their Register's house where they were not only inspected but copies verbally ordered to be taken of them without application having been made to or\n\n\u00b9 Court to Bombay 30th Mar. 1744 para 9, Pub. Dep. Court's Letters Vol. 3 of 1742-1751, 91-92.\n\u00b2 Pub. Diary 20 of 1747, 201.\n\u00b3 Bom. Gov. Consultation 9th June 1747, Pub, Diary 20 of 1747, 199 - 200,\n\u2074 Pub. Diary 20 of 1747, 246.\na precept issued by the Court for that purpose. They represent that a precept was granted for attaching the effects of N\u00e1g\u00e1r L\u00e1lji the father, but that not the least mention was made of the said Dharamd\u00e1s\u2019 name. The second objection was the obliging Gentus to take oaths not heretofore administered by that Court, more especially that of swearing on all occasions upon the cow. Although one or more Hindus with no regard to their castes may have lately been prevailed upon to take a cow-oath still the practice gives Hindus, especially higher caste Hindus, great uneasiness and offence. Notwithstanding they have hitherto complied with the order at the quarter sessions it has always been with great reluctance. The practice puts them to expense and trouble, as after taking such an oath they are obliged to make offerings and pay their Br\u00e1hmans for performing several rites and ceremonies. This petition being taken into consideration, it is observed that as the Mayor\u2019s Court\u2019s obliging them to swear upon the cow on all occasions is the chief point that causes uneasiness it were to be wished that method had never been introduced at the quarter sessions which can happen but four times in the year. At the same time it is to be noted that an oath taken on the Hindu book Gita is esteemed as sacred as any other oath in the Moghal\u2019s or other governments under which the Gentus reside. Under their own government the magistrates administer no oaths on any occasion whatever. Further upon reference to the Royal Charter we find indulgence in regard to castes is recommended and in instructions received with a commission from Chancery, it is said that in case Gentus or any other caste in India choose to make oaths upon the Holy Evangelists it is good. But it must not be forced upon them, but taken voluntarily as it is presumed any oath ought to be. Upon the whole the Board is of opinion that the imposing this oath of swearing upon the cow is likely to be attended with great prejudice to the Honourable Company\u2019s affairs: Such as hindering Gentu merchants from coming to reside upon the island, driving them from it, and giving great uneasiness to those who may remain here. Wherefore it is unanimously agreed that against our next meeting a letter be prepared to the Mayor\u2019s Court very earnestly recommending to them to continue the method that has been hitherto practised in their Court of swearing the Gentus upon the book Gita. That this course be adopted at least till they can be better satisfied from England in so nice a point as that of the imposition of oaths, especially as they must be sensible that a false statement made after taking either oath would be equally deemed perjury and be equally punishable by the law. The Board also wish to be informed of what the merchants say with regard to the seizing of Dharamd\u00e1s\u2019 books and papers and attaching the effects of N\u00e1g\u00e1r L\u00e1lji.\n\nAt a Consultation held the 3rd June 1746, the Board read the following reply from the Mayor\u2019s Court: In regard to imposing (as some are pleased to term it) the cow-oath upon the Gentus, the Court want neither the report of the inhabitants nor any certificates to convince them of its legality or illegality. They are very well assured\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Consultation 22nd April 1746, Pub. Diary 19 of 1746, 125-127.\nthat it is a sacred and obligatory oath agreeable to the religion and laws of the Gentus and hath been the practice upon this island in criminal cases time out of mind. The intention of this Court by administering the cow-oath in civil causes is to promote justice and truth, the end of all such oaths, the Honourable Court having had too many and late instances how light the Banians and other castes of Gentus set by the book-oath. The Grand Jury at the late quarter sessions were sensible of the use of the cow-oath, or certainly they would have dropped it rather than the interpreter's bare refusal to take it should have been any obstacle to justice, although he had sworn by the cow for twenty years past. It is plain that several of the witnesses at the sessions declared that it was equal to them whether they swore on the book or cow. To conclude, as the Honourable Court are very earnest to have the cow-oath brought in practice, they request the authority of this Government to put a stop to the unwarrantable proceedings of some of the natives who seem resolved to obstruct the course of justice in defiance of the laws of England and the laws and religion of the Gentus and the constitution of this Government.\n\nThe Board record that remarks on this letter will be made at the close of the year. No such remarks seem to have been made.\n\nAt a Consultation on the 25th July 1746, the Board read a third petition from the merchants of the Gantu caste on the island repeating their dislike of the Mayor's Court persisting in obliging them to swear upon the cow on all occasions; the Court's attaching Dharamdas' books and papers; and lately their interfering in a dispute among their castes which always used to be adjusted by the caste heads. Upon this it is remarked that the proper method to ease the merchants would be to acquaint the Mayor's Court of their grievances. But as from the Court's late behaviour they have shown no great readiness to afford the merchants redress, it is ordered that the President will acquaint the merchants that they may follow their respective occupations without fear of having their usual privileges infringed on.\n\nA Consultation held a week later (1st August 1746) has the following entry: Several merchants of Surat having been informed from their correspondents on this island that the Mayor's Court had obliged the Gentus on all occasions to swear upon a cow, have written an attestation addressed to this Board concerning the same enclosed in a letter from the Chief of Surat. Translate of this attestation shows the petitioners represent that such an oath is never taken by any authority in Surat, Gujar\u00e1t that is North Gujar\u00e1t, Dekkan, or Hindust\u00e1n, and that nobody swears upon the cow, and that amongst the Gentus it is deemed a very ill thing both in him that swears and in him that obliges any one to swear in that manner.

I am ordered to acquaint you that the Court being sorry to observe the dissensions that have happened in relation to the cow-oath took them this day into serious consideration, and being fully satisfied that the cow-oath has occasioned great uneasiness and discontent among the natives in general, and that whatever oath they take conformable to their religion will be equally binding as well as punishable by law, we have agreed that all suits shall be carried on in the method heretofore practised by this Court. The Board order that this letter be recorded.\n\nAt a Consultation the 4th November 1746, the following petition from black merchants to the President, 20th October 1746, is read and ordered to be recorded: Having presented your Honour several petitions at different times representing the grievance of having the oath upon the cow imposed upon us by the then Mayor's Court contrary to our established laws and religion to which your Honour very graciously attended and were pleased to recommend to the said Court by letter to remit us the same and continue the long established practice of the administration of the oath upon the book called Bhagvat Gita, this matter being lately taken into consideration by the now judges of the Mayor's Court, we have been relieved from the cow-oath both in that Court and by the bench of justices at the late quarter sessions. For this we make bold to address your Honour with the most sincere thanks and acknowledgments. In token of gratitude we shall be always ready and willing to afford this Government the utmost of our assistance even to the extent of our lives and fortunes whenever we may be called upon. Now we set ourselves down in peace and tranquillity under your Honour's Government on all occasions found so mild and indulgent to us, which from your Honour's experienced clemency and goodness we have the greatest reason to hope will be long continued. We add no more but to wish your Honour prosperity and success in all your affairs.\n\nAt a Consultation, the 9th June 1747, the Board record the following resolution on the letter of 30th September 1746 from the Mayor's Court, consideration of which had been put off owing to unavoidable business: As the Mayor's Court became at length sensible that the cow-oath occasioned great uneasiness and discontents among the natives, the Board thinks they acted a becoming part in administering the book-oath heretofore used in that Court.\n\nThe following reply from the Court of Directors, dated the 25th February 1747, was in due course received to the reference regarding the use of the cow-oath: Since the granting of the charter for the\n\n---\n\n1 Bom.

We have from time to time consulted the most eminent counsel upon the subject, and as there is nothing particular in your letter but what has before occurred at our other settlements, we send you extracts from the opinions which have been already taken, and hope they will be sufficient for your Government. Mr. Browne, the Company's Standing Counsel, in an opinion of his, says: 'If the witness voluntarily takes the oath of his country from the hands of a Br\u00e1hman or in a pagoda in order to give a sanction to his testimony before he comes to attest a fact, all that you can do is to afford a greater or less share of credit to his evidence according to the solemnity and the nature of the oath taken and the degree of reverence in which it is held by the Indians; and from this measure and the probability of the fact testified, the Court must form a judgment upon the whole case according to their real belief of the witness.' Again Sir Dudley Ryder Attorney General, Sir John Strange late Solicitor General, and Mr. Browne in a joint opinion say: 'We think it safest for the Court to admit the evidence of heathen witness in such cases as has been usual since the Charter, and upon such oaths as are commonly taken by them in case of evidence according to their respective religions; but to be particularly careful not to oblige them to take such oaths as their customs render it infamous for them to take.' The same gentlemen in answer to another question say: 'We are of opinion the Court cannot compel the taking of the Pagoda oath; and if the Court upon the party's refusal to take oath should without entering into the merits of the cause make a decree against the party, we apprehend it would be an error and a foundation for an appeal; and if the Mayor's Court should endeavour by censure to compel the party to take it, it will be a just ground of complaint against the Court as a mis-behaviour in the office.' Once more the present Attorney and Solicitor General, Mr. Browne, and Mr. Browning, in a joint opinion say: 'If the Mayor's Court should insist on an Indian's putting in his answer or being sworn as a witness in a manner inconsistent with the religion of his caste, it will be proper to bring that matter before the Governor and Council by appeal.' We expect these opinions will have that weight with the Mayor's Court to induce them to alter their manner of proceeding and to accept the answers and evidence of the Gentus and other natives of India upon such oaths as are commonly taken by them; and not to insist upon such as their customs render it infamous for them to take.\u00b9\n\nIn pursuance of the powers granted by the Charter, dated 14th September 1726, the Governor and Council of Bombay were constituted a Court of Oyer and Terminer and Gaol Delivery at the same time that the Mayor's Court was established for the trial of civil suits. Only one volume (1743-45) remains of the register containing the proceedings of the sessions held in the Town Hall or Bohora Baz\u00e1r Street Court House, by the Board of Council for the Town and Island of Bombay,\n\n\u00b9 Pub.

Present in Court: the Honourable William Wake Esquire, Chairman; and John Morley Esquire, William Sedgwick Esquire, George Dudley Esquire, Thomas Marsh Esquire, and Edward Owen Esquire. Tried a case of theft (11th May 1743) of copper dishes and cup.\u00b9\n\nThe Grand Jury deliver (to the Court) two Bills of Indictment against Joseph Coutinho and Badhou for felony and burglary. The Court then tried the case. The evidence being summed up to the jury, they after retiring a short time acquitted the prisoner of the burglary, but found him guilty of the felony, for which he received sentence of death.\u00b2\n\nThe following well-known case has sometimes been referred to as an instance of extraordinary rigour. The sentence of burning for petty treason was, however, the only sentence the Court could legally have passed, as the penalty for compassing a husband's death was the same as for high treason: Gangi indicted for petty treason in aiding and abetting Vitha Bhandari in the murder of her husband, to which she pleaded not guilty, and making no exceptions, the same jury as before was sworn to pass upon her trial. The evidence being the same as against the former prisoner (Vitha Bhandari) who was sentenced to death for this murder, the witnesses were again severally cited and sworn, when they repeated what they had deposed in the preceding trial, particularly that the deceased said\u2014He had found Vitha Bhandari with his wife; that she afterwards put pounded glass in his k\u0101nji and then he was wounded; she left the door open and did not lay on his bed, but upon the ground. Being asked whether she showed any concern at the accident, they declare they did not perceive she did, which they the more observed, as the country women generally make great crying and noise upon the most trifling accidents. The prisoner denied any knowledge of the fact nor did she know of any person being in the house or her husband wounded till waked by him, and that her leaving the door open that night was by her husband's order, as he was troubled with a flux and might have occasion to go out. The Chairman repeating the evidence to the Grand Jury, they retired and after some time found her guilty; and she was sentenced to be burnt.\u00b3\n\nA letter from the Court of Directors, dated the 24th January 1753, contains the following note on capital punishment: With respect to\n\n\u00b9 Bombay Court of Oyer & Terminer Diary 11th May 1743 Vol. 119 of 1743-1745, 2.\n\u00b2 Bombay Court of Oyer and Terminer Diary 27th Oct. 1743 Vol. 119 of 1743-1745, 23, 25.\n\u00b3 Bombay Court of Oyer and Terminer Diary 6th June 1744 Vol. 119 of 1743-1745, 9-40.

Several printed copies thereof we send you herewith. If the Commissioners of Oyer and Terminer think it may be a means to prevent or deter persons from committing that horrid crime, they may, in case of conviction, proceed to judgment and execution, and disposal of the body in the manner that Act directs.\n\nThe Court being a Court of Quarter Sessions, its officers were in theory payable by the county, that is by the householders of the island, who were also liable for the upkeep of the county jail. At a Consultation of the 28th February 1741, the Board record the following entry: The Coroner and Marshal, the former at Rs. 12 and the latter at Rs. 23-3-75 a month, ought, it is certain, to be paid by the county. But as the poverty of the generality of our inhabitants will not admit of a proper assessment to defray the same, and those officers being so essentially necessary, we cannot see any way to provide a relief from that expense. It therefore must be submitted to by our Hon'ble Employers.\n\nIn reply on the 11th March 1742 the Directors write: The reason given in Consultation for our being at the charge of paying a Coroner and Marshal is that the inhabitants are generally so poor that they cannot bear a monthly assessment of Rs. 40 for that purpose. We can by no means admit this to be a fair representation of the case. The several housekeepers must take this charge off our hands.\n\nAccordingly on the 26th August 1743, the Board order that Rs. 44 a month be a fixed tax on the inhabitants for defraying the Coroner's and Marshal's wages.\n\nThe following extracts relate to the appointment of new Justices. A Consultation on the 8th May 1747 records: Mr. Sedgwick's dismissal occasioning a vacancy in the Bench of Justices, Mr. Sanders being fifth of Council upon the island, is now sworn in by the President accordingly. Again on the 8th September 1747 the entry occurs: Mr. George Scott being fifth of Council on the island, is now sworn in by the President as one of his Majesty's justices. And on the 8th December 1747: The removal of Messrs. Whitewell and Munro occasioning two vacancies in the number of justices, Messrs. Sewell and Dorrill are respectively sworn into that office by the President.\n\nThe fact that for purposes of criminal justice Bombay was considered a county, and that the charges of the court's officers and the jail were\n\n---\n\n1 Court to Bombay 24th Jan. 1753 para 16, Pub.

The following extracts show the constant complaints regarding the condition of the jail due to the want of money for repairing it. A Consultation the 3rd May 1728 records: The justices of the late sessions, held the 29th and 30th April and 1st instant, having upon a presentment made them from the Grand Jury, complained of the want of a prison, a plan was laid before them shewing how at a cost of Rs. 2000 Dongri fort can be made proper for the same. As the justices approved and ordered this amount to be levied on the English inhabitants as well as on the several other castes on this island, and as for some time past the said fort has been of no other use than for a prison and may be rendered more commodious than any building we can erect for the same expense, resolved that it be appropriated for that purpose.\n\nAt a meeting on the 12th May 1743 the Court of Oyer and Terminer decided that as money was required to pay the rent due for the county prison and other charges, a sum of Rs. 400 be raised by an assessment on the inhabitants for this purpose.\n\nAgain on the 24th October 1743 the Court order an assessment of Rs. 1800 to be levied on the inhabitants of this island for defraying the prison expenses and other charges for one year, as well as for discharging some debts due from the county and filling up holes on the Green.\n\nAt a Consultation the 19th March 1745 the Board record: The house rented by the Honourable Company of the Modi at Rs. 25 a month and used for the county prison requires such costly repair as neither the Modi nor the county agree to meet. Considering that the county has already laid out Rs. 5000 in building the prison at Dongri since demolished upon erecting the new fortification (1739), it is agreed that some of the lower rooms of the house in the marine yard be appropriated for a prison.\n\nCertain defects having been noticed in the working of the Mayor's Courts, the Company obtained a new Charter from King George II. dated 8th January 1753, re-establishing the Mayor's Court, and repeating the provisions of the earlier Charters regarding the powers of the Governor and Council as a Criminal Court. The new Charter also created a Court of Requests for the summary disposal of small causes. The Directors announce these new arrangements in a letter dated 24th January 1753: When the re-establishment of our settlement at Fort St. George was under our consideration, we intended to have revived the Courts of Justice there, which were granted by the\n\n---\n\n1 Bom.

In 1750 (Grose, I. 49) Dongri fort was still the prison. The prison probably remained in Dongri fort till the fort was destroyed in 1769. Bombay Town Materials, II. 376-377.\nLetters Patent of the 13th year of the reign of his late Majesty. But upon advising with Mr. Attorney General, Mr. Solicitor General, and Mr. York (our Standing Counsel), we were informed that by reason of the taking of that place by the French and their possession of it afterwards, all the powers and authorities which by that charter were granted for holding of pleas in civil actions at Fort St. George were at an end, and that it would be necessary for us to apply to His Majesty for a new charter. There being some defects in the former Charter, and some alterations necessary, and that there might be an uniformity in the constitution of our several Courts of Justice, and in the rules and methods for the administration of justice at our several settlements in the East Indies, we were advised by the same gentlemen to petition His Majesty for leave to surrender our former charters, and that His Majesty would be graciously pleased to grant us a new one for our several settlements. Accordingly His Majesty has been pleased to accept of such our surrender of our said former Charters, and to grant us new Charters for our principal settlements in India; an exemplification of which new charter under the great seal of Great Britain we send you herewith. We also send two written copies of the present Charter and of the surrender of the former, bound separately, the one for the common use of our Governor and Council, the other for the use of the Mayor's Court. By the new charter our President and Council and also the Mayor's Court are, within thirty days after the arrival thereof, to qualify themselves as by this Charter is directed. From that time all powers and authorities granted by the former charters are to cease and to be no longer acted under. At the same time all proceedings as well civil as criminal, which at the time of the arrival of this Charter shall be depending, are to be continued and carried on before their several jurisdictions without abatement or revival. Our President and all our Council are constituted Justices of the Peace and Commissioners of Oyer and Terminer and Gaol Delivery; and the Mayor and Aldermen, who shall be such at the time of the arrival of this Charter, are continued in their several employments. For the future all vacancies in the Court of Aldermen are to be supplied and filled up by our Governor and Council, which we recommend and direct them to do out of our covenanted servants, if at such times there shall be a sufficient number of them fitly qualified. If not, they must supply such vacancies with the principal inhabitants of the place. The Mayor's Court are annually to return two members of their body to our Governor and Council, out of which they are to choose one to be Mayor for the ensuing year. Several rules and directions relative to the Administration of Justice, vary from those of the former Charter. This is particularly the case in the matter of receiving evidence upon affirmation from such persons as by their caste cannot submit to take an oath. All moneys securities and effects of the suitors, which shall be ordered into Court, are to be deposited with our President and Council for which the Company are to be answerable, under such exceptions as in the Charter are mentioned. And an Accountant General is to be appointed, who with the Register of the\nMayor's Court is to keep the accounts between our President and Council, and that Court. In regard to the suing for small debts, as the ordinary method for proceeding in the Mayor's Court is attended with a greater expense than the nature of such suits can bear, a Court of Requests is by this Charter erected for hearing and determining in a summary way all disputes where the matter in question shall not exceed the value of five pagodas (Rs.15). These are the material parts of the Charter, which we at present think fit to take notice of. We strictly recommend to you and to the Mayor's Court that you attentively read over the Charter; and that you and they will in all respects strictly conform yourselves thereto. Within thirty days after the arrival of this Charter, our President and Council are to take the oaths as Justices of the Peace, and Commissioners of Oyer and Terminer and Gaol Delivery, and must afterwards fill up the vacancies, if any, among the Aldermen, who must take the oaths directed by this Charter, being the same as were directed by the former Charter, the forms whereof are to be found in the Book of Instructions sent out to the Mayor's Court with the former Charter of the 13th of the late King. The substance of this Charter, so far as relates to the people and inhabitants, should be published to them in the same manner the former Charter was published. For the particulars whereof, we refer you to your own entries with this addition that it should be known to such of the natives as cannot in their consciences condescend to the taking of an oath, that their evidence is for the future to be admitted upon affirmation, or in such manner as they shall think most binding upon them to speak the truth. The reason for this indulgence to the natives of India to give their evidence by affirmation, is that some persons, we are informed, have lost their debts, and others have submitted to lie in prison rather than to submit to the taking an oath. We also remember that at your settlement, upon its being insisted that the natives should take the cow-oath, they petitioned against it; and, if it was insisted upon, they desired leave to withdraw themselves and their effects from our settlement. The Court of Directors agreeable to the new Charter, by an instrument in writing under the Company's seal sent herewith, have obliged the Company to be answerable in the terms of the Charter sent herewith, for such moneys, effects, and securities as shall be deposited with their Governor or President and Council. By an order under the hands of thirteen or more of the Directors, they have authorized you to appoint an Accountant General and directed him in what manner that office is to be conducted.\n\n---\n\n1 The detailed order runs as follows:\n\nWhereas His Majesty King George the Second by his Letters Patent under the great seal of Great Britain, bearing date at Westminster the eighth day of January, in the twenty-sixth year of his reign did for himself his heirs and successors give and grant unto the United Company of merchants of England trading to the East Indies and their successors; and did thereby ordain, direct, establish, and appoint that there should be for ever thereafter within the town or factory of Bombay in the East Indies one body politic and corporate by the name of the Mayor and Aldermen of Bombay to consist of a Mayor and nine Aldermen; and did thereby give and grant to the said Company and their successors and did thereby ordain direct and appoint that the Mayor and Aldermen for the time being of Bombay aforesaid should for ever thereafter be and they are thereby constituted a Court of Record by\nThe erecting of this office of Accountant General is of such utmost importance to the suitors that we have undertaken to be at the expense of it and that the suitors shall not be burthened. The office itself is new. A person must be appointed by the Governor and Council to\n\nthe name of the Mayor's Court of Bombay; and that they or any three or more of them (whereof the Mayor or Senior Alderman then residing there to be one) may and they are thereby authorized to try hear and determine all civil suits actions and pleas that shall or may arise or happen, or that had already arisen or happened, within the said town of Bombay or within any of the factories subject or subordinate to the said Company's factory or settlement at Bombay or to the Governor or President and the Council of Bombay aforesaid, except as therein is mentioned. And His Majesty in his said Letters Patent, taking notice that it was of the utmost concern and importance to the suitors of the said Court that their moneys securities and effects should be preserved and secured for their benefit in the most careful and effectual manner, and that the same would be most safely kept in the hands of the said Company's Governor or President and Council of Bombay with the cash and effects belonging to the said Company, and reciting that the said Company had undertaken and agreed to be answerable to the suitors of the said Court for all such moneys securities and effects as under the orders of the said Mayor's Court should be paid delivered to or deposited with their said President and Council (except in cases of fire, foreign invasions, or other unavoidable accidents whereby the said moneys securities or effects may be lost), and also to be at the charge and expense which may be occasioned by reason thereof or of the depositing safe keeping and restoring or paying and delivering out of such moneys securities and effects so that the suitors might not be burthened thereby. His Majesty therefore, upon such agreement and undertaking of the said Company, for himself his heirs and successors by his said Letters Patent did will and ordain that all moneys securities and effects of the said suitors as should be ordered into Court or to be paid delivered or deposited for safer custody should be paid or delivered into or deposited with the Governor or President and Council at Bombay to be by them kept and deposited with the cash and effects of the said Company, subject to such orders and directions as the said Mayor's Court should from time to time think fit to make concerning the same for the benefit of the suitors. And His Majesty by his said Letters Patent for himself his heirs and successors did give and grant unto the Court of Directors of the said Company, or the major part of them, full power and authority from time to time to name and appoint an officer with the name of the Accountant General of the Mayor's Court at Bombay, and the same at their pleasure to remove and another to appoint who shall act perform and do all matters and things necessary to carry into execution the orders of the said Mayor's Court relating to the payment or delivery of the suitors' moneys effects and securities unto the Governor or President and Council of the said United Company at Bombay, and taking the same out again and keeping the accounts with the said Governor and Council and Register of the Mayor's Court and other matters relating thereto, under such rules methods and directions as shall from time to time be made and given under the hands of thirteen or more of the Court of Directors of the said Company. Which rules methods and directions His Majesty did thereby will and direct should be according to such rules methods and directions as are observed by the Accountant General of his High Court of Chancery in Great Britain, or as near thereto as might be and the situation and circumstances of affairs would permit. Which said Letters Patent heretofore recited were not to take place or to be of any force or effect until thirty days next after the arrival of such Letters Patent at Bombay aforesaid. And whereas the said United Company of merchants of England trading to the East Indies, by their obligation or instrument in writing under the common seal bearing date the eighteenth day of January instant, have undertaken and agreed to be answerable to the suitors of the said Mayor's Court of Bombay aforesaid for all such moneys securities and effects as under the orders of the said Mayor's Court shall be paid delivered to or deposited with the said United Company's Governor or President and Council at Bombay aforesaid, except in cases of fire, foreign invasions, or other unavoidable accidents whereby the said moneys securities or effects may be lost. And the said United Company by the same obligation or instrument have further undertaken and agreed to be at the charge and expense which may be occasioned by reason of the depositing safe keeping and restoring or paying and delivering out such moneys securities and effects so that the suitors may not be burthened thereby. Now, we, the Court of Directors of the said United Company of merchants of England trading to the East Indies...\nkeep their accounts with the Accountant General. The whole trouble the Register of the Mayor's Court will have, by keeping the like accounts with the Governor and Council and Accountant General, is an additional duty to his office. A proper satisfaction should therefore be made to\n\nIndies, whose names are hereunto subscribed and set, being the major part of the said Court of Directors, in pursuance of the several powers and authorities in and by the said Letters Patent given and granted unto the said Court of Directors of the said United Company, and in order to carry the same into execution subject to such alterations and other regulations as the Court of Directors of the United Company for the time being or the major part of them may hereafter from the exigency or circumstances of affairs think reasonable or proper, do hereby order authorize direct and empower the said Company's Governor or President and Council at Fort Saint George (should be Bombay) aforesaid or the major part of them, whereof the said Governor or President or in his absence the Senior in Council then resident to be one, within thirty days next after the receipt hereof to nominate and appoint a fit and proper person to be the Accountant General of the Mayor's Court at Bombay to act perform and do all matters and things necessary to carry into execution the orders of the Mayor's Court of Bombay relating to the payment or delivery of the suitors' moneys effects and securities unto the Governor and Council of the said United Company at Bombay aforesaid, and taking the same out again and keeping accounts with the said Governor or President and Council and Register of the said Mayor's Court and other matters relating thereto under such rules methods and directions as are hereinafter mentioned, being the same or the like rules methods and directions as are observed by the Accountant General of His Majesty's High Court of Chancery in Great Britain or as near thereto as the situation and circumstances of affairs will permit. And we do hereby direct and order that the person so to be appointed as aforesaid shall be called the Accountant General of the Mayor's Court of Bombay and shall hold such office during the pleasure of the Court of Directors for the time being, or until he shall be removed from his office by the President and Council of Bombay aforesaid or the major part of them, whereof the President or in his absence the Senior in Council then residing there to be one, whom we do hereby authorize and empower to remove the person so to be appointed also the Accountant General for the time being, if they shall see sufficient cause so to do. And in case of the death or removal of the Accountant General for the time being, whereby the said office or employment shall become vacant, we do hereby authorize and empower the President and Council at Bombay aforesaid or the major part of them, whereof the President or in his absence the Senior of the Council then residing there to be one, as often as such vacancy shall happen, to nominate and appoint another person to be the Accountant General of the said Mayor's Court to continue in such office until the pleasure of the Court of Directors shall be known, unless sooner removed by the said President and Council aforesaid.\n\nAnd we do hereby order that an account shall be kept in the name of the Accountant General of the suitors' moneys securities and effects with the said Governor and Council and Register of the Mayor's Court for and on behalf of the suitors of the Court under the rules methods and directions hereinafter prescribed and directed, unless in such instances as the Court of Directors of the said United Company, according to the exigency and circumstances of affairs, shall hereafter otherwise determine and appoint. And it is further ordered that the said Governor and Council the Accountant General and Register of the Mayor's Court do each of them keep a separate set of books wherein they shall respectively make fair and distinct entries of all the moneys effects and securities of the said suitors as shall be ordered into Court or to be paid delivered or deposited for safe custody with the Governor or President and Council at Bombay with the names of the causes and dates of the orders under which the same were paid in or deposited. And that the account in each cause be kept separate and distinct in the ledger by way of debtor and creditor in double columns on both sides, one column to contain the receipts and payments in cash only and the other to contain both securities and cash. And all the moneys securities and effects which shall be so paid delivered or deposited with the Governor and Council shall be kept in the same manner with those belonging to the Company without their paying or allowing any interest for the same. And it is further ordered that in all cases where any moneys effects or transferable securities shall hereafter be ordered to be received deposited or paid into Court, such transferable securities shall be assigned unto and in the name of the Accountant General and his successors in trust to attend the orders of the Mayor's Court made or to be made in\nall these officers for their service. What or how much that should be we cannot at present form any judgment, as that will in a great measure depend upon the trouble they will have and the advantage that may arise to us from such money of the suitors as may be paid into and\n\nthe cause wherein such security is directed to be transferred or assigned. And all moneys and effects, and likewise the said securities, shall be paid into and delivered and deposited with the Governor and Council and shall be placed to the account of the Accountant General of the Mayor's Court and to the credit of the cause wherein such order shall be made. For that purpose it is ordered that the suitor or his agent do attend the Accountant General with the order of the Mayor's Court whereby such moneys effects or securities are directed to be assigned to the Accountant General and paid or deposited with the said Governor and Council. And thereupon the Accountant General is hereby directed to certify to the Governor and Council that they are to receive such moneys effects and securities as are specified in such order, and which shall be likewise particularly inserted in such certificates, and to place the same to his account and to the credit of the cause in which such order shall be made, and in such certificate there shall be set forth the title of the cause and the date of such order. The Governor and Council upon receipt of such certificate shall accordingly take in and receive the moneys effects and securities mentioned in such certificate. And the said Governor and Council or any three of them, whereof the Governor or in his absence the Senior in Council then residing at Bombay to be one, shall give a certificate that they have received such moneys effects and securities, which certificate shall be carried to the said Accountant General who shall certify to the Mayor's Court the delivery of such moneys effects and securities, and shall annex to such report the certificate of the Governor and Council and cause the same to be filed with the Register of the said Mayor's Court. It is further ordered that the said Governor and Council Register and Accountant General shall each of them make due and proper entries in their respective books of all such moneys effects and securities as shall be so paid in delivered or deposited with the said Governor and Council keeping the account in each cause separate and distinct in the ledger and in the journal to set forth the dates of the orders under which the same shall be received or taken in, and describing the several securities. It is, further ordered that in case of paying or delivering out any moneys securities or effects the suitor or his agent do carry to the Accountant General the order of the Mayor's Court whereby such moneys effects or securities shall be ordered or directed to be paid or delivered out. And thereupon the Accountant General shall forthwith by a note or order under his hand draw upon the Governor and Council for such moneys or for the delivery of such securities or effects as shall be ordered by the Mayor's Court to be paid or delivered. And such note or order shall be expressly limited to be paid or complied with within one month after date and if it be not paid or complied with within such time such note or order shall be void. It is further ordered that such note or order shall be first carried to the Register together with the order whereby such payment of moneys or delivery of effects or securities is directed to be made, and an entry shall be made in the Register's books of the said note or order and that the same was drawn by the Accountant General by virtue of such order of the Mayor's Court, and the Register shall write the word entered upon such note or order and shall sign the same. Upon producing such note or order to the Governor and Council and leaving the same with them, it is hereby ordered that the said Governor and Council do issue and pay such moneys and deliver such securities and effects unto the person mentioned in such note or order or to his assigns by endorsement thereon. The Accountant General is to reassign such securities to the person or persons named in the order of the Mayor's Court. It is further ordered that twice in every year, at such times as shall be agreed upon by the said Governor or President and Council and the said Mayor's Court, the books of the said Governor and Council Accountant General and Register shall be balanced. For that purpose and during that interval of time no moneys effects or securities shall be received paid or delivered out, and that a duplicate copy be made of one of the sets of the said books and signed by the Governor and Council Accountant General and Register and transmitted from time to time to the East India Company in England. And the said Governor and Council Register and Accountant General at the first sitting of the Mayor's Court after the respective times before mentioned shall deliver into the said Court an account in writing containing the balances of moneys effects and securities belonging to the suitors of the Mayor's Court in each respective cause at the time aforesaid and shall sign the account and,\nremain in our treasury. We therefore suspend for the present appointing any salaries for these officers, and desire you will let us know your sentiments what salaries should be paid to each of them, with your reasons for the same. In the meantime we permit and authorize you to make them such moderate allowances for their trouble as you shall think reasonable. As the Mayor's Court has been long in possession of their jurisdiction, so that they have established to themselves forms and methods of proceeding, we shall prefer them to follow the same and the rules of practice laid-down in the book of instructions sent them by the former Charter, except in such instances wherein they have deviated from the same. In this we particularly remark that they have suffered the proceedings before them to be prolix and impertinent, whereas in the bill and in the answer the party's case and defence should be stated in the most clear and concise manner, without observations arguments or inferences, all which ought to be expunged as impertinent and as proper arguments for the counsel or attorneys to make use of at the hearing rather than to insert in their pleadings. We cannot help taking notice that special replications and rejoinders with other special proceedings have been admitted after a full answer has been put in, all which we consider as impertinent and occasioning great delays, and putting the suitors to a most unnecessary expense. To prevent the like for the future we do hereby will and order and direct you to acquaint the Mayor's Court that after a full answer is put in, no special replication or rejoinder or any subsequent special proceedings shall be admitted in any case whatsoever. After a full answer is put in, the plaintiff shall reply and the defendant or defendants shall rejoin, according to the common or usual form laid down in the book of instructions. That thereupon the parties give such rules for producing witnesses, and passing publication, as in the said book is directed. This method, as we are informed, is agreeable to constant settled rules of practice in all\n\nshall certify that they have examined their respective accounts with each other and that the balances set forth in the said account do agree with those in their respective books which certificate and account shall be filed among the records of the Mayor's Court. It is further ordered that upon the death or removal of any Accountant General all moneys effects and securities standing in his name or assigned to him as Accountant General shall be and are hereby declared to vest in the succeeding Accountant General without any transfer or assignment whatsoever thereof and shall accordingly be carried to the credit of the account of such succeeding Accountant General in the books of the Governor and Council and of the Register of the Mayor's Court. And it is further ordered that the Accountant General Register or any other officer of the Mayor's Court shall not meddle with the actual receipt of any of the suitors' moneys effects or securities. But such Accountant General shall only keep the account with the Governor and Council and Register of the Mayor's Court according to the rules hereby prescribed and which shall hereafter be prescribed by the Court of Directors of the said United Company. He shall not be answerable for any moneys effects or securities he shall not actually receive, and the said United Company and their Governor and Council at Bombay shall be answerable for the moneys effects and securities of the suitors which shall be received by the said Governor and Council except in cases before excepted. And it is hereby further ordered that no fee or fees whatsoever shall be taken by the said Governor and Council Accountant General and Register or any of them or any of their clerks or servants for any matter or thing done or directed to be done by virtue of this order. And it is further ordered that a copy of this order be set up in the offices of the Register and Accountant General of the Mayor's Court at Bombay aforesaid.\u2014Enclosures to Court's Letters Vol. 8, 29-35.\nthe Courts of equity in this kingdom. If any attorney or solicitor shall offend by inserting any scandalous or impertinent matter in any bill or answer we order and direct that the same be expunged and that such attorney or solicitor, and not the client, do pay the costs occasioned thereby out of his own pocket.\n\nIn the same despatch (24th January 1753) regarding the Court of Requests or Small Causes the Directors continue: An easier more summary and less expensive method for the recovery of debts than the common form of proceedings allows has long been wished for. This has formerly been attempted at all or most of our settlements. But as we then had no sufficient authority to hold such Courts, the design however useful was obliged to be laid aside. The many Acts of Parliament that have of late years passed here for the erecting of such Courts in several cities and boroughs of this kingdom, together with our own opinions, sufficiently convince us of the utility of such Courts. For these reasons we petitioned His Majesty that in the new Charter he would erect such a Court. With this His Majesty has been graciously pleased to comply and we send you herewith, under the hands of thirteen or more of the Court of Directors, certain rules orders and regulations to be observed by yourselves and by the Commissioners of the Court of Requests so far as respectively concerns you. And we do in a particular manner recommend to you and to the Commissioners, that in the first nomination of Commissioners and in all future appointments of them, our covenant servants shall always have a preference or be first named. If there should not be a sufficient number of them to answer this purpose, the rest must be made up out of the principal inhabitants. We likewise recommend it to you that the officers of the Court be as few and the fees as moderate as possible that the suitors may find relief without oppression. As this Court is calculated for the benefit of the poorest of the people, we hope none of our servants or of the inhabitants that shall be nominated Commissioners, will decline the service; as by an honest and faithful discharge of their duty, they may be a blessing to the people. For your further assistance in carrying this part of the Charter into execution, we send you several printed Acts of Parliament, whereby the like Courts are established in this kingdom. We leave it to our President and Council, with the assistance of the Commissioners, besides the orders and instructions we now send you, to take such other parts of the several Acts of Parliament and to establish such further rules and orders of your own, as in your opinions will best conduce to those good ends for which this power was desired and obtained, subject always to our control and alteration. As the Court of Requests will at first be at a loss, with regard to the form of their process and orders and the method of keeping of their books, we send you with this despatch a book of instructions upon this head with an appendix thereto containing the forms of their orders and process, and the method of keeping such books as will be necessary and which are agreeable to the forms and methods made use of in the Court of Requests here. We recommend it to the Commissioners to follow the same,\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Dep. Court's Letters Vol. 4 of 1752-1756, 55-59.\nunless any better method occurs to them, which as often as it does, they are at liberty to pursue. You will perceive by our instructions, with regard to the Court of Requests, that all money ordered to be paid into Court, must be paid into and lodged with the clerk of the Court, to be paid over to the plaintiffs according to the Commissioners' orders. At present these sums will be small and such as the clerk of the Court may himself be sufficient for. In time, and as the Court may happen to take with the people, considerable sums may be lodged with the clerk. We recommend it therefore to the Commissioners to have a watchful eye to this matter; and whenever they think it necessary, to call upon and oblige their clerk to give sufficient security to their satisfaction, to be answerable to the suitors for all moneys which shall be paid into their hands under any orders of Court. To prevent persons suing in the Mayor's Court, where the matter does not exceed the value of five Pagodas, we have made an order which we send you herewith, whereby the Mayor's Court are in all such cases directed not to allow the plaintiff any costs, but to oblige him to pay costs to the defendant.\n\n1 Pub. Dep. Court's Letters Vol. 4 of 1752-1756, 60-62. The following are the detailed orders for establishing the Court of Requests:\n\nWhereas His Majesty King George II. by his Letters Patent under the great seal of Great Britain bearing date at Westminster the 8th day of January in the 26th year of his reign did for himself his heirs and successors give and grant unto the said United Company of merchants of England trading to the East Indies and their successors and did thereby ordain direct establish and appoint that there should be forever thereafter within the town or factory of Bombay in the East Indies one body politic and corporate by the name of the Mayor and Aldermen of Bombay, and did thereby give and grant to the said Company and their successors, and did thereby ordain direct and appoint that the Mayor and Aldermen for the time being of Bombay aforesaid should forever thereafter be and they are thereby constituted a Court of Record by the name of the Mayor's Court of Bombay. And that they or any three or more of them (whereof the Mayor or senior Alderman then residing there to be one) may, and they are thereby authorized to, try hear and determine all civil suits actions and pleas that shall or may arise or happen or that had already arisen or happened within the said town of Bombay, or within any of the factories subject or subordinate to the said Company's factory or settlement at Bombay, or to the Governor or the President and the Council at Bombay aforesaid except as therein is mentioned. And by the same Charter or Letters Patent His Majesty did give full power and authority to the Court of Directors of the said United Company, or any thirteen or more of them, to make such regulations and orders for the better administration of justice in the said Mayor's Court as they should from time to time think fit and necessary. And by the same Charter or Letters Patent for the providing a more speedy and easy way for the recovery of small debts within the said town of Bombay his said Majesty did thereby give and grant to the said United Company and did direct and appoint that there should be a Court of Requests in the said town of Bombay who shall have full power to hear and determine all such actions or suits as should be brought before them where the debt duty or matter in dispute should not exceed or be more than the value of five pagodas. And whereas notwithstanding the provisions made by the said Charter for the suing for and recovering of small debts in a summary way yet vexatious or ill-minded persons may be induced to commence or bring actions or suits in the Mayor's Court of Bombay where the debt duty or matter in dispute may not exceed or be more than the value of five pagodas, contrary to the intent and meaning of his said Majesty's Letters Patent for preventing thereof, We, the Court of Directors of the United Company of merchants of England trading to the East Indies whose names are hereunto subscribed and set, being the major part of the said Court of Directors, in pursuance of the several powers and authorities in and by the said Letters Patent given and granted unto the said Court of Directors of the said United Company do hereby ordain and direct that if in any action for recovery of any debt to be sued or prosecuted against any person or persons in the Mayor's Court of Bombay it shall appear to the said Mayor's Court that the debt\nAND ISLAND.\n\nThe following extract from a Consultation of the 14th September 1753 gives the names of the original members of the Court of Requests:\n\nto be recovered by the plaintiff in such action doth not exceed the value of five pagodas and the defendant in such action shall duly prove by sufficient testimony to be allowed by the said Mayor's Court that at the time of commencing such action such defendant was inhabiting and resident within the said town of Bombay or the factories or districts subordinate thereto and was liable to be warned or summoned before the said Court of Requests for such debt, then and in such case the said Mayor's Court shall not allow to the said plaintiff any costs of suit but shall award that the said plaintiff shall pay so much ordinary costs to the party-defendant as such defendant shall justly prove before the said Mayor's Court it hath truly cost him in the defence of the said suit. And we do further order and direct that this order shall be in force and take place at Bombay and the factories and districts thereof at the same time the Court of Requests established by His Majesty's aforesaid Royal Charter shall take place there.\u2014Enclosures to the Letters from the Court of Directors Vol. 8, 26 - 28,\n\nThe detailed Rules for the conduct of business in the Court of Requests are as follows: Rules orders and regulations made by the Court of Directors of the United Company of Merchants of England trading to the East Indies, to be observed by the Commissioners of the Court of Requests for the town of Bombay and the factories and districts thereof erected by His Most Excellent Majesty King George II. by his letters patent bearing date at Westminster the 8th day of January 1753 in the 26th year of his reign.

That on the first Thursday in December next after the arrival of his Majesty's charter, the said Commissioners shall assemble together and 12 of the persons to be appointed Commissioners, or one-half of the said Commissioners in case their number be less than 24, shall by the ballot of all of them or such of them as shall be present be removed and a number equal to that of those removed shall be chosen by ballot of the remaining 12 or lesser number of those that shall be removed, in the places and stead of such as shall be removed, to continue in such employment until the first Thursday in December in the succeeding year, and until others shall be chosen. And that at the end of the said year that half of the Commissioners who shall have the longest served in such office shall be removed and others chosen by ballot in their places in manner aforesaid and so from year to year on the first Thursday in December forever hereafter. That the said Commissioners do keep or cause to be kept such and so many proper books wherein shall be entered and registered all Acts Orders and Proceedings of the said Court.

Diary 26 of 1753, 315.\nUnder the powers granted by the Charter, the Mayor's Court, under date the 21st July 1763, drew up the following rules, which however were disapproved by the Directors and finally dropped. Regulations drawn up and agreed upon by the Mayor's Court for their observance in practice:\n\nThat all Courts be held by adjournment the Court meeting at the time to which they adjourned themselves whether there is business or not as recommended by the instructions to the Charter, and that no Mayor or senior Alderman have an authority to adjourn a Court when the same is regularly met without their own consent or assigning some sufficient reason.\n\nThat the Mayor and two or more Aldermen hold a Court every Monday at the Town Hall by rotation, and that the first Monday of every month there be a full Court, the day recommended for deciding all material or intricate causes. The members who wilfully absent themselves from such Court to forfeit Rs. 6 unless some reasonable excuse is admitted. Nothing in this rule is to prevent the Mayor, upon particular business such as arrests or attachments, holding intermediate Courts at his own house for despatch of business.\n\nThat all petitions or papers presented to Court be undersigned by the register in default of attorneys.\n\nThat at the Court held the first Monday of every month the register be ordered to lay before them his account current book of estates producing at the same time the accountant general's receipts for whatever sums of money may have been ordered to have been deposited in the treasury in the course of the preceding month, also an account of all Court commission collected, a list of what causes have been decided and of those depending, with the Mayor and register's separate lists of all prisoners confined in the chauki and gaol by the Mayor and Court specifying the time of their confinement at whose suit and the amount of the debt. Likewise that the accountant general and register be ordered to lay their books before the Court at the expiration of every six months in order that the same be inspected and compared.\n\nThat no money to be deposited in the Company's treasury pass through the hands of any of the Court's servants in future, but the following rules be observed therein: (1) Upon the Court's ordering any money to be deposited, the register is to write to the accountant general to bring the same on his books as Court deposits. (2) The accountant general upon receipt of such order from the register is to write to the assistant to the treasurers to lodge the same in the treasury with which when granted he is to acquaint the parties concerned who by their own people are to pay it to the said assistant and he to grant the accountant general a receipt for the amount, which receipt is to be produced in Court as before mentioned. (3) That the same rules be reversely observed with respect to paying money out of the deposits in the treasury to any suitors in whose favour the Court may have decreed the same.\n\nThat the proceedings of each Court day be fair transcribed against\nthe succeeding one and then read over for the information and approval of the members instead of the foul minutes as hitherto practiced.\n\nTaking into consideration the tenour of his late Majesty's Charter with regard to the Mayor's private proceedings, which they remark have of late years been very extensive, though no establishment in the former or present Court appears to authorise the same, and observing that the said Charter makes no mention of any such proceedings being lawful or binding or even gives an opening for them to make any such law as can empower the Mayor of himself to decide causes, this Court have come to the following resolutions regarding his proceedings in future: (1) That the Mayor shall upon any reasonable complaint for debt have a power to commit provided always that the party complained of do not positively deny the debt in which case it becomes disputed and must be determined by a Court. But if the party complained of do not absolutely deny the debt, but endeavour to put it off with evasive excuses, the Mayor is then in such case authorised to commit, and, upon the complainant's declaring he is satisfied and the Court commission being recovered, to set the person complained of at liberty. (2) That the Mayor shall have an authority to appoint arbitrators to adjust any difference between the black inhabitants provided both parties consent thereto limiting the arbitrators to such reasonable time as the intricacy of the case may require and shall likewise exact penalty bonds from the parties for their finally abiding by such award. In case the party against whom such award may have been passed shall refuse to abide thereby or otherwise prove refractory, the Mayor is then to apply to the Court who will give him an authority to enforce the same by distress. (3) That at the expiration of his mayoralty the Mayor shall lay before the Court a regular entry book of all proceedings and shall then pay into the Court cash the amount of commission collected by him after deducting his charges. (4) That the present acting Mayor delivers to the Court all papers in his possession relative to disputed cases undetermined in order for their being proceeded on by the Court. (5) That in future the Mayor's chauki (or lock-up) be under the care of the Sheriff, but in all respects under the orders of the Mayor as formerly, the Sheriff keeping there all prisoners confined for debt during the space of fourteen days and after such time removing them to the county gaol. (6) That all applications to the Mayor be made in writing in the form of a complaint in order that they may be regularly entered in his minute book, that, in case reference is had thereto, the original occasion of such commitment or other act of justice may be produced if required.\n\nIn order to discourage all frivolous and vexatious suits causeless arrests and attachments, as also to prevent any parties being put to unnecessary charge and trouble, this Court propose as a standing rule that in future, when any attorney is applied to for filing a bill against any person or persons whatever, he shall, after fully narrating the subject of complaint, send the said bill with the complainant or complainants to the Mayor for the time being that.\nhe may enquire into the matter and by sending for the opposite party endeavour through his mediation and by persuasive means only to accommodate and make up their difference. If he succeeds in this it must be entered in his minute book and the Court commission recovered and the bill so lodged must then be returned by the party to the attorney with a message from the Mayor acquainting him that the dispute had been accommodated with the mutual consent of the parties. The attorney is then to receive a fee of Rs. 4, which, with the above mentioned Court commission, is all the expense to be incurred on any pretence whatever. If, however, the party or parties seem averse to any agreement the said bill must then be filed and the cause proceeded on in such manner as the law directs.\n\nThat the Register be immediately under the Mayor for the time being as President of the Court and no other member have a right to give him any orders or call upon him except in Court.\n\nThat when any cause is intricate and the amount sued for exceeds Rs. 800, though the same may be ripe for issue at any intermediate Court, it may, upon a motion to that purpose by any member then present, be deferred till the full Court is held. And that in such case, as well as in all other causes when found necessary or required before decision, all the papers relative thereto be sent round to every member of the Court that they may be acquainted therewith.\n\nThat in cases of re-hearing where the party who thinks himself aggrieved by any decree of this Court prays he has fresh matter, it be a standing rule in future that unless the party who so prays a re-hearing file his bill of fresh complaint with the register within twenty days after such re-hearing has been prayed for that his bill be finally thrown out and he entitled to no further redress in the Court.\n\nThat all persons who have any application to make to this Court deliver their petitions or other papers to the register at least one day before the meeting thereof in order that he may know at the meeting of every Court what business is to be done that day and provide the necessary references thereto. Otherwise if the Court is fully employed such papers will be deferred till the next Court.\n\nThat the allowance made for the maintenance of persons confined for debt by their creditors be in some shape proportionable to the station they formerly held in life and that on no account a smaller subsistence be admitted than what the Company give to criminals.\n\nIt having frequently happened that bills have been filed in the Court by persons properly now resident on the island, who, on finding they are likely to be cast have withdrawn themselves from the place, whereby the Court have suffered through the loss of commission and their servants by the loss of their fees, it is in future to be observed as a standing rule that no bill be admitted till such time as proper security has been given to the register for all costs.\nFurther if any attorney takes a cause in hand without the above security he shall be obliged to stand to all costs of such suit.\n\nIn order to prevent the many and apparent evils which have and do happen from diverse people taking upon themselves the management of deceased persons' estates without a proper power from this Court, it is directed to be made public that whoever does in future presume to intermeddle in any such estate without having previously obtained a proper power and authority from this Court and thereby rendered themselves accountable for their administration, shall be deemed to act in contempt of the Court and shall be treated accordingly to the utmost extent of the law. As this Court never refuse granting the administration of any estate to the person who is most properly entitled thereto, it is proposed as a rule in future that whoever takes upon himself the management of any deceased person's estate without a proper power or any reasonable excuse for not having obtained it, shall on account of such behaviour forfeit all title to the legal administration and the Court be at liberty to provide to themselves an administrator. In order to prevent any estate suffering by not being timely administered, it is resolved that if no application is made to this Court for a power of administering within thirty days of such person's decease that the Court do then of themselves appoint an administrator as before mentioned. And further observing that the oath taken both by executors and administrators for the due delivery of their accounts is not a sufficient check, but that many people are very deficient in this material point and often entirely neglect it, it is directed that the Register do in future, when the time of delivering in these accounts is expired, give notice thereof to any such executors or administrators as appear dilatory. And upon their still neglecting or refusing to comply with this necessary form in law, that he make a report of the same to this Court who will then take proper notice of such behaviour. Further that all wills presented to Court in Portuguese or other foreign language be translated into English ere probates are granted. That the Sheriff do in future, on the return of all writs issued from this Court for levying of money by sale or otherwise, render in the full amount of such money levied without making any deduction therefrom for his fees or charges, a bill of which he must first present to this Court before it will be allowed or paid. And he is required strictly to order his officer the Marshal to attend this Court with four sepoys every court-day and he himself be also further made acquainted that in future he accept of no orders from the Mayor or any other single member of this Court, but that all orders be in the name of the Court and through their Register. That he be also reminded when attachments are laid on that the intention thereof is for the security of the complainant not with a view to distress the person complained of, and, though the law requires that all possible security be given the complainant, it nevertheless directs that no unnecessary distress be put upon the defendant. Also that he be ordered to observe it as a standing rule that in taking the necessary steps for the security of the complainant, he at the same time show all possible and consistent lenity towards the defendant, and,\nto the utmost of his power, take every means to preserve such goods that may come under his hands from damage by weather or otherwise, and for the more effectually attaining of this end that he himself be personally present at the laying on of every attachment. That the vereadores of Bombay and Mahim be strictly ordered to deliver in monthly proper and authenticate lists of all persons deceased within their districts in order that powers may be granted to the heirs of such as die possessed of estates to act as executors or administrators, and the Court be satisfied that regular inventories and partillas are properly and timely completed which they are as usual to deliver in for the confirmation of this Court. Further that they be ordered immediately to deliver in the inventories and partillas of all such estates as have not yet been rendered. Being of opinion that their backwardness in complying with the orders of the Court, and often acting in neglect or even in contempt of it, can proceed from no good cause, it is resolved that in future they shall be treated with more severity and upon the least appearance of neglect or contempt in not paying a punctual obedience to the orders issued, they be reprimanded or fined at the Court's discretion.\n\nAt a Consultation on the 26th July 1763, after reading this letter, the Board record: Read letter from the Honourable Mayor's Court enclosing a set of regulations and table of fees for our approbation and requesting the commission on all suits may be limited to Rs. 200 instead of Rs. 100; the sum hitherto collected, as the Court's expenses have of late exceeded their income. Also that the Aldermen may be indulged with the Honourable Company's palanquins and coolies in preference to other inhabitants; and that we would order some presses to be made at the Honourable Company's expense for containing their papers\u2014Ordered that the letter and regulations be sent round to the several members for their perusal and that the Court be desired to send us a comparative view of the fees originally established, those lately collected, and what now proposed, that we may judge how far the same are reasonable. The letter and regulations will then be considered and in the interim the Secretary will furnish them with such presses as he can spare. The Court to be debited for the same and to pay for them when able.\n\nOn the proposed rules of the Mayor's Court, in their despatches dated 12th and 26th March 1766, the Court of Directors write: The letter to you from the Mayor's Court dated 21st July 1763, enclosing their proposed regulations in the practice of that Court, contains in it a very extraordinary remark indeed, namely: that they have of themselves a power to establish these rules, though their being submitted to us is noways contradictory to the tenour of his late Majesty's Charter. If those gentlemen had resorted to that Charter they would have found that the power given them to frame rules of practice, or to do any other thing necessary for the administration of justice is expressly upon condition that they do from time to time give an account thereof to\u2014\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 41 of 1763, 490-496.\n2 Bom. Gov. Consultation 26th July 1763; Pub. Diary 41 of 1763, 488.\nthe Company, and so as that the same be subject to our approbation control and alteration, to whom full power is given to make such rules and orders for the better administration of justice as we shall think fit and necessary. Though the rules made by the Mayor's Court, so far as they are not repugnant to those made by us, are to remain in force until we shall think fit to revoke or alter them, yet we desire that it may be understood by that court that it is their indispensable duty, immediately on their making any such rules or orders, to cause them to be transmitted to us for our consideration, and that we have full power over them to confirm, revoke, alter, amend, or explain as we shall think necessary or expedient. We desire likewise that it may be signified to the Court, that so far from not having any objection, which they hope, that on the contrary our reasons and objections are insuperable, not only against enlarging or increasing their commission on causes of a large amount, but to their having any commission at all upon causes of any amount or of any kind. We are astonished, if this practice had subsisted and was within our knowledge, that we have not from the time it became so put a total stop to it. The very idea of judges being paid a commission or receiving a reward upon the sums they decree to be due is temptation enough to bias their judgments, and to prevent them dealing forth justice, not to mention the great injustice to those suitors on whom it falls to contribute to this commission. If, therefore, the expenses of the Mayor's Court exceed their income, some other means of supply must be devised. For it is our positive order that this practice be forthwith discontinued, which brings disgrace upon their proceedings and hardships upon every individual who is obliged to resort for justice to them.\n\nOn receipt of these orders from the Directors, on 4th May 1767, the Register of the Mayor's Court writes to Government: I am directed by the Honourable the Mayor's Court to acknowledge the receipt of the Honourable the Court of Directors' commands of the 26th March 1766, relative to the regulations proposed by their Court in the year 1763. Respecting this they now beg to acquaint your Honour that on a reconsideration they are perfectly satisfied with their present method of practice as laid down in the instructions to the Charter, and are desirous to give your Honourable Board and the Honourable Company no further trouble regarding them.\n\nRead (5th May 1767) a letter from the Mayor's Court in answer to the paragraph of the Honourable Company's commands of the 26th March 1766, wherein they express their entire satisfaction with their present method of practice and their desire of not further troubling the Honourable Company or us on the subject of the regulations proposed by them in the year 1763. This must be noticed to the Honourable Company in our address by Devonshire.\n\nA Consultation of the 4th November 1766 records: Read a letter\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Dep.

Diary 48 of 1767, 307.\nfrom the Honourable the Mayor's Court requesting that the members thereof may be furnished with palanquin coolies. We are very sensible of the propriety of indulging them in this respect and should therefore very readily comply with their request if the number of the people under the Collector would admit of it. But as that is not the case the Secretary is ordered to signify the same to them. At the same time if they can procure a sufficient number from the other side or elsewhere, the Collector will not interfere with them.\n\nThe following extracts relate to the jurisdiction of and the fees levied in the Mayor's Court. A Consultation of the 6th November 1767 records: The President now lays before the Board a letter addressed to him from the Honourable the Mayor's Court accompanying a list of fees, which being altered agreeable to what he signified to them on this subject, are now approved and signed by him and ordered to follow this Consultation.\n\nAt a Consultation, the 13th April 1769, the Board read the following letter from the Register to the Mayor's Court to the President and Council, dated Bombay 8th April 1769: I am directed by the Honourable the Mayor's Court to enclose two legal questions which have lately arisen in the course of their proceedings. First whether the Court can try an action for defamation; and second how it can grant a commission of lucacy. On these points the Court request your Honour, through the channel of the Honourable the Court of Directors, will obtain the advice of counsel in England for their guidance in future. They likewise direct me to request your Honour will apply to the Honourable the Court of Directors for a set of instructions for executing the present Charter, drawn up in a like ample manner with the instructions formerly sent out for executing the old charter. As the two charters convey different powers, the Court think instructions are as requisite to the present as they were to the former, and will be a certain means to prevent error or doubt in their proceedings. The Court having occasion to refer to the paragraph of a letter from the Honourable the Court of Directors of the 4th April 1767 handed to them by your Honour, wherein the method of depositing the balances of estates in their treasury in the name of the Accountant General is censured as an irregular practice, have ordered the Register to acquaint your Honour, that this practice, however irregular it may now be deemed, is of an equal date with the first appointment of the office of an Accountant General to their Court. It will appear the first deposits were made in January 1745 under the following heads:\n\n| Description                                      | Rs. | q. | r. |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-----|----|----|\n| The Estate of Captain Hercules Courtney           | 204 | 0  | 85 |\n| Hussan Allani against Fakru Munji Mahomed        | 203 | 3  | 30 |\n| Baman Jiya against Kolakhbai Hassanbhai          | 44  | 2  | 55 |\n| The Estate of James Verelst                      | 1713| 0  | 30 |\n\nTotal ... 2165 3 0\n\n---\n\n1 Bom.

For details of fees see above footnote 1 pages 11-12.\nThis method has been continued in all time past as the books of that office will show. The Honourable Company are pleased to direct that in future such moneys shall be paid into the treasury for bills of exchange. As to this the Court would acquaint your Honour that it seldom happens any money is deposited in this manner. The only case is when the connections in Europe of the person deceased, his heirs executors or any persons in whose favour the bills might be drawn, are unknown and the money is lodged in the treasury as a place of the greatest security until it appears to the Court whose property it is. In this light only have such funds been considered suitors' money. At the same time the Court being very desirous as far as is in their power to comply with the Honourable Company's intentions, they have directed me to request your Honour will explain to them the above mentioned paragraph, and point out the particular method in which you choose any such sums should be paid in future.\n\nThe Board ordered the questions be referred to the Court of Directors by the Essex and that consideration of them be at present deferred.\n\nThe following answers to the Mayor's Court's questions were received in a despatch from the Directors dated 6th April 1770: As regards defamation the Company's solicitor decides that as the Mayor's Court have by the charter of justice a power to try all civil actions, there is no doubt their authority extends to actions for defamatory words, which must be proved by written evidence in the manner other suits are determined in that Court. If the charge is proved the Court may adjudge and decree the defendant to pay what sum of money they shall think reasonable by way of damages for the injury the plaintiff shall have sustained. As regards the commission in lunacy the opinion is that, the Mayor's Court having no authority vested in them by the charter of justice to issue commissions of lunacy, they can exercise no such jurisdiction.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 20th December 1774 the Board read a letter from the Register of the Mayor's Court by the Court's direction, enclosing in consequence of our order a copy of the present table of fees and another of the fees established in the year 1767. Both lists are now considered and such a table is drawn out for the future as we esteem proper to be collected. Ordered that a copy of this table be transmitted to the Mayor's Court with directions that none of their officers be permitted to levy fees in excess of the amounts therein allowed to be charged, and that a copy of it be hung up in the most conspicuous part of the Court-room for the information of all persons whatever.\n\nFour years later, at a Consultation on the 25th November 1778, the Board considered a statement of the charges of the Mayor's Court which amounted in the past year to Rs. 3772. After consideration\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 53 of 1769, 455-456.\n2 Bom. Gov. Consultation 13th April 1769, Pub.

Pub. Diary 74 of 1778, 881. Forrest's Home Series, II, 232.\nMr. Ashburner is of the same opinion. (3) Mr. Stackhouse is of opinion that the charges according to the account delivered in, should be defrayed by the Honourable Company and that proper allowances should be settled for the Mayor and Aldermen. (4) Mr. Moore is of the same opinion and thinks the allowances for the Mayor should be settled at Rs. 100 a month and for each Alderman at Rs. 50 a month. In this Mr. Stackhouse concurs. (5) Mr. Carnac is of opinion that as public justice is a public benefit, the expense of administering it should be defrayed by the public and that as the Honourable Company by fixing salaries for the Mayor and Accountant General have ascertained how far they meant to contribute towards defraying the charges of the Court, it will not be agreeable to them to be put to any further charge. At any rate in his opinion the Aldermen should receive nothing further than an allowance of Rs. 30 a month for a palanquin. (6) Mr. Draper and the President (Mr. Hornby) are of opinion that the charges should be borne by the suitors. The opinions being collected, it is carried by a majority that the charges according to the account delivered, shall be defrayed by the Honourable Company, which is resolved accordingly; and that the amount thereof being Rs. 3772 a year be issued from the land pay office to the register in monthly payments to commence from the day the collecting of commission (on the sum or value of the property decreed in every suit or action) was abolished. The Mayor's Court having hitherto allowed out of the commission cash a monthly pension of Rs. 40 to the orphan child of the late Mr. Edward Warner a servant of the Company's, a young man of a good character and died totally insolvent, resolved as the child is left entirely destitute by the father's relations, that as an act of charity the pension be continued and borne by the Honourable Company.\n\nThe expenses of the Court of Appeals amounting, according to an account laid before us by the Register to Rs. 34 a month, must also be defrayed by the Honourable Company. It is resolved and hereby made a standing order that no Company's servant of the rank of writer be hereafter permitted to commence as attorney in the Mayor's Court, as the whole term of their writership ought to be devoted to the Company's business. It is ordered that this resolution be communicated to the Mayor's Court that they may not in future admit any writers as attorneys.\n\nIn consequence of a letter from the Mayor's Court, it is resolved that the members of the Court be allowed Rs. 30 a month for a palanquin, to commence from the same term as the payment of their other charges.\n\nAt a Consultation, the 18th March 1779, the Board read the following letter from the Register of the Mayor's Court to the President and Council, dated Bombay Town Hall 8th March 1779: I am directed by the Honourable the Mayor's Court to request you will be pleased to fill up the two seats of judges made vacant by the resignation\n\n---\n\n1 Bom.

Vol. 2 of 1759-1788, 298.\nof Mr. Alderman Thomas Holmes and the departure for Europe of Mr. Alderman Richmond Smith. I am further commanded to acquaint your Honourable Board that on the most serious consideration of the reasons assigned by Mr. Thomas Holmes for leave to resign, his gown in a letter this day read, this Court beg leave to recommend that all future vacancies on this bench may be filled up by gentlemen not in the service of the Honourable Company.\n\nAfter consideration the Board record the following entry: Though it has been the practice for several years for the Mayor's Court to admit of the resignation of their members in particular cases, yet it is very evident from the Charter that they have no such power, and that, except in certain contingencies therein expressed, an alderman is to continue in office for life, therefore it must be signified to the Court that such practice will not be admitted in future. The Charter having made us the judges what persons to appoint aldermen, we think the Mayor's Court have no right to interfere therein or to recommend what persons should be made choice of.\n\nIn the following year instructions on certain points of legal procedure were received in a letter from the Court of Directors, dated 5th July 1780. The Directors write: We enclose you a copy of the opinion of George Rous Esq., the Company's Standing Counsel on the following questions:\n\n1. Whether an Alderman of Bombay can resign his office; and if he can, whether such resignation should be made to the Mayor's Court or to the Governor and Council?\n\n2. Whether a Coroner can be appointed for Bombay and by whom? To these opinions you are to conform yourselves.\n\nThe Directors continue: It is not in our power to control the proceedings in the Mayor's Court. The jurisdiction granted to them by charter is to try civil causes arising within the town or factory of Bombay or within any of the factories subject or subordinate thereto. Therefore, although the Chief of Mahim may have usually taken upon himself to exercise a judicial authority in determining little matters of property between the inhabitants of that district, as related in paragraph 181 of your letter of 30th April 1779, we apprehend that such proceedings are not warranted or legal. At the same time in cases where both parties are desirous to avoid the trouble expense and delay of a suit in the Mayor's Court, they may do it by a reference; and whatever the Chief of Mahim shall determine in quality of arbitrator respecting the rights of the parties, will be binding upon the Mayor's Court as an award. But if the parties refuse to perform the award without compulsion its execution can be enforced only in the Mayor's Court.\n\nIn 1798 the Mayor's Court was abolished and in its place was established the Recorder's Court, the first recorder being Sir William Syer, Bart.\n\n---\n\n1 Pub.

The opinions of Mr. Rous have not been traced.\nThe following extracts relate to the establishment of this Recorder's Court. On the 25th May 1798, the Court of Directors write to Bombay: In pursuance of an act in the last session of Parliament His Majesty has seen fit by his royal charter to establish a new Court of Judicature to be held for the settlement of Bombay and the territories subject to that Government. It is styled the Court of the Recorder of Bombay and is to consist of a Recorder and the Mayor and three of the Aldermen of Bombay all of whom are by turns to act as judges in the new Court by rotation as pointed out in the charter which will be delivered to you by Sir William Syer whom His Majesty has appointed to the office of Recorder. Upon the arrival of Sir William you must in concert with him do what is necessary on the part of the Government for the open publication of the new charter and for establishing the new Court in its functions. Upon that event the Mayor's Court and Court of Appeals and the present Court of Oyer and Terminer will be at an end and all their powers and authorities will cease. From that time these powers will be exercised by the Court of the Recorder which is invested with the whole civil and criminal jurisdiction at present belonging to the Mayor's Court and Court of Oyer and Terminer. The records of both these Courts must be delivered over to, and be deposited with, the new Court. The appointment of the ministerial officers of the Court is to be made by the Court itself. We feel confident that in making such appointments the Court will pay every attention to make the arrangement both in regard to the numbers and emoluments of the officers as economical as shall be consistent with the due and punctual administration of justice. As well for this purpose as upon every other occasion we direct that all our servants give such information and assistance as may be in their power and shall be requisite towards the establishment of the Court upon such a footing as shall be most conducive to the ends of public justice and the furthering His Majesty's gracious intentions for the benefit of the inhabitants of the countries comprised in the jurisdiction granted to the new Court. You will observe by the Act of Parliament, in pursuance of which the present charter is granted, that the Mayor's Court only is to be abolished. The Corporation of the Mayor and Aldermen erected by the charter of the 8th January 1753 is to remain entire and to be continued as directed in that instrument. The Act of Parliament provides that the Recorder is to be paid the yearly salary of \u00a35000 at an exchange of 2s. and 6d. for the Bombay rupee. We direct that this salary shall be paid accordingly. It is to commence from the day on which Sir William Syer shall embark from Great Britain. His Majesty has seen fit to declare by the charter that the Recorder for the time being shall be entitled to rank next after the Governor of Bombay. We therefore direct that he shall enjoy such rank and that Sir William Syer shall have every attention shown to him which is due to his high situation and his own merits. We direct that by the earliest conveyance after the establishment of the Court shall be formed, you send us an account of it as well as copies of all rules and regulations which may be framed, and also in future of all alterations which may be made therein from time to time.\n\n1 Pub. Dep. Court's Letters Vol. 14 of 1796-1797, 176-178.\nReferring to these instructions on the 29th January 1799 Government write to the Court of Directors: Sir William Syer arrived here on your ship the Melville Castle on the 29th September (1798). Since his arrival the establishment of this new Court has had full effect in pursuance of the clauses in the Act. The necessary instructions have been issued to the proper officers in regard to the payment of his salary and his rank has been fully promulgated. We shall also punctually attend to your requisition to be furnished with copies of all the rules and regulations which may be framed in this new Court, which we have noticed to the Register that he may take care to furnish us with them.\n\nIn the same letter of 29th January 1799 Government continue: Enclosed we have the honour to submit to your Honourable Court an address from the Corporation of Mayor and Aldermen at this place accompanied by a letter on the subject from Sir William Syer the Recorder, by the establishment of which Court it would appear that all the advantages they formerly derived from the execution of their judicial functions as civil magistrates have been entirely superseded by the provisions in the late charter, while at the same time their duties are increased by the share they are now obliged to take in the administration of criminal justice. The pecuniary advantages they formerly enjoyed appear to have been derived from the practice founded under an established usage rather than on law. By this usage the Mayor was in the habit of holding what was termed his private Court for the decision by summary process of causes of small value between the natives. The established fees of this Court are averaged by the present Corporation to have yielded an annual income of Rs. 25,000. At the same time we deem it advisable that your Honourable Court might more fully judge of the authority or cause of the original establishment of this Court of small causes, the nature and extent of the duties performed in it, the degree of convenience derived therefrom to the community or of inconvenience from its abolition, the rates of fees established for this private practice and how authorised and collected. We therefore beg leave to lay before you a report on these several heads by your Solicitor, which we have required of him with the view of leaving to your Honourable Court to determine how far the re-establishment of this Court and fees may or may not prove the more eligible means of still recompensing the Mayor and Aldermen. At all events we can suggest no other course which will not be attended with heavy expense to the Company. We would further remark that the voluntary jurisdiction thus exercised by the Mayor has been found of such convenience to the inhabitants that their being deprived of that summary course in cases of small value causes considerable hardship. Whether this or any other consideration should operate to the restoration of the Mayor's separate and limited umpirage, we presume not to determine, especially as it is probable the Recorder may be able to provide some remedy for the present acknowledged evil under such a subsidiary rule and summary process as the present charter\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Dep. Letters to the Court Vol. 32 of 1797 - 1799, 264.\nmay admit of. Whether such an arrangement may answer future experience will show. Meanwhile we have to solicit your commands as to how the claimants are to be rewarded for performing duties which it is hardly to be expected they can continue to execute as at present gratis. Government further add: Since closing our present address we received from the Recorder an account of the latest arrangement in his newly established Court at this Presidency and his letter on the occasion. We submit copies for the information of your Honourable Court. Our resolutions in regard to these arrangements will be communicated hereafter.\n\nOn the subject of the memorial mentioned in the above letter the Court of Directors write to Bombay on the 28th August 1800, paragraph 65: In answer to the 163rd paragraph of the 29th January 1799 transmitting a memorial from the Mayor and Aldermen of Bombay requesting that some permanent allowance may be granted to the Mayor for the time being for his attendance in the Court of the Recorder, we must observe that had it been in the contemplation of the legislature that the Company should sustain any greater expense by the institution of this Court than is mentioned in the Act, it would have been so declared. But as neither the Letters Patent of the 13th George I. and the 26th of George II. for the establishment of the Mayor's Court nor those of the 37th of his present Majesty for the recent institution of the Recorder's Court make provision for any salary for the Mayor and Aldermen, we should not feel ourselves justified in complying with the prayer of the memorial.\n\nAt a Consultation, the 2nd April 1800, the Board read the following letter, dated the 31st March 1800, from the Register to the Court of the Recorder: Honourable Sir, I have the honour to inform you, by the direction of the Court of the Recorder, that on account of the numberless inconveniences attending the present court house (Colonel Jones' house in Marine Street), the Court have in consequence of the late permission of the Governor signified to the Recorder agreed with Mr. Maister for the Admiralty House (the present Great Western Hotel) on the following terms:\n\n1. Mr. Maister on behalf of Mr. Hornby agrees to let to the Government of Bombay the large house called the Admiralty House, with the offices and appurtenances thereunto belonging (except the six large godowns or warehouses under the same, the large batty warehouse thereto belonging in the lane contiguous, and the enclosed godown or warehouse in the back court or yard belonging to the said house), for the term of one year commencing on the 1st April 1800 at the rent of Rs. 500 a month to be paid monthly by the Government of Bombay to Mr. Maister or to any other duly appointed attorney of Mr. Hornby.\n\n2. It is agreed that the Court of the Recorder shall be erected and held in the said house during the said term, but that the chunam\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Dep.

That Mr. Maister shall put and keep in repair during the term the roof, tiles, mats, and venetian blinds belonging to the said premises.\n\n4. That Mr. Maister shall also put in repair the glass windows, locks and bolts, and leads for the windows, which shall afterwards be kept and left by the Government in the same repair in which they shall be received.\n\n5. That Mr. Maister and his assigns shall at all times during the term have free ingress egress and regress to and from all the godowns or warehouses and other parts of the premises excepted out of this agreement.\n\n6. That if either party should be unwilling to extend or prolong this term, he shall give two months' notice of his intention to the other previous to the expiration thereof.\n\nI have the honour further to acquaint you by the direction of the Court that not having occasion for the whole of the premises, and wishing to put the Government to as little expense as possible, they have agreed to let a part of the premises to Mr. Cleaver for Rs. 200 a month, the rent to commence on 1st April 1800 and to be paid monthly to the Government. I am also further to add that sufficient room will be left on the premises for the reception or accommodation of such furniture as belongs to the Government and was heretofore deposited in the said house for the use of the admiralty. I am also directed to request that you will be pleased to give directions to the civil architect to remove the court from the present court house to the admiralty house.\n\nBelow this letter the following entry is recorded: The Board from a desire of affording every accommodation to the Recorder's Court acquiesce in the above reported arrangement. The civil paymaster to be advised thereof with directions to recover the monthly rent stipulated to be paid by Mr. Cleaver for his portion of the building in question; and to remove the Court as suggested in the last paragraph. Mr. Pearson is also to be instructed to credit this house with the monthly sum of Rs. 50, being the amount that he reported to the Government would be required for the hire of a godown to keep the admiralty furniture in, which is now to remain in the court house.\u00b9\n\nRegarding the Prothonotary's office on the 25th July 1799 Government write to the Court of Directors: Upon a representation from the Recorder of which we had the honour to advise your Honourable Court under date the 13th June last, we have since taken into consideration the inadequacy of the Prothonotary's office establishment, and finding a considerable increase thereof absolutely necessary to enable him to bring up the records of his department now much in arrear and to furnish copies for Europe, we have agreed to allow him\n\n\u00b9 Bom. Gov. Consultation 2nd April 1800, Pub. Diary 147 of 1800, 765-767.\nto draw on this account at the monthly rate of Rs. 850. The allowance to commence with the institution of the Recorder's Court at this Presidency and to continue until the 15th June 1800, when it is hoped the records will be sufficiently advanced to admit of a revision of the establishment authorised.\n\nReferring to the above letter Government write on the 29th November 1800, paragraph 64: In our address of the 25th July 1799 we had the honour to advise your Honourable Court of an allowance granted to the Prothonotary and Register for the Recorder's Court for an establishment to bring up the records of the late Mayor's Court and for contingencies of office. This allowance being granted for a specific period ceased on the 15th of June last, but the present Prothonotary having represented the arrears of this department and other necessary business in it absolutely requiring the continuance of the establishment for some time longer, we have accordingly sanctioned it under such restrictions as will, we trust, obviate its misapplication or duration beyond the period it may be indispensably required.\n\nOn the 31st December 1801 the Court write: If the extra allowance of Rs. 550 a month for copying the proceedings of the late Mayor's Court shall not have ceased, we direct that the same be forthwith discontinued.\n\nSix months later, 30th June 1802, Government write: A copy of the 33rd paragraph was transmitted immediately on receipt to the Court of Recorder at this Presidency and to the pay and audit departments, but your Honourable Court will perceive that the Prothonotary's extra allowance had previously attracted our notice and that it was ordered to cease on the 31st May last.\n\nNext year, 5th February 1803, Government explain: In connection with the subject of the 33rd paragraph of the Honourable Court's commands of the 31st of December requiring the discontinuance of an extra allowance granted to the Prothonotary of the Recorder's Court at this Presidency, we take this opportunity of observing that it appears by our records that the Recorder made a representation to us on the 11th of June 1799 respecting that officer's establishment for clerks peons and other items amounting to Rs. 500 a month, with Rs. 50 for office rent and Rs. 300 on account of clothing for the Court and Aldermen's peons, stationery, and annual presents of shawls, the whole amounting to Rs. 850. Out of the former sum of Rs. 500 the Register was to employ a sufficient number of writers for the purpose of completing the records of the late Mayor's Court which were directed to be brought up and transmitted to your Honourable Court. On the 11th June 1799 we sanctioned this establishment of Rs. 850 and ordered that the Prothonotary should make a monthly report to the civil auditor of his progress in copying the records, in order that when completed this establishment should be revised. In April 1800 the\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Dep. Letters to the Court Vol. 32 of 1797 - 1799, 377.\n2 Pub. Dep. Letters to the Court Vol. 33 of 1800 - 1803, 61.\n3 Pub. Dep. Court's Letters Vol. 15 of 1800 - 1803, 206.\n4 Pub. Dep. Letters to the Court Vol. 33 of 1800 - 1803, 180.\nCourt was removed to the Admiralty House and from that period the sum of Rs. 50 for office rent has been discontinued. On the 22nd of April 1802 the Prothonotary reported to the civil auditor that the records of the late Mayor's Court would be completed in the ensuing month. In consequence of this a revision took place and the establishment of the office of Prothonotary to the Recorder's Court now stands as follows: For clerks and peons Rs. 335; clothing and stationery Rs. 164-2-0; total Rs. 499-2-0; making a reduction of Rs. 300-2-0.\n\nOn this in a letter of the 31st August 1804, paragraph 91, the Court wrote that the matter is already replied to.\n\nOn the 7th October 1802 Sir William Syer died and on the 20th October 1802 Government write to the Court of Directors: It is with much concern that we announce to your Honourable Court the death on the 7th instant of Sir William Syer, the Recorder at this Presidency. In consequence of this unlooked-for event the measures prescribed by the Charter have been adopted by the Mayor of the Corporation, whereby the junior judge of the Supreme Court of Judicature at Madras has been invited to repair to this Presidency to supply the vacancy that has thus occurred. On this occasion we consider it as no more than a duty of justice to the memory of the deceased to make known to your Honourable Court the very favourable impression left on the public mind by the faithful and upright discharge of the important functions of the high office of Recorder while held by the late Sir William Syer. His death will long be viewed as a very serious loss to this community. It constitutes a peculiar subject of regret to your Government with which Sir William preserved the utmost harmony throughout his most useful and judicious administration of the authorities vested in him which he never sought to exercise but for the essential and important purposes of insuring impartial justice to those within the limits of his jurisdiction without seeking to extend them beyond that criterion or to cramp your Government in the execution of theirs. In truth he was in all respect so dignified and worthy a character that his memory cannot be held in too great honour and we have only to wish that his successor may tread in his steps.\n\nReferring to this event the Court write to Bombay on the 31st August 1804, paragraph 63: We are concerned at the information communicated in these paragraphs of the death of Sir William Syer.\n\nAs has already been noticed, the Governor and Council continued to exercise the same criminal jurisdiction under the new Charter of 1753 as under the old of 1726. In spite of frequent complaints the county still continued liable for the cost of criminal justice. At a Consultation dated the 26th October 1762 the Board read a letter from the Clerk of the Peace submitting the following representation from the Grand Jury to the Court of Sessions, dated Bombay 22nd October 1762: That notwithstanding, the frequent and large assessments laid thereon, this county is greatly indebted, owing to the increase of European prisoners' charges which\n\n---\n\n1 Pub.

The Grand Jury do therefore request the Court will represent it to the Honourable Company, that the fines annually collected may in future be applied for easing the county in some shape of the heavy load they at present labour under. This the Board agree to transmit for the observation of their Honourable Masters.\n\nThe following extract shows that the question of swearing on the cow in the criminal courts was again raised. At a Consultation of the 25th July 1771 the Board read the following letter from the Clerk of the Peace, dated 23rd July 1771: One of the prisoners having objected to the present mode of administering oaths to the Gentus as not sufficiently binding and having desired that his witnesses might be sworn on a cow, the Grand Jury have delivered it as their opinion that this is the most effectual and indeed the only way of obliging these people to speak the truth and have recommended the adopting of this method of administering oaths to that caste, as the same is practised at Fort William and Fort St. George and was formerly practised here. On reading the above the Board decide that its consideration be deferred.\n\nAt a Consultation the 9th May 1775 the Board read the following letter from Mr. Edward Ravenscroft Clerk of the Peace, dated Bombay 8th May 1775; His Majesty's Justices at the last quarter sessions assembled, have directed me to represent to your Honour that in the month of March last a most horrid murder was committed on a Banian boy named Pitambar, whose body was afterwards found in a house inhabited by a number of the people called Bhatis. That although a strict examination was made into this affair by the acting magistrate and afterwards by the Grand Jury, no evidence could be found sufficient to fix the charge upon any particular persons. His Majesty's Justices therefore, as the only likely method to effect a discovery, have directed me to recommend to your Honour to offer a handsome reward and promise of protection to any persons who will give information regarding this murder so that the offenders may be brought to justice. Below this letter is the following entry: Agreed that we comply with the desire of the Court. The Secretary is therefore ordered to issue a publication offering a reward of Rs. 500 for the discovery of the murder so that the offenders may be brought to justice; and assuring the person or persons who may make this discovery, that he or they shall receive every protection on this account that they can desire or that we can afford them.\n\nThe keeping of the jail in proper repair was always a matter of great difficulty as the proceeds of the county cess levied on the householders for jail purposes seem never to have been sufficient. At a Consultation on the 24th July 1771 the Board read the following letter from the\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 39 of 1762, 612.\n2 Bom. Gov. Consultation 26th Oct. 1762, Pub.

Under this letter is the entry: The consideration of this letter is deferred.\n\nAt a Consultation the 19th January 1773, the Board read the following letter from Mr. George Page, clerk of the peace, dated Bombay 19th January 1773: John Butler, a person in the service of the Honourable Company, being presented at the last sessions by the Grand Jury to the Court together with his house as a nuisance to the island, I am directed to address your Honour requesting you will be pleased to take such notice of his conduct as you may think it deserves. On this the Board record that John Butler presented to us as a nuisance be sent to England in the ship Speaker.\n\nAt the same Consultation (19th January 1773) the Board read the following from the Clerk of the Peace of the same date: The Sheriff having mentioned to His Majesty's Justices that the county jail is in a ruinous and untenable situation and entirely unfit for the reception of prisoners and having declared it impossible for him to be answerable for the persons confined in it in its present condition, the Mayor's Court have ordered me to refer the same to your Honour. On this the Board record: The land paymaster is directed to cause a survey of the jail to be made as also of the town hall which has been presented as unsafe by several grand juries, and report their present state and condition to the Board that we may determine respecting them.\n\nAt a Consultation a month later (19th February 1773) the Board record the following entry: The land paymaster lays before the Board agreeable to order a report survey of the town jail (which was within the Marine Yard enclosure) and town hall. By this it appears the jail is in good condition but the town hall wants some repairs.\n\nAt a Consultation on the 6th August 1777 the Board read a letter of the same date from the Clerk of the Peace forwarding the following presentment from the Grand Jury, dated 18th July 1777: The Grand Jury again present the ruinous condition of the town jail where debtors and felons are under confinement in the same rooms, and many of them are actually not defended against the inclemency of the weather. The Jury desire the Sheriff may be called on by the Court to inform them of its true state, when they are certain it will be found to require the Court's immediate and most serious consideration to which they in the strongest terms recommend it.\n\nOn this the Board record: We are well convinced the jail is ruinous, insecure, and unfit for the use to which it is put. We think a\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 58 of 1771, 679-680.\n2 Pub. Diary 63 of 1773, 37, 40.\n3 Pub. Diary 63 of 1773, 40.\n4 Bom. Gov. Consultation 19th Jan. 1773, Pub. Diary 63 of 1773, 37, 40.\n5 Bom.

We therefore order the engineer to survey it and to report what alterations or additions may be necessary with the expense of carrying the same into execution. A suitable place must also be provided within the town to serve as a Round House for the confinement of prisoners previous to their examination before a magistrate.\n\nSix weeks later, at a Consultation of the 26th September 1777, the Board read a letter from the engineer together with an estimate of the expense of converting part of Fort George into a jail. This project appearing to be attended with great expense and other insurmountable objections it is given up. At the same time as a jail is indispensably necessary the engineer is now sent for to give his opinion if any other more convenient place can be found for this purpose. He accordingly attending and being consulted on the subject, seems to think that the present jail will admit of being enlarged so as to afford sufficient room to make separate and secure places of confinement for the debtors and the felons. Before we proceed further in this affair the engineer must be directed to prepare a plan and estimate of the proposed additions, and jointly with the master attendant to survey the ground he proposes taking in, that all inconveniences to the fortifications and to the marine yard may be avoided.\n\nAt a Consultation held a year later (29th October 1778) the Board read a report from the committee appointed to survey the town jail. As the expense of repairing the present jail is estimated at so considerable a sum as Rs. 10,252-3-0 and as the building is otherwise inconvenient and from its situation particularly so to the marine yard, it is resolved that the engineer be directed to inquire and report if a proper place cannot be found in the town to build an entire new jail which we suppose will not cost more than the above sum.\n\nMeanwhile the complaints against the existing jail were growing louder. At a Consultation of the 28th July 1779 the Board read the following letter from the Clerk of the Peace, dated 27th July 1779:\n\nThe Sheriff represents to the Bench that the public jail of this town is now in so bad a condition that he thinks it a duty incumbent on him to request on behalf of the miserable people who are therein confined, that till a new jail is built, the Court will take such steps as they may think proper to make it more comfortable. He further adds that at this time the jail is very full of prisoners and that there is scarce a dry place for any one of them, owing to which many debtors are now in a very sickly state. The Sheriff further represents to the Court that soon after his taking charge of his office he found that the county was considerably indebted to many of its officers and servants which upon inquiry appeared to have been accumulating for several preceding years owing to an increase in the expenses of the county and the insufficiency of the sums assessed for defraying them. He therefore now begs leave to lay before the Court a particular statement of what\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Consultation 6th Aug. 1777, Pub. Diary 71 of 1777, 320.\n2 Bom. Gov.

The Court taking this into consideration are of opinion that it would not now be proper to lay an additional assessment on the inhabitants; but resolve to recommend to the Honourable President and Council to advance to the Sheriff the sum of Rs. 2000 for which the county must be further taxed in the assessment for the ensuing year when the amount will be repaid to the Honourable Company.\n\nOn this the Board record: The President and Mr. Carnac, with the assistance of the engineer, will endeavour to fix upon a proper spot for erecting a jail. They will also examine into the state of the present jail which must be put into repair so as sufficiently to defend the prisoners from the weather.\n\nAt a Consultation, the 4th August 1779, the President acquaints the Board that himself and Mr. Carnac attended by the engineer, have visited the present jail. They are of opinion that at a small expense it may be rendered sufficiently commodious, and separate places of confinement be made for the felons and the debtors by appropriating for the accommodation of the prisoners the upper part which is at present employed as a sail loft. Ordered that the engineer be directed to deliver in an estimate of the expense which will attend these alterations.\n\nAt a Consultation two months later (13th October 1779) the Board read the following letter from the Principal Engineer to the President, dated 31st August 1779: In obedience to the commands of your Honourable Board I have the honour to enclose an estimate for repairing and altering the present town jail. Owing to the very great decay of that building, and the fitting of the upper apartment for debtors, as there is no part of it which will do but the walls and roof, the charges will amount to Rs. 14,073.\n\nA second letter from the Principal Engineer was also read: In obedience to the commands of your Honourable Board I have calculated the expense of building a jail on the spot at present intended to be filled between the new work and the old Bandar Battery, a plan of which now accompanies. Although this would be a convenient spot for the jail itself, yet I am of opinion it is rather too near the Castle for so massy a building. In case of an assault it would prevent the cannon of the Castle playing on the Pen and ground adjacent within the works. This ought to be guarded against. I have further to remark that the filling up has not been included in my former estimate for completing the works, as not thinking it necessary for the immediate defence of the place until more material works could be finished,\n\n---\n\n1 Pub.

Diary 76 of 1779, 595.\nWhen all the works are completed it will then be very proper to have that space filled as it will add greatly to the strength of those works and make an assault more impracticable.\\(^1\\)\n\nOn these two letters the Board resolve not to erect the jail on the spot they at first thought of, but to make the additions to the old one mentioned in their proceedings of the 4th August last, which they direct must be carried into execution with all possible expedition.\\(^2\\)\n\nOn the 24th April 1781, Rear Admiral Sir Edward Hughes writes to Government: The extent of the marine yard, as it is at this time, is much too small to give room for the necessary quantities of timber and workmen. I earnestly recommend to you that you will extend the yard so as to comprehend the two Surgeons' houses and the hospital on that side. Also that the prisoners be moved from the house now made a prison, and the whole of the house be opened, as was the case formerly, for the purpose of fitting rigging and containing the stores of the ships in dock. The present very crowded state of the yard evidently retards the progress of the workmen and prevents its being kept in that clean condition so necessary to the health of such as labour in it, and the jail, making as it were a part of the yard, is greatly inconvenient and a nuisance.\\(^3\\) Referring to the portion of the Rear Admiral's letter which concerns the removal of the jail a Consultation, the 13th June 1781, records: The Collector must be directed to pitch upon some proper spot within the town wall for a jail at the smallest expense for removal of houses and the least inconvenience to the inhabitants.\\(^4\\)\n\nThis proposal was not carried out. The jail continued in its old quarters in the Marine Yard.\n\nIn a letter to the Mayor's Court, dated Bombay 27th December 1786, Mr. William Arden, Sheriff to the Mayor's Court, writes: The county prison having been frequently represented as an improper place both for debtors and felons from the communication it has with the marine yard and docks and because it has frequently been without the necessary repairs: And, as I find from a minute inspection, that it is at present in an untenable state, I therefore think it a duty incumbent upon me in justice to myself now to protest against it as I do also from being anyways responsible for the accidents that may arise in consequence thereof.\n\nOn the same day, 27th December 1786, the Mayor's Court forwarded the above letter to Government, who at their Consultation of the 4th January 1787 observe: We have to remark on this application that whenever any repairs have been required to the town jail they have always been executed and in respect to its situation it is out of our power at present to allow a more secure place.\\(^5\\)\n\nThe Board at a Consultation of the 15th January 1788 read the following letter from the Sheriff addressed to the Mayor's Court which\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Pub.

Diary 90 of 1787, 24-25.\nwas submitted to the Honourable Board by the Register, dated 23rd December 1787: Though several of my predecessors in office have represented to this Honourable Court the insecure state of the county jail, yet I find upon making every possible enquiry that it is at present in a much worse state than it ever was before and totally inadequate to the purposes it is intended for, being not only insecure but a great deal too small and wanting the conveniences necessary to a place of this kind where so many people are confined and whose health must suffer from not having a courtyard of considerable extent where they could walk and take exercise, a thing so much attended to in England. The place appropriated for debtors in the gaol is so much out of repair and so very unsafe that I think it my duty and in justice to myself to protest against it in the strongest manner as I cannot be answerable for any accidents arising therefrom. It is by much too small for the number of debtors who are confined in it and who daily increase in numbers to so great a degree that I have to request this Honourable Court will take the same into consideration and adopt such measure as in their judgment may seem proper for enlarging the county gaol and lodging the debtors with security. On this the Board remark: We are sensible of the truth of what the Sheriff has represented, but from the present state of our finances we are under the necessity of postponing the consideration of it for the present.\n\nTwelve years later, 1799, a plot of ground was purchased for erecting a new jail at Umarkh\u00e1di. On the 1st September 1799, Government write to the Court, paragraph 2: The enclosure No. 1 will advise your Honourable Court of the absolute necessity of causing a new jail to be built at this Presidency and of the principal reasons which led to our acquiescence in the purchase of a plot of ground and house for the purpose called Omercurry (Umarkh\u00e1di). This site seems to be recommended not only by the advantage of situation, but also in point of economy as from the statements laid before us by the Civil Architect, it is urged as the least expensive plan we could adopt for effecting the required construction.\n\nThree months later, 14th December 1799, Government further write to the Court, paragraph 4: We have the honour to lay before you copies of the deeds of conveyance of the Omercurry estate purchased for the purpose particularly specified in the second paragraph of our address of the 1st September in this (Public) department, together with a plan and estimate of the expense of erecting a county jail there and lunatic hospital inclusive of our final arrangement with the civil architect for the construction of this building which, we trust, will meet with the approbation of your Honourable Court.\n\nIn their reply on the 28th August 1800, paragraph 139, the Court of Directors write: We have perused the enclosure No. 1 referred to in paragraph 2, dated 1st September 1799, in consequence of the presentment of the grand jury on the defective state of the jail at your Presidency, and approve of your determination for purchasing\n\n---\n\n1 Pub.

A plan and estimate of this new building we observe have been ordered to be prepared, but they have not yet been transmitted to us. We trust, however, that in the execution of the work every proper attention will be had to economy consistently with the convenience and desirability of the building.\n\nOn the 18th March 1801 they further write, paragraph 7: In the 139th paragraph of our letter in the Public Department, dated the 28th August last, we signified our approbation of your determination for purchasing the ground and house called Omerecurry for the purpose of erecting a new jail upon the site. Having perused the papers to which you have referred us we have now to express our further approbation of your having agreed to the construction of the intended building upon the terms proposed by the civil architect, trusting that under the check and inspection of the Chief Engineer the work will be properly executed and with a due attention to economy.\n\nBefore receipt of the above letter from the Court, Government wrote on the 25th March 1801, paragraph 82: The plan and estimate of the new jail accompanied our address to your Honourable Court, paragraph 4, in the Public Department of the 14th December 1799, to which we now subjoin a report by the civil architect since called for, exhibiting the progress which has been made in executing the work and the probable time of its being completed.\n\nAbout the close of the same year, 22nd December 1801, paragraph 20, Government further write to the Court: Our want of funds has hitherto prevented our making adequate progress with the New Jail. The work was apparently completed in 1804. In front of the west entrance to the Umarkh\u00e1di jail is (1892) a paved platform about 27 feet long by 13 feet wide, where prisoners sentenced to death are hanged. The top of this platform is about six feet above the public road. It is reached from the north by a flight of nine and from the south by a flight of ten steps. The west end of the steps and platform is guarded by a three feet high masonry parapet. In the outer face of this parapet a sandstone slab (2' 8\" x 1' 6\") is inserted carved with these words:\n\nTHIS GAOL WAS BUILT DURING THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE HONOURABLE JONATHAN DUNCAN ESQUIRE 1804.\n\nAt a Consultation, the 22nd March 1800, the Board read a letter, dated the 25th October 1799, from the Recorder Sir William Syer, Bart., recommending the appointment of a professional gentleman to settle the indictments and the prosecutions in the criminal court and to\n\n---\n\n1 Pub.

The Board resolve that Mr. Cleaver be appointed to these offices.\n\nIn 1801 the Coroner's pay was increased to Rs. 200. On the 14th August 1801, paragraph 48, Government write to the Court of Directors: In pursuance of a recommendation from the Court of Recorder, of which we have to request your Honourable Court's perusal, and of the accompanying representation by the Coroner, we have agreed to fix this officer's salary at Rs. 200 a month with arrears from the institution of the new Court at this Presidency. This amount appears to us to be no more than adequate to the duties now performed by the Coroner. At the same time, under the impression arising from the strict injunction conveyed in the 10th paragraph of your Honourable Court's letter to us in (Public) department, of the 18th March last, this measure is accompanied with a resolution providing for the Coroner's refunding whatever part of this additional allowance may be disapproved of. This rule, as suggested in the Governor's minute on the general establishments, we shall not fail to observe in all like instances which shall also certainly prove as rare as possible consistent with the means of carrying on the public service. In reply on the 4th February 1803, paragraph 23, the Court write: We approve of your determination on the subject of the Coroner's salary.\n\nRegarding the police of Bombay on the 20th December 1769, Government write to the Court of Directors: On the 26th August 1769 in consequence of a letter from a Bench of His Majesty's Justices, we established sundry regulations for the better conducting the police of the place in general, particularly in respect to the markets for provisions of every kind.\n\nReferring to the above on the 25th April 1771 the Court write: The regulations established for better conducting the police of the island, in consequence of the recommendation from the quarter sessions, meet with our approbation.\n\nThe following extracts relate to the police arrangements between 1771 and 1780: At a Consultation the 13th August 1771 the Board read the following letter from Brigadier-General David Wedderburn to the President and Governor, dated Bombay 12th August 1771: The Bhandaris of the district of Bombay have been formed into a battalion consisting of 48 officers and 400 privates. Of these 41 officers and 286 privates actually appeared last Tuesday the 6th August, 93 privates were sick, and 21 were out of Bombay. It appears to me that, with very little training, the Bhandaris may be made a very excellent militia and may prove very useful for the police of the neighbourhood of this town. From the number of Bhandaris at present fit for duty, it will be no hardship upon them to furnish every night a guard of 100 men and 12 officers for the protection of\n\n---\n\n1 Pub.

Constant patrols are to go from these several posts from dark till gun-firing in the morning, and to communicate with each other. By this means the whole space between Dongri and Back Bay will be visited frequently during the night. A proclamation should be issued strictly enjoining all Europeans who live in Sonapur or Dongri to apply for passes according to the different classes they may range under: All persons belonging to the marine, from the superintendent; all persons belonging to the military, from the commanding officer; all other Europeans not employed in the Company's service but living here by permission of Government, from the Secretary; and all artificers who may be employed in any of the offices, from the head of their office. The order that all persons should register their slaves should be renewed and enforced under a penalty. That the patrols may not be (deceived) all the passes should have a stamp, as the Company's seal or such like, provided by the Secretary and distributed to the persons who are empowered to sign them; and the passes should be given with(out any?) fee or reward. The vereadores of Bombay should be directed to appoint a number not less than 20 of the most trusty and reputable Portuguese fazandars to attend one or two each night at the several posts. The patrols should be directed to keep the peace, to seize all persons they may find in riots till they can be examined, to pursue and endeavour to apprehend all robbers and housebreakers they may get intelligence of, to seize all Europeans they may find without passes, and all coffrees they may find in a greater number than two together or armed with swords knives sticks or bludgeons. The superior officer, and the Portuguese of each post, should report all that has happened during the night, and bring all the persons that may have been apprehended by the patrols, to a magistrate for examination. This magistrate should not be changed. The patrols should apprehend all coffrees or other runaway slaves they may get intelligence of. The prisoners should be put to work on the fortifications for a year at Rs. 3 a month, or be sent on board the cruisers for the same term, and notice given of their age, size, country, and description, that their masters may have an opportunity of claiming them. If they be not claimed at the end of one year they should be sent as opportunities may offer to Bencoolen in Sumatra. In order to encourage the Bhandaris to a proper discharge of their duty and in some measure to pay them for their service, it may be ordered that for every coffee or other runaway slave they may apprehend who shall be put upon the works or on board a cruizer, they shall be allowed the sum of Rs. 10 to be paid by the Company; for every slave who shall have absented himself from his service for three days, Re. 1; for every slave who shall have absented himself one month, Rs. 2, and in proportion. The inhabitants should be directed, when a slave runs away, to send notice to the grand chauki. For every soldier or sailor (belonging to the marine) having no pass, who shall be found drunk in the woods after eight at night, half a rupee; for every sailor who shall have absented himself from his cruizer or for every soldier who shall have absented himself from the garrison for 48 hours, Re. 1. These sums\nshould be immediately paid by the superintendent or commanding officer and charged to the sailor's pay. The money so collected shall be equally distributed among the Bhand\u00e1ris doing duty once a month or oftener, and an account of the money received and distributed, signed by the magistrate, should be laid before the Governor and Council. The Honourable Company's share in all fines, where the offenders shall have been apprehended by their means, should be given to the Bhand\u00e1ris. The Bhand\u00e1ris for guard should assemble opposite to the Church Gate every evening at five o'clock; and when the weather will permit, they should be taught the firing motions and the platoon exercise, and to fire balls at a mark; for which purpose some good hav\u00e1ld\u00e1rs should attend to instruct them; and the adjutant of the day or some other European officer should constantly attend.\n\nOn this letter the Board record: We are unanimously of opinion that the regulations proposed by the Brigadier-General will be of public benefit and in a great measure it is hoped will prevent the many robberies and even murders which are committed in the adjacent woods. Resolved therefore that these regulations be carried into execution. The Secretary is to issue a proclamation to that effect enjoining a strict observance of them.\n\nFive years later, 13th August 1776, occurs the following entry on the subject of patrols: Notwithstanding the Bhand\u00e1ri patrols the complaints of robberies committed without the town gates continue frequent. Parties of regular sepoys must be added to the Bhand\u00e1ri patrols with the same instructions as were established for the Bhand\u00e1ris in the year 1771.\n\nAt a Consultation, the 3rd February 1779, the Board read the following presentment from the Grand Jury: The Jurors for our Sovereign Lord the King on their oath do testify that it is with concern they find themselves again obliged to present to this Honourable Bench the absolute necessity there is for a thorough reform in the police of this county. The frequent robberies committed, with the difficulty attending the detection of the aggressors, calls aloud for some establishment with such authority as will effectually protect the innocent inhabitants and bring the guilty to trial. They therefore humbly propose to this Honourable Bench that application may be made to Government to establish such an officer as may with ample authority effectually answer the heads proposed. On this the Board ordered that, instead of the Bhand\u00e1ri militia, patrols of regular sepoys be sent into the woods every night for the security of the inhabitants. They add: We hope this will in some measure remedy the evils complained of. We imagine the battalion of sepoy marines will be able to furnish these patrols, which must also be accompanied by a peace officer who must every morning report to the acting magistrate.\n\n---\n\n1 Pub.

In respect to framing proper regulations for my guidance in this office, I submit the accompanying rough draft of what I humbly conceive will be the necessary commission to be given me and the oath to be taken by me. After being sworn in and public notices given, I propose to sit regularly for the despatch of public business relative to my office and make daily reports to the sitting justice in order for his warranting such necessary acts as may be incident thereto. It must be a work of time and attention before any exact code of regulations can be drawn up to be finally established, and will require my inspecting and referring to all such as have been heretofore made before I can lay them properly before the Board. As soon as I am sworn into office I will exert myself to the utmost to accomplish it. In respect to any fixed salary I humbly request I may be permitted to waive it at present; and as the post is established on trial, wait the event when I very cheerfully submit what matter may personally regard myself to your Honourable Board's future consideration. Oaths to be taken by the Lieutenant of Police: (1) I James Tod do sincerely promise and swear that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to His Majesty King George. So help me God. (Signed) James Tod. (2) I James Tod do swear I will well and truly serve the King's Majesty and the Honourable the United Company of merchants of England trading to the East Indies in the office of Lieutenant of the Police and promote the peace and safety of the inhabitants of His Majesty's Castle and Island of Bombay in all things that belong to the said office as far as I legally can or may. I will do right as well to poor as rich in all things belonging to my office. I will do no wrong to any man for any gift reward or promise nor for favour or hatred. I will truly and diligently do my endeavours for preventing murders, robberies, disorders, and all irregularities, and for maintaining and carrying into execution such orders and regulations as are or may be established for the peace safety and good of the inhabitants and for His Majesty's and the Honourable Company's advantage discharging my whole duty to the utmost of my skill and power. So help me God. (Signed) James Tod. Sworn to before me the 8th March 1779. (Signed) William Hornby. The draft commission runs: We the President and Council of and for all forces and affairs of the Honourable United Company of merchants of England trading to the East Indies on the Coasts of India Persia and Arabia and of His Majesty's Castle and Island of Bombay, to all whom these presents shall come greeting: By virtue of a power given us by the Honourable the Court of Directors\nof the said United Company, derived unto them from the authority of our sovereign Lord King George III. and His Royal Predecessors, reposing special trust and confidence in your integrity, abilities, fidelity, and circumspection, do by these presents constitute and appoint you James Tod Esquire Lieutenant of Police for the peace and safety of the inhabitants of this island in the carrying into execution such orders plan or regulations as may at present subsist or hereafter be found necessary to be established or provided by Government for preventing murders, robberies, disorders, and other irregularities in breach of peace and good order. We further give you full power and authority to pursue all legal measures for that purpose and to issue necessary summonses and orders for the due establishment thereof, willing and requiring all persons whatever to appear before you on such summons being served them, and all subordinate officers of the police aforesaid to pay you due obedience, you following all such orders as shall be given from us or our successors and from His Majesty's justices of the peace for this Castle and Island of Bombay aforesaid, pursuant to the trust reposed in you. Failing therein these presents are to be vacated and annulled by us the President and Council for the time being. Sealed with the seal of the aforesaid Company and given under our hands in Bombay Castle this third day of March in the year of the reign of His Excellent Majesty George III. of Great Britain France and Ireland, King, Defender of the Faith, and in the year of our Lord 1779. By order of the Honourable William Hornby Esquire, President of and for all affairs of the Honourable United Company of merchants of England trading to the East Indies on the Coasts of India Persia and Arabia, and Governor and Commander-in-Chief of His Majesty's Castle and Island of Bombay and its dependencies and Council. On this the Board direct: The above commission and forms of the oath for the Lieutenant of Police being read, are approved. Public notice must be given to the inhabitants of the appointment of this officer and of his power to which they must be enjoined to conform. The Secretary must furnish Mr. Tod with all available regulations for the better discharge of his duty.\n\nThis appointment of Lieutenant of Police found no favour with the Honourable Company. A letter from the Court of Directors dated the 5th July 1780 runs: Determined as we are to resist every attempt that may be made to create new offices at the expense of the Company, we cannot but be highly displeased with your having appointed an officer in quality of Lieutenant of Police with a salary of Rs. 4 a day. Whatever sum may have been paid in consequence must be refunded. If such an officer be of that utility to the public as you have represented, the public by some tax or otherwise should defray the charges thereof.\n\nMeanwhile the following report was submitted by the new Lieutenant of Police, dated the 31st December 1779:\n\n---\n\n1 Bom.

These having been approved by his Majesty's Justices, are now submitted to your Honour's consideration for confirmation, they appearing to be of great utility for preserving good order and government on this island. I have proceeded herein as far as I have been hitherto able to accomplish and shall continue with the utmost diligence to the extent of my power to prepare others which are immediately necessary: as the prices of provisions, the assize of bread, and other matters relative to the markets, also labourers and tradesmen, carts' and conveyances' hire, and prices. All of this shall be submitted to you as soon as possible. If your Honourable Board approve thereof, I mean to publish those already finished on or before the 1st day of February, giving the inhabitants thirty days' notice to conform thereto.\n\nA Consultation the 26th January 1780 records: The regulations laid before us last Council day by the Lieutenant of Police, having since been sent round to the several members for their inspection, are now approved and confirmed; and a publication must be issued enjoining strict attention thereto.\n\nMeanwhile the Board had received the following letter from Mr. James Tod, Lieutenant of Police, to the President and Council, dated Bombay 17th January 1780: Agreeable to order I exhibit my account of the sums advanced by me and expended in the duties of my offices as lieutenant of the police and high constable. Thereto I have added a list of fines levied by order of the Justices and paid to the Sheriff as treasurer of the county. On the sixth day of May last in consequence of information received that constables had been already sworn in to the number of twenty-four for the villages without the gates, who receiving no pay had in concert with the Bhandaris who then did the duty of the patrols, been guilty of great oppressions in ill treating the inhabitants and exacting undue fees, which was an unpardonable abuse of their offices, considering those employed therein ought to be respectable intelligent men, and not such as served the office at that time; I therefore, as is customary on such occasions, issued out a summons to twenty-four of the fazandars to take upon themselves the office, or to serve it by deputy; and at a meeting at my office, it was considered and explained to them, and agreed to provide proper persons to serve who were to be paid accordingly. If the Government should not approve of paying their wages, I humbly entreat they should be paid by a general assessment on the inhabitants, who are heads of families without the gates, and not by the Christains alone as other classes equally receive the benefit of the appointment; and to make good the pay of the constables then chosen. This not being settled so soon as I wished, I found it\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 77 of 1780, 8 - 9.\n2 Bom. Gov. Consultation 26th Jan. 1780, Pub. Diary 77 of 1780, 22.\nnecessary to advance them three months' pay that they might have no excuse for misbehaviour; and having in the course of their duty been able to judge of their merits, with the approbation of the acting magistrate, I chose such as I judged competent, and who could read and write, and some new ones; and paid their whole arrears, to the first day of January instant beginning the new year, by striking off six and presenting eighteen to the acting magistrate. These being all intelligent men and of good character, I judge sufficient for the duty required. Humbly concurring with the request of the fazandars in respect to an equal and reasonable assessment, should you please to order the amount to be so levied, with all due respect I submit it to your consideration.\n\nAt a Consultation, the 26th January 1780, on reading the above letter the Board direct that the balance of the accounts of expenses incurred on account of the office of police, be paid to the lieutenant of police from the treasury. The assessment already levied being complained of as heavy, and as we conclude it is not levied with equality according to the circumstances of the inhabitants, the President will give orders to the heads of each caste to give in an account of their number, circumstances, and the proportion of assessment levied on each person.\n\nAt a Consultation, the 22nd March 1780, the Board read the following letter from Mr. James Tod Lieutenant of Police, to the President and Council, dated Bombay 8th March 1780: Since I had the honour of addressing you under date the 30th of November last, I have received a copy of the Rule Ordinance and Regulation for the better management of the police at Calcutta. I have adopted the same for the management of the police of Bombay both of which I now lay before you, and submit them together with my said letter to your Honourable Board's consideration. Mr. Tod's observations are: That though the copy brought from Calcutta is very incorrect it clearly points out the duty of the Superintendent of Police, his powers, and the manner of establishing him in his office, by the appointment of the Honourable the President and Council and a Rule of Court conformable to the powers vested in them by charter, to be passed on the ensuing sessions of Oyer and Terminer. That following the plan of Calcutta in the Rule exhibited for Bombay, the same is almost word for word; but it being an island, from the peculiarity of its situation the Lieutenant of the Police humbly conceives the same be abridged, and having since his delivery of the Rule, more maturely weighed it, he most respectfully submits it as follows: That the reasons set forth in the preamble are undoubtedly sufficient for establishing a superintendent of police, and the other matters respecting him and his deputy (if any be appointed) and his powers are very necessary to be confirmed by a rule of a Court of Record in the manner it has been at Calcutta and approved by the Honourable the Court of Directors. That these powers are particularly contained in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th Articles, the last requiring a proviso that the committees or heads of castes are not to be\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 77 of 1780, 28-30.\n2 Bom. Gov. Consultation 26th Jan. 1780, Pub. Diary 77 of 1780, 22.\n3 Pub. Diary 77 of 1780, 101.\nremoved finally but by order of the Honourable the President and Council or of two of His Majesty's Justices one of whom is to be the Honourable the President. That the 7th article comprehends the present established Regulations in Bombay which, as they must be ever open to revision or addition, the Superintendent will of course agreeable to his powers be enabled to enforce. And, as the determinations necessary thereon will depend on circumstances, much prolixity in the Calcutta Rule may be avoided in that of Bombay, as by the form of a rule of Court, the spirit of the charter is maintained, and the Honourable the President and Council by form of law are confirmed in their power for making By-laws agreeable thereto. That the 8th article is a necessary one and also the 9th, with a proviso, as above noticed, that no penalties are to be inflicted on the committees or heads of castes but with the approbation of the Honourable the President and Council or two of His Majesty's Justices. That the 10th 11th and 12th articles are necessary. That the 13th article may be left out, being sufficiently provided for in the 7th article of this Rule. That the 14th 15th and 16th articles respecting the punishments are very necessary. That the 17th article is provided in the 7th. That the 18th article is necessary so far as respects the noticing of this Rule to the committees, and also the established Regulations; the remainder is provided in the 7th article as circumstances may point out. This observation extends to the 19th and 20th articles. That it is unnecessary to enter more of the 21st 22nd and 23rd articles of this Rule than what relates to summonses and enquiries of a breach of the By-laws or contempt of orders. That the 24th article respecting the appropriation of fines is necessary. It is further necessary this Rule be passed by the Honourable Board, and confirmed by a Rule of Court in the same manner and form as at Calcutta at the ensuing sessions of Oyer and Terminer to be held on the 15th day of April next.\n\nAt the same Consultation (the 22nd March 1780) the Board also read the following letter from Mr. James Tod, Lieutenant of Police, to the President and Council, dated Bombay 30th November 1779:\n\nWhen your Honour's and the Council's opinion that an officer to superintend the police would be of great utility to the public was first communicated to me, and that you had been pleased to appoint me to that office, I was determined, notwithstanding the obstacles I plainly foresaw were in my way and the difficulties I should meet in the execution of it, to show my grateful sense of the confidence the Board had been pleased to place in me, by accepting of it, depending entirely on the support you promised, and on the candour of the public in general; and resolving to exert my utmost abilities to make the office answer the ends proposed, for the Honourable Company's interests and the advantage quiet and happiness of the inhabitants. With these views I drew up a most solemn oath, which was administered to me, and I determined to abide by it, also a commission (I then thought) suitable to the occasion; and which your Honourable Board were pleased to approve of and deliver to me. I soon experienced the diffi-\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 77 of 1780, 120-122.\nculties of my post, as I had foreseen. My county honourably acquitted me of two indictments for felony, deeming the prosecutions against me malicious, and your Honourable Board were pleased on the occasion to enter on record the utility of my post, and your full approbation of my conduct therein. Encouraged by so honourable an acquittal, I persevered with constancy in the discharge of the duties of my office, but am nevertheless in continual dread of blame. When I gave in my proposals to your Honourable Board I wish it had occurred to me to insert the title superintendent of police instead of lieutenant of police. I have since found at Calcutta the office is held under the title superintendent. This would consequently have prevented the objections made to the title lieutenant. I never conceived any objection would arise on a word. I considered the public benefit solely and the necessary authority for maintaining the respect due to the post in order to accomplish the desirable ends for which it was instituted. I proposed to myself more honour from a due discharge of my duty as an honest man than any title or parade whatever. The same considerations now induce me to address your Honourable Board on the present occasion. I have, by an unremitting and persevering attention to my duty, made many and bitter enemies, in consequence of which I have been obliged in a great measure to give up my bread, and my only dependence is on your Honourable Board's favour and protection which I firmly rely on. If therefore the commission you have been pleased to honour me with should appear to be in too military a style for my office as a civil one, that every reasonable objection may be removed, if judged expedient, I will cheerfully resign it, humbly submitting it to the consideration of the Board. My case is not singular. Mr. Playdell has held the same office under title of superintendent of police in Calcutta, and this has been approved by the Honourable the Court of Directors.

As to the emoluments of the office I cheerfully submit them to the Board's consideration, to be proportioned to the difference of the places as you shall see fit.\n\nA week later, at a Consultation on the 29th March 1780, the Board taking into consideration this letter, which had lain since the 30th November, and also considering the Rule formed for the management of the police of this town drawn from that formed at Calcutta, record the following entry: These regulations being now attentively perused, several alterations and amendments adapted to the difference of circumstances between this place and Calcutta are now made, and instead of styling him superintendent of police the title to be given him is deputy of police according to which the Rule is altered and some other retrenchments made in his powers. The yearly salary to be annexed to the office of deputy of police is now fixed at Rs. 3000 to commence from the day of his first appointment as lieutenant of police. The Secretary must in consequence call upon Mr. Tod to surrender his commission of lieutenant of police which is now vacated and annulled. Ordered\n\n---\n\n1Pub.

I return my most sincere thanks to your Honourable Board for the salary you have been pleased to bestow upon me and will manifest my gratitude the only way in my power by a steady attention to the duties of my office, in the execution of the trust reposed in me.

At a Consultation held at Bombay on the 6th of February 1670 it was resolved that the two companies of soldiers be reduced into one in regard of the paucity of men, the charge of keeping so many commission officers standing when there is no absolute necessity thereof seeing the militia may be as well governed with a less number, and the serious consideration of the Honourable Company's injunction to all possible frugality.\u00b9\n\nThe next entry on the same day, 6th February 1670, is one of military discipline. Antonio Ribero made a complaint to the Governor of abuse done him by William Havens, William Middleton, William Minchell, and John Staines, in cutting down and breaking his pots wherewith he watered his cocoanut trees. It was concluded (for the preventing further abuse of the like nature) this being the second time they have committed the said wrong that William Havens being a tailor have twelve drubs given him with a rope end at the guard door by the boatswain of the bandar and that the other three being soldiers be tied neck and heels one hour under the wooden horse.\u00b2\n\nThe reduction of the regular garrison drew attention to the militia. On the 28th October 1670 the Surat Council record: It was resolved that the Deputy Governor and Council of Bombay be ordered to muster their militia and to keep them in a posture of defence, and that the number of the said militia be sent us and the guard of Mahim be doubled. To this end, in case there be a necessity, that they do enlist twenty white men more provided they will receive the Company's pay last ordered, 20 shillings the month. So that, according to the list of officers and soldiers last sent us, the standing number of the company is to consist of 260 men. The militia should be ordered to muster once a month at Mahim and Bombay.\u00b3\n\nSix years later, 4th July 1676, the Surat Council impress the need for reductions in the Bombay military charges: We have perused the rolls you sent us of your garrison, Company's militia and staff officers,\n\n\u00b9 Bom., Gov.

Diary 1 of 1660-1696.\nand we have also again taken into consideration the answer to those seven proposals formerly recommended unto you. In the main we find that you have not observed the orders left with you by the President at his departure for retrenching the charges, but that you put the Company to a far greater expense than need requires. We find in your letter to the Company that you have near 400 men, officers included. Now that our nation is in peace with all the world we cannot conceive the necessity of keeping so many men in pay. We are sure the Company will not admit the necessity. Rather they will be much offended with us for our improvident management of their affairs. In our proposals sent you in February last (1676) we advised you that we thought sixteen files was enough for each company, and though some reasons which you give in your answer do convince us that as things stand now with you that number is too little, yet surely we must needs conclude that thirty files for each company are too many. Wherefore for the present we do enorder you that from and after the musters that shall follow the receiving this our letter, you do reduce your two companies to 150 men each company which is the number specified in your answer to our proposals. We say that the said two companies should not exceed 300 men, officers included, and we heartily wish they might consist all of English. Still seeing that cannot be we would have you to supply the rest with topasses. For as to the middle sort consisting of European strangers we are not well satisfied with them and hereafter would not have you entertain any more under that notion. As to those which are at present in pay we would have you disband them keeping only such as have served the Company five years and are married on the island, whom we would have you continue in their present pay and the rest to be discharged except they will serve as topasses. We desire you to send us a list of such men who have served the Honourable Company five years and upwards.\n\nWe shall now give you our opinions touching those reasons you offer to us in answer to our proposal for the keeping so many men in pay. First whereas you say there is a necessity for the keeping 80 or 100 men in pay extraordinary for the manning the Company's vessels and shib\u00e1rs as also merchants' vessels, we answer that we know no such necessity nor shall by any means admit it. As to the Company's vessels, to wit Revenge, Hunter ketch, and others, what men are hereafter employed upon them let their pay be charged to account of those voyages for which they are sent. And when they are employed in cruising out and defending the port against the Malab\u00e1rs, you may well draw off so many men as shall be necessary for that expedition out of the two companies without increase of charges. As to supplying merchants' vessels with our men, we require you forbear any such practice hereafter except the merchants make good the men's pay and provision for the time they do entertain them. And if the merchants do complain and cease from trade, we know no remedy, for it is a thing never practised in any nation or port whatsoever. As to Malab\u00e1rs disturbing your trade you must take care to secure your own ports from them and to send Revenge and Hunter frequently to cruise out after them and to go in convoy with such vessels as shall desire it.\nBut to let out our own men to man the merchants' ships, we can no ways answer it except the merchants' ships bear the whole charge. Secondly whereas you say that Shiv\u00e1ji and the Sidi's men are often unwelcome guests to you, that they are morose and surly ready to act some mischief, we answer that we would not have you possess yourselves with any apprehension or fear from them. For we know they dare not attempt any public breach of peace with us, and though disorders do frequently happen from their unruly soldiers, yet we ever found their officers civil and orderly and ready to punish such disorders in their men. Wherefore that is no argument to put the Company to more charge. But, in such case, whenever any of Shiv\u00e1ji's or Sidi's men are on the island, which is but seldom, your care then must be to keep a stricter watch than ordinary and not to suffer them to wear their arms, but to secure all their arms in the fort; and then you need little fear what mischief they are able to do. Thirdly whereas you allege your fears of the Portuguese, though they bark frequently, yet we know they dare not bite. We little concern ourselves for anything they dare do and wish they would begin to quarrel. Fourthly what you allege as to the building your bastion is a just and sound argument, for till that bastion be finished and the two home works also raised to a convenient height joined by a line to the fort, it cannot be so secure as it should be; and therefore therewith a necessity of keeping 300 men in pay. Indeed this is the only argument which persuades us to maintain so many men. Wherefore we desire you to employ all diligence possible for the finishing the said work especially the bastion and the parapet to the faussebraye, both which are absolutely necessary. We hope that by your care they will be soon reduced to a very defensible posture. Fifthly what you say touching the Portugal soldiers who have land on the island and are apt to sell it, when disbanded, to Moors Banians and others, that is no argument in the least to keep more men in pay than need requires. If they are not contented to stay, let them sell their land and go where they will. We also require you to take care that no Moors be admitted to buy land according as the President formerly hinted, but Christians Hindus and P\u00e1rsis are free; and you need not fear that we shall want men and good soldiers too whenever we shall have occasion of them. Your last argument touching the sickness of your men is too apparent to our great grief. But we trust in God when quarters are built for them in the two home works and an hospital is also built for the sick men, they will by God's blessing be kept in better health. To this end we desire you to take the first opportunity that presents for the raising an hospital and finishing the said two home works that we may the sooner prevent those sicknesses that our people are so much subject unto. There are several other things which we judge are unnecessary charges in your roll of staff officers and militia, which we reserve for another opportunity in regard we are unwilling to detain this cossett (messenger) any longer.\n\n1 Surat to Bombay 4th July 1676, Surat Fact. Out. L. B. 2 of 1675-76, 153 - 156. Forrest's Home Series, I. 96 - 98.\nIn spite of these strong views on retrenchment the Bombay Council succeeded in persuading Surat that some increase in the military was necessary. On the 14th August 1676 the Surat Council write: We are now with yours of the 30th July in answer to ours of the 4th 6th and 11th of the said month. We approve in the main of the reasons you give us for the number and increase of your garrison soldiers by your taking the seamen into your rolls which otherwise would have lain all the winter aside and at a great charge. Also your initiating these sailors into military discipline ashore and introducing a familiarity between them and the soldiers, which is prudently done. As to what supernumeraries you shall engage in case of mortality to keep up your limited number of 300, we answer that we would have you keep your full complement of 300 men besides what fresh soldiers the ships may bring out. And for a supply in case of mortality if you keep two or three files extraordinary we shall admit of it. Also, seeing that mortality reigns mostly during the first two or three months after soldiers' arrival, occasioned chiefly by their immoderate drinking of punch and toddy, we would have you immediately upon their arrival to send us up five or six files of them with a serjeant to defend the Honourable Company's estate. We have much cause to expect great troubles and danger so soon as the rains are over. This transfer will be a means to preserve the new soldiers and to inure them to the climate. And although they may not be disciplined soldiers yet being Englishmen they will serve us here.\n\nRegarding the recruits sent from England the Surat Council write to Bombay on the 21st November 1676: We would have you advise us how the soldiers sent out this year do comport themselves and especially the Germans. Let us know how many English Roman Catholics there are in the service of the Company, their employes, and how they do behave themselves therein.\n\nOn the improved condition of their militia the Bombay Council write to the Court on the 24th January 1677: Our militia is now perfected. We have increased them to a complete body of near 600 men who are all possessors of land on the island. We shall see them well trained and disciplined that they may be serviceable upon the most emergent occasions, and hope time will bring them to so good a martial order that the security and defence of the island may much depend upon their strength. Above 100 owners of land, Br\u0101hmans and Banians being never accustomed to bear arms, are willing to contribute in money which will help towards payment of the militia officers. We are not yet come to an agreement how much they shall pay, but in a month or two more shall conclude upon it. The charge of the officers is as much abbreviated as possible, the whole body having but one captain who has but lieutenant's pay, and the lieutenant ensign's pay, and the ensign serjeant's pay, some of the sergeants\n\n---\n\n1 Surat to Bombay 14th Aug. 1676, Surat Fact.

Nothing can be of greater safeguard to the island. For besides the extraordinary fame of horse in these countries, one horse being esteemed equivalent to 50 foot, they are such an ubiquitous force that in half an hour's time by taking up forty soldiers behind them we can have eighty men in any part of the island completely armed, ready to impede an enemy's landing or to quiet any sudden insurrection. The charge of all this is but very small. The captain alone will receive pay. As for a lieutenant and cornet we shall oblige some of (your) Honours' own servants to officiate in those places. Quartermasters we want none and the three corporals will have but four Xeraphins a month each more than private sentries. Troopers we shall choose out of the garrison soldiers; and though the garrison companies are the weaker, it matters not. Instead of them there shall always be a division of the horse to keep a guard over against the Fort Gate. The most part of the horses shall be of the country breed, which will cost but Rs. 60, 80, or 100 each. They will not need that high feeding of jagri and butter commonly given to all horses in these parts, and whereas it is the custom for every horse to have a horsekeeper, we will endeavour to make one horsekeeper serve two horses; and for grass and hay we will make the island supply us for nothing, as it has hitherto done for the thirty-one horses we now have which were ever a great charge and yet of no defence for want of modelling into a troop and disciplining. We think ourselves very happy in the choice of so expert and discreet a commander as is over them, the President and Council having conferred that employment upon Captain Richard Keigwin.\\(^2\\)\n\nAs regards the health of the soldiers the same letter continues: Our soldiers, thanks be to God, continue very healthful. For whereas last year (1675-76) from October to February there died above 100 men, this year (1676-77) we have not lost fifteen and most of them from imposthumation in the liver. Much of this benefit we must attribute to our new hospital, we having taken the old court of judicature for that use, a hospital being a thing so highly necessary. Soldiers do not die, as some vainly imagine, by any fatality concomitant to the clime, but by their irregularity and want of due attendance when sick. For to persons in a flux strong drink and flesh is mortal, which to make an English soldier leave off is almost as difficult as to make him divest his nature, even though present death be laid down before him as the reward of the ill gratifying his palate. This is the true cause our Bombay bills of mortality have swelled so high, whereas in the hospital nothing can come in or out without passing the Doctor's eyes. We have great\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Bombay to Court 24th Jan. 1677, Sec. Out. L. B. 4 of 1677-1687, 4. Forrest's Home Series, I. 119.\n\n\\(^2\\) Bombay to Court 24th Jan. 1677, Sec. Out. L.

They are not so proper for our fort as they are wanting in length. Herein lies the advantage a fort has over shipping, that ere the ship can approach to batter, the fort is able to sink the ship with her long guns which no ship's deck is able to receive or to endure its reverse or recochet. For the defence of the fort, we suppose it very necessary for your Honours to send out 20 or 25 guns, each 18 to 22 feet long. These would likewise be a terror to all people.\u00b2\n\nIn March 1677 the President at Surat sends commissions for a lieutenant and cornet to the troop of horse at Bombay. The letter dated 12th March runs: Herewith we send you Mr. John Harnigold and Mr. John Petit's commissions for lieutenant and cornet to the troop of horse on the island which we desire you to deliver unto them.\u00b2\n\nIn April 1677 an accidental gunpowder explosion did considerable damage and led to a war-council to punish the offenders. The Bombay letter to Surat of the 10th April runs: We had lately an unfortunate accident befallen us and yet we have reason to bless God for his deliverance of us from a greater mischief. It was thus. The storekeeper as customary had sent up some powder to dry upon the north-east bastion. It was about two o'clock in the afternoon when one of our Corporals by name Stanton took an old bandalier or leather pistol case and filled it with wildfire, intending to tie it to a dog's tail then in the guard. Coming to the gate, the dog being not in the way, he took the bandalier; there being a string tied to it and flung it towards the Judge's old house. The wind being very strong the bandalier blew upon the bastion and fired the drying powder 35 barrels all English. Eight coolies and one sentry who were tending the powder were all burnt to death, whereof six were blown into the ditch and the parade, and some limbs were carried over the fort. The shock was so great, much of the powder being in a heap, that it blew open all the doors of the magazines in the fort though well locked. Nay the shock blew open the doors of the rooms under the Second's lodgings and made most part of the town shake. It sunk the terrace of the bastion a small matter, but has done the arch underneath no damage. We had this day a Council of War upon the Corporal. Having examined all witnesses and circumstances, including several that saw him make the fuse and fling it, we could not find him guilty of any wilful treacherous design. Still that an officer into whose hands our lives are all sometimes entrusted should be so wretchedly careless he being but a little before come off the bastion himself, we cashiered him from ever more bearing arms, and to run the gauntlet three times for an example to all.\u2074\n\n\u00b9 Bombay to Court 24th Jan. 1677, Sec.

We have given them no answer.\n\nThe same letter further notices: Our soldiers do humbly beg your Honour to take into consideration the loss they receive in the money that is paid them. This loss on bujeruks\u00b2 is near 30 per cent and on duganis\u00b3 16 or 18 per cent. Also provisions are growing so dear upon the island that they are not able to subsist. We have not in the least encouraged them to expect any favour. Your Honour may please to resolve what is fitting to be done.\n\nIn reply regarding the piec payment to soldiers the Surat President writes to Bombay on the 26th April 1677: We are not well pleased with the soldiers' request to consider of the great loss they receive by having their wages paid them in bujeruks and duganis. We have given no orders for altering the value of the said species and presume you have not raised them but that they pass still current for what they did upon the island. As to their passing abroad we are not to concern ourselves; and if there be any abuse in the shroffs by their raising the vatav or exchange you must punish them. But we had information by the late Deputy Governor that the chief officers do much abuse the soldiers in keeping all the silver and gold to themselves of which they make an advantage to the soldiers' prejudice. We suspect this petition and design to be fomented by them which we would have strictly enquired into; and inform us the truth of what you find. It is a thing of bad consequence to alter the settled pay of the soldiers who are a quarrelous (querulous) ungrateful people and never satisfied. We are sure there is no garrison in Asia or in Europe better paid than that of Bombay and yet they are always craving. If provisions are dear, you must use all just means to procure them plenty and cheap as you can, but for altering their pay or the vatav of the current coin, we do not approve it.\n\nIn the same year 1677 the Bombay Council once more write on the same subject\u2014the discontent of the soldiers due to short pay. Their letter to Surat of the 21st October runs: We did formerly prefer a petition of all the soldiers concerning the shortness of the pay, to which we received an answer that no alteration could be made in it. We shall not presume to dive into the causes of such a denial, but we find ourselves obliged to give your Worships a daily account of the state of affairs on\n\n\u00b9 Bombay to Surat 10th April 1677, Sec.

We have hitherto experienced too much fidelity from them to think they will be tempted to act anything contrary to your duties. Yet we must needs say, should any evil consequence happen, that this will be the real occasion thereof.\n\nTowards the close of the year 1677 on the same subject of the soldiers' pay, the Bombay Council again write to Surat on the 12th December: The clause of the President's letter of the 26th April concerning the soldiers' pay we did then thoroughly peruse, but it being an absolute order to us we would not presume farther to discuss upon it. Our opinions have been often plainly declared that the soldiers are cut of the pay a considerable matter. It was ordered by the President when here that 19 phadi\u00e1s (phad\u00ed\u00e1s) should pass for a Xeraphin. We can indeed order that a penny shall pass for twopence but it is not all the proclamations and commands we can issue out shall be of force to effect it. It is certain the kings and potentates of Europe do put what value they please on their coins which pass current in their own territories, but while Bombay is but eight miles long we do not see any possibility of following their rules. Here is nothing growing on the island but cocoanut, and all things we want from abroad; and though the President is pleased to say that we ought not to be concerned however money passes abroad, yet how shall we get provisions and goods on the island except our money goes off to fetch them; and what is intended by that clause that we should use all just means to procure them plenty and cheap when the very fountain head is stopped, that is money prohibited to be carried off. The shroffs are marked out as the cause of this distemper; but we do not see on what ground; for they do not raise the vat\u00e1v as is objected, but rather lower it, for the Xeraphin instead of 19 phadi\u00e1s is worth 29. Suppose the King of England should issue out a proclamation that four farthings should go for a penny; if any person should give another eight farthings for his penny, we cannot imagine this is punishable, and this is just our case; and to order the shroff to give people silver for the bujeruks, is a disowning our coin; for if bujeruks are current, what occasion is there for shroffs to exchange them into silver, and if they are not current, there is reason of a complaint, people receiving but 19 phadi\u00e1s instead of 29. Our dug\u00e1n\u00eds indeed go current off the island, that is at 23 phadi\u00e1s per cent or thereabouts and not at 19 as we pay them on which is 20 per cent loss; neither do we argue the necessity of allowing the soldiers the utmost value of the bazar, which rises and falls every day. We believe two phadi\u00e1s in a Xeraphin's advance would highly content them and so low as that it never falls. This is only our opinion with a submission to your Worships' letter.\n\n---\n\n1 Bombay to Surat 21st Oct. 1677, Sec. Out. L. B. 4 of 1677-1687, 57.

Forrest's Home Series, I. 141.\nOn the subject of military retrenchments the Court of Directors write to Surat on the 22nd April (1681 or 1682): By the recruits of English soldiers we sent you in our last ship for Bombay or by anything wrote in our last general letter (except only Captain Keigwin's wages and entertainment), you are to understand that we do not break in upon our former retrenchment. We are resolved that the establishment for that island shall not be enlarged but rather lessened. In order to this let our Deputy Governor of Bombay know we shall not think well of him if we do not hear that he hath discharged the like number of Portuguese soldiers in lieu of so many Englishmen as shall arrive in safety at Bombay.\n\nIn spite of this opinion during the next year the strength of the garrison was increased. On the 15th August 1683 the Court wrote to Bombay: We have now a complete company of foot soldiers on board the ship Charles II. Sir Thomas Grantham Commander: This company of soldiers which is under the command of Lieut. Oglethorpe, after they have been at Bantam, are to return to your place and to be made up a third company, whereof the Second of our Council at Bombay shall always be Captain. And we shall by our first ships send you forty soldiers to recruit that and our other two companies by which you will see our intent is that our standing garrison at Bombay shall always consist of three complete English companies.\n\nAs regards the position which Sir Thomas Grantham was to occupy at Bombay, the Court wrote to Surat on the 7th April 1684: We do appoint Sir Thomas Grantham during his ship's being in Bombay road to be of our Council there, and to take place after our Deputy Governor while he is of that Council.\n\nThe addition of a third company and the building of a bastion and like measures taken to ensure the protection of the inhabitants led to the imposition of a tax on the people. In its justification the Court wrote to Surat on the 7th April 1684: The island of Bombay hath stood us first and last above \u00a3300,000 and now we are entering upon a further charge by the order we have and hereby give you to build up that bastion which is wanting, and by the addition of a third standing company and two standing companies of Rashpouts (Rajputs). So that any man endued with reason must needs see the necessity and equity of our making such levies upon the inhabitants as may at least serve to support the growing charge of their protection.\n\nThe same letter continues: Those two companies of Rashpouts (Rajputs) we would have you hire from the main upon the best terms you can, to be paid weekly part in rice and part in money as you can agree.

But both our President as Captain General and our Deputy Governor of Bombay as Lieutenant General are to act by consultation and advice of our respective Councils of Surat when the General is there or of Bombay when he is upon that island. The Captain of our third company of English for the time being we always appoint to be our Major General. The two standing companies of Rajputs we would have always to consist of 100 men each and kept constantly to watch and mount the guards daily as the English soldiers do; and in such station and proportion as you shall think best for our service and as may best prevent any jarrings between them and our English soldiers among whom you may now always enforce good order by a strict military discipline, His Majesty having granted us by a new Charter the power of exercising martial law.\n\nBy the middle of 1686 the number of soldiers was reduced to lessen the charges. About this time there was considerable sickness among the garrison, and medicines were badly wanted. The Bombay letter to Surat of the 28th July 1686 runs: After muster-day we shall give account to your Excellency about reducing the soldiery pursuant to the directions. We have received no medicines for the use of the garrison by this shipping and are much in want thereof, occasioned by the great number of sick people we have continually had and are likely to have. If we have not a sudden supply of what is expressed in the doctor's list, it may endanger the lives of many, there being few or no drugs to be bought here and there being some drugs mentioned in the said attestation which may be useful for the hospital. We desire your orders about them.\n\nIn the same year 1686 one Robert Clarke belonging to the military committed a murder. Dr. St. John the Judge was in favour of trying the offender by the Court of Judicature, while the Deputy Governor Mr. John Wyborne and Council were in favour of the exercise of martial law. The Bombay letter to Surat of the 27th September 1686 runs: As to the trying of Robert Clarke by the Court of Judicature the Judge's advice or opinion is of little value. The laws of war say quite another thing. So that if your Excellency please to adhere to Dr. St. John's advice as to governing of an island or garrison, the Deputy Governor should never expect anything but confusion; for he dare swear if we do not punish soldiers by martial law, no officer nor inhabitant can be safe in their lives or estates. We well know the common law will clear Clarke for murder and so it will any man for theft, great part of the jurymen not knowing how soon it may be their turn to be brought to the bar on the same score.

We now write to that purpose, but will submit to your directions, and Clarke shall be tried accordingly that he may live and murder some other poor man.\n\nThe following Bombay letter to Surat, of the 28th September 1686, shows in how wretched a state the soldiers sent from England sometimes arrived: This comes per hands of the Rt. Worsh. Charles Zinzan who comes up in His Majesty's ship *Phoenix*, and accompanies the enclosed bill of lading for 30 chests of treasure which the Rt. Honourable Company sent out in the ship *Worcester*. As her Captain and most of her men are very sick and as the ship is in a very distracted condition, we have thought it much more safe and for the Rt. Honourable our Masters' service to send the said treasure to you in His Majesty's ship than to let it remain on board of the *Worcester*, not knowing when she will be able to sail. Even were her Captain well, many of her men are ill and those few that are well swear that they will die rather than go in the same ship again. They have been used so ill by their Captain. Our Rt. Honourable Masters sent in the said ship for this place 35 poor men as soldiers. Of these 19 came on shore here alive; but there were but two of them could stand on their legs, the other 17 were carried to the hospital, two of whom are already dead and most of the rest we fear will die.\n\nAs the increase in the wealth and importance of Bombay failed to compensate for the heavy fresh charges of 1684, to make good the deficit the Court suggested a reduction in the pay of the Bombay troops. To this the Bombay Council in their letter to Surat of the 31st October 1686 make the following protest: The reducing of the men's pay is so weighty a matter that we hope you will think it fitter for His Excellency Sir John Gayer to do than any man else. The new Deputy Governor (Mr. J. Wyborne) says that both himself officers and soldiers were entered at the East India house and agreed to have the same allowance of pay that His Majesty's guards in England had. The men indented to serve for the said salary and we know that provisions of all sorts are much dearer here than ever they were. At this allowance of pay some of the men are starved or else so many of them would not die, for it is certain there was never more care taken of the men than now is by this Deputy Governor.\n\nSoon after, more severe measures than a reduction of pay were carried out. About the close of 1686 the four companies of soldiers (apparently the second Rajput company was never raised) were reduced to three. On the 2nd December 1686 the Bombay Council write to Surat: We sometime since received a letter from your Excellency which enordered us to reduce the four companies into three which was immediately done.\n\n---\n\n1 Bombay to Surat 27th Sept. 1686, Sec.

On the 29th December 1686 the Bombay Council made the following representation to the Court on the subject of the ill treatment of recruits on the voyage out: We desire that more care may be taken when your Honours send out any men hither as soldiers or servants. The poor men are generally so starved or beaten and abused that they fall into the scurvy and half of them die by the way or come on shore so sick and weak as to be altogether unfit for service. The men that came out on the New London were the healthiest strongest men that ever came hither out of England. This we suppose was occasioned by Sir John Wyborne's care of and charity to them. Here were landed 62 men all fit to bear arms the first day. When your Honours agree with any Captain of your ships to bring your servants out for India, pray be pleased to agree that each man have so many ounces of bread a day. For if men be served a week's bread at a time, it often happens that one steals from another and if a poor man loses a week's bread before he comes to have any more, he is half starved; so it is necessary to have them served daily. Besides the captains say they allow them so many pounds of bread a week but they allow not above 10 ozs. to the pound which starves the poor wretches, and all other provisions proportionable. The men that came on the Worcester frigate we have reason to believe were ill used. There came but nineteen poor souls on shore and but two of the nineteen able to stand, all having the scurvy. Great part of them are since dead in your hospital. We humbly beg on the poor men's behalf if you may have occasion to send out hereafter that some other care may be taken for their safety and your Honours' service and this country's security, for in the main your Honours are the losers.\n\nIn January 1687 a fresh batch of recruits arrived regarding whom the Bombay Council in their letter to Surat of the 23rd January 1687 write: On the 20th as soon as his ship was at an anchor Captain Willdey came on shore. He told us that he wanted water for his ship's company not having filled any since he came from the Mauritius. We thought it convenient while he did lie here affilling of water, to land the powder on board him. In order to his despatch we sent four boats on board her to land the soldiers and their arms and clothes. There are come over in her 63 men as soldiers on the Rt. Honourable Company's accounts, of which one is lieutenant, one ensign, four serjeants, four corporals, and two drummers. The agreement that they made in England we have not, neither that of the men that came in the ship Charles II. We pray your Excellency to send us those papers if come to your hands, also your orders how to dispose of them whether to keep them in rolls distinct or mix them. They have colours and officers for two companies as corporals serjeants and drummers. We can make them no allowance till we hear from you. The officers say they were all made officers in England and received advanced money\n\n---\n\n1 Bombay to Court 29th Dec. 1686, Sec. Out. L. B. 4 of 1677-1687, 43-44.

Captain Willdey says he has buried upwards of 100 men most of them seamen.\n\nAs the question of reducing the soldiers' pay was still pressed, the Bombay Government wrote to Surat on the 5th February 1687: We are very sensible the Honourable Company has ordered the soldiers' pay to be reduced to Xeraphins at 20d. and are in general for putting that order in execution. But we humbly beg leave to lay down some considerations before we pointblank run upon it. The Honourable Company's orders to immediately dismiss out of their service all such as shall refuse to receive their pay at the rates established for their coin to go here are strict. Still the consideration remains, if the Rt. Honourable Company should but begin with one private sentinel to cashier him on that account, they would possibly leave but few but hath already repented of their coming out and would be glad of such an occasion to quit their service. For most part of what now come out as recruits are able seamen and will not be yoked unless land-service be easier to them than the sea. And considering the circumstances our nation lies under here in India, not knowing how soon we may be in action, for the honour and good of our nation we humbly offer it as our opinion not at this juncture to effect a saving but rather to labour to give an encouragement than a discouragement to men that must stand by us and no doubt will when their pay is encouraging and all they fight for. We leave this wholly to your Excellency's consideration. If reductions cannot be avoided at this juncture, we beg your Excellency will be pleased to put forth a proclamation that it may be openly published at the head of all the companies what the will and pleasure of the Rt. Honourable Company is relating to the alteration and settlement of all the money rates to be paid in this island. This will not only satisfy all that shall hear it but be a standing rule for us to act by. Then the new rates shall no longer be delayed on our parts but immediately be put in execution. We hope what we have here laid down may not be taken amiss.\n\nThis remonstrance had no effect. On the 23rd March 1687 the Bombay Council write to Surat: We have paid the garrison the last month's pay at the rate of \u00a30\u00bdd. the Xeraphin to the dissatisfaction of most people as well officers as soldiers. Since that pay day a great many of our French and Dutch have laid down their arms and are gone off from the island. The topasses in general say they shall be starved, provision of all sorts being so very dear. But all the people's hope is that when your Excellency comes you will take pity on them and give them their former allowance. A copy of the agreement the men made in England who have come out in the Tonqueen we herewith send you.\n\n---\n\n1 Bombay to Surat 23rd Jan. 1687, Sec. Out. L.

Forrest's Home Series, I. 156-157.\nThe following from a letter of the Court to Surat, dated the 3rd January 1694, shows the steps taken to replace the Europeans destroyed by the plague during the three previous years: As we have sent you by the first ships what soldiers we possibly could, so we intend by our latter ships to send you above 200 soldiers more to Bombay. We hope to procure them by contract with some undertakers or captain conductors who are to put them on board our ships. This matter of the soldiers we are the more earnest to accomplish, because they are the best arguments and cards you can show to secure to the Company and their successors forever the lands forfeited to us upon Bombay.\u00b9 As we would not for any gain in the world injure any innocent man, so on the other hand we will not part with any revenue that is justly accrued to us by the present and ancient laws of that island.\n\nIt is perhaps a coincidence that the despatch which accompanies this somewhat questionable policy of forfeit with an uncalled-for parade of high motives should also contain the following: We send you on the Thomas 25 Bibles for the use of our garrison at Bombay. By the next shipping you shall receive a further supply.\u00b2\n\nIn spite of the special care taken of them the 1694 recruits do not seem to have found life in Bombay attractive. On the 18th February 1695 the Council issued the following order to a Ship Captain: Hearing that you have on board some people belonging to this garrison, we require you to send them on shore on receipt hereof. For the future you are not to receive any person from hence without our orders as you will answer the same to our Right Hon'ble Masters.\u00b3\n\nIn June 1703 the Court draw attention to the need of better food and lodging for the troops in Bombay. In addition to recommending the building of barracks somewhere near the fort the Court add: Some proper person in the nature of a sutler is required to provide and oversee that the provisions be good and wholesome. The soldiers should also be kept under strict military discipline and not suffered to lie a night out of the fort or barracks.\u2074\n\nFive years later the Court again insist on the necessity of barracks. On the 20th April 1708 they write: We positively require, all excuses apart, that you provide barracks for the soldiers and a good sutler for want of which we hear the soldiers are forced to lodge with the natives who soon poison them. Also that the hospital be more looked after, and a matron or more be pitched upon to attend it, and have for her or their pains what you think a proper allowance.\u2075\n\nTwo years later the question of officers\u2019 pay again comes to the front. On the 24th March 1710 the Court write to Bombay: For want of\n\n\u00b9 This apparently refers to the forfeit of their lands by people who fled or sided with the Sidi during the Sidi occupation of the island in 1689-90.\n\u00b2 Court to Surat 3rd Jan. 1694, Sec.

But as we have found our people at the coast (Madras) and bay (Calcutta) have made larger allowances to them than we contracted with them, we repeat that when we sent them from hence we have wrote them and do now tell you that a lieutenant has but four pounds a month, an ensign three pounds a month, a serjeant thirty shillings, a corporal twenty-four shillings, and a private sentinel twenty-one shillings a month; and that they be paid thirteen months to the year.\n\nIn the same letter the Court further direct Bombay to send by every ship a list of all European soldiers and officers in the military, with the monthly allowances, and where they severally keep guard. Also to send the like for the Christian out-guard and topasses, with an account of what number is necessary for each place.\n\nDuring the next five years (1710-1715) the vereadores seem to have been excused from providing trained bands or militia. In their letter of the 5th April 1715 the Court order Bombay to examine and write home if the new agreement with the vereadores to excuse them from finding trained bands or militia in consideration of fifteen thousand Xeraphins a year be a sufficient equivalent. And to state if this change does not so alter the ancient constitution of the island as may turn to the Company\u2019s prejudice; and whether in return for the Xs. 15,000 the vereadores think themselves absolutely discharged from assisting in case of any invasion by an enemy.\n\nRegarding commissions to military officers the Court write on the 5th April 1715: Having taken into consideration the method you are to use in giving commissions to military officers, we hereby direct that all commissions to be hereafter given out to them, be granted by the Governor for the time being, and by his authority; and that he only sign the same. Also where it has been usual to put the Company\u2019s seal thereto, that the like method be still continued and the seal affixed accordingly. That the Governor have power singly to suspend any military officer for breach of orders or failure in his duty until the next Consultation day. But that no officer be entertained in our service under your presidency or cashiered and expelled from thence without the consent of the President and Council or the major part of them met in Consultation, the whole Council being duly summoned.\n\nThe question of military pay once more comes to the front in 1732, when the Court describe their own financial expedient of 1686 as a mean practice. In their letter of the 7th June 1732, the Court write: We are informed the military and marine have laboured under some hardships. You must necessarily be apprised that the agreement made\n\n---\n\n1 Court to Bombay 24th Mar. 1710 para 74. Comp. of Standing Ord.

We direct that this be paid them in rupees at the same rate as our covenant servants receive their salary, and a stop be put to that mean practice of delivering out seventy-two pice for a silver rupee, when the poor soldiers must part with seventy-six or seventy-eight to purchase one, or which is the same in effect, the value of one. Even though (as we hope is the case) the difference be brought to our account, yet we cannot allow such a practice to be just. Besides rectifying this abuse, you must have a watchful eye over the officers and paymaster, and suffer them not to impose on the soldiers any hardships whatsoever. On the contrary they must give the soldiers all fitting encouragement.\n\nOn receipt of these orders, on the 30th of March 1733, the Bombay Council direct that the land and marine paymasters pay the officers soldiers and sailors in the military and marine in silver or pice at the rate of eighty pice for one silver rupee. And, that there may be no objection to this exchange, it is agreed that for the future eighty pice shall be received into the Company's treasury, the custom house cash, the warehouse, and the general stores as a rupee. Also that a publication be issued to this purpose that all inhabitants may be apprised thereof to take place from the 1st of April.\n\nIn October 1736 the question of barracks again comes under discussion. On the 8th October 1736 the Bombay Council passed the following orders: Frequent representations having been made of the inconveniency of the foot barracks and guard rooms in the fort that they are not near large enough for the number of Europeans we have on shore in the time of the rains, and that the guard rooms particularly are very damp and not capable of sheltering the people from the inclemency of the season which we are assured has occasioned the loss of some of them, it is agreed that such repairs be made as are necessary and such additions as are absolutely wanted to accommodate the soldiers. The paymaster is enjoined to see that the Honourable Company be not put to any superfluous charge therein.\n\nThe Bombay Diary of the 11th August 1737 records: Our Honourable Masters are at great expense to supply us with European soldiers, including the outlay on those who die before their arrival here. Every man they send stands them in between \u00a316 and \u00a320.\n\nTo provide accommodation for ensigns the Bombay Diary of the 17th February 1738 contains the following orders: The apartments for the ensigns upon the east curtain in the fort being very old and undermined by rats lately fell down. As there is a great want of accommodations for the said officers, it is agreed that the apartments be rebuilt in the most frugal manner possible.\n\n---\n\n1 The mistaken \u00a31 3s. is corrected to \u00a31 1s. in Court's Letter of 15th March 1733.\n2 Court to Bombay 7th June 1732 para 39.

To remedy these evils the said President and Governor by and with the consent and advice of his Council doth hereby forbid any Bhandaris or other inhabitants without the town gates to entertain any European soldier or sailor in their houses before nine of the clock in the forenoon or after seven in the evening on penalty of forfeiting five rupees for every offence. The said Bhandaris and other inhabitants are hereby positively forbid buying any of the said soldiers' regimental or other clothing, or any of their arms accoutrements or ammunition on any pretence whatever on the like penalty of five rupees on every offence. That no person may plead ignorance hereof, the said President and Governor hath caused these presents to be published by the beat of drum and affixed at the usual places. Given in Bombay Castle, the 26th day of May in the eleventh year of the reign of our sovereign Lord George II, King of Great Britain &c. A.D. 1738.\n\nWhen the Company's covenanted civil military and marine servants wanted to remit money to England, the Government granted them bills of exchange on the Court of Directors. The military and marine found that where they were paid at 2s. 6d. the rupee for their service they were allowed only 2s. 3d. the rupee when they wanted to remit money to England. In reply to a petition on this subject, on the 9th November 1738, the Bombay Council passed the following orders: Several of our military and marine officers have made complaints of the hardships of paying them at 2s. and 6d. the rupee and giving them bills at 2s. and 3d. On recourse to the orders of our Honourable Masters relating to exchange, it is observed that they are pleased to permit all their servants to pay in their money at 2s. and 5d. And as we presume our Honourable Masters do not mean to lay their servants in the military and marine under such hardship and therefore that in their last orders they include them as well as their covenant servants, it is agreed that we grant bills to all covenant, military, and marine servants at 2s. and 5d. At the same time as we are not certain whether our Honourable Masters look upon the officers of the Europe ships as owners or as their servants we give these officers certificates for the number of rupees they may pay in, leaving to our Honourable Masters to adjust the exchange until they give us explicit orders.\n\nUnder the influence of the fear of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, inspired by their successes against the Portuguese, at a Consultation of the 16th April 1739 the Board ordered that every gentleman and English inhabitant not comprehended in military, marine, or gunroom, be provided with arms and accoutrements to have by him in readiness on any call or\n\n---\n\n1 Sec.

Agreed likewise that the President recommend to the gentlemen their instructing themselves in the use and exercise of small arms, which may better enable them to be more serviceable in the defence of the place, should occasion require it. Certain of the Portuguese who sought shelter in Bombay on the fall of Bassein had taken service as soldiers. At a Consultation on the 27th July 1739 the President observed that the Portuguese that are enrolled in our military are distinguished from all other Europeans by receiving less pay than they, although no reasons appear assigned for it. In consideration of the gallant behaviour of the soldiery at Bassein, the encouragement it will be to them to list in our service as occasion shall offer, as well likewise to ensure the fidelity of those already listed, the Board resolved that henceforward the pay of a European Portuguese in our military be equal to that of all the rest of the Europeans in our service, the same being actually observed at present in the marine. The Board add: It may be here remarked that the Europeans procured in these parts are impressed without the cost which those sent out from England stand our Honourable Masters in, and are generally found to be more sober and serviceable. At the same Consultation (27th July 1739), in consequence of the Maratha successes, the President remarks to the Board that our present circumstances and insecurity render it very necessary to consult the best means of strengthening our military at the least expense to our Honourable Masters. That therefore on enquiry, finding our number of topasses greatly decreased and most of those in our pay disabled or almost passed service through age or infirmities, he proposed recruiting them by inviting such a number of freshmen as could be got to take our pay, and, whenever there should be a sufficient number of the new topasses, to disband, in proportion our Gentu sepoys, who, on account of their caste being the same as that of the Marathas and for many other reasons, are not so much to be depended upon in case of an invasion, or indeed so serviceable and expert at firearms as the topasses. That, at a time when all necessaries of life are raised so much in their price, apprehending the smallness of our pay to be an obstacle to our getting men fit for service and duty, some encouragement ought to be thought of to remove this obstacle. To secure this object it seems an absolute necessity either to raise the pay, which is to entail a perpetual increased expense on the Honourable Company, or to find out some other means or expedient as by furnishing topasses with rice at an under rate. This may make their support the easier, and in cheap times become without consequence or easily dropped as occasions offer. The same therefore is recommended to the mature deliberation of the Board, in order that the most effectual measures may be taken, both for the benefit of the service and for the ease of expense to our Honourable Masters, as far as consistently can be. This matter being of so great consequence, it is agreed that we take further time to consider thereof come to a determination.\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Consultation 16th April 1739, Pub.

In reply the Commanding Officer submitted the following report, dated the 24th August 1739: Agreeable to your Honours' orders I, Samuel Walker Commanding Officer; deliver you a state of the military and sepoys as they are now posted at the several guards and passes upon this island and on Underi and Butcher's Island, and my opinion jointly with the rest of the officers. After a strict review we decided that from old age and other causes 177 of the topasses were incapable of service. The reason why so large a proportion of the whole body are unfit for service is that the low pay failed to attract good men and at the same time a large body had to be kept up to man the numerous posts, particularly the passes at Sion and Suri and the posts of Warli and Mahim. Besides detachments were necessary for manning the fleet in the fair season; which by taking up the major part of our Europeans has hitherto prevented the discharge of the aged and incapable as no fresh men could be obtained. The difficulty of suitable recruits is now renewed from the number of topasses that have retired hither from the several parts of the Portuguese territories conquered by the Marathas. Further in all probability if the Portuguese do not receive a proper supply of men and money this September from Europe, they will be obliged to evacuate Chaul and Daman. In both these garrisons they have a good body of topasses which, with proper encouragement, will in all probability retire to Bombay. It is our opinion, as many of them have been tried and refused to take service at Rs. 4 a month, that they will not enter at less than Rs. 6 or Rs. 5\u00bd, which in the cheapest time will do no more than barely maintain their families, it being a truth well known that at Madras and other settlements the topasses have two pagodas (Rs. 6 to 7 a month). The bulk of the Bombay topasses have hitherto subsisted by families taking care of and watering carts and others manuring the batty grounds. In consequence they were dispersed over the island, at Mahim Parel or other distant places, so that they could not be got together in a body for some time. The ill consequences of their being dispersed in case of an alarm is visible when you consider the situation of this island that the necessaries of life are mostly brought from the main, added to its being a place of trade which occasions a number of strangers from all parts of the main to resort hither. Though we have it as a standing and positive order from your Honour to observe strangers coming on the island, yet, should any of the neighbouring powers form a design of invading this place, it is not impracticable for them to have a number of men concealed here under the hidden characters of merchants and others under a pretence of bringing necessaries. As they command numbers, when they have their designs formed they can attack you in different places. In our opinion this danger cannot more effectually be remedied than by suffering none to live within the town walls except merchants and other people of credit, of whose affection and fidelity you have reason to be satisfied. Also at the same time to have habitations provided for the topasses to live within the walls, and their subsistence so increased as they may be able to maintain their families without other helps. Therefore we apprehend the opportunity for augmenting\nthe number of good topasses is not to be lost, they being a body of men to be depended upon in point of fidelity and discipline, joined with a body of your Europeans which are now but few in number, and the climate not agreeing with a European constitution so well as we could wish. Further the badness and scarcity of flesh provisions, which is chiefly their food, are not to be remedied, whilst the country in our neighbourhood remains under the Gentu government. Also out of the small number of Europeans you have got in garrison, too many of them from their first arrival were justly to be objected against, being not fit for this or any other service. We could wish it were recommended by your Honour that the persons employed by the Company in raising their recruits for this settlement, might be obliged to provide strong and healthy men. But we are glad to give it your Honour as our opinion that the recruits come now on the Haistingfield seem to us to be good men. Of your sepoys, the other branch of the force of this garrison which the necessity of your affairs obliged you to entertain until you could increase your number of Europeans and topasses, we are unwilling to express any suspicion as they have not hitherto been detected in want of fidelity to the service. At the same time as it is a practice of those eastern nations to corrupt the subjects and servants of those powers they want to overcome, and, as the sepoys in your service were formerly subjects and have their relations and are intermarried with the inhabitants of this neighbourhood, added to their being of the same religion, complete confidence is not possible. Also when as at present your neighbouring powers have occasion for men, they give more pay than you do, which will of course draw your best men to their service. As they will never be brought to act in a body with Europeans and topasses, though a small number of them will always be necessary in the service, we could wish their numbers were less, and the number of good Europeans and topasses increased. Those men that are incapable from their long services and other infirmities may be otherwise provided for as the number on the rolls is seemingly great, but in reality it is deceiving the service.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 28th September 1739, after considering the above report, it is remarked that, in case of any sudden alarm, as the topasses when off guard live out of the town gates, in the oarts, and some as far out of town as Mahim and Parel, it would be impossible to call a body of them together upon any such emergency. That therefore in our present situation, where we are surrounded by treacherous neighbours, who are notorious for watching all occasions of surprise, it is consequently requisite to keep a constant guard. It would be highly conducive to the safety of the town if a sufficient number of topasses had habitations within the town walls so as to be ready at any sudden warning to repair to their quarters. Against this change one material objection is the slenderness of their pay which is evidently insufficient\n\n---\n\n1 Military Officers' Report to Government 24th Aug. 1739, Pub. Diary 12 of 1733-39, 383-386.\nto their maintenance and which they are obliged to make up by little employes as labourers in the carts; so that it would be a great hardship to oblige them to live within the walls. For remedy to this the President proposes that every able topass now on the rolls or henceforward to be enlisted, that will engage to serve the term of five years, shall receive Rs. 5 a month, which it is to be hoped will not only remove the aforesaid objection but encourage good and able men to list in our service, who are now kept from it by the smallness of the pay. The Board, Mr. Stonestreet dissenting, agrees with the report in holding the smallness of pay to be the chief reason that on a review of those men, so few will be found really serviceable or capable of doing military duty. Considering next of the provision to be made for such as are invalids and incapable of doing military duty, and for that reason proper to be struck off the list of effective men, it is unanimously agreed that the following regulations be in force and take place at such time as the President shall judge convenient: All topasses invalids or incapable, who are private men, not having served seven years are to be struck off the roll, and one month's pay as gratuity is to be advanced them on their said dismission. Such as are qualified by seven years' service or upwards and are disabled, invalids, or otherwise incapable, are to have pensions during their life at the rate of Rs. 3 a month. Those that are under such incapacity and have served twenty-five years or upwards are to be pensioned at Rs. 4 a month during life. A black topass serjeant past duty is to be allowed Rs. 5 and a corporal Rs. 4 also during life. All these pensioners are nevertheless, on such occasions as their service may be wanted, to be employed according to their respective abilities at the discretion and under the orders of the proper officers.\n\nAt a Consultation on the 3rd March 1740, the President observes to the Board that when any of our military, whether soldiers sepoys or subalterns, especially those married or in debt here to their captains, whence stoppage of any part of their pay here ensues, are sent on command to subordinate factories, such stoppages here breed a great confusion, the Honourable Company often suffering by our payments here, as in cases of death or desertion. To prevent this he proposes that henceforward such detachments shall, if possible, consist only of single persons, or, where such debts or engagements make stoppages necessary, that the Chief at the place they are sent to, see that proper satisfaction be made at the request of the parties concerned, or as the case requires; so that the land paymaster's books here be not charged any longer with accounts of persons that are on other establishments. In this opinion the Board concurring, the same is laid down as a standing rule of practice in future, of which the President will advise the Captain Commandant, and the land paymaster is now directed to take due notice of this regulation.\n\n---\n\n1 Bom.

At the same time as there is no hospital in case of sickness they are obliged to be brought down to Bombay when their condition is at times too bad to admit safely of such a removal. That thereupon the engineer being consulted, gave assurance of building a reasonably commodious lodgment or cazern for about one thousand rupees, and a place to serve for a hospital for five hundred. On consideration of this matter it is agreed that these buildings be set about out of hand.\n\nEmbezzlements of shot and other stores from the fortifications led to the issue of the following orders by the Board on the 10th October 1740: The President moves for restraining the present pernicious license given to the inhabitants of dealing in the several ammunitions of war. He remarks that the gunner often complains of embezzlements of shot and other stores from the fortifications, and since dealing in arms is allowed, it is put out of his power to detect those who by their purchases encourage such thefts. The President therefore proposes the issuing a publication prohibiting the buying of articles of ammunition; that those now possessed of any, deliver within twenty days a true and exact list thereof, which are to be valued and paid for on account of our Honourable Masters. To this the Board agree.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 27th October 1740 the Board issue the following orders: It is remarked that the soldiers and sailors who through their own follies contract the venereal distemper have not hitherto paid anything for their care; and the fixing a certain sum to be deducted out of their pay will probably discourage them from a repetition of the vice. It is therefore ordered that each common soldier pay to the Doctor Rs. 6, serjeants and corporals an increase proportionable to their addition of pay, and every mariner a month's pay for his attendance. And to the end that the persons may be satisfied of their Doctor, as well as to excite an emulation in point of care, it is to be left to the patient's option whom to apply to, and the gratuity above specified is to be paid to him so employed.\n\nThe Bombay Diary of the 13th January 1741 has the following entry: The President acquaints the Board that our Honourable Masters so repeatedly expressing their uneasiness under the great charges of this island, had caused in him the strictest attention to lessen every branch thereof when it could with any tolerable prudence be attempted; that accordingly as we have not at present any advice of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s' intentions against us that they have any considerable bodies of men in our neighbourhood, he had, on his proceeding a few days past to muster at the out-forts in company with the land paymaster, observed that keeping so many Europeans in garrison at Sion, was attended\n\n---\n\n1 Bom.

A phara of batty is also given monthly to 531 men of the militia doing duty and pay to a doctor with diet and servants alone amounts to Rs. 708 a year. On consulting the officers they were of opinion the topasses might be sufficient in the present conjunctures and the Europeans with the doctor recalled; that indeed it would be requisite to continue a few of the militia for the several small batteries on the banks of the river but the number may be reduced to 144. These several items with two large boats withdrawn from the river will as by an estimate cause a reduction of Rs. 14,364-1-10 a year. On the other hand it is to be remembered that our security will depend on our having the best and earliest intelligence of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s' movements which must be carefully sought after and some expense unavoidably incurred. Yet as we believe on the whole a real saving will arise, we hope our Honourable Masters will approve of this step and be in some measure convinced no endeavours are wanting or opportunity slipped for bringing about what by them is so frequently enjoined.\n\n1 Bom.

After making this survey the Engineer reports: About thirty-six years ago the foot barracks were built with walls of chunam and stone not above one foot ten inches thick. As the walls were not thought of substance sufficient to bear upper rooms, it was judged convenient to cover the whole with a terrace which on examination was found to be about twelve inches thick and in the midst a pavement of stone. That finding a few years after that the terrace became exceedingly leaky and rendered the barrack very wet and prejudicial to the health of the people, it was judged expedient that without taking up the terrace and pavement a roof should be raised over them. This roof was accordingly made but of such bad materials that it is now ready to fall in, the rafters being entirely rotten and decayed, the greatest part of the ridge timbers broke, and the main beams cracked through in several places. For some years back this upper roof has been supported by a few stanchions fixed in the common barrack that very much incommode the people and likewise were liable to be thrown down, thus making the whole in danger of falling in by the excessive weight of the terrace, pavement, and roof, the walls being not of substance sufficient to support so great a weight. The engineer therefore esteemed it highly expedient that without loss of time the terrace should be taken off as well as the roof and that new beams should be fixed and an entirely new roof erected of the best materials in the most substantial manner. According to a calculate delivered me, and which is herewith presented, the expense of this new roof amounts to Rs. 4041, though, should your Honour approve thereof, the utmost care shall be taken to bring the expense into a narrower compass.\n\nI must further beg leave to represent to your Honour that, through the leakiness of the terrace, the sail room and apartments in the marine yard are in a manner uninhabitable. Not only so, but in time the leak must prejudice and rot the beams and joices which are not of thickness enough to support so great a weight. Besides this the Company are at an annual expense of between Rs. 200 and 300 to cover the whole with cajans or palm thatch, which I presume is exceedingly dangerous as the palm leaves are so apt to take fire and are by no means a proper roof, especially so near our vessels when in the dock, as, should such a misfortune happen, the whole would be in the utmost danger of being consumed. To prevent so fatal an accident and that the above room and lodgings may be made secure and dry and also that proper conveniences may be made for the sails and other stores belonging to the marine, it is proposed that the aforementioned terrace be taken off and that the walls which are thick enough be raised 7\u00bd feet higher for making the said store rooms and conveniences and that a tiled roof be erected over the whole of the best materials whereby the same will not only last many years without being subject to any heavy annual expense but likewise be preserved from fire. The estimate I have caused to be made of the expense that will attend these alterations amounts to Rs. 5005. I further think it my duty to acquaint your Honour that some part of the mint has hitherto been annually cajaned. This I apprehend to be\nexceedingly improper, considering the number of fires continually alight, as well as the essay (assay) room adjoining thereto and likewise being so near the fort and foot barrack that any accident by fire would be attended with melancholy consequences. And as making a small roof and covering it with tiles will not cost a large sum and will save an annual charge and likewise the whole will be rendered more secure, I take the liberty to recommend the doing it to your Honour. At the same time I am fearful the number of works already in hand will not admit of its being done this season.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 30th January 1741 the following orders were passed on the Paymaster's report: The Board proceeding to consider the condition of the barracks so amply stated by the paymaster and the President acquainting them that he had in person lately viewed the building and consulted such as were reckoned the most competent judges, they esteemed them greatly ruined as set forth in the letter now before the Board. It is therefore agreed that the defects be remedied according to the proposal of our engineer and that the paymaster see to the performance with the best and most substantial materials avoiding at the same time any superfluous charge. That with regard to the sail room and apartments in the marine yard, it is certain that continuing them in their present condition renders it greatly hurtful to the health of the people who inhabit there as well as destructive of the vessels' sails by the damp rotting them during the rainy season and the beams and joices not being esteemed sufficient to support their present load of terrace, the whole may be reckoned of little duration or service. That the method hitherto pursued to make them in any tolerable degree dry and useful by covering them with cajans puts our Honourable Masters to a constant annual expense and is at the same time attended with the greatest hazard from fire, which, should it ever happen at a time when our vessels are on shore, even the whole of them may be destroyed, a consequence the most dreadful to this island. It is resolved that provided the walls shall on a strict survey be found of sufficient substance to be raised the height of 7\u00bd feet more, to the end of making convenient lodgments for the several stores belonging to the marine, that the same be set about; but if on the contrary it shall be thought anyways detrimental or weakening to the fabric, that then only the terrace be taken off and a tile-roof erected.\n\nIn answer to an application from the Chief and Factors of Surat for a supply of soldiers and other military men, the Board passed the following resolution on the 9th November 1741: Considering the request of the Surat Chief and Factors to be supplied with a serjeant, corporal, and 20 Europeans for defending their factory against any insults the (Moghal) government may throw in their way, we find that of 529 men left to garrison this place only 60 are Europeans; and from these the galivats are yet to be manned. For this reason it is thought imprudent to gratify Surat in this particular. Besides the\n\n---\n\n1 Land Paymaster to Government 15th Jan. 1741, P. Diary 14 of 1740-41, 54-56.\n2 Bom, Gov. Consultation 30th Jan. 1741, Pub, Diary 14 of 1740-41, 46-47.\nBoard does not conceive that the assistance asked would be of any real service, as it is presumed none will dare to rob or plunder us. Should it prove otherwise, we can always obtain reparation by methods that have been found successful in parallel cases. The Chief and Factors must be admonished to pursue such a neutral part as will give neither side cause of offence; for that seems the most likely policy to carry them clear of trouble.\n\nIn August 1742 some topasses offered themselves for enlistment at Rs. 5 a month and promised to live within the walls. With reference to the former (1739) discussion, the Land Paymaster desired to know if any should be now entertained. The Bombay Diary of the 3rd August 1742 has the following entry: The Land Paymaster desires the Board will determine whether he may enlist any more topasses at the rate of Rs. 5 a month, as some have lately offered themselves. On this the President takes occasion to declare it is his real and firm sentiments the topasses ought to be encouraged to live and keep their families within the walls though at the additional allowance of Rs. 5. By that means they will always be ready for the defence of the town, and the presence of their families will be a sure pledge for their fidelity. The President reminds the Board that during the reduction of the Portuguese territories the wives and children of the garrison were not timely brought into Bassein. The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s possessing themselves of the wives and children and threatening to cut them off even under the walls soon induced the men to surrender. The same, he adds, may happen to this place if the wives and children of the garrison are suffered to remain without. Indeed many of the topasses live at so great a distance that it would be difficult on any sudden attack to compose a body of them. The members apprehending our Honourable Masters' orders too conclusive to admit of any more topasses being enlisted at that rate, the paymaster is ordered to enlist only such as will take Rs. 4 a month. Those already enlisted may be continued at the rate of Rs. 5, but as any die or leave the service, the pay must be reduced to those recruited in their room.\n\nTo ascertain what reductions could be made in the military charges a statement of the whole force was laid before the Board at a Consultation on the 13th August 1742. After discussion the following orders were passed: A state of the military force both soldiers and sepoys showing their distribution on guard at the several posts, detachments on board the vessels, and other services, is now laid upon the table and perused. On this the Board are of opinion that, provided any reduction be made, it had better be among the sepoys, as we can the rather depend upon the fidelity of the Christian soldiers than upon sepoys. Further though the number of the Christians appears to be 829 men, yet, as 285 of them are actually employed on the fortification works, it would answer no end at present to discharge them. Therefore the Board resolve to let the whole remain as they now stand till\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Consultation 9th Nov. 1741, Pub. Diary 14 of 1740-41, 455-456.\n2 Bom. Gov.

Otherwise they demanded their discharge and persisted notwithstanding all arguments to show them how unreasonable were their demands. The President ordered the captain commandant with a proper detachment to relieve the several posts, and by a letter received this morning from the commandant and now read, it appears the topasses continue in the same refractory and obstinate disposition. The topasses now thus mutinous and disorderly are such as fled hither from S\u00e1lsette after the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s took possession of that island and to the number of 172 were taken into the service and formed into four companies at Rs. 842-0-66 a month. At that time there were apprehensions of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s molesting this island. But at present there are no reasons to suspect the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s have any such ill designs. Even if the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s have, and these people are discharged, they can be of no more service to the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s than sepoys without European officers to discipline them, and of sepoys without European officers the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s can have as many thousands as they please. It is further observed that if these topasses are anyways indulged in their demands, it may be a bad example for others of the garrison to insist in the like manner. Therefore the President proposes to send off the island all of the Sion topasses who have behaved in this mutinous manner. As they must soon be starving this will make the others set a true value upon the service. Such pay as they now have they can nowhere get or earn by their labour. To this proposal the whole Board agree, also that the pay due to the topasses for part of the current month be stopped for the payment of the batty they have been supplied with.\n\nThe Bombay Diary of the 1st July 1743 records: A motion being made for settling the number to be employed in the military and that in future the respective companies should have a fixed number of men of all denominations allotted to each in which the officers\u2019 servants are to be included, the following scheme is proposed for the seven companies of Europeans and topasses:\n\n| Companies                  | Captain | Lieutenants | Ensigns | Sergeant-Majors | Sergeants | Corporals | Drummers | Europeans | Artillers | Servants | Sabashes | Lingeiss | Armourer | Doctor | Topasses | Total |\n|----------------------------|---------|-------------|---------|----------------|-----------|-----------|----------|-----------|-----------|----------|---------|---------|---------|--------|---------|\n| Grenadier's Company        |         |             |         |                |           |           |          |           |           |          |         |         |         |        |         |       |\n| 1st Company Bombay        | 1       | 1           | 1       | 1              | 10        | 10        | 3        | 100       |           |          |         |         |         |        |         | 127   |\n| 2nd ditto M\u00e1labar         | 1       | 2           | 1       | 1              | 10        | 10        | 4        | 40        | 10        | 7        |         |         |         |        |         | 150   |\n| 3rd ditto Sion            | 1       | 2           | 1       | 1              | 10        | 10        | 3        |           |           | 3        | 2        | 1       | 1      |         | 150   |\n| 4th ditto Bombay          | 1       | 2           | 1       | 1              | 10        | 10        | 3        | 44        | 6         | 3        |         |         |         |        |         | 100   |\n| 5th ditto ditto           | 1       | 2           | 1       | 1              | 10        | 10        | 3        | 45        | 5         | 3        |         |         |         |        |         | 100   |\n| 6th ditto ditto           | 1       | 2           | 1       | 1              | 10        | 10        | 3        | 45        | 4         | 3        |         |         |         |        |         | 100   |\n| 7th ditto ditto           | 1       | 2           | 1       | 1              | 10        | 10        | 3        | 44        | 6         | 3        |         |         |         |        |         | 100   |\n| Total                     | 1       | 9           | 15      | 2              | 82        | 82        | 26       | 819       | 31        | 27       | 2        | 1       | 1       | 1      | 900    | 1499  |\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Consultation 9th May 1743, Pub. Diary 16 of 1743, 135-136.\nThe division of the sepoys into thirteen companies causes more officers than are necessary to command so small a body of men. It is therefore proposed to reduce the number of sepoy companies to six with in each a total of 117 officers and sepoys at a monthly cost of about Rs. 523, that is a total strength of 702 and a monthly cost of Rs. 3132.\\(^1\\)\n\nThe above being taken into consideration it is observed that our nation is now in actual war and that if France declares war we may expect to be troubled on this coast. Besides as it is uncertain what measures our neighbours the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s may think proper to pursue, it is the unanimous opinion of this Board that the number of people specified in the preceding proposals are necessary at the present to be kept up for the garrison but not to be exceeded. As supplies are received from England a proportionable number of topasses may be discharged so as to render the several companies equal to the intended establishment. By this resolution the difference in yearly expense in July 1743 compared with what it was in November 1742 will be Rs. 17,229.\\(^2\\)\n\nOrdered that the land paymaster discharge the sepoys officers and others upon the rolls that are supernumerary to what are now allowed, giving to each person discharged one month\u2019s pay according to his rank.\\(^3\\)\n\nIn their letter of the 17th June 1748 the Court write: We have judged it highly proper to put our military and artillery at Bombay upon a new footing as by the establishment and regulations enclosed.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The details of each company are:\n\n| Company Details | Rs. q.r. res. |\n|-----------------|--------------|\n| 1 Subhed\u00e1r at   | ... 20 0 0   |\n| 2 Jumbled\u00e1rs at Rs. 13 | ... 26 0 0   |\n| 5 Hav\u00e1ld\u00e1rs at Rs. 6\u00bd | ... 32 2 0   |\n| 5 Na\u00edks at Rs. 4-2-20 | ... 22 3 0   |\n| 1 Sabnis at     | ... 4 2 20   |\n| 1 Trumpeter at  | ... 4 0 0    |\n| 1 Colour-bearer at | ... 4 0 0    |\n| 1 Bh\u00e1ld\u00e1r or Halberd-bearer at | ... 4 0 0    |\n| 100 Sepoys at Rs. 4 | ... 400 0 0 |\n\nTotal 117 ... 517 3 20\n\n1 Servant to the Subhed\u00e1r at Rs. 6 in the first company and at Rs. 4 in each of the other five companies ... 6 0 0.\n\nTotal monthly charge Rs. 523 3 20 or Rs. 521 3 20\n\n\\(^2\\) The details are:\n\n| Pay Details | Rs. q.r. res. |\n|-------------|--------------|\n| Pay of the regiment of 1668 men November (1742) | ... 11,040 2 3 |\n| Ditto of 1499 men July 1743 | ... 10,314 3 86 |\n\nMonthly difference ... 725 2 17\n\nYearly ditto ... 8706 2 4\n\nPay to thirteen companies of Sepoys, the 30th November 1742 ... 3843 0 20\n\nPay to six companies as established July (1743) ... 3132 3 20\n\nMonthly difference ... 710 1 0\n\nYearly ditto ... 8523 0 0\n\nTotal yearly difference for regiment and companies together ... 17,229 2 4\n\n\\(^3\\) Bom. Gov. Consultation 1st July 1743, Pub. Diary 16 of 1743, 162 - 164.\nCaptain William Atkinson is entertained by us to be Captain Lieutenant of the company of artillery and Director of the laboratory at \u00a3100 a year to commence from the 3rd March last (1748) and Mr. Cresswell Maddox to be Lieutenant Fire-worker of the artillery company at \u00a375 a year to commence from the 27th March last. We have lent Captain Atkinson \u00a350 and Lieutenant Maddox \u00a340 upon their enclosed bonds to repay the same out of their growing salary. On the suspension of arms with France their Excellencies the Lords Regent having given orders that any officers private men or others belonging to the company of artillery and the twelve independent companies of soldiers under the command of the Honourable Rear Admiral Boscawen who are willing to enter into the Company's service may have leave to stay in the East Indies, we embrace the opportunity to fill up all our garrisons and to complete our companies of artillery. You are therefore to receive into our service at Bombay according to these directions so many of the officers who may offer their service as you may have vacancies for on our new establishment and all the private men you can who are in health and fit for service, distributing so many of the non-commission officers and private men among the ten companies as will make them complete, taking the first opportunities to send the others to Bengal and Fort St. David in such proportions as (according to the best information you have) they may be of most use, though we judge the greater number ought to remain at Bombay as it is not so convenient for us to send recruits thither. On the good character we have had of Major Goodyere, we offer him the post of Major at Bombay on the same conditions as those on which we have engaged Major Mosman for Bengal. You are forthwith to acquaint Major Goodyere with this our offer, and, in case he accepts of it, you are to let him know the establishment of the military and artillery at Bombay together with the regulations for each and are to give him copies of them for his government. In case you engage any of the commission officers to stay at Bombay, the Governor with Major Goodyere are to take care they be men of good character, brave, prudent, and sober. As it is expected Admiral Boscawen will have had some opportunities of trying the merit of every one under his command, we hope he will be so good as to give you his opinion of such as may offer themselves which we know may be relied upon. As the conduct of the officers in action is seldom concealed it will be no difficult thing to be informed of those who have behaved well or ill. For an encouragement to the non-commission officers and private men to enter into our service we allow you to give them a bounty not exceeding Rs. 40 to each man. In cases where any one enters on his being promoted to the rank of sergeant or corporal, not having served in that rank before, we expect such person to enter without any other bounty than that of his promotion. As to the commission and non-commission officers to fill up the company of artillery, after due regard being had to those belonging to the gun-room who may be equally fit according to our regulations to serve as officers in the company of artillery, you are to choose them out of such of those belonging to His Majesty's company of artillery as may offer their service. We rely on Admiral Boscawen's opinion of their conduct and behaviour under him and on\nMajor Goodyere's judgment as to the posts each man may be fit for. And as many of that company may offer themselves for commission or non-commission officers in the artillery whom you cannot make room for at Bombay, we leave it to the Governor and Major Goodyere to engage them for such posts as they may judge them fit for and direct that they distribute the officers so engaged for the artillery as may be judged most beneficial to the service, taking care to make a reserve for the officers sent from hence, namely William Atkinson to be Captain-Lieutenant and Director of the laboratory and Cresswell Maddox to be first Lieutenant at Bombay and Lawrence Witherington to be Captain-Lieutenant and Director of the laboratory and Henry Learner to be first Serjeant at Fort St. David or Bengal, making also a reserve according to the best of their judgment for such belonging to the gun-rooms at Bengal or Fort St. David as may according to our regulations be equally fit to serve as officers of the artillery. As to the matrosses or others belonging to His Majesty's company of artillery who enter into our service without immediate promotion you are to give them a bounty in like manner as we have ordered for those of the independent companies. All who enter our service are to engage for five years certain, except Major Goodyere who having His Grace the Duke of Montague's leave to stay some time in India to assist in putting the Company's ordnance affairs into order without prejudice to his rank in the royal regiment of artillery, we do not insist on his engaging for any fixed time, so that he may have it in his option to make trial of our service before he resolve to quit His Majesty's. If Major Goodyere determine to stay on either footing his pay, together with all his other allowances, are to commence from the time he shall declare his resolution to stay in India and continue till the time of his embarking to return for Europe. We are putting our garrisons at Fort St. David and Bengal on the same establishment as we now put Bombay and have ordered seven companies to be established at Fort St. David and five at Bengal, besides a company of artillery at each place. If therefore more officers of character as above belonging to His Majesty's troops offer their service than you have vacancies for, the Governor with Major Goodyere (if he declare his intention to stay in India) may engage such a number as according to the best information they can get will be wanting for each place to complete the said companies; and such officers are to be sent to their respective places with the other military by the first good opportunity. But great care is to be taken that none be engaged as officers who having misbehaved in His Majesty's service, are of characters unfit for ours. Major Goodyere is to have a salary of \u00a3250 a year with allowances for diet palanquin and servants equal to one of our Council in which he is to rank as third and constantly remain as such. He is to have the command of a company besides the command of the company of artillery; but he is not to be embarrassed with any other of our affairs but the care of the military.\n\n1 Court to Bombay 17th June 1748 paras 4, 5, 25 - 31, Pub. Dep. Court's Let. Vol. 3 of 1742 - 1751, 177, 179 - 182.\nAs an accompaniment of the above letter the Bombay Government received the following Artillery Regulations: Regulations for the forming disciplining and governing a company of artillery at Bombay and for the better managing and keeping in good order the ordnance, small arms and military stores, tools, utensils, and other habiliments of war. As it is intended to abolish the offices of gunners, gunners' mates, quarter gunners, and gun-room crew, and in lieu of them to substitute a regular company of artillery for the better defence of our settlements in time of danger, and for the training up a regular and disciplined corps for the ordnance service; for the more easy attaining this end, we do hereby order that the following regulations be strictly followed and observed:\n\n1. That the said company of artillery do consist of one second captain, one captain-lieutenant and director of the laboratory, one first lieutenant fireworker, one second lieutenant fireworker, one ensign fireworker, four sergeant bombardiers, four corporal bombardiers, two drummers, and one hundred gunners.\n\n2. That the formation of the company of artillery shall be set about as soon as can be after the receipt of this, but as we hope to engage Major John Goodyere, now chief officer of the Train under the Honourable Admiral Boscawen, to reside abroad in our service on the same conditions and in the same rank we have engaged Majors Mosman and Lawrence, and as we intend him to command the military at Bombay according to the Military Regulations newly made, the formation of the company of artillery is to be suspended till the arrival of the said Major Goodyere, and in the meantime the officers Atkinson and Maddox are to be employed in training, teaching, and disciplining such as may, by the Governor and the first of these officers, be thought fit men according to these regulations for the ordnance service. But on the arrival of Major Goodyere, he, with the approbation of the Governor, shall direct the formation of the company of artillery in the manner most suitable to the service. And in case Major Goodyere should not accept of the proposal made to him by us, or should not arrive at Bombay in the next season after his acceptance of our proposals, the Governor is to appoint the next capable military officer who shall be in our service, at the time it is known that Major Goodyere either refuses to come into our service or that the time for his arrival at Bombay is elapsed, to form the said company of artillery with his approbation according to these regulations, and to act as Captain thereof as well as Commander of all the other military companies, till the arrival of Major Goodyere, or till the Court of Directors order otherwise.\n\n3. The officers and others already engaged for the service of the artillery are to be placed immediately in the several ranks they are engaged for, in which they are to continue till promoted, unless by committing any crime or offence they shall be broken by the judgment of a Court Martial or dismissed by order of the Court of Directors.\n\n4. That such of those belonging to the gun-room as have behaved well and can give proof of their being properly qualified to serve in the artillery be admitted into this company in such rank as on trial the Governor, Major, or next officer of the artillery may judge them fit for.\n\n5. In case any of the officers or others belonging to the company of artillery in His Majesty's service under the command of Admiral Boscawen should obtain leave to stay in the East Indies in order to enter into the service of the Company, they shall be admitted into such vacant employments as the Governor and Major may judge them qualified for. But as it is intended the second captain is to be an engineer, no one is to be admitted into that rank who hath not a competent knowledge and experience in that profession. It is therefore intended to keep that post open till a person so qualified is named by the Court of Directors.\n6. In order to complete the company of artillery as soon as possible, a sufficient number of young healthy ablebodied and most sober men from among the soldiers or others belonging to the other companies are to be taught the exercise of the artillery, among whom it is recommended to have as many as possible who have been bred to the occupation of smiths carpenters or some other trade or business which may be of use in the service of the artillery, as also such as can read and write and seem to have the best capacity to learn the several parts of duty proper for the ordnance service. And as soon as they shall have made a sufficient progress in the artillery exercise they shall be discharged from the companies they belong to and entered into the company of artillery and promoted in it according to their merit. And that there may be always a supply of men proper to recruit the company of artillery, the Major is to take care that a sufficient number of men as much as possible qualified as above be continually instructed in the artillery discipline for that purpose, our intention being that the company of artillery be at all times complete, and in case any person admitted into the company of artillery misbehave so as not to be fit to continue in it, he shall on the judgment of a Court Martial be obliged to serve the remainder of his time in the company he was taken from.\n\n7. So soon as the company of artillery consists of a sufficient number of officers and gunners to do the duty of the gunner and gun-room crew (which it is strongly recommended may be as soon as possible), the office of gunner and of all belonging to the gun-room are to be abolished.\n\n8. On abolishing the offices of gunner and others belonging to the gun-room crew, the Governor is to order the Company's storekeeper, or some other proper person among the Covenanted servants, to act as military storekeeper to whom the gunner is to deliver up all the ordnance, carriages, arms, powder, shot, shells, tools, instruments, and other stores and habiliments of war under his care, which the military storekeeper is to receive and take into his charge, and to make an exact inventory of the same, distinguishing what part thereof is in service and where in service from what remains in store. The Major and next officer of the artillery are to survey the whole and to make report of the condition thereof, and his inventory and survey, signed by the Major, the next officer of the company of artillery, and the storekeeper, are to be laid forthwith before the Council.\n\n9. The military storekeeper is likewise to take possession of the gun-room and different magazines where the military stores have been usually kept, a convenient part whereof is to be set apart for a laboratory of which possession is to be delivered to the director of the laboratory for a place to prepare the military fireworks in, such as making and filling cartridges, fixing shells or grapeshot, preparing fuzes, quick-match carcasses, fireballs, signal rockets, port-fires, or other fireworks of a military nature, or for experiments which may be necessary for the service.\n\n10. The military storekeeper is to keep an exact account of all military stores received into his charge, as also of all he delivers; he is to receive none but by order of the Governor and Council, nor until they be surveyed by the Major and the next officer of the artillery who are to certify the quality of such stores before he receives them. And if any of them prove defective in quality or damaged, report thereof is immediately to be made in writing to the Governor and Council, setting forth the nature degree and cause to the best of their judgment of such defects or damages, that such stores if bought or contracted for in the country may be returned, or if received from Europe or any of the settlements abroad, an account thereof may be transmitted to the Court of Directors and to the President and Council of the place they came from, that the Company may obtain satisfaction for such defects or damages. And all stores issued by the storekeeper shall, if they be returned to him, undergo the same survey and report before he gives his receipt for the same.\n\n11. The military storekeeper is to keep an exact list or register of all ordnance, whether the great guns, mortars, royals, cohorts or patercores, as well brass as iron, belonging to the Company at Bombay, whether they be at the head settlement or at the subordinates, or on board of or belonging to any of\nthe Company's vessels, expressing their several natures, lengths, and weights with their dimensions at the base trunnions and muzzle. The Major and next officer of the artillery are to assist the storekeeper in a general survey of the ordnance in making the register and shall distinctly set down which of them are employed in service and where, and which of them are in store, and if any of them be found unserviceable, it must be particularly remarked against such pieces in the register. Copy of this register signed by the Major, the next officer of the artillery, and the storekeeper, is to be kept by the Governor, and another such copy by the Major or officer commanding the companies, a third by the next officer of the artillery on the spot under the Major, and a fourth to be sent home. At the end of every year a new survey and register of the ordnance is to be made and copies of it made out signed and distributed in like manner.\n\n12. The military storekeeper is to keep under his care all the small arms and other military weapons, as also all the ammunition, tools, and utensils necessary for the service of the artillery or for the small arms, all gun carriages, ingredients for making fireworks, and in general everything necessary for the service of war, except such parts thereof as it may be proper to be kept under the care of the director of the laboratory, of which he is to deliver no part to any person whatsoever without an order of Council. On urgent occasions an order from the Governor or the Major or the officer then commanding the companies shall be a sufficient warrant to him. But he shall make report in writing of what stores he shall have delivered by virtue of such order to the Council the first time it is held, and the director of the laboratory is to act in like manner with relation to the stores under his care.\n\n13. The storekeeper shall keep a set of correct books by way of journal and ledger, in which every article under his care must have a separate head. He is to take care the entries be fairly made and the books continually posted that he may at all times be ready to show to the Governor and Council the state of every or any article he or they want to be informed of. The storekeeper is likewise to keep a book into which he is to enter a copy of every order he shall receive for the delivering or receiving any stores under his care. He shall likewise copy into the same book all letters he shall write or receive relating to them, as also all contracts made for the furnishing of artillery, arms, and military stores together with all surveys and indents.\n\n14. The storekeeper shall at the end of every year make up a general rest or balance of all military appurtenances under his charge in which he is particularly to explain the state of every article, how employed, and what remains in store. The whole is at the same time to be surveyed in the presence of the Major or officer commanding the companies and the next officer of the artillery who are to certify such survey, making the necessary remarks thereon, by distinguishing what is fit for service from what is not, what can be repaired and made fit for service from what ought to be condemned as irreparable or not worth the expense of repairing, that the latter may be sold or otherwise disposed of as the Council may think fit to order. A like rest and survey is to be made at all times on the death resignation or removal of the storekeeper that the former storekeeper or his estate may make good to the Company all deficiencies and that the new storekeeper may at his first entering upon his office know what he is accountable for.\n\n15. The storekeeper is to take care that everything under his charge be kept in repair and in the best manner to prevent damage or waste. When repairs are wanting he is to give immediate notice thereof to the Council that they may give proper orders for them to be made; and when there is a want of stores or other necessaries for the military, he is to make timely application for them by indent to the Council, who if they think proper are to order the same to be supplied if they consist of materials usually bought in the country, or to transmit the said indents to Europe by the first conveyance if they consist of articles usually supplied from thence.\n\n16. When any military stores are received or any expenses are made in repairs or other ways by order of the Council under the direction of the military storekeeper, he shall lay an account certified by him of such stores bought, or\nsuch expenses made monthly or oftener before the Council, who, approving of the same, are to give warrants to the military paymaster for the payment thereof.\n\n17. Copies of all books kept by the military storekeeper are to be sent home yearly in the Company's packets.\n\n18. The director of the laboratory is to have possession of proper places for preparing preserving and safe-keeping of all necessaries proper for the laboratory, and to have an apartment as near it as may be convenient that he may have it the more under his inspection and care. He is to be allowed such assistants as may be necessary for the business of the laboratory, and is from time to time to give notice to the Governor or Major of the number of assistants he may want, who are to appoint them only from among the company of artillery, taking care that none but sober men be chosen for that purpose. But the director of the laboratory may name for his chief assistant on all occasions any one of the said company, not above the degree of serjeant, on whose skill and care he can rely.\n\n19. All such of the company of artillery as are employed as assistants in the laboratory shall during the time of such employment be excused from other duty.\n\n20. The director of the laboratory is to order and regulate the laboratory, and all works which shall be fitted up or prepared therein, and to see them carried on in the most skilful diligent and complete manner, and that there be no waste or embezzlement in the Company's stores and that none be made use of but for the Company's service.\n\n21. The director of the laboratory shall, at the first taking possession of the places assigned for his use, make out an inventory of all stores, ammunition, tools, utensils, ingredients or other necessaries, which he is to sign and acknowledge the receipt of the same from the storekeeper on their being delivered to him. This inventory and receipt he shall deliver to the military storekeeper, who is to return a duplicate thereof signed by himself to the director of the laboratory, who shall enter the same in a register book kept for that and other purposes hereafter mentioned.\n\n22. The director of the laboratory is from time to time to indent for such working tools, utensils, moulds and implements, as also for such ingredients and materials as are used and proper for making, preparing, compounding, and fitting of laboratory stores or military fireworks, whether offensive or defensive or for signals. This indent he is to deliver to the Governor, Major, or officer commanding the companies who is to lay the same before the next Council, who, if they think proper, are to order the storekeeper to deliver the whole or part of the contents of the said indent to the director of the laboratory taking his receipt for the same. But in cases of urgent necessity the order of the Governor or Major to the storekeeper for delivering what may be indented for by the director of the laboratory, shall be sufficient, but the storekeeper is to make report thereof in writing to the Council at their next sitting.\n\n23. The director of the laboratory is always to keep in readiness such ammunition stores or fireworks as may be wanting for the ordinary service of the garrison and to conduct the business of the laboratory in such manner and with such foresight as never to be unprepared at a short warning to furnish the garrison in time with all that may be necessary to defend the place in case of sudden attack or attempt to surprise it. He is to prove all shells to see they be serviceable before they be filled, and if any of them prove unfit for service they are to be kept apart to serve to throw as dead shells at the exercise of the mortars, or to be otherwise disposed of as the Council may order; but they are on no account to be made use of for live-shells in the Company's service, unless on a survey by the Major and next principal officers of the artillery it be judged safe so to do.\n\n24. The director of the laboratory is to keep the key of the laboratory and such other places as may be allotted for him to keep safe the ammunition ingredients fireworks and stores under his charge. He is not to suffer any of them to be opened but with the greatest care to prevent accidents, and no work is to be\nChapter VI.\n\nMilitary.\n\nArtillery Regulations, 1748.\n\ndone in the laboratory but at due hours and by daylight unless in cases of most urgent necessity. And he or his assistant is to take care that every day when any work is done in the laboratory before the door be shut, the shelves, tables, chairs, benches, and floor be swept clean and mopt or swapped with water to prevent accident and that the sweepings be thrown into water and carried out and laid at a proper distance from the buildings.\n\n25. When there is a greater quantity of live shells, or other fireworks or ammunition, in the custody of the director of the laboratory than it may be convenient or safe to remain in the places allotted for them, he is to apply to the Governor, Major, or officer commanding the companies that such part thereof as cannot conveniently or safely be kept by him, may be delivered to the storekeeper, who is to receive and give his receipt for the same. The director of the laboratory is to see that all ammunition fireworks and stores whether in his own keeping or in that of the storekeeper, be bestowed in the best manner in the magazines, to prevent accidents, or their being spoiled by damp or otherwise. And it shall be his duty from time to time to visit all the military magazines, to see the stores are preserved in the best manner. In case he finds any neglect, or that anything is necessary to be done to the magazines for the better preservation of the stores, he is to give notice thereof in writing to the Governor, who is to lay the same forthwith before the Council that they may order the needful to be done.\n\n26. No foreigner whether in our service or not (except such as hath been admitted into it by the Court of Directors) nor no Indian black or person of a mixed breed, nor any Roman Catholic of what nation soever, shall on any pretence be admitted to set foot in the laboratory or any of the military magazines either out of curiosity or to be employed in them, or to come near them so as to see what is doing or contained therein. Nor shall any such persons have a copy or sight of any accounts or papers relating to any military stores whatsoever.\n\n27. The director of the laboratory is to keep a regular account in his register book of the receiving, delivering, and expending of everything under his care, and once in every three months or oftener if necessary shall lay in writing before the Governor and Council, the Major, or officer commanding the companies, a state of the stores under his charge with a demand of such materials, utensils, ingredients and stores as may be necessary for carrying on the current service of the following quarter. At the end of each year such an account shall be made for the whole year, copy whereof must be sent home, as is directed above. With regard to the military storekeeper and as it may so happen that the director of the laboratory may not understand book-keeping well enough to keep these accounts in a clear and distinct manner, if no person proper for this purpose belongs to the company of Artillery, the Governor is on application of the director to appoint one fit for this purpose from among the Company's covenanted servants to assist him who is to be a sober discreet person, and one whose secrecy and fidelity can be depended upon.\n\n28. That the director of the laboratory and his assistant shall diligently carefully and properly instruct in the whole art of making military fireworks for real use in every branch without concealing any part thereof all officers belonging to the artillery and also such officers and cadets belonging to the other companies as are willing and desirous to be instructed; as also such cadets and gunners belonging to the artillery as have the best disposition to be instructed and are employed or intended to be employed in the laboratory or be anyways promoted in the service of the artillery. In this care shall be taken to choose out the soberest and most intelligent persons whose fidelity and attachment to the service of the Company can be most relied on. And all persons instructed in the business of the laboratory shall first receive an order of the Governor and Council, Major, or officer commanding the companies to be so instructed, and shall then be personally employed in the actual making and preparing all sorts of fireworks. For greater certainty that no part thereof is concealed from them the director of the laboratory is to enter fair into a book all receipts of compositions titled with the uses for which they are designed, with the manner of compounding, preparing, fitting, and making up all parts of military fireworks, whether compositions, machines, or cases. And the said book shall be\nan office book to be inspected by all such as are ordered or permitted to attend\nthe laboratory as above, and are willing to be instructed therein, and the Governor\nand Major or officer commanding the companies shall each of them have a dupli-\ncate of the said book. But no other copies either in part or whole shall be given\nto or taken by any other person whatsoever.\n\n29. When labourers are required to work in the military magazines or labora-\ntory they shall be taken from the company or artillery only, and such labour\nshall be deemed as tours of duty. In extraordinary cases where the labour\nmay exceed the duty of the rest of the garrison such a compensation shall be\nmade to the persons so employed as the Governor and Council shall judge\nequitable and reasonable, and the Council is to act in the same manner with\nregard to any artificers belonging to the company of artillery when employed as\nsuch in the service of the artillery.\n\n30. The officers of the company are to take care to teach all persons belonging\nto the said company in the practice of gunnery in general, as the manner of\nserving and firing all sorts of pieces of artillery, whether designed for the throwing\nof shot, shells, stones, grenades, carcasses, or other fireworks. They are to teach\nthem the use and construction of all the instruments used for pointing or levelling\ngreat guns or mortars and to exercise them at convenient times in the hitting\nmarks whether pointblank or at any degree of elevation, together with quick\nfiring for which a proper quantity of ammunition is to be allowed. They are\nlikewise to instruct them in the making gabions and fascines with the manner to\nuse them in making batteries or breastworks as also the manner of making\nintrenchments whether for defence or approaches. They are likewise to teach\nthem the manner to mount or dismount cannon or mortars and to remove them\nfrom place to place at which they are to be exercised at proper times, but so as\nnot to overfatigue them or give them a disgust to the service. But the\nknowledge of this exercise is necessary as in time of danger no other assistance\ncan be got to do this work.\n\n31. The artillery company is likewise to be taught and perfected in the\nmilitary exercise of small arms in all its parts in the same manner the other\ncompanies are taught and is to be reviewed and exercised in common with the\nrest of the garrison. Toward the end of each month, they shall likewise go\nthrough a general exercise of the artillery once in each month at which the\nGovernor or some one of the Council and the Major or officer commanding the\ncompanies shall be present, and twice at least in every year they shall perform\na solemn exercise to fire at marks and throw shells in presence of the Governor\nor second and the Major; and to encourage such who perform the best the\nCouncil may order suitable premiums.\n\n32. The company of artillery is to do garrison duty in common and in propor-\ntion with the other troops and so many officers and gunners are to mount\ndaily as may perform the duty on the platforms and bastions as was done by the\ngun-room crew heretofore. And in all respects the company of artillery is to be\nemployed as is practised in His Majesty's garrisons of Gibraltar and Minorca.\n\n33. No deserter from any nation whatever is to be entertained in the com-\npany of artillery, not even a British subject, who may have once deserted from\nHis Majesty's or the Company's service, although he may have been pardoned for\nhis desertion, nor any Roman Catholic. And if any person belonging to the com-\npany of artillery marry a Roman Catholic, or his wife become a Roman Catholic\nafter marriage, such person shall be immediately dismissed from the company\nof artillery and be obliged to serve the remainder of his time in one of the other\ncompanies or be removed to some other of the Company's settlements to serve it\nout there if the Council think fit.\n\n34. The Major, with the approbation of the Governor, shall regulate the cloth-\ning for the artillery which is to be of blue cloth out of the Company's warehouses\nwith red cuffs and facings and brass buttons with a cap or hat which shall be\nprovided by the Major and paid for by the company in the same manner as\nordered in the 22nd and 23rd articles of the Military Regulations. And the said\ncompany shall be armed in the manner most suitable to the climate and the\nnature of their service.\nChapter VI.\nMilitary.\nArtillery Regulations, 1748.\n\n35. The company of artillery is to be paid in the same manner by the military paymaster as directed by the 17th, 18th, and 19th articles of the Military Regulations.\n\n36. In case of the death of any person belonging to the company of artillery, the effects of the deceased are to be taken care of as directed in the 25th article of the Military Regulations.\n\n37. The commission and non-commission officers and gunners belonging to the company of artillery are to be promoted, broken, punished, or confined according to the several Regulations made for the Military in the Company's service at Bombay, with this distinction that where an officer or gunner belonging to the artillery is to be tried, so many of the officers belonging to the artillery as conveniently can, shall be of the Court Martial. And in all tours of duty the officers of the companies and of the artillery company are to roll together according to their ranks and seniority so far as is consistent with the nature of their different services, and are to have the same military honours done them, and those who serve in the artillery may be promoted in the other companies in case of vacancies, as may those who serve in the other companies be promoted to vacancies in the artillery company, but not unless they have made themselves completely masters of the business and service of the artillery in all its branches, and give good proofs of their knowledge and experience therein to the satisfaction of the Governor and Major or officer commanding the companies.\n\n38. All the posts where cannon or mortars are mounted or intended to be mounted shall be visited once in every week or oftener by one of the commission officers belonging to the company of artillery who is carefully to inspect the artillery at those posts, that the ordnance with their carriages and other appurtenances be kept in the best order. And if he observe any damage, decay, waste, or embezzlement therein, whether from neglect, the injury of weather, or other causes, he is to make immediate report thereof in writing to the Major who is to acquaint the Governor therewith, that such damages or waste may be forthwith remedied, and means used to prevent the like for the future. He is at the same time carefully to observe if there be any damage or decay in any of the fortifications or works and to make report thereof in like manner through the Major to the Governor that they may be forthwith repaired.\n\n39. The above regulations are to be strictly complied with in every article and made public in such manner that no one may be ignorant of their contents so far as he is concerned therein. And as it may be proper to make farther regulations for the company of artillery at Bombay than can at present be foreseen, more especially with relation to detachments sent to the subordinate garrisons or on parties, it is hereby left to the discretion of the Governor and Council, with the advice of the Major or officer commanding the companies, to make such farther regulations. These they may from time to time amend or alter for the good of the service, provided such further regulations alterations or amendments be not contrary to or inconsistent with the above regulations.\n\n40. It is ordered that the company of artillery in the East India Company's service consist as follows. (1) To reside where the Company's service may require: First Captain and Chief Engineer at \u00a3200 a year. (2) To reside at the chief settlement or its subordinates: 1 Second Captain and Second Engineer at \u00a3150; 1 Captain-Lieutenant and Director of the Laboratory at \u00a3100; 1 First Lieutenant Fireworker at \u00a375; 1 Second Lieutenant Fireworker at \u00a360; 1 Third Lieutenant Fireworker at \u00a350; 4 Sergeant Bombardiers at 2s. a day; 4 Corporal Bombardiers at 1s. 6d.; 100 Gunners at 1s.; and 2 Drummers at 1s. Total 115 men exclusive of the Chief Engineer.\n\nThe same despatch from the Court of Directors (dated 17th June 1748) was accompanied by a copy of the following regulations for forming disciplining and governing the military at Bombay:\n\n1 Accompaniment to Court's Letter 17th June 1748. Enclosures to Court's Letters Vol. 7, 179-193.\n1. That the Governor make his constant residence at the Fort that he may have the military more immediately under his eye and that he may be, the better able to judge of the conduct and capacity of the officers and soldiers. It is not by this intended to restrain the Governor from being absent on the customary visits or tours in the country for health or diversion.\n\n2. That upon the Major's arrival at Bombay the companies now there and at the subordinate settlements be formed into ten companies consisting of one captain, one lieutenant, one ensign, four sergeants, four corporals, three drummers, and seventy private men each, and that in case there be any surplus men, they be divided equally among the companies until the designed establishment of a company of artillery can take place, when a number of the properest men for the service of the artillery are to be draughted from the companies in order to complete the company of artillery. The lieutenant of the Major's company is to be captain-lieutenant and is to rank as captain. If there be at the forming the companies a greater number of sergeants, corporals, drummers, and musicians than are necessary, they shall be reduced to form the new establishment, but for their encouragement they shall be provided for in their former ranks if qualified for them as vacancies happen.\n\n3. That all vacancies of companies that shall happen be named appointed and commissioned by the Governor and Council, but that subaltern officers under the degree of captain be named appointed and commissioned by the Governor only.\n\n4. That all officers be promoted by seniority unless very good reason to the contrary be given to the Governor in writing; the Major or officer commanding the ten companies to recommend to vacancies when they happen to be approved or not by the Governor. But every captain to recommend to all vacancies of sergeants corporals and drummers that may happen in their respective companies which are to be approved or not by the Major or military commanding officer of the ten companies.\n\n5. That all commissions given by the Court of Directors continue in force without any fresh commissions to be issued by the Governor or Council who are to grant their commissions as above only in case of vacancies happening in the country by decease, dismission, resignation, or otherwise.\n\n6. That the entire discipline of the ten companies be under the direction command and inspection of the Major or commanding military officer, subordinate nevertheless to the Governor or next in Council in the Governor's absence. And all orders to the military shall be conveyed through the Major or adjutant unless in cases of urgent necessity.\n\n7. That for encouragement to the adjutant in the punctual execution of his office, he have the rank and pay of lieutenant and be promoted according to his seniority as above mentioned, but when promoted to the rank of captain, to quit the office of adjutant.\n\n8. The Major, commanding officer, or adjutant shall every morning at an hour appointed wait upon the Governor or in his absence on the next in Council to receive the word and daily orders and shall at the same time make a report in writing to the Governor or in his absence to the next in Council of all irregularities and accidents that have happened among the military, whether at the barracks or other quarters, or in or about the town or other places. Also of the names and state of the sick in the hospital or elsewhere, and of any abuses relative to them, and for his better information in this respect the Major or commanding officer shall take care to appoint proper officers to visit the sick once or twice daily. He is likewise to make report in the same manner of all detachments sent abroad or returned, signifying the names of the officers and soldiers belonging to such detachments. He shall also report all just complaints the officers and soldiers may have to make against one another.\n\n9. That after the Governor or in his absence the next in Council hath delivered the public daily orders for the garrison, the Major or officer commanding the companies shall give such orders as he shall find necessary for their discipline and good government which are to be obeyed by all officers and soldiers. All orders issued by the Governor or in his absence by the next in Council and\nby the Major or officer commanding the companies are to be entered fair in a book to be kept for that purpose by the adjutant.\n\n10. That the Governor at relieving the guard shall have a report made to him immediately in writing by the officer of the guard relieved, of all occurrences that past during the time he was upon guard, to which shall be added all new orders relating to the troops which shall have been issued by the Major or commanding officer during that guard.\n\n11. That all outposts or stations of the military be constantly relieved at stated times, that every commission, non-commission officer, and soldier may have their turns upon all duties and services, and that none may grow negligent or forgetful of their duty by too long absence from the main body.\n\n12. No officer or soldier shall be excused from doing his duty, but in case of sickness or inability or with leave of the Major or officer commanding the companies, and the approbation of the Governor. Nor shall any one hire another to do his duty for him without such leave and approbation on pain of being punished as the next court martial shall think proper. Every non-commission officer conniving at such excusing or hiring of duty shall be reduced for it and every commission officer knowing and allowing such practices in the Company's service shall be punished according to the judgment of a court martial.\n\n13. That no man among the military be allowed to keep a public house for the retailing of strong liquors, or to retail them or be concerned in the retailing them in any manner whatsoever. But if the Governor and Council think fit to permit any military man on his request to keep a public house, or to get his living by his trade or profession, they shall discharge such person from the military on condition that he remain at the settlement till his time be expired, and that he be ready to take up arms and assist in common with the military in the defence of the place, or to go on any expedition. During this time of service he shall be allowed pay and not otherwise. But this shall not extend to prevent any one's re-entering into the company he was discharged from, on his giving up the retailing or being concerned in the retailing of strong liquors or the carrying on his trade or profession.\n\n14. That no commission officer shall be broken or degraded unless by order of the Court of Directors, without a fair full and impartial hearing before the Governor and Council. Where the offence is of a military nature, the Major or officer commanding the companies with two Captains shall be members of council on such trial, and shall judge and determine in common with the Governor and Council in all military offences according to the rules articles and custom of war in His Majesty's Service, conforming in this respect to the powers granted to the Company by their charter and for the better maintaining of discipline and good order. All offences of a military nature committed by the non-commission officers or soldiers, shall be tried by a Court Martial, consisting of a captain and four subaltern officers to be appointed by the Major or officer commanding the ten companies, after the nature of a Regimental Court Martial. They shall try and examine in a fair and impartial manner all military crimes such as disobedience of orders, neglect of duty, disturbance in barracks or quarters, or upon guard or party or elsewhere, and shall give their opinion according to the rules articles and custom of war in the manner above mentioned. Their opinion is to be confirmed by the Governor or in his absence by the next of Council before it is put in execution. Upon inflicting punishment upon European soldiers, it shall be done by Europeans only, but no part of this clause or any other in these Regulations shall be construed to deprive the Governor and Council of the power to suspend any military person of what rank soever for any offence whether of a civil or military nature in cases where they are in doubt as to the nature or degree of the offence or of the proper punishment for it. And such suspension shall remain if they think fit, till they have the determination of the Court of Directors upon the offence of which they are hereby ordered to send home a full and just account with their or the Court Martial's opinion upon it by the first returning ships.\n\n15. That no captain or other officer shall, on pain of being dismissed from the service, demand or receive directly or indirectly any present, fee, or reward\nfor the admission or promotion or recommendation of any person to be promoted in the military service.\n\n16. That no man shall be discharged from the military company before his time is out, but by order of the Governor and Council. Those who have served their full time shall be discharged, unless they engage for a farther time.\n\n17. That the Governor shall appoint one of the Company's covenanted servants to be military paymaster, who shall at the beginning of each month after the close of the general muster, pay to each captain or officer commanding the company (unless the Governor and Council have good reasons to the contrary) the pay of the company which is to be issued weekly to the non-commission officers and private men, or in such payments as may be most proper for the service and most advantageous to the men to whom the pay is due. The Major or officer commanding the companies is to oblige them to regularity in their diet by messing or such other methods as the nature of the country and service will admit.\n\n18. The Governor or Second in Council shall make a general review or muster of the military and see them exercised once towards the latter end of each month, or oftener when the season will permit it.\n\n19. That the muster rolls of each company shall be signed by the Captain and subalterns, and certified by the Governor or Second whosoever shall have made the review, as also by the Major or officer commanding the companies, and then they shall be laid before the Council in time for approbation before the next payment.\n\n20. That a separate list be made up to the first of January and sent home yearly in the Company's packets, of each military company, in which shall be inserted the name of each person received from England or any of the Company's settlements abroad, as also of such as may be enlisted setting forth what nation they are of and specifying the times of their arrival or enlisting as also the times of every man's discharge death or desertion.\n\n21. No commission or non-commission officer or soldier put under an arrest or confined and continued so above six hours, shall be discharged or cleared but by the Governor or Council. And any officer detaining a person under arrest or confinement more than six hours without making a report in writing to the Governor, or in his absence to the next in Council, shall be broken unless such person be taken into arrest in the night time, in which case report thereof shall be made to the Governor or in his absence to the next in Council early in the morning.\n\n22. That each Captain have the clothing of his own company and that for regularity the Major or officer commanding the companies shall appoint a pattern coat and hat or cap suitable to the climate, to be approved by the Governor and to which every Captain shall conform at the first making new clothes, and that the Major shall appoint the uniforms for the commission officers to be approved of by the Governor. Great care is to be had by the Governor and Major that the clothing be not too expensive either to the officers or private men, and that the stoppages from non-commission officers and private men be no more than is reasonable and that it be made gradually and in such equal parts as to reimburse the Captains from new clothing to new clothing for his first cost with a moderate profit thereon, making an equitable allowance for the losses he may sustain by deserters carrying away their clothing or from other accidents.\n\n23. That the Governor and Major or officer commanding the companies shall take care that the captains do justice to their non-commissioned officers and soldiers in their clothing and pay; that they be new clothed once in two years with English cloth out of the Company's warehouses; and that they nor the subaltern officers do not oppress them, and that the soldiers be kept to a strict discipline and subordination.\n\n24. That a sufficient quantity of ammunition shall be delivered for disciplining the companies, for which the adjutant shall give receipts and deliver\nin accounts of the consumption thereof to the person who hath charge of the ammunition to be so delivered.\n\n25. That upon the death of any commission officer unless the deceased has an heir at age upon the spot, or hath by will appointed an executor at hand to discharge the trust, the Major or officer commanding the companies shall authorize and appoint three commission officers, one of whom to be a Captain, to take a true and exact inventory of the effects of the deceased, and to sell the same at public outcry at such time as the Major or officer commanding the companies shall appoint. On giving the customary notice thereof the three officers ordered for this service are, out of the produce of the effects of the deceased, to pay forthwith the funeral charges and all just debts due from the deceased, and to make up and sign an account of the same in which no commission is to be charged. The Major or officer commanding the companies is to examine these accounts and finding them just, is to certify them accordingly, and deposit them for the use of the heirs in the Secretary's office. The balance due to the heirs is to be immediately paid for their benefit into the Company's cash. And if the officers ordered as above for this service refuse neglect or delay to perform it in a just and fair manner, the Major or officer commanding the companies shall forthwith make complaint against such officer or officers so refusing neglecting or delaying to the Governor and Council, and bring him or them to a court martial to be punished according to the nature and degree of the offence. If any of the officers so complained against appear guilty of any fraudulent practices, or of having embezzled or misapplied any part of the deceased's effects or estate, they shall be obliged forthwith to make restitution, and shall be rendered incapable of serving the Company in any station whatsoever. In case of the decease of any non-commission officer or soldier, the captain of the company to which the deceased did belong shall perform this service in the above manner, making report thereof to the Major or officer commanding the companies.\n\n26. In case of the death or desertion of any non-commission officer or soldier, the captain of the company to which such officer or soldier did belong, is forthwith to see that the arms accoutrements and ammunition delivered to such non-commissioned officer or soldier be returned to the proper officer, or that they be immediately paid for, preferably to all other debts out of the effects if any can be found belonging to the person deceased or deserted.\n\n27. The above regulations are to be strictly complied with in every article and made public in such manner that no one may be ignorant of their contents so far as he is concerned therein. And as it may be proper to make farther regulations for the military at Bombay than can at present be foreseen to be necessary, more especially with relation to detachments sent as garrisons to the subordinate settlements, or to escort the Company's effects, it is hereby left to the prudence and discretion of the Governor and Council, with the advice of the Major or officer commanding the companies to make such farther regulations which they may from time to time amend or alter for the good of the service, provided such farther regulations be not contrary to or inconsistent with the above.\n\n28. It is ordered that the garrison for the settlement at Bombay be formed into ten regular companies under the command of a Major after the following manner. To be paid at 2 shillings and 6 pence a rupee:\n\n| Position                  | Pay per Year |\n|---------------------------|--------------|\n| Major-Captain and Commander| \u00a3250         |\n| Captain-Lieutenant        | 5s. a day    |\n| Ensign                    | 4s.          |\n| Adjutant                  | 5s.          |\n| Serjeants                 | at 1s. 8d.   |\n| Corporals                 | at 1s. 2d.   |\n| Drum Major                | 1s. 8d.      |\n| Drummers                  | at 1s. 2d.   |\n| Private Sentinels         | at 10d.      |\n\n85\nAND ISLAND.\n\nSecond Company.\n\n1 Captain ... ... ... ... 10s. a day.\n1 Lieutenant ... ... ... ... 5s. \"\n1 Ensign ... ... ... ... 4s. \"\n4 Serjeants ... ... ... at 1s. 8d. \"\n4 Corporals ... ... ... \" 1s. 2d. \"\n3 Drummers ... ... ... \" 1s. 2d. \"\n70 Private Sentinels ... ... ... \" 10d. \"\n\nEight companies more at the same strength.

The whole to consist of Europeans as soon as they can be completed.\u00b9\n\nAt a Consultation of the 28th April 1749 the Board observe regarding the above regulations and arrangements: Major Goodyere who was to have had the command both of the military and artillery died at Fort St. David on the 24th December last. As our next military officer, Captain William Gibbs, is married to a Roman Catholic, the military and artillery cannot be kept under him, this being contrary to the Honourable Company's express orders, although he is in all other respects so well qualified as his long service and the good discipline he has always kept the military in, fully shew. As we have no one here that is duly qualified as Major Goodyere was, to be at the head of both, it is agreed that the military be continued under command of Captain William Gibbs as Captain Commandant with the allowance of \u00a3250 a year intended for the Major and the command of the first of the ten companies; and that the nine next officers to him being Lieutenants Rich, Mostyn, Sterling, Gouin, Lane, Andrews, Stanton, Cameron, and Forbes be appointed to be Captains and Commanders of the other nine companies for the service of this island and all the settlements subordinate thereto. Into these companies the topasses are to be incorporated as are a suitable number of lascars into the artillery company which for the present is to be continued under command of Captain Hugh Cameron. That the place of Second Captain and Second Engineer be kept vacant agreeable to the Honourable Company's orders. That Mr. Atkinson, sent out by the Honourable Company in quality of Captain-Lieutenant and director of the laboratory, be continued for the present as such but have no trust committed to him on account of his behaviour here as well as on board the Dodington, noticed in Consultation the 29th ultimo, for which it became unavoidable to confine him to the fort where he is now in a regimen under the care of the hospital surgeons. As to the other places of first second and third lieutenant fire-workers in the artillery, as likewise the lieutenants in the military, the Governor has nominated and appointed such as are of good characters and well experienced in their business. Directed that the general storekeeper for the time being be appointed military storekeeper; also that the land paymaster for the time being be military paymaster, who is ordered to pay the officers and people at the rates now established by the Honourable Company. But that, instead of paying the amount of the several companies to the respective captains thereof, he is directed to pay the people monthly in the manner\n\n\u00b9 Accompaniment to Court's Letter 17th June 1748, Enclosures to Court's Letters Vol. 7, 194-201.\nheretofore practised, taking care no other stoppages be made than as formerly settled and that himself or assistant be always present at the pay table till the whole payments are finished which is on no account whatever to be dispensed with.\\(^1\\)\n\nAs on forming these military and artillery companies a sufficient number of Europeans were not available, recourse was had to Fort St. David. A Bombay Consultation of the 2nd May 1749 records: There being a want of 14 serjeants 11 corporals and 260 private sentinels, also 20 gunners for completing the military and artillery companies with Europeans conformable to the Honourable Company's last regulations, the Board resolved that the President and Council at Fort St. David be requested to enlist that number out of the artillery company and twelve independent companies of soldiers under command of Admiral Boscawen on the terms prescribed by the Honourable Company in their commands to this Presidency by Dodington.\\(^2\\)\n\nAbout a year later a letter from the Court of Directors of the 7th March 1750 was received, intimating their appointment of Major William Mackenzie to be Major of Bombay. The Court write: We have entertained Major William Mackenzie, an able experienced officer, to be Major of Bombay. He is to be third of Council and always remain as such, and to have the command and clothing of one of the companies agreeable to the 22nd and 23rd paragraphs of the military regulations sent by Dodington, dated 17th June 1748. For all these stations his salary is to be two hundred and fifty pounds a year, with the same appointments for diet servants and palanquin as third of our Council. These salaries and appointments, which are to commence on his arrival at Bombay, are to be in lieu of all other allowances whatsoever. But notwithstanding he is appointed third of Council, he is not to be embarrassed with any other affairs than the care of the military, nor is he to have any additional pay for any service or duty in regulating or commanding the artillery company.\\(^3\\)\n\nAt a Consultation of the 21st September 1750, on perusing Major Mackenzie's Commission, the Board observe: Read Major Mackenzie's Commission from the Honourable Company appointing him Major and Commandant of their regiment of military at this place, also Captain of the first company of soldiers, as likewise that of artillery. As by this appointment Captain William Gibbs, late commandant of the military and captain of the first company, will be without any command, it is ordered that he take charge of Mahim fort at the end of the month and that Captain Rich come down to Bombay.\\(^4\\)\n\nAfter his arrival Major Mackenzie wrote the following letter to Government on the 30th October 1750: The military instructions delivered me by the Honourable Company's Secretary and now in my possession I ever looked upon as my articled establishment, and I am firm in my opinion it is the Secretary's mistake in drawing up the Lord\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Bom.

These were the appointments ordered Captain Goodyere when he was named Major for Bombay and less were never offered me. Less I could not accept as Mr. Goodyere's rank in His Majesty's service was inferior to mine.\n\nOn reading the above letter the Board ordered that due notice be taken of this letter to the Honourable Company in our letter by the Boscawen.\n\nThe rule laid down in the Company's military and artillery regulations of 1748 paying the men proved inconvenient. On this subject the Bombay Diary of the 29th May 1750 has the following entry: Under the 27th October last we transmitted the Chief and factors at Tellicherry the Honourable Company's military regulations which direct that, after the muster rolls at the beginning of the month are regularly passed in Council, the pay of each company be given to the respective commanders for them to pay the men. This method we understand was practised at their settlement some time before the said regulations came out. As the same gives a large latitude to the Captains to make what stoppages they please out of the men's pay, and as several instances have been known of the poor soldiers having been oppressed by such means, the Board have thought proper to deviate from those regulations of the Honourable Company at this place and to order that as heretofore accustomary at this Presidency and its subordinates the military and artillery companies be regularly paid by the military paymaster at the beginning of every month, and that he see there be no other stoppages made out of the soldiers' pay on account of their officers than according to the standing rules of the garrison. This we esteem the most proper method to prevent the private men being oppressed. It is therefore agreed that the Chief and factors at Tellicherry be directed, if they have not done it already, to put the same in practice again at their settlement and continue it in future and that they suffer no means whatever to be made use of that may be oppressive to the soldiers.\n\nThe Bombay Diary of the 4th January 1751 records the following court-martial: This morning the Honourable the President and Council with Captain Gibbs and Lane sat as a Court-martial on the trials of Lieutenants Henry Townraw who was convicted of bribery and Samuel Levick of misbehaviour to his Commandant Major Mackenzie. The Court, after a due hearing of their offences, unanimously resolved that the former be broke as a commission officer and that, as it is his first offence, the latter do ask the Major's pardon at the head of the regiment.\n\n---\n\n1 Major Mackenzie to Government 30th Oct. 1750, Pub.

Consultation 4th Jan. 1751, Pub. Diary 24 of 1751, 8.\nWith a view to check the spread of venereal diseases among the military and seamen, on the 28th January 1751 the Bombay Council passed the following orders: The military and seamen of late frequently contracting the venereal disease and the surgeons having no allowance from them for the performance of such a disagreeable cure, the Board agreed that in future the surgeons be allowed half a month's pay for the cure of any of the military or seamen of the said disorder according to their respective stations. This it is to be hoped will be a means to prevent in some measure their running into such excess.\n\nThe Court of Directors' letter to Bombay of the 4th March 1752 runs: We acquainted you by the Durington that we intended to send for the service of Bombay Presidency an entire company of Protestant Swiss soldiers to consist of one hundred and forty men, commission and non-commission officers included. We are now to acquaint you that the said company is embarked on the ships Royal Duke and Dodington under the command of Alexander de Zeigler Esquire, to whom we have granted a commission, as we have likewise to the first and second lieutenants and ensign, for whose names we refer to the muster rolls. The pay of the captain, officers, and private men is to be exactly the same as the rest of our forces upon the present military establishment. You are to take notice that by the abovementioned agreement the captain had the liberty to name and appoint the several subaltern officers in the company to be formed and commanded by him; these officers are afterwards to succeed according to their standing and seniority unless good and sufficient reasons shall appear to the contrary. What other matters are engaged for, we refer to the agreement before-mentioned. Upon the arrival of each detachment you must make a particular enquiry into the usage they have met with in their passage and give us an impartial account thereof in your next advices. We are determined to show a suitable resentment for any ill behaviour to them, which the commanders are fully apprised of by a particular clause in their instructions. It is most earnestly recommended to you to cultivate and preserve a good harmony between our other forces and the said Swiss. And to prevent all distinction you must see that the clothing is in all respects exactly uniform. We have sent on the Pelham about seventy English recruits to be incorporated in the several companies at Bombay Presidency. Agreeable to your repeated requests for subaltern officers we have appointed the several persons hereafter named to serve in our military: Mr. James Ogilvy to be a lieutenant and to succeed to the command of a company upon the first vacancy that shall happen after his arrival at Bombay, excepting in the company of Swiss; Messrs. Hugh McKie, Gilbert Carter, and John Bakie to be lieutenants, and Peregrine Cruikshanks, Newton Burr, and Thomas Deane to be ensigns, who are to be promoted according to their behaviour. The pay of all the abovementioned persons is to commence upon their arrival at Bombay agreeable to their respective stations.\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Consultation 28th Jan. 1751, Pub.

Upon the receipt of this you are to discharge them from our service and send such as are British subjects to England as we will on no account permit of their continuing in India.\\(^1\\)\n\nAs regards militia, the same letter directs: A regular militia formed of the inhabitants on Bombay may at all times be of service, and upon extraordinary occasions of infinite use to us. You must therefore direct the Major to form a scheme for the purpose, which when you have well digested and rendered practicable, you are to carry it into execution forthwith.\\(^2\\)\n\nTo prevent the theft of warlike stores from the fortifications, the Board passed the following orders on the 23rd January 1753: Great complaints having been made of late to the President that balls and other warlike stores are frequently stolen from the fortifications which there is much reason to suspect is encouraged by the shopkeepers of the Bazar, and this pernicious practice being of very evil tendency to the welfare and safety of the island, and whereas proclamation was made the 20th October 1740 prohibiting the inhabitants of the island to deal in warlike stores, he proposes that a publication be issued strictly forbidding any person whatever from dealing in warlike stores (sword-blades excepted) and that all persons possessed of such stores deliver in a list of them within 25 days from the date hereof that their value be ascertained and paid for by the Honourable Company. Should any one presume to act in contempt of this order, they shall be fined at the discretion of the Board, half of the fine to go to the informer and half to the Honourable Company, or in case of insufficiency to suffer corporal punishment. This proposal is unanimously approved and ordered to be put in execution.\\(^3\\)\n\nIn March 1753 Captain Gilbert Carter represented the great want of cannon and shells for the out-forts and town wall. He writes: This island is considered the arsenal to three or more subordinate settlements on this side of India. It is also frequently called upon by the Presidencies of Bengal and Madras for supplies of gunpowder and other ammunitions of war. It appears to me from the practice of the cannon and mortars for the instruction and improvement of the artillery company that there is great want of both those articles and likewise of shot and shells. Very few except those lately received from Europe are fit for use. They have suffered so extremely by remaining a long time in the country exposed to the inclemencies of the weather that they are so much diminished from the first sizes that I am obliged to paste cap paper over those used in the flats where the artillery company is exercised. Thirty-seven cannon are wanting to fill up the embrasures, 53 mortars and howitzers are destitute of proper shells to fit them as will appear by the schedule hereto annexed; in general there is a great want of cannon, there not being sufficient for the service of\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Court to Bombay 4th Mar. 1752 para 119, P.

There is a foundry here and a founder, but he cannot cast any mortars exceeding $4\\frac{1}{2}$ inches. On perusing the above report on the 1st March 1753 the Board ordered that copy of it be transmitted to the Court of Directors.\n\nThe Court considered the artillery of Bombay one of its main supports in times of trouble. In their letter of the 14th March 1753 they intimated the following modifications of their detailed instructions of the 17th June 1748: Being fully satisfied how great a share of our dependance must in case of troubles be on the artillery, and upon the skill and ability of the people appropriated to its service, we have therefore determined to complete the artillery company at our Presidency of Bombay, agreeable to the following establishment in lieu of that sent you by the ships Somerset and Pelham, dated the 17th June 1748. That is to say the artillery company is to consist of:\n\nOne Captain at two hundred pounds a year.\nOne First Lieutenant at one hundred pounds.\nOne Second Lieutenant at ninety pounds.\nOne Third Lieutenant at ninety pounds.\nSix Sergeants at two shillings a day each.\nSix Corporals at one shilling and eight pence each.\nThirty Bombardiers at one shilling and eight pence each.\nThirty Gunners at one shilling and six pence each.\nForty Mattrosses at one shilling each.\nTwo Drummers at one shilling each.\n\nIn all other respects the regulations and rules laid down in the before-mentioned establishment of the 17th June 1748, so far as is consistent with this new one, are to remain in force.\n\nIn the same letter of the 14th March 1753 the Court intimate the appointment made by them of Sir James Foulis to be Commander of all the forces at the Presidency of Bombay. They write: We have entertained Sir James Foulis, Bart., a gentleman of great reputation and abilities as well as an experienced and good officer to be Major of our garrison at Bombay, Commander of all the forces at the Presidency of Bombay, and Third of Council, and to remain Third without rising to a superior rank therein. He is also to have the command and clothing of one of the companies agreeable to the 22nd paragraph of the military regulations dated the 17th of June 1748. And for all these stations his salary is to be two hundred and fifty pounds a year, with the usual appointments for diet servants and palanquin as Third in Council, to commence on his arrival at Bombay, which salary and appointments are to be in lieu of all other allowances whatsoever for the said several stations of Major, Commander of our forces, Third of Council, and Captain of a company. Notwithstanding Sir James Foulis is appointed Third in Council, he is not to be embarrassed with any other affairs than the care of the military.\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov.

You are accordingly to direct the Major to set about this service immediately, and he is to be assisted therein by the Captain of the artillery company, and any other persons whatsoever that may be thought necessary.\n\nAgreeably to the above order on the 4th September the Bombay Government directed Sir James Foulis to survey all the ordnance and warlike stores, and Jaques de Funk Esq. to visit all the fortifications agreeable to the 79th paragraph.\n\nIn consequence of the above order, on the 22nd November 1753, Sir James Foulis furnished a general abstract of cannon, mortars, shot, shells, and gunpowder in the Castle, on the town wall, and on the out-forts of Bombay.

The Bombay Diary of the 14th August records: The Honourable Company having recommended to us to erect barracks for accommodating officers and preserving the health and good order of the soldiers, it being impossible to enlarge the present barracks the military paymaster and clerk of the works are directed to pitch upon some proper place for this purpose, and lay an estimate of the expense before the Board.\n\nMilitary Pay, 1753.\n\nThe method practised for some time past of advancing the military one month\u2019s pay being attended with many inconveniences and the Honourable Company being frequently liable to suffer by the military dying in their debt, the Board at a Consultation of the 28th December 1753 resolved that the practice be discontinued. That the change may not immediately fall hard on the military, the paymaster is ordered to advance two-thirds of their pay this month and so proportion the rest until it is brought to the former footing excepting the Swiss company which are to be paid daily according to the practice in Europe.\n\nCourts Martial, 1754.\n\nIn a letter of the 5th April 1754 the Court write; An act having passed this present Sessions of Parliament for empowering the Company to hold Courts Martial upon military people in the East Indies and at St. Helena, we transmit you by the ship Hardwicke a separate packet containing the necessary powers and instructions together with a letter\n\n---\n\n1 Bom.

Court's Letters Vol. 4 of 1752-1756, 173.}\n\nOn the subject of military irregularities in economy and discipline at Bombay the Court continue: We are well assured that there are great irregularities in the military economy at Bombay as well in point of discipline as in many other particulars. But as Sir James Foulis is so good a judge of the duty of a soldier and will very soon observe in what manner our forces may be managed so as to be most useful to us, we shall expect to hear that attending to his representations and advice you have rectified all abuses among our troops, and in all respects put them on such a footing as may best answer our intentions, and the great expense we are at in maintaining them. The officers sent out last year and those proceeding this year being gentlemen of experience in their profession, will greatly contribute to the introduction and constant practice of an exact military discipline. We have been acquainted that during the time Captain Rich acted as Commandant of all our troops he left the captains no authority over them, that all military discipline (without which no due subordination can subsist) was utterly neglected, continual drunkenness encouraged by being left entirely unpunished, no orders ever given for exercising the soldiers in the management of arms and in military evolutions, no care taken for obliging them to keep their arms and accoutrements clean and in good order, and the guards very irregularly relieved. These are part of the abuses we complain of and which we particularize that they may be immediately remedied. For these reasons we direct, in case of the death or absence of Sir James Foulis, that Captain Rich be not commandant.\\footnote{Court to Bombay 5th April 1754, paras 140, 141, Pub. Dep. Court's Letters Vol. 4 of 1752-1756, 174-175.}\n\nThe following extract from the same letter, 5th April 1754, shows the importance the Court attached to an efficient militia: We observe by a letter from Captain Rich, dated 20th November 1752, at that time commandant of our forces, that, agreeable to our orders, a militia had been formed of the native inhabitants of Bombay and Mahim, but that it would be a work of time to bring them into proper discipline. As we have this affair much at heart we earnestly recommend it to you to use every method for making the inhabitants at all times fit to perform such military duty as may be useful on any emergent service. You are at the same time to take particular care that the people may not be oppressed, and that the duty be rendered as little burdensome as possible.\\footnote{Court to Bombay 5th April 1754, para 142, Pub.

Court's Letters Vol. 4 of 1752-1756, 175-176.}\n\nIn the same year (1754) about the close of September were received at Bombay the Court's commands of the 15th March and 5th April, regarding the passing of the Mutiny Act. On their reperusal on the 30th September the Bombay Council resolved that to-morrow morning at nine o'clock the Mutiny Act in regard to the Honourable Company's\n\nChapter VI.\n\nMilitary Irregularities, 1754.\n\nMilitia, 1754.\n\nMutiny Act, 1754.\nforces be published, and that we consult with the military officers for regulating the form in the most solemn manner.\\(^1\\) Of the form of publication the Bombay Diary of the 1st October 1754 records: At nine o'clock in the forenoon the regiment being drawn up before the Fort Gate, the Governor and Council and the principal inhabitants attending, the Secretary, mounted on horseback, read His Majesty's most gracious Act of Parliament for the punishment of mutiny and desertion and for the better disciplining the Honourable Company's forces. This being ended, the military paymaster asked the officers and soldiers if they were willing to serve the Honourable Company on those terms to which they all cheerfully assented by giving three hurras.\\(^2\\)\n\nIn a letter of the 4th November 1754, Mr. C. Taylor, surgeon of the Hardwicke, makes the following claim: As I am informed it is customary to allow the surgeon Rs. 4 for the care of each soldier brought from England, I beg you will be pleased to order payment for thirty-three brought in the Hardwicke in which ship I acted as surgeon.\\(^3\\) Similarly on the 5th November 1754, Mr. W. Davis, surgeon of the Warwick writes: I beg you will be pleased to order me the payment of the usual head-money for thirty-seven soldiers and galleymen delivered here from on board the ship Warwick.\\(^4\\) On the above claims the following order was passed: The surgeons of the Hardwicke and Warwick applying by letter for the usual allowance of head-money on the recruits landed from those ships, Government ordered it be paid as usual.\\(^5\\)\n\nThe following calculate made in January 1755 shows the charges of clothing a Swiss soldier conformable to the agreement entered into between their agents in England and the Honourable Company:\\(^6\\)\n\n| Yards | Cloth and Charges | \u00a3. s. d.

Foulis in 1753, the Court observe in their letter of the 26th March 1755: It appears to us by the survey of all the cannon mounted or dismounted in the several parts of the island made by Sir James Foulis, with the assistance of Captain DeFunck and Captain Cameron, that many of the gun carriages are bad and sixty-seven good guns are dismounted. We have for two years past sent you our directions for mounting all your artillery. We now enforce them by ordering you to finish the same with the utmost despatch in the most effectual manner you can by giving a workmanlike repair to all the old carriages, and making as many new ones as shall be necessary, as the safety of the island greatly depends upon the condition of your artillery.\\(^2\\)\n\nIn the same letter on the subject of barracks the Court write: We observe by your Consultations that by making a small alteration in your barracks which would be attended with little expense, they would contain about eighty men more than they then did, and that you had given directions for the said alterations accordingly. We approve of the step and empower you to make such further alterations and additions to the said barracks in the most frugal manner as you shall judge necessary for the accommodation of the military. We are sensible of the inconveniences and expense many of the military officers labour under for want of proper quarters. We therefore direct in the first place that you make conveniences for all or as many as possible in the barracks which we have directed and now repeat our directions for enlarging and building; and then to such officers as cannot be accommodated in the barracks or elsewhere, we do empower you to make a reasonable and moderate allowance.\\(^3\\)\n\nAs regards a provision for the relief of the widows of military men in their letter of the 26th March 1755 the Court write: We are very desirous that a provision should be made for the relief of the widows of such of our military officers as are left in indigent circumstances,\\(^4\\) as likewise for sick, wounded, and disabled officers, and private men upon the Bombay establishment. We therefore most earnestly recommend it to you to consider of ways and means for settling a fund for so good a purpose.

Among other good effects a fund will prevent the application of many unhappy objects whom we know not how to relieve, as having no fund for such purposes. You are hereby directed to send us a very particular account of your proceedings in consequence of this recommendation.\n\nOn the 26th March 1755 the Court direct the following changes in the military arrangements introduced in 1748: The military companies are too large and are not agreeable to the military regulations. We therefore think it for our service and accordingly direct that you form four new companies to be officered by the gentlemen who have been sent out to succeed to the first vacancies as captains lieutenants and ensigns. That the non-commission officers and private men for the said four companies be draughted out of the old companies. And we positively direct that all the companies at your Presidency, as well the old as the new ones, be as equal as possible in the number of Europeans, Mesties, Topasses, and others, and as nearly agreeable to our military regulations of the year 1748 as may be convenient in the present situation. Regarding clothing the Court continue: We insist upon your carefully seeing that our military are fairly dealt with in regard to their clothing agreeable to the directions laid down in our military regulations of 1748, having some reasons to believe the regulations have not been attended to as they ought to have been.\n\nIn the same letter, 26th March 1755, on the subject of artillery, the Court add: Upon comparing the state of your artillery company transmitted to us by the Salisbury with the directions given for the formation thereof in our general letter of the 14th March 1753, we find the number of which it consists greatly exceeds our establishment, the necessity of which, if any, ought to have been explained. In the present situation of our affairs it may not, as we observed before with regard to our military companies, be prudent to reduce the number of artillery people too much. At the same time, we would have them formed in a manner which may be most useful to the Company and agreeable to the constitution of His Majesty\u2019s artillery. We hereby order and direct that, in pursuance of our said commands of the 14th March 1753, instead of the establishment of that corps three companies of artillery be established consisting of the following officers and private men, who are to be all Europeans and with the pay hereunder mentioned, namely:\n\nEach of the said three companies is to consist of a Captain at \u00a3200 a year, one Captain-Lieutenant at \u00a3109 10s. a year, one First Lieutenant at \u00a3100 a year, one Second Lieutenant at \u00a390 a year, three Lieutenant Fire-workers at 3s. a day, three Serjeants at 2s. a day, three Corporals at 1s. 8d. a day, eight Bombardiers at 1s. 6d. a day, twenty Gunners at 1s. 4d. a day, sixty-four Matrosses at 1s. a day, two Drummers at 1s. a day.\n\n---\n\n1 Court to Bombay 26th March 1755 para 135, Pub.

Captain Jacques de Funck is to command the first company, Captain Gilbert Carter the second company, and Captain Richard Galliard the third. The two first mentioned gentlemen are now at Bombay, and the third, whom we have chosen for that purpose, proceeds thither on one of these ships. The other officers of the said three companies are to be appointed out of the present company according to their rank and you are to make up all deficiencies of officers with such persons as you shall find qualified, giving preference to the officers sent from hence, who are not otherwise provided for.\n\nSo many private men as shall be wanted to complete the said artillery companies are to be draughted out of the ten old military companies and the English recruits sent you this season.\n\nThe regulations and rules laid down in our former establishment of the 17th June 1748 are to continue in force so far as is consistent with this new establishment.\u00b9\n\nReferring to the remarks and orders contained in the Court\u2019s letter of the 26th March 1755 regarding the clothing of the troops, Sir James Foulis writes the following letter to Government, 18th December 1755: Our Honourable Masters, in their letter of the 26th March 1755 by Dragon, having been pleased to express a dissatisfaction at the first company of infantry being more numerous than the others, which may be so interpreted as if I had done something unwarrantable for my own private advantage, I beg leave to state the case fairly and lay my own conduct in that particular before the Board. At my arrival on the island in August 1753, the immediate command of the first company being given to me, can there be any question whether I had not an undoubted right to take charge of the same in the manner it was delivered to me. But as I perceived it was stronger than the other companies I never made even the smallest addition to it, as will appear by the enclosed abstract in which the proportionable strength of the companies is set down as they were at my arrival on the island and afterwards when the Dragon arrived in September 1755. By this abstract it is evident I increased the numbers in the other companies, while I suffered my own to diminish. From the enclosed abstract of the state of the companies from the year 1743 to the time of my taking charge of the first company, it will appear that the first company always had a far greater proportionable superiority of numbers during that time than it has had since. This was perfectly well known to our Honourable Masters from the returns annually sent home, and also known to me at the time I was entering into their service. It was also one of my inducements for engaging in the service, as I could not be ignorant of the profits arising from the clothing.\n\n\u00b9 Court to Bombay 26th March 1755 paras 146-150, Pub. Dep. Court\u2019s Letters Vol. 4 of 1752-1756, 235-237.\na greater or less number of men. I hope neither my Honourable Employers nor your Honour will infer from what I have said on this head that I mean to find the least fault with their late orders in respect to the reducing this company. On the contrary, you will do me the justice to testify that I showed the greatest readiness at putting their orders in execution; and the first of the new companies that was formed, I did it by reducing my own. But as their order in this respect is attended by a very considerable diminution of the advantage I had just reason to expect the continuance of, I hope neither my Honourable Masters nor your Honour will think me unreasonable in expecting an equivalent consideration in another shape for what is so evidently taken from me in this. I therefore beg your permission to apply to the Honourable Company for that purpose, and if it be judged proper also your mentioning it in my favour. But though I doubt not upon a fair representation and consideration of the equity of my request they will grant me due redress, yet that redress cannot be given till two years hence. I therefore hope it will not be thought too presuming that I now take the liberty to apply to your Honour for such redress in the interim as may be judged equitable. I cannot omit once more referring to the enclosed abstract of the state of the Honourable Company's military from the year 1748, as it appears thereby that former commanding officers, who for their own private advantage increased their own company, have been permitted to reap all advantages from it, while I who have acted in a contrary manner, by increasing the other companies and suffering my own to diminish, have the half of that company taken from me. In the 132nd paragraph of the Company's commands by Drayon, they are pleased to inform us that it is their intention that their artillery companies should be clothed by their respective captains and not by the major. How necessary this paragraph may have been at other settlements, I know not; but I hope my conduct in particulars of this nature is such as to render that information needless at Bombay, and that it is sufficiently known to your Honour that I never pretended to draw any profit perquisite or advantage from the artillery company in this or any other shape. In the 143rd paragraph it is said that the clothing of the Honourable Company's troops does not seem to have been attended to as it ought to have been. This concerns me not personally; because at the only time the troops have been clothed since my coming to India, I was by permission and approbation of your Honour at Madras. But that our Honourable Masters may be truly informed of the state of this affair, I beg leave through your channel to lay before them a short account of the care taken in the method of clothing the troops as it has been practised here. The calculation of the quantity of cloth requisite for each man was made in the year 1748 by the late Mr. Sewell, then military paymaster, and as he could have no advantage from it he could have no inducement to impose on the Honourable Company or on either officers or soldiers in that article. Before the cloth is received for is subscribed to by the military paymaster who has the muster rolls of each company vouched by the Honourable the President, or Second, the commanding officer, and himself the said paymaster, who has always been looked upon as a check\non things of that kind and can have no advantage in allowing one inch of cloth more than is requisite. The nature and price of the cloth stands on record in warehouse and on the general books. The patterns are approved by the Honourable the President, and everybody sees that the men have received their new clothes at the appointed time. The stoppages are not arbitrary, but such as were settled many years ago by the Governor and Council, and are not made by the officers themselves, but stopped in the hands of the paymaster; and the method is near the same at Tellicherry and Anjengo. From this account of the circumspection used to prevent any fraud in that article, I hope our Honourable Masters will be convinced that this point in general has not passed without being settled with a good deal of attention. I have indeed observed there is some unexactness in respect to the clothing given and the stoppages made from the artillery companies, some differences in the accounts of soldiers relieved from subordinate settlements, and a great deal in the accounts of those lately returned from Madras. This has not proceeded from any ill intention in those concerned, but from these three reasons: (1) The changes lately made in the pay and establishment of the artillery companies, which has been altered twice in two years. (2) The situation of the subordinate settlements and the seasons in which ships usually go there from hence, by which cloth could not always be conveniently sent for clothing the troops there at the same time they are clothed at Bombay. (3) From the different methods of clothing and making the stoppages practised at the different Presidencies. I therefore propose with permission from your Honour soon to lay before the Board and submit to your judgment a scheme and proper calculate for such a method of clothing the troops as may prevent all inconveniences for the future, and seems the nearest to reconcile these three points\u2014equity to the soldiers, a reasonable profit to the Captains, and the advantage of the Honourable Company\u2019s service.\n\nIn connection with this letter from Sir James Foulis abstracts were prepared which show the strength of the different companies from 1743 to 1755. The details are:\n\n| Companies | 1743 | 1744 | 1746 | 1746 | 1747 | 1748 | 1749 | 1750 | 1751 | 1753 | 1755 |\n|-----------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| First Company | 104 | 114 | 106 | ... | 98 | 91 | 348 | 363 | 368 | 343 | 338 |\n| Second Ditto | 264 | 306 | 314 | ... | 336 | 325 | 213 | 133 | 207 | 205 | 223 |\n| Third Ditto | 163 | 172 | 164 | 162 | 187 | 183 | 105 | 216 | 198 | 194 | 217 |\n| Fourth Ditto | 177 | 174 | 176 | 164 | 192 | 164 | 208 | 206 | 203 | 204 | 227 |\n| Fifth Ditto | 179 | 176 | 177 | ... | 196 | 177 | ... | ... | 188 | 205 | 213 |\n| Sixth Ditto | 181 | 176 | 177 | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | 206 | 200 | 208 |\n\nThis letter from Sir James Foulis Bart. Major, being duly considered on the 23rd December 1755, and also his request for compensation on account of the reduction in the strength of his company, the Board agreed to refer Sir James\u2019s request for an equivalent to their Honourable Masters\u2019 determination, and notice to them his readiness in executing\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 28 of 1755, 495 - 499.\ntheir orders by first reducing his own company, being satisfied he has rather lessened the number than otherwise, and did not receive any advantage in respect to the artillery who have been clothed by their own captains. Sir James was also desired to deliver in his proposal for regulating any inconvenience regarding the artillery clothing.\n\nOn receipt of Sir James Foulis' report of November 1753 on the Bombay ordnance, the Court write to Bombay on the 31st March 1756: It appears by the letter of Sir James Foulis laid before you under date the 22nd November 1753, together with his state of the ordnance in the Castle, on the town wall, and in the out-forts, that the cannon mortar and other ordnance are amply sufficient for the defence of the island. We have therefore not complied with that part of your military indent. And as that indent was framed in the absence of Sir James Foulis we shall not think of sending any, until we have Sir James's second report as mentioned in his said letter.\n\nA committee appointed to ascertain the state of the gun carriages delivered the following report on the 8th June 1756: Agreeable to an order in Council of the 18th ultimo, we proceeded on a survey of the gun carriages round the town walls taking to our assistance Captains Cameron and Funck with Hirji the carpenter. We find the condition of the gun carriages to be as follows. Of twenty-five carriages on the Pier-head battery and on the Royal, Marlborough, Stanhope, Moor, Banian, Prince's, and Mandvi bastions, nineteen are unserviceable and six though out of order can be repaired. Of the unserviceable carriages the iron work seems good, but part of it will not answer to the new carriages without some alteration, as many of them have been made on improper models.\n\nOn reading the above the Board ordered on the 8th June 1756 that the military storekeeper repair and make as many new carriages as are necessary.\n\nThe increase in the number of officers which formed part of the 1755 arrangements again raised the question of accommodation. A Consultation of the 2nd January 1756 records: Read a petition from sundry military officers desiring quarters or an allowance on that account. Ordered that the land paymaster report how many he can accommodate in any rooms which may be vacant.\n\nA further entry at the close of the year (10th December 1756) shows that the paymaster's efforts were not successful. As the intended additional fortifications or works cannot be completed for a very considerable time till when it will not be in our power to build barracks and as we cannot get quarters for some of the\n\n---\n\n1 Bom.

We therefore send you fifteen hundred with bayonets of the same pattern as those we send to St. Helena, which are four inches shorter in the barrel, and much lighter for carriage than common firelocks. The other fifteen hundred are the same as those used in the sea service without bayonets.\n\nIn 1757, in consequence of a report that the French were likely to attempt a landing on the island, at a Consultation of the 5th August the Board ordered the Triumph prahm to be fitted and stationed in Mahim bay or wherever else she may prove most serviceable.\n\nOn the same date (5th August), in consequence of a letter from Sir James Foulis drawing attention to the serious decrease in the available strength of the Bombay garrison, the Board record the following entry: Sir James Foulis, Bart., Major, assuring us that he has found from comparing the present state of the garrison with that in the year 1746 that there are upwards of 200 military and 2000 sepoys less on the island now than at that time, the means of increasing our forces with the greatest expedition is taken into consideration. Being of opinion that considering our friendship with the Marathas a detachment may safely be withdrawn from Fort Victoria and Surat, it is resolved that the Superintendent prepare the Drake ketch for transporting the Fort Victoria troops hither as soon as possible. Also, seeing Surat is at peace, that we prepare the Success ketch and that we write the Chief and Factors at Surat to hold their detachment in readiness for being embarked. Further that the Chief at Surat be directed with all expedition to enlist up to 2000 of such able military people as they can procure in Surat and the adjacent country giving preference to Turks Arabs and Rajputs, and entertaining a proportionable number of each rather than the whole.\n\n---\n\n1 Bom.

See also Bombay Town Materials, I. 316-318.\n\nThe accompanying French Maps of the Fort and of the Island of Bombay, obtained from Pondicherry through the kindness of Mr. G. W. Forrest, Officer in charge of the Records of the Government of India, seem to owe their existence, the Fort Map to this intended invasion and the Island Map to a similar scheme about ten years later.\n\nThe French references in the Fort Map are:\n\n- a Fort.\n- b Marine Gate.\n- c Marine Yard.\n- d Docks.\n- e Hospital.\n- f Treasury.\n- g Parade Ground.\n- h Church.\n- i Catholic Chapel.\n- j Government House.\n- k Admiralty House.\n- l Commissariat.\n- m Barracks.\n- n Council Hall.\n- o Officers' Quarters.\n- p Secret Gate.\n- q Old Woman's Island Landing.\n- r Bazar.\n- s Dongri Fort.\n- t Dongri Landing.\n\n* Instead of Port de la Montagne de Pierre the Landing for the Hill of Stone, the sense seems to require Port du Montage de Pierre the Landing for the Stone Slope or Ramp.\nshould consist of any particular country. We must leave it to their discretion whether it will best answer for them to settle the pay with each individual or agree with every subhed\u00e1r for raising his company at certain rates. But at the same time to observe what were the medium pay provisions and charges allowed to such forces as were enlisted in Surat in 1746. The men engaged should if possible be accustomed to the use of arms. But whether accustomed or not they must be forwarded before the close of the ensuing season.\n\nTowards the close of the same year, the 12th December 1757, Sir James Foulis proposed that the free grant of arrack to the soldiers be discontinued and that the sum thus saved be appropriated to building barracks and improving provisions. The Diary of the 13th December records the following letter from Sir James Foulis: It has long been the custom to give every day to each European soldier a glass of arrack in the fair season and double that quantity during the rains. This was an act of great humanity and beneficial to the men at the time it was first granted as it was not then allowed to retail spirits in town so that all the men on duty must otherwise have had nothing but water to drink, and, at other times, if they abused the liberty of going out of town, the keeping them within the gates necessarily obliged them to sobriety. Since it has been judged more for the advantage of the Honourable Company to permit the retailing of spirits in town, the reason why arrack was given to the soldiers ceases. Few rest content with the quantity allowed them. And when they have drunk it, they also furnish themselves at the next shop or punch house with as much more as they are able to purchase. I find that the price of the arrack given to the soldiers in 1754, 1755, and 1756 amounts at a medium to Rs. 12,896-1-88 each year. I am persuaded that if this sum were laid out in building barracks and finding provisions it would be more for the service of the Honourable Company by contributing to the health discipline and good behaviour of the men. At a Consultation, on the 13th December, the consideration of this subject was deferred until the arrival of the expected ships from England.\n\nIn the same year (1757) the Court empowered the Bombay Government to pay the military either weekly monthly or at any other suitable periods. They write on the 4th May 1757: As we find monthly payments are more satisfactory to the military than weekly ones, we give you leave to dispense with our orders in this respect, and henceforward you are to pay them at such periods as you shall be of opinion will be most useful and convenient to them.\n\nOn receipt of this letter the Bombay Government passed the following orders on the 10th January 1758: Our Honourable Masters having permitted us to pay the military in such manner as we judge may be most useful to them, and the inconveniences attending their being paid weekly, being considered, which we are sensible prevents their being able to lay out their money so much to advantage as when\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 30 of 1757, 299 - 300.\n2 Pub. Diary 30 of 1757, 458 - 459.\n3 Pub. Dep. Court's Letters Vol. 5 of 1757 - 1761, 37.\nthey receive it only monthly, besides occasioning a more general drunkenness among them, it is resolved that they be all paid monthly as heretofore, except the Swiss company who must be paid daily conformable to their contract; and that all disputes or disturbances may be avoided, the Major must order an officer to attend at the office to see them paid accordingly.\n\nIn 1757, perhaps in consequence of the considerable number of officers recently brought from England, discussion and friction arose regarding the relations between the military officers and the covenanted civil servants of the Company. To settle the question in dispute at a Consultation of the 7th June 1757 the Board recorded the following remarks and orders: We hear the military in general have lately started many idle objections and make a doubt whether they ought to obey the orders of the Honourable Company's covenanted servants at any of their settlements in case of the death or absence of the Chief though in such case the senior servant must necessarily for the time being be invested with the same position. Agreeable to the constitution and invariable rules of the service and in order to prevent the ill consequences which may accrue from the military entertaining any notion of their independency on such occasions and to confirm and enforce the established rules of the service, we resolve that an order be issued to the Major by the authority of this Board requiring all the military and artillery in the Honourable Company's service now on the island, of what rank or denomination soever, to obey all such orders as they may at any time receive from the eldest covenant servant in standing at any of the Honourable Company's settlements in case of the death or absence of the Chief or other person appointed to transact their affairs at those settlements. And though we have not any reason to imagine the marine entertain any such scruples, the like order must be given to the Superintendent respecting that corps as well as transmitted to the subordinates by the first conveyance.\n\nRegarding the above order the Court of Directors wrote to Bombay on the 5th July 1758: The order you issued upon the 8th June 1757 was unnecessary and improper. It was before never doubted that the troops in our pay were subject to the orders and directions of our President and Council and by necessary gradation to those of the Chief and Factors at the subordinates and in the absence of the Chief to the senior covenanted servant who should happen to be upon the place. By this we would be understood to mean that the person appointed by you to succeed to the chiefship is always to be deemed to be the senior covenanted servant though there may happen to be at that place others of longer standing in our service, whereas the issuing of a particular order upon this occasion might carry with it the appearance of a novelty and that you were introducing an obligation to which our military were not before liable.\n\nIn the same letter the Court add: By the Charter of King William and by that of the 26th of his present Majesty, the East India Com-\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Consultation 10th Jan. 1758, Pub. Diary 31 of 1758, 11.\n2 Bom. Gov. Consultation 7th June 1757, Pub. Diary 30 of 1757, 194-195.\nCompany have power to make peace and war, to maintain and keep standing forces, and in time of war or open hostility to enforce martial law. There having been some doubts with respect to the construction of the words time of war or open hostility, and it being likewise necessary for the safety of the Company's settlements to have at all times a standing force, and there being no provision for exercising martial law in time of peace, and discipline being essential to the keeping military forces in order as well in peace as in war, to obviate all the doubts that had been raised to former powers, the East India Company applied to Parliament and obtained the present Mutiny Act that the forces in their pay might in time of peace as well as in war be subject to the same discipline and liable to the like methods of trial and punishment for the like offences as the King's troops were before liable to by law. This was not done by way of indulgence to the Company's forces or to dispense with any of the obligations they were before subject to or anyways to make them less dependent on the Company than they were before. On the contrary it was with a view to establish a legal and regular method of trial and punishment instead of the uncertain and irregular way they were in before and to compel and enforce from their own troops a strict obedience to the Company's orders and to punish them for their neglect or disobedience by the methods and in the manner prescribed by that Act.\n\nIn consequence of this Act His Majesty by his Sign Manual empowered the Court of Directors by a Commission under the Company's seal to authorize you our Governor and Council to issue your warrants for holding of courts martial as occasion should require for carrying the Act into execution. The management of all the Company's affairs civil and military by their constitution vests in the Court of Directors. And the Court of Directors invest their President and Council at their several Presidencies with their absolute power (under the orders of the Court of Directors). In like manner their President and Council issue their orders and delegate their authority to the Chief, and, in his absence, to such other of the Company's covenant servants at the subordinate settlements as they from time to time think fittest to be intrusted with the care and management of the Company's affairs at those places. The military officers and soldiers in our pay are therefore equally liable to all such orders as they may receive from you and from the Chief for the time being or other person you shall appoint to act in the absence of such Chief at any of the subordinates, and they are to execute all such orders and commands as shall be so transmitted to them absolutely and implicitly. All such orders are lawful orders and are to be considered and looked upon as lawful by all our officers and they are by the Mutiny Act and articles of war punishable for their neglect or disobedience. Nor is it by any means left to the consideration or determination of our officers, nor are they at all at liberty to consider the purport of such orders further than to obey them. This is a matter of grave consequence to the Company. Without such subordination the entertaining of military forces would be useless and dangerous. It would be transferring the government and direction of the Company's settlements and property into the hands of the military. We cannot relax or dispense with this condition. We require your strictest attention to it and for that purpose we do order and direct you upon receipt\nof this to acquaint all the military officers in our pay with these our sentiments, and that you do ask each of them whether they are willing to continue in our service upon these terms. If any of them refuse to declare their submission thereto, you are, without distinction of rank or person, instantly to dismiss and discharge from our service every such officer who shall not explicitly signify his submission to these our orders. And let the officers you do dismiss be sent home at our expense by the first ships that shall afterwards sail from your settlement. If in future any officers of our forces shall refuse to pay all due obedience to your orders and to the orders of such as act under you, we do require and order you to dismiss and discharge from our service and send home every such officer, and to fill up the vacancies with such other persons as you shall think proper, always taking care and strictly observing that your actions do not proceed from any partiality resentment or private view to advance another into the place of the person you so discharge.\n\nOn receipt of this letter the Bombay Government, on the 24th April 1759, passed the following orders: Having summoned Major Mace and all the military and artillery officers on the island who are not on immediate duty, the commands of our Honourable Masters concerning them, under the 5th July last, are read to them by the Secretary and they are severally asked by the President whether they are willing to continue in the service on those terms. As the officers unanimously agree thereto, the Secretary is directed to deliver an attested copy of the paragraphs to the Major that he may publish them to the rest of the officers on the island. It is also ordered that the same must be transmitted to all the subordinates with our next advices.\n\nMajor Mace communicated these orders to such of the military and artillery officers on the island as could not attend the above Council and reported to Government that they all declared their readiness to continue in the service on the terms mentioned in the Court's letter.\n\nPerhaps in consequence of the haste with which recruits were collected in 1757, certain of the companies were allowed provisions and others were not. With the object of placing all on the same footing the Bombay Diary of the 5th June 1759 records: The eight companies of sepoys enlisted here who are allowed provisions occasion an extraordinary charge to our Honourable Masters. It is therefore ordered that unless they will for the future serve on the same terms as our other sepoys the provisional Commandant immediately discharge them and that our established companies of sepoys be completed by him so that the present twenty companies be reduced to eight of the established number and the supernumerary officers whose pay amounts to Rs. 16,000 a year be paid off agreeable to a regulation now presented by the President. A statement which accompanies this entry shows\n\n---\n\n1 Court to Bombay 5th July 1758, paras 18, 19-24, Pub. Dep. Court's Letters Vol. 5 of 1757-1761, 129-132.\n2 Bom. Gov.

The rates of monthly pay of the different grades were, subhed\u00e1r Rs. 20, jamled\u00e1r Rs. 13, hav\u00e1ld\u00e1r Rs. 6\u00bd, na\u00edk Rs. 4\u00bd, and sepoy Rs. 4.\n\nIn October 1759 Major Fraser submitted the following Sepoy Regulations for the approval of Government: Agreeable to your order I send you the sepoy regulations for your approbation. I beg leave to remark that though the Company at this time pays upwards of 2300 sepoys at about Rs. 14,000, if 500 sepoys were wanted for immediate service it would be impossible to have them without stripping every post of the whole serviceable number of sepoys belonging to the island. The proposed establishment is to have 1500 sepoys complete, regulated disciplined and paid in the same manner as they are upon the coast and in Bengal. With this number the sepoy duty of this island will, upon all occasions, be done in a soldier-like manner. If any emergency should require it, we shall be able to march 1000 sepoys complete into the field, well disciplined, which on real service will be found to answer better than five times the number of the irregular sort we now have. At the same time we shall have 500 left for the garrison or other different posts or to reinforce those in the field, should it be found necessary. The whole expense of this complete body of troops will not amount to Rs. 10,000 a month agreeable to the following abstract of sepoy pay: One subhed\u00e1r at Rs. 30, three jam\u00e1dd\u00e1rs at Rs. 15 each, six hav\u00e1ld\u00e1rs at Rs. 9 each, seven na\u00edks at Rs. 7 each, and 108 sepoys at Rs. 6 each, total Rs. 826 a month. Twelve companies complete the establishment. Thus our sepoy force will be more formidable than at present and the expense reduced at least Rs. 4000 a month.\n\nOn reperusing the above regulations, at a Consultation on the 30th October, the Board observe: Reperused Major Fraser's proposal for making a regulation among the sepoys. In regard to this we concur that the sepoys belonging to the out-offices or who are necessary to attend the several members as justices of the peace, the arrack and tobacco farmers and other people who have always been allowed sepoys and are entitled thereto, are not sepoys to be depended on in a military capacity. On the contrary that they should be made a distinct corps and their pay charged after the same manner which has been observed with respect to the sepoys attending the out-offices ever since 1752, the expense of which has been just the same as though they had been included in the muster roll. Resolved, therefore, that all sepoys employed in the manner abovementioned be formed into a separate\n\n---\n\n1 Statement in Pub. Diary 32 of 1759, 377.\n2 Pub.

And that a body of 500 sepoys and their officers be likewise formed and kept under a regular and strict discipline in order to which it is recommended to Major Fraser to complete that number with such of the Bombay sepoys as he may judge best qualified, paying a regard to those having families on the island. This we hold in the light of a trial, as we are sensible that the Arabs and some other mercenaries we now have will not depart from their own discipline, so that we think 500 will be a sufficient number to select at present. The abstract of pay annexed to Major Fraser's proposal far exceeds what is allowed our sepoys. Considering this and that it will hereafter be extremely difficult to reduce any advance we may now make; also deeming Rs. 3 and two pharas of batty to the sepoys a month and the officers proportionally an advance of a quarter part more than their present pay, a sufficient encouragement for their serving in a regular manner conformable to Major Fraser's plan; it is agreed that the military paymaster pay them accordingly.\n\nMajor Fraser next recommended the establishment of a grenadier company and represented that it might be formed from the troops without occasioning any extraordinary expense to the Company. At their Consultation on the 4th December 1759 the Board ordered him to set about the forming of such a company.\n\nOn observing Sir James Foulis' scheme for building barracks with savings from arrack money the Court write to Bombay on the 25th April 1759: We desire you will reconsider Sir James Foulis' scheme entered on your Consultation the 13th December 1757, for building the barracks at little or no expense to us. If, as seems evident, the soldiers will be well satisfied with the conditions, we can see no just reason why the scheme should not be carried into execution. The cutting off the great expense of drams may be a future saving to the soldiers for many valuable purposes. We therefore direct that the building of these barracks be no longer protracted, for it is impossible but what is material to be fortified must be finished before this reaches you.\n\nOn receipt of this letter the Bombay Government on the 30th October 1759 observe: Read Sir James Foulis' proposals for building barracks and laying in provisions for the military at little or no expense to the Honourable Company, as entered after the Consultation on the 13th December 1757, with the paragraph of our address to the Honourable the Court of Directors relating thereto under the 8th April 1758 and their reply under the 25th April last; also Major Fraser's opinion thereon in which he represents the want of barracks and a proper market for the use of the military, but disapproves the striking off the drams during the present war and recommends building apartments for the officers. Taking the above into consideration we continue to concur in the necessity of building barracks and proper apartments for the officers, and that it would be very improper to deprive the military of the drams they have been so long accustomed to at least during the\n\n---\n\n1 Bom.

For this purpose Major Fraser and Messrs. Byfeld and Hornby, together with the principal engineer, are appointed a committee for surveying the carpenters' yard, pitching on a proper place for removing those workmen to, and delivering us a plan and estimate of the expense which may attend building the said barracks and apartments for the officers.\n\nOn Major Fraser representing the opinion of the Committee on the 20th November 1759 the Board observe: Major Fraser represents that the committee appointed to survey the carpenters' yard are of opinion that it will be a proper place for building of barracks, but that the principal engineer cannot sufficiently view the ground and draw a plan for the barracks without the yard and some of the Honourable Company's batty warehouses adjoining thereto being cleared. The warehouse-keeper and land paymaster are therefore directed to comply therein as soon as possible and the former to inquire whether any other warehouses proper for lodging grain are to be procured.\n\nShortly after a plan of the barracks to be built was laid before Government, who on the 18th December 1759 referred it to Major Fraser and Messrs. Byfeld and Hornby and the Principal Engineer to report their opinion of it.\n\nOn receipt of the Committee's report Government passed the following orders on the 15th January 1760: Read a letter from the committee appointed to carry on the intended barracks proposing to convert the barracks at present occupied by the King's detachment and the adjoining warehouses into barracks for the Honourable Company's troops and apartments for the officers. For the reasons they give this proposal is approved, and suitable directions are ordered to be given the principal engineer and the new fortification paymaster for proceeding therein.\n\nIn 1760 in connection with the appointment of a fort or town major the Bombay Diary of the 11th March records: Two aids-de-camp whose pay is Rs. 4 a day having been appointed a few months ago on account of some disputes about seniority arising between Major Fraser and Captain Maitland, the President acquaints the Board he has struck them off as deeming them no longer necessary.

On taking these proposals into consideration at a Consultation on the 11th March 1760 the Bombay Council observe:\n\nWith respect to the payment of the troops for the reasons the Major gives and as he declares that all the Captains will be answerable to the Honourable Company for any deficiency which may ensue through fraud or neglect, it is agreed that the troops be paid regularly once a week by their own Captains as is practised at both the other Presidencies and in all other garrisons. Conformable to this the military paymaster is directed to advance their pay for this month.\n\nWith respect to a regular market for the soldiers in order that they may be messed together properly, it is observed that as the committee recommend our accepting some proposals made by certain butchers for supplying the garrison with fresh meat (as entered after Consultation the 20th November 1759) the said butchers' proposals are accepted. It is further agreed that the Secretary get a joint and\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Bom. Gov. Consultation 20th May 1760, Pub. Diary 34 of 1760, 390.\n\n\\(^2\\) Pub.

The butchers' (10th July 1759) petition runs: Unless prevented by casualties or unavoidable accidents from the seizure of cattle on the other side, your informants will engage by security bond during a term of five years to supply meat to the barracks for 6\u00bd pice the pound and suffer the penalty of Rs.1000 on failure. But as there frequently remains meat after having served the barracks, the butchers humbly pray that they may have the liberty of selling the surplus for 8 pice the pound as one Fakru sells for 10 pice the pound.\n\nWith respect to the regular and uniform clothing of the troops as at Madras and Bengal, it is resolved, for the reasons assigned by Major Fraser, that they be clothed by agents to be appointed by the captains in the manner he recommends. The following letter, 9th March 1760, gives Major Fraser's proposal on this point: The privilege of a captain in the Honourable Company's service having the clothing of his own company agreeable to the present method is liable to many abuses. I would therefore recommend to this Honourable Board that the whole troops of this Presidency should be clothed by agents appointed by the captains for that purpose as practised by the other two settlements. These agents are to make up all the clothing for the different garrisons and subordinate settlements agreeable to a pattern shewn to and approved by this Honourable Board, by the Major or other Commanding Officer for the time being. The said agents to be answerable that the clothing is of equal goodness with the pattern and that the whole is ready by Christmas Day and the overplus of the off-reckonings (after the charges attending the clothing are deducted and 5 per cent which the said agents are to be allowed for their trouble) be equally divided among the Captains who command companies.\n\nWith respect to advancing the topasses' pay to Rs. 7 a month, we are thoroughly sensible of the necessity, considering the dearness of provisions and all the other requisites of life at this place. The deferring of this increase has rendered it almost impracticable for us to recruit topasses and has occasioned their constantly deserting for some time past. This is the more easily accounted for as their present pay is not equal to that of common labourers. However, though we think it highly necessary to raise their pay in the manner Major Fraser proposes, we concur in only advancing their pay Re. 1, that is making it equal to Rs. 6 a month till our Honourable Masters' pleasure can be known. It is agreed to recommend the Major's proposal regarding topasses' pay at Bombay alone, as we know the pay the topasses at subordinates now receive is sufficient and more than equal to Rs. 6 a month at this place.\n\nOn this point the Court in their letter of the 6th May 1761 write:\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Consultation 11th Mar. 1760, Pub.Diary 34 of 1760, 183 - 184, 188 - 189. Pub. Diary 33 of 1759, 430.\nIf as you represent the raising the pay of the topasses at Bombay to Rs. 7 a month is a measure really and greatly conducive to the good of the service, as likewise that an addition should be made for the same purpose to the pay of the sepoys, we must leave it to you to determine upon as we shall depend upon our being put to no further expense than is really necessary.\n\nThe following letter from the Military Paymaster to Government, 7th September 1762, compares the pay of the King's infantry and artillery with that of the Company's troops: Having carefully compared the accounts delivered by Major Munro of the established pay of His Majesty's infantry and artillery with the pay of the Honourable Company's troops, I now lay before the Board a statement of the excess on either side. By this may be seen that by adding the Company's gratuity as established at Madras to His Majesty's pay, the commissioned officers receive considerably more than the Company's. But if the arrears are deducted (on which account it is presumed the gratuity is founded) the King's officers will receive but a trifle more and some will receive less, namely the Captains and Lieutenant Fire-workers of the Artillery. As to the King's non-commissioned officers, even adding the gratuity to their established pay, they receive less than the Company's officers of the same rank. The Adjutant and Quarter Master of the King's artillery are (without gratuity) upon a better footing than the Company's officers of the same rank, the former receiving six shillings a day and the latter four shillings and no deduction of arrears, whereas our Adjutant and Quarter Master's pay is five shillings and four shillings a day. So that the King's Adjutant and Quarter Master of artillery are not entitled to any gratuity, although they have thought proper to draw for it, and have been paid it upon a supposition that the pay they received from His Majesty was the same as that received by the officers of the same denominations in the infantry and subject to a deduction of arrears.

Gov. Consultation 7th Sept. 1762, Pub. Diary 39 of 1762, 510.\nSuperintendent has pitched upon, and that the present one be converted into a warehouse for stores.\\footnote{Pub. Diary 5th Oct. 1762 Vol. 39 of 1762, 556-557.}\n\nIn February 1763, the committee of accounts brings to the notice of Government the increase in the number of officers in the sepoys' companies. The Board, as entered in their diary of the 8th February, proceed to ascertain how far the increase is a necessity and to fix the number of both officers and men. They reperuse the committee of accounts' report of the 10th January wherein the committee remark the increase in the number of officers in the sepoys' companies and the necessity of fixing them to a certain number of both officers and men. This being taken into mature consideration and the Major declaring that, in proportion to the number of men, a greater number of officers than formerly is now absolutely necessary for the better training and disciplining that corps, and that each company should therefore consist of the following number of officers and men, the same is agreed to, namely Subhed\u00e1r 1, Jamled\u00e1rs 3, Hav\u00e1ld\u00e1rs 5, N\u00e1iks 5, Sabnis 1, Colour-bearers 2, Trumpeter 1, Tom-toms 3, Bh\u00e1ld\u00e1r 1, Watchman 1, Sepoys 100, Total 123. It appears from an abstract of the sepoys companies now laid before the Board that many of them are greatly deficient in complement. This deficiency the Major represents to be occasioned by death and desertions, and by the impossibility of recruiting because of the hardness of the duty, the strictness of the discipline, and the lowness of the pay in comparison to what they can get in other employ. The Major further declares that in spite of doing everything in his power to complete the number established in our Consultation of the 30th October 1759, they have decreased from 1300 to about 800. From the best information he can procure, the Major assures us the only remedy is to increase their pay. In the 140th para of their commands of 6th May 1761, our Honourable Masters have been pleased to give us a latitude for this purpose, should it be found absolutely necessary, which, as we are at present circumstanced, we really think it is. Resolved therefore that we increase the pay of the private sepoys rupee one a month and that the subhed\u00e1rs whose companies are deficient be allowed two months to complete them, which, should they not be able to perform within that time, the Major must be directed to report the same to us. And as the above increase of pay puts the sepoys upon the same footing with a n\u00e1ik and sabnis who are inferior officers, to keep up the distinction between them, it is ordered that the pay of the n\u00e1ik and sabnis be likewise increased rupee one a month.\\footnote{Bom. Gov. Consultation 8th Feb. 1763, Pub. Diary 40 of 1763, 101-102.}\n\nThe new fortifications necessitated the erection of new guard-rooms in place of the accommodation at the Apollo Gate. A Consultation of the 5th June 1764 records: The new works at the marine battery having rendered the former guard-room improper for the accommodation of the guard at the Apollo Gate and the Major representing that it is absolutely necessary to have some house to shelter the men from the weather during the approaching rains, it is directed that he and the clerk of the works survey the place and pitch upon a spot for\nerecting a strong shed, which, as there has been lately a guard-room built for the officer, we imagine, will be sufficient for the men.\\(^1\\)\n\nAgreeably to this order Mr. A. Werner on the 19th June reports: According to your orders I have inspected into the Castle for a place for new guard-rooms to be built for a captain and two subalterns. The properest place that I find is over the gateway which will consist of a hall and a closet for the captain and one room on each side for the subalterns, agreeable to the plan here enclosed.\\(^2\\)\n\nOn this report the same day the Board pass the following order: On perusing Captain-Lieutenant Andrew Werner's letter with a plan of the guard-rooms proposed in the Castle, it is ordered that a calculate of the expense be prepared and laid before us for our notice.\\(^3\\)\n\nMr. John Gouin on the 26th June 1764 reports what additional stores are required for the out-forts. He writes: The enclosed list\\(^4\\) will show your Honour what additional stores are requisite to put the out-forts in a proper state of defence, provided our garrison would admit of furnishing an adequate number of men which I am sorry to say it cannot at this time afford. Mahim Warli and Sion ought to be under commissioned officers. But Suri might still continue under a Serjeant since it is not so distant as the other forts and may be instantly reinforced upon the least notice. Permit me to observe that within these few years our topasses are considerably reduced, nor have I been able to prevail on any others to enter. As, mixed with Europeans, topasses certainly are a useful body of men, I could heartily wish some means might be thought on to induce them to enlist. The smallness of their pay is, I believe, the chief reason against their enlisting. Whether it may be consistent to raise their present pay, your Honour alone can judge.\\(^5\\)\n\nIn connection with the above report a Consultation of the 26th June 1764 records: The President now lays before the Board a letter from the Major to him, enclosing a list of ordnance and stores which he thinks necessary for the out-forts. But as our present garrison will not admit of reinforcing them, the out-forts must continue for some time in the condition they have been in this great while past. It is resolved likewise as the only means left us of reinforcing our garrison that the Major be empowered to enlist as many topasses as he may be able. But as even topasses are difficult to be procured, it is agreed that we endeavour to engage all the slaves possible, those of Christians to be incorporated with the infantry and those of Moors and others with the sepoys, and at the same pay of those corps. Such slaves to be engaged for three years certain under a penalty of being forfeited to the Company. To facilitate this scheme the new\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Bom. Gov. Consultation 5th June 1764, Pub.

The infantry is to consist of fifteen companies of one hundred Europeans each, commissioned and non-commissioned officers included. The first company is to be composed of the Major as Captain, one lieutenant who is to be captain-lieutenant, one ensign, as many subalterns as are necessary, and the remainder to be private men, so as to make the company one hundred men in all, officers included. The other fourteen companies are each to have one captain, one lieutenant, one ensign, and subalterns and private men as the first company. The artillery is to consist of three companies with each its captain, two lieutenants, two lieutenant fireworkers, as many subalterns as are necessary, and the remainder to be bombardiers gunners and matrosses, so as to make each company in all one hundred Europeans, officers included.\\footnote{Court to Bombay 22nd Mar. 1765 paras 145, 147, Pub.

Vol. 2 of 1759-1788, 222-223.}\n\nIn the same letter the Court continue: If on the receipt hereof or at any other time the number of Europeans shall exceed what is necessary to complete the present establishment of fifteen companies of infantry and three of artillery to one hundred each, officers included, let the surplus be equally divided among the several companies of artillery and infantry as no new companies shall be formed. On the other hand, if you shall be deficient in the before-established number of Europeans for the several companies, fill them up with topasses to that amount, and no more, as it is our intention that, including officers and soldiers, no company shall exceed the number of one hundred men. Observing that you muster among the several companies of infantry some topasses and mesties to the number of between thirty and forty each, and apprehending they are a useful corps among the military, as well as that, if you were to deprive yourselves of them, it might be a means of throwing a force into the hands of our enemies, we leave it to your serious consideration to determine whether it may be prudent to part with these...\nsoldiers. At the same time we direct, if you find it most proper to continue them, that you do not enlist others in the room of such as shall drop off from time to time, designing that your several companies should consist entirely of Europeans according to the above directions, and that topasses be entertained only when you shall be short in the number of Europeans.\n\nThe following extract from the Bombay Diary of the 12th August 1766 shows the opinion of Government regarding the Bombay sepoys of that time: Being of opinion that the Bombay sepoys are much more to be depended upon than the Callicailones (men of Calicut and Quilon) and other hired irregulars at Tellicherry, as we have found by experience from their dastardly behaviour the Quilons are of very little use, resolved that two companies of our Bombay sepoys be employed for the future at that settlement and annually relieved.\n\nIn 1767 as their previous orders against the sale of warlike stores had proved ineffectual, Government were obliged to adopt harder measures. On the 17th January the Bombay Council observe: Frequent publications have at times been issued prohibiting the sale of warlike stores. These must now be repeated and orders issued to all the subordinate settlements to prohibit the same there also. To render these orders still more binding it is agreed to confiscate any stores which may be discovered to be so sold and to inflict such other penalty on the seller as we may think proper, half the produce of such stores to be given the informer and the other half to the Honourable Company. All aiders and abettors to be looked upon as principals.\n\nIn the same year 1767, with a view to check the spread of petty offences among the military, it was thought advisable to erect a house of correction to be known as a Conjee or Gruel House. The Bombay Diary of the 3rd March records: It being judged that, as long practised at Madras, the establishment of a Conjee or Gruel House for the punishment of smaller crimes among the military will be of advantage to the service, and have a better effect and be more humane than the inflicting of corporal punishment, a plan and estimate of such a house has been prepared and is now laid before us, amounting to Rs. 2781-2-24, which being approved, a house agreeable thereto is ordered to be built accordingly.\n\nA year later, on the 18th March 1768, the Court intimated their approval of this measure. They write: We approve of building a Conjee House for military offenders as we think it may be conducive to the better regulating the common soldiers and preserving good order in the garrison.\n\nIn 1767 Government ordered a survey of gun carriages.

Agreeable to the enclosed list we find most of them rotten and irreparable, a result the Committee beg leave to represent to be in some measure owing to their being exposed to the weather for want of a proper place to put them in. We therefore recommend a veranda being built along the side of the artillery arsenal, which will contain a number. On receipt of this survey of the old and unserviceable gun carriages the Board directed, the 8th September, that the carriages said to be entirely decayed be broken up and the others repaired; and that the shed be erected, which the Committee recommend to be built for the preservation of gun carriages in general.\n\nOn the necessity of increasing the troops and military staff the Court write on the 18th March 1768: As the Company's extensive and rich possessions in India cannot be secured but by large bodies of well regulated troops, we have consulted Lord Clive, Generals Lawrence, Cailland, Carnac, and other military gentlemen on this important subject, and have thereupon found it necessary to make some alterations in the present military establishments at the several Presidencies, as well for the advantage of each as the good of the service in general, by increasing the number of Europeans, and by having the several corps commanded by a larger proportion of field and other officers. Upon this idea, therefore, we have thought proper to adopt the following plan for the military establishment for the service of our Presidency of Bombay, including the several subordinate settlements. You are to carry this plan into execution accordingly as soon as possible. We send out this season about 2000 recruits, two hundred and fifty whereof are intended for Bombay and are embarked on the ships Shrewsbury, Thames, and Royal Captain. We also send you several officers as hereafter mentioned, and it is our intention to supply you with such a number of recruits annually as will keep the several European corps complete. Instead therefore of the establishment as it now stands, the following is to be substituted and adopted. The corps of infantry is to consist of one regiment of 1600 Europeans, all officers included, to be commanded by a Colonel and to be divided into three battalions, to each of which is to be one Lieutenant-Colonel and one Major. Each battalion is to consist of seven companies, and every company is to have one captain, one lieutenant, one ensign, four sergeants, four corporals, two drummers, and 63 private men, excepting the companies to be commanded by the Field officers, which instead of Captains are to have Captain-Lieutenants. According to the foregoing establishment the regiment of infantry will consist of one Colonel, three lieutenant-colonels, three majors, fourteen captains, seven captain-lieutenants, twenty-one lieutenants, twenty-one ensigns, eighty-four sergeants, eighty-four corporals, forty-two drummers, and 1323 privates; total 1603. After mentioning the appointment of Colonel Charles Pemble to be Commander-in-Chief of all the Company's forces under the Presidency of Bombay and its several subordinate settlements the Court add that he is to be subject to the control and orders of the President and Council who are the Company's\n\n1 Pub. Diary 49 of 1767, 505-507.\nimmediate and legal representatives. He is also to be Colonel of the regiment of infantry to be formed in consequence of the directions in the 136th paragraph of this letter. The field officers (the Commander-in-Chief excepted) are likewise to be Captains of companies. With respect to the pay and allowances of the several officers we direct that Charles Pemble Esquire, be allowed \u00a31206-5-0 a year made of the following items:\n\n| Item                  | \u00a3   | s |\n|-----------------------|-----|---|\n| Commander-in-Chief    | ... | 750 0 |\n| Colonel, 15 shillings a day | ... | 273 15 |\n| Addition, 10 shillings a day | ... | 182 10 |\n\nTotal ... 1206 5\n\nThe addition of ten shillings a day is in lieu of pay as a Captain of a company, as it is our pleasure he should not be embarrassed with and consequently have the emoluments of a company. The lieutenant-colonels and majors, as such, are to have the pay as field officers in those ranks, namely the first named ten shillings and the other five shillings a day. When they succeed to companies, they are to have ten shillings a day as Captains and the emoluments arising from clothing. Being sensible that the pay of field officers as such is insufficient to support them in a manner suitable to their rank, we agree and accordingly direct that until they succeed to companies they be allowed in addition thereto ten shillings a day extraordinary. It is our meaning that the said ten shillings is not to continue as an extra allowance when they succeed to companies, but is to be deemed their pay as Captains, the only difference intended before they have companies being the emoluments arising from clothing. In the preceding paragraphs we have pointed out the usual pay and emoluments of a Captain of infantry. The pay of the following ranks is to continue as usual, namely a captain-lieutenant five shillings a day, a lieutenant five shillings a day, and an ensign four shillings. As much depends upon a well regulated corps of artillery, and in order to give all fitting encouragement to the officers of such corps the artillery is to be formed into a battalion of four companies consisting of 300 Europeans, officers included, to be commanded by a lieutenant-colonel and a major. Each company is to consist of one captain, one captain-lieutenant, one first lieutenant, one second lieutenant, three lieutenant fire-workers, three sergeants, three corporals, two drummers, eight bombardiers, twelve gunners, and forty matrosses. Excepting the companies to be commanded by the lieutenant-colonel and major, which in lieu of captains are each to have an additional lieutenant as third in rank, the corps will be as follows: One lieutenant-colonel, one major, two captains, four captain-lieutenants, four first lieutenants, four second lieutenants, two third lieutenants, twelve lieutenant-fireworkers, twelve sergeants, twelve corporals, eight drummers, thirty-two bombardiers, forty-eight gunners, and 160 matrosses; total 302. The several officers and others belonging to the corps of artillery are to be always kept therein and not removed into any other corps as without such restriction the service would be liable to many inconveniences. By way of encouragement we have therefore adopted the before-going plan of\nhaving field officers therein as high as a lieutenant-colonel, to give them rank in the army, beyond which they are not at any time entitled to rise. Captain Thomas Keating is to command the whole artillery corps with the rank of lieutenant-colonel. He is also to continue in the command of one of the companies belonging to the said corps. His pay as a field officer is to be ten shillings a day and ten shillings a day more as captain with the emoluments arising from clothing his company which is to be in lieu of his present allowances in the artillery corps. Mr. Thomas Lee is to be the second in command with the rank of major. As such he is to have five shillings a day, and, when he succeeds to a company of artillery, which he is to have on the first vacancy, he is to have \u00a3200 a year more as captain with the emoluments arising from clothing such company. Mr. Lee proceeds on one of the ships of this season.\n\nWe have also determined to new model your sepoys corps. For this purpose they are to be formed into two battalions of one thousand men each, black officers included, and that each battalion be composed of ten companies, each company to be commanded in the following manner: One subhed\u00e1r, two jamild\u00e1rs (jam\u00e1d\u00e1rs), six hav\u00e1ld\u00e1rs, six n\u00e1iks, three tom-toms, one trumpeter, one water-man, and eighty privates; total 100. Each battalion of sepoys is also to have one captain, one lieutenant, one ensign, and ten sergeants, all Europeans. According to the said plan the whole corps of sepoys will consist of two European captains, two European lieutenants, two European ensigns, twenty European sergeants, twenty subhed\u00e1rs, forty jamild\u00e1rs, 120 hav\u00e1ld\u00e1rs, 120 n\u00e1iks, sixty tom-toms, twenty trumpeters, twenty water-men, and 1600 privates; total 2026.\n\nWith respect to the lieutenants and ensigns we leave the appointment of them to you confiding in your fixing on persons qualified for those stations. Their pay is to be the same as the pay of the like rank in the infantry. You are likewise to appoint proper Europeans to the rank of sergeants in this corps with the like pay as in the infantry. In all commissions to be granted to military officers you are to observe the following method, that is to say, commissions to the field officers and captains are to be granted and signed by the President and Council, and those to subaltern officers by the President only. The Company's seal is to be affixed to all such commissions and they are to be regularly minuted in your Consultations. Having thus in general settled the outlines of the military establishment for Bombay, you are strictly to conform thereto. We are sensible many regulations are necessary for effectually carrying into execution the same. We therefore recommend it to you to settle as soon after the receipt of this letter as possible. In order to assist you herein we now send you the printed military code or plan given out at Madras in 1765 for the troops on the coast of Coromandel. Allowing for the difference of the service at the two Presidencies this code may be adapted to the situation and particular circumstances of the troops employed at Bombay, varying the rules orders and regulations accordingly. Such a code can be drawn out only on the spot. We direct therefore that, as soon as you can, you frame a code and transmit it to us for our information and further directions. Here\nwe are to observe that a military system improves not by multiplying orders and regulations but by a strict attention that the orders given are observed and obeyed. You are not only to transmit us a copy of such a code annually, but you are likewise to transmit copies to the other Presidencies who are to do the same with respect to you. This mutual communication, if duly attended to, will be productive of a similarity of system throughout our whole possessions. Each of the several military officers who have been appointed by us this season have been shewn a paper by our Secretary previous to their taking the usual oath to be true and faithful to the Company in their several stations, to which they declared their assent and agreement. A copy of such part thereof as is necessary for your information is as follows: That they are not only to obey their superior officers according to the rules and discipline of war, but are to be entirely subject to the orders of the Governor and Council at each Presidency, who are the Company's legal representatives, as likewise to such orders as they may receive from any of the Company's civil servants at their several subordinate settlements to whom the Governor and Council shall think fit to delegate such authority. That as they are entirely subject to the authority of the Company's civil representatives so the Governor and Council upon the misbehaviour of any officer whatever may, whenever they think fit, take away such officer's commission without bringing him before a court martial according to the general practice of the service. The intent of sending you the above notice is not merely with respect to the officers now appointed, but also to remind you of the power you have always had. This power it is necessary should be constantly kept up in order to preserve that authority over the military which is essential for the good of the service.\n\nAn increase in the number of non-commissioned officers was thought desirable and the Board allowed it. In 1768 the Diary of the 30th September records: The President lays before the Board a letter from Lieutenant-Colonel Gordon, to him, representing that the number of non-commissioned officers in the regiment of infantry is not near sufficient for the duty of the garrison. Agreed that an addition of two sergeants and two corporals be made to each of the fifteen companies on the island as the necessity therefor is so obvious.\n\nAs regards the proper peace footing of the garrison Colonels Campbell and Keating submit the following report on the 31st October 1768: With respect to the necessary garrison for Bombay in time of peace it is our opinion that there ought to be no reduction in the European infantry and artillery. As the life and spirit of a siege will fall particularly to their share, and as the means of obtaining such valuable troops in cases of emergency are sometimes extremely uncertain and almost impossible on other occasions, it appears to us of very material importance to the safety of the place to maintain the Europe corps always full and complete. The sepoys may be reduced by 2000\n\n---\n\n1 Court to Bombay 18th Mar. 1768 paras 134-175, Pub. Dep. Court's Letters Vol. 7 of 1765-1768, 347-339. Comp. of Standing Ord.

This number is absolutely necessary for the common detail of the garrison duty of Bombay and the outposts of the island exclusive of the subordinate settlements along this coast. The terrible situation of this garrison at present must be a very convincing proof to you of the necessity of an augmentation when you see every out-work in the circuit of the fortifications abandoned and not a single soldier for their security. The very guards that are at present necessary for the body of the place although reduced to the lowest numbers possible are one day off and one day on, which in a little time must be productive of the very worst of consequences in affecting the health and spirits as well as the very discipline of troops. When the above garrison is established in time of peace, and the duty is such as will afford discipline proper encouragement or opportunity to flourish, we beg leave to recommend in the strongest manner the exercise of cannon and mortars to the European infantry. In time of a siege the Europeans will be particularly attached to that duty and even in the field will render the Company most essential service by a superior well-worked artillery which in this part of the world will in our opinion ever render actions decisive. We have also examined the hospitals and find them deficient in point of size and accommodations for the sick of this garrison. When an accurate plan is made of them (which will be executed as soon as possible) the necessary improvements and additions will be laid before you.\n\nOn this a Consultation of the 1st November 1768 records: Read a letter from Lieutenant-Colonel Gordon representing the very weak state of our garrison and the severe duty which occasions both sickness and desertion among the troops and giving his opinion that this garrison without regard to the subordinate settlements should at all times consist of at least 1200 European infantry and 300 artillery, exclusive of commissioned and non-commissioned officers, together with 5000 sepoys and 1000 lascars in time of war, which however in time of peace might be reduced to 3000 of the former and 500 of the latter, but the Europeans, the Colonel thinks, ought always to be kept up to the above number. These views being confirmed by a letter now read from Lieutenant-Colonels Campbell and Keating, it is agreed to represent the same to the Honourable the Court of Directors. In the meantime it is ordered that an additional number of 400 sepoys be enlisted at Surat or Cambay as the northern sepoys are stouter better men and in our opinion more to be depended on than those of the adjacent country. These Gujar\u00e1t recruits, so soon as they are enlisted and arrive here, must be incorporated into the two battalions by adding twenty men to each company. Orders must accordingly be sent to the Chief and Council at Surat to procure the above number and send them hither as opportunities offer. And in order still further to ease the duty of this garrison and reduce the charges at Tellicherry, the Chief and Factors must be directed\n\n---\n\n1 Pub, Diary 52 of 1768, 404 - 405.\nto enlist topasses in lieu of the Bombay sepoys employed in that garrison who must be sent up as soon as the topasses are engaged for that purpose.\\(^1\\)\n\nIn the beginning of 1769 the Commanding Officer having represented that no topasses or black drummers can be procured on account of the pay then allowed them being insufficient for their maintenance, and as it appeared to the Board very uncertain whether the whole number of able-bodied sepoys they were in want of could be raised, on the 27th January Government ordered that five hundred topasses be enlisted towards completing the infantry battalions agreeable to the Honourable Company\u2019s orders under the 22nd March 1765. They add that when they may be pleased to send us sufficient Europeans, the topasses may be employed at the outposts and detachments for the cruisers in lieu of sepoys, and that their pay as well as that of the drummers be increased to Rs. 8 a month, but their stoppages for clothing to be no more than formerly.\\(^2\\)\n\nIn the next month, 21st February 1769, Government directed that there being about two hundred sepoys enlisted at Vengurla, the Superintendent must be directed to freight two large batelds for bringing them up, and to proceed under convoy of the Hawke gallivat which must also be ordered to call for them in her way up again from Tellicherry.\\(^3\\)\n\nIn May 1769 the Commanding Officer having represented that the practice of giving pice to the soldiers instead of drams is extremely prejudicial to the service and recommending that the drams may in future be issued every evening and made into grog, the same is ordered to be observed accordingly.\\(^4\\)\n\nThe Bombay Diary of the 23rd June 1769 records: Notwithstanding we have repeatedly wrote to Madras to be informed of the house rents and other extraordinary allowances made to Field officers there, we have yet received no answer to our letters on that subject, although the last is dated so long ago as the 30th January. It is now therefore taken into consideration what allowances should be made on that account. Colonel Pemble\u2019s letter of the 21st February, wherein the necessity of settling these allowances is strongly enforced, is referred to; and being fully sensible that in the present enhanced price of houses the smallest rent for a house fit for a Field officer to live in will amount to at least Rs. 80 a month, it is agreed to settle the rent allowance at this rate and to increase the allowances to a captain and subaltern on this account, the former to Rs. 40 and the latter to Rs. 20 a month. As on this occasion we are of opinion it is highly proper also to regulate the allowance of house rent to the Civil Servants, it is agreed to allow the Members of the Board the same as the Field officers, the senior and junior merchants and factors the same as Captains, and the writers the same as subalterns.

Gov. Consultation 28th Oct. 1769, Pub. Diary 54 of 1769, 719.}\n\nIn the matter of increasing the number of sepoys and providing accommodation for them, Government on the 29th September 1769 passed the following orders: Read a letter from Colonel Pemble, which being maturely considered, the following resolutions are taken thereon. Notwithstanding in the present great scarcity of money we could wish to diminish instead of increase our expenses, yet as for the reasons assigned by the Colonel it appears indispensably proper to keep upon the island the full number of sepoys which he recommends, more especially as we are like to fall so considerably short of the European recruits the Honourable Company intended for this Presidency, it is resolved that four hundred sepoys be raised as soon as possible to replace the four companies detached to Tellicherry and Surat. We concur with the Colonel in the expediency of keeping this corps in cantonments. But Old Woman's island is in many respects liable to objection, and erecting sheds or other covers for them will be attended with a vast expense to the Honourable Company, and with very great inconvenience and dissatisfaction to themselves, this corps being composed of many different castes. Therefore the colonel, military paymaster, collector, and principal engineer are appointed a committee to fix upon a spot proper for building them some houses, so that this whole corps may live contiguous, and yet have their different castes distinct from each other. We likewise acquiesce in the propriety of establishing a Marine Corps and in the method of completing it as recommended by the Colonel. He is therefore ordered to take the most effectual means for engaging as many able-bodied topasses as may be necessary for completing the battalions, except two hundred which may be engaged at Tellicherry.\\footnote{Bom. Gov. Consultation 29th Sept. 1769, Pub. Diary 54 of 1769, 680-681.}\n\nAgreeably to the above orders the Colonel attempted to raise the required recruits and about the close of the year reported his success to Government. The Bombay Diary of the 28th December 1769 records: The Colonel reporting that a person employed for raising recruits to the southward has got ready at Vengurla 300 topasses and 700 sepoys, also a few Europeans, it is ordered that the Bombay grab with some boats to be hired for that purpose proceed thither to bring them up as soon as possible, and carry a supply of Rs. 6000 in order that each man may be advanced a month's pay.\\footnote{Bom. Gov. Consultation 28th Dec. 1769, Pub. Diary 54 of 1769, 838.}\n\nDuring this year (1769) the Muhammadan sepoys objected on religious grounds to wear boots. The details on the subject are thus\nrecorded in the Bombay Diary, 15th August 1769: Read the following petition from the officers of sepoys of the Muhammadan faith representing that the clothes and boots they have been ordered to wear are repugnant to their religion; also the following letter from Colonel Pemble representing the dangerous consequences which may accrue to the service, should any part of their petition be granted.\u00b9 Petition from the Moor subhed\u00e1rs and jumbled\u00e1rs to the Governor and Council: That your Honour's poor petitioners prostrating themselves at your feet humbly beg leave to represent to your Honours that they are very well contented and highly indebted to your Honours for the great pay you were pleased to make them, for which they and their families are bound to pray to God Almighty for your health and prosperity. But whereas the Christian clothes and boots they are now ordered to wear being quite contrary to the Muhammadan religion insomuch they are not only excluded from their caste forever but also from their relations wives and children which their law in such case separates from your Honour's petitioners. Therefore it obliges them through necessity to make this request to your Honours, hoping you will, out of your wonted goodness and charity, be graciously pleased to order them to be excused from wearing the aforesaid Christian clothes and boots. And as they esteem their religion much more than any thing else in the world, they would rather be contented to be reduced to their old pay and clothes than to wear the aforesaid clothes and boots for high pay, they being greatly ashamed to show their faces in their present dress to any of their caste. They applied to the Colonel about it, who was pleased to bid them represent the same to your Honours. They say that their fathers and forefathers have been the Honourable Company's zealous servants and have died such. On the whole they on account of their religion humbly implore your Honours will be pleased to order a stop to be put to their wearing the aforesaid clothes and boots or grant them their discharge.\u00b2 Letter from Colonel Charles Pemble to the President and Council, dated Bombay 8th August 1769: The Honourable the Governor having informed me that the corps of black officers have presented a petition to the Board, setting forth the hardships they sustain by being obliged to appear in boots, agreeable to a general order issued for that purpose; that their Codjees (K\u00e1j\u00eds) have declared it to be inconsistent with the tenets of the Muhammadan religion and have accordingly threatened them with excommunication from all the privileges of their caste if they persist in complying with the said order; and praying that they may therefore be released from it or receive their discharge from the service, or be reduced to their former pay if this order cannot be dispensed with. It therefore becomes my duty to offer my sentiments to the Honourable Board on this occasion as well to justify the propriety of the order as to represent the dangerous consequences which may accrue to the service should any part of their request be granted.

I therefore recommended it to the Honourable the Governor as essentially necessary to the sepoys corps. And as I was just arrived from the army in Bengal which consisted of more than ten times the number of sepoys officers who all appear on duty in boots and who were never heard to murmur against it, I could not suspect that those on this establishment could have the least objection thereto. I beg leave to remark there are a number of mosques where the forces of Bengal are cantoned, and consequently Kajis for the service of them, who I think may with some reason be supposed to possess as much knowledge and erudition as those few who reside on this island. Experience has convinced me that exclusive of the tendency it bears to discipline and order, troops acquire an emulation and spirit by an uniform and consistent appearance. Therefore whether their appearing on duty in long drawers and slippers can be productive of any of these effects, I submit to the judgment of this Honourable Board. The ill consequences that may attend giving up a point of this nature to an undisciplined body of officers are so obvious as not to make it necessary for me to point them out. I will only beg leave to observe that should their request be submitted to, I shall expect to hear soon that the arms they carry bear also too Christian-like an appearance and that they demand matchlocks in lieu of them, or any other absurdity of the like nature. I do not presume to prescribe what measures should be taken on this occasion; but was my humble opinion to be required, it would be to insist on a strict obedience to the orders which have been given out; and should these officers dare to refuse it, to dismiss with every disgrace the nature of their refusal may deserve. We had better be without them than admit of a wound to the service; there will be enough who will rejoice to succeed them. Some of the Moor officers have been seen to wear boots before the order for that purpose, and a subhed\u00e1r named Karim Kh\u00e1n has declared to Captain Jackson that he for his part is determined to comply with the order, even should the rest of the officers refuse it. The subhed\u00e1rs also appointed to command the companies raised by Mirza have no objection to wearing boots. I mention these circumstances as an argument of the obstinacy of the black officers. The tenor of the petition before the Board appears to have a mutinous tendency calculated by a few of the principals only for seditious purposes. I think it necessary to inform the Board that the Gentus have delivered me a petition requesting that as they are very willing to appear in boots and conform themselves to every other order that may be given for the service, they may not suffer through the disobedience of others by having their pay reduced to the former establishment.\n\nAt a Consultation on the 15th August 1769 consideration of the above petition and letter was deferred. The subject was resumed on the 29th September 1769, when the following entry was made: Read another petition from the Muhammadan officers of the sepoys on this\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 54 of 1769, 625-627.\nestablishment, representing that they have been disgraced and turned out of the caste for wearing boots agreeable to the garrison orders, and this they have reason to believe at the instigation of some evil disposed persons who they request may be punished and their credit restored, or that they may be permitted to appear without boots. This being considered together with their former petition read the 15th August last, it is observed that from the best information we have hitherto procured Muhammadans in every part of India and all Muhammadan countries wear boots without scruple, and therefore there is reason to believe the K\u00e1ji has imposed on our sepoy officers by asserting it as contrary to their religion. Resolved therefore that the Chief and Factors at Surat be directed to enquire into it by collecting the opinions of the K\u00e1ji, Head Sayed, and other principal persons of the Muhammadan faith at that place, and transmit their report to us. We shall then be enabled to come to some resolution on the subject of the petition now before us. In the meantime the commanding officer is ordered to permit of a small alteration being made in the boots, which he represents will satisfy the officers for the present.\n\nIn reply to the above request the Wolfe galivat brought, 30th November 1769, a letter from the Chief and Council at Surat, dated the 23rd November 1769. It acknowledges the Bombay commands of the 19th (October) and encloses the opinions of the K\u00e1ji Mufti and principal Sayeds in respect to sepoys of the Muhammadan faith wearing boots. On this, on the 5th December, the Bombay Council observe: Read the letter from the Chief and Council at Surat, with the opinions of the Sayeds and K\u00e1jis about Muhammadans wearing boots. On this we cannot help remarking that the question seems to have been improperly put to them. This is now however immaterial as the affair has been settled some time.\n\nThe Bombay Diary of the 23rd February 1770 records: Colonel Pemble represents that the service will suffer greatly if the allowance of Rs. 5 for each sepoy who may enlist is not continued. Ordered the same be paid to the recruiting officer who must defray all other expenses on this account.\n\nIn December 1769 Colonel Pemble submitted certain proposals regarding the sepoy corps. On these, at their Consultation the 2nd January 1770, the Board record: Read a letter from Colonel Pemble recommending that the sepoy corps may be formed into four instead of three battalions and that the Europeans may be cantoned at Old Woman's island during the fair season. The consideration of this letter was deferred for a full Board. Subsequently on the 23rd February 1770, the Board passed the following orders. Reperused the letter from Colonel Pemble, read the 2nd ultimo. The same being now taken into consideration we are of opinion the several proposals made by him are obviously for the real benefit of the service and therefore they are\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov.

The sepoy corps to be formed into four battalions and the President to appoint an officer to command the fourth battalion. The Board are of opinion such appointments rest with the President. Nor would Captain Jackson's appointment to this corps have been minuted under the 8th March 1769 had not the President on account of his particular regard for Captain Jackson desired the same might stand upon record to obviate every possible reflection. The land paymaster is directed to erect the sheds and bungalows recommended by the Colonel in which he must observe the utmost frugality and make use of cocoanut trees where it can be done with propriety.\n\nIn the matter of the military peace establishment, after consulting officers of experience, the Court write on the 6th April 1770: The important point of settling our military establishment in the interval of peace upon a respectable footing having been under our most mature consideration, we have, with the advice and assistance of Lord Clive, Major-General Lawrence, Major-General Coote, and Colonel Wedderburn, thought proper to adopt the following plan and regulations for the military establishment at your Presidency. This we direct you to carry into execution as soon after the receipt hereof as possible. That the infantry do consist of one regiment containing two battalions of Europeans and two battalions of sepoys. The two battalions of Europeans are to consist, including commission and non-commission officers and privates, of 1562 men exclusive of the Field officers, and the two battalions of sepoys, including commission and non-commission European and Black officers, of 2042 men. That each battalion of infantry do consist of one Grenadier company and eight battalion companies. The Grenadier company of each battalion to be formed of one captain, four lieutenants, six sergeants, six corporals, four drummers, and 80 privates; total 101. Each of the eight battalion companies to be formed of one captain, one lieutenant, two ensigns, four sergeants, four corporals, three drummers and fifers, and 70 privates; total 85. That the Field officers to the said regiment be, one Colonel, two lieutenant-colonels, and two majors. That each of the two battalions of sepoys beforementioned shall consist of one captain, five lieutenants, five ensigns, and ten sergeants; total 21 Europeans. One commandant, 10 subhed\u00e1rs, 20 jam\u00e1d\u00e1rs, 60 hav\u00e1ld\u00e1rs, 60 n\u00e1iks, 10 colour-men, 10 tom-toms, and 829 sepoys; total 1000; in all 1021. Having formed a new military establishment as mentioned in the preceding paragraph we require the most punctual compliance therewith. This will serve as a reply to the 100th paragraph of your letter of the 2nd December 1768 respecting the appointment of an additional number of non-commission officers to the two battalions of infantry. The same letter continues: As it is very essential that the natives should be kept as ignorant as possible both of the theory and practice of the artillery branch of the art of war, we esteem it a very pernicious practice to employ the people of the country in working the guns. If such practice is in use with you we direct that\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Consultations 2nd Jan. and 23rd Feb. 1770, Pub. Diary 55 of 1770, 3, 137.

I now lay before you such observations as have occurred to me respecting the execution of the orders of the Honourable the Court of Directors for reducing and new modelling the sepoys corps. It appears to me that the number of private sepoys, exclusive of officers and non-commissioned officers ordered by the Honourable the Court of Directors, is insufficient for the service of this Presidency and its subordinate settlements. Without entering into any disquisition of the numbers required for the defence of this place and its extensive works in case of an attack, I shall confine myself to the details now before me of the duty which is necessary to be done here. The establishment ordered by the Honourable the Directors is 1658 private sepoys. It does not appear to me proper to diminish the number of sentinels, and it is very evident that when guns are mounted upon the new works and stores lodged in them, it will be indispensable to increase the number of sentinels very considerably. The following detail taken from the return given me of the duty of sepoys on the island of Bombay compared with the number of sepoys ordered for the new establishment will show how inadequate that number is to the duty required:\n\n353 Private sepoys daily on duty at the several town gates.\n706 Private sepoys wanted to make two reliefs, which is as little as can or ought to be allowed.\n313 Private sepoys doing duty at the out-posts.\n313 Wanted to relieve the out-posts.\n189 Sick, upon the supposition of the two battalions, being half the number of the sick at present.\n30 On furlough, being half the number now absent with leave.\n100 Recruits attending the drill, not being one-quarter of the number now at the drill.\n18 Storekeepers, half the number at present employed.\n9 Subhedars' sons, half the present number.\n\n2031 Total.\n\nFor the duty of the town and island of Bombay alone exclusive of any of the subordinate settlements, of any demands from the marine, and of any detachments to any place without the limits of the Presidency, the new establishment is 373 men deficient. As, consistent with the safety of the military stores, the preservation of the works, or the good government of the town and island, it seems impossible so to diminish the guards as to be able to obey the words of the order of the Honour-\n\n---\n\n1 Court to Bombay 6th April 1770 paras 67-73, Pub. Dep. Court's Letters Vol. 8 of 1769-1771, 158-160. Comp. of Standing Ord. Vol. 2 of 1759-1758, 257, 260.\nable the Directors, it comes to be considered how far it will be possible to obey the spirit and meaning of the order which I humbly conceive to be to have a sufficient and respectable military force kept at this Presidency at the least possible expense to the Honourable Company. I have seen a considerable number of invalids in the Honourable Company's pay who are able to serve in the out-forts on this island. They belong to no battalion, are not under the care of any officers, and do no duty. The irregular and licentious manner in which these invalids in the neighbourhood of the garrison live is, I am told, extremely hurtful to the health and discipline of the troops. It is submitted to your Honour's consideration whether these invalids may not still render some service to the Honourable Company and do much less mischief to the rest of the troops, if such of them as are fit to serve at all be either added as supernumeraries to the companies of the infantry or formed into separate companies for the duty of the out-posts alone. They are perfectly equal to this duty; it will be unnecessary ever to relieve them; their vice and licentiousness will be a little restrained; and the two battalions of infantry will furnish every year a sufficient number to keep the corps of invalids always complete. The garrison of Tellicherry consists at present of three companies of infantry, one company of Bombay sepoys, and 815 local sepoys of the Nair and Tivi castes. The pay of this garrison amounts to about Rs. 7000 a month. It is submitted to your Honour's consideration whether the post of Tellicherry and its dependencies will not have a stronger or more serviceable garrison, if, instead of three companies of infantry in bad order, because they have not been recruited or relieved, and 815 untrained troops, it was ordered to consist of two complete companies of infantry sent from hence and four companies of well disciplined Bombay sepoys with European officers and non-commissioned officers, exclusive of the artillery detachment which is at present there. The expense of this proposed garrison will not exceed Rs. 5000 a month. It is conceived the post will be in a much more defensible state than at present and the saving to the Honourable Company will be about Rs. 24,000 a year. Besides the consideration of economy in the military establishment at Tellicherry there is another which I doubt not has occurred to your Honour. The Nair and Tivi sepoys raised there will not move from thence upon any emergency whatever. They therefore cannot be reckoned equally useful to this Presidency as sepoys who will serve cheerfully in any part of Asia, and who, being to be relieved at stated times, leave their wives and children here as a pledge of their fidelity and allegiance. The garrison of Surat consists at present of two companies of infantry, two companies of Bombay sepoys, and eight companies of Surat sepoys. By the information which I have received the Surat sepoys are not only of no use but are in the greatest degree dangerous to the settlement there. They are, not uniformly clothed, they are not armed alike, and are so little to be trusted that I am told they are never admitted into the Castle. It is extremely doubtful whether the sepoys in the Honourable Company's pay at Surat would not turn their arms against their Masters in the event of any rupture between their Masters and the country powers. By the last returns it appears that the Chief of Surat has a guard of an officer and\nthirty men of the infantry. Besides this I have heard that he seldom goes abroad with less than 150 sepoys attending him and the other civil servants in proportion. I hope your Honour will do me the justice to believe I do not wish to strike off one man from the suite of the Chief of Surat or any of the Honourable Company's civil servants. Still I am persuaded you will agree with me in thinking it wrong that the pay of peons of the Honourable Company's civil servants should be included under the head of military expenses, especially as I have heard a company of peons are expressly allowed for the Chief and other officers. To pay troops upon whom you can have no dependence, whom you cannot prudently trust within the walls of your fortress, who will not wear your uniform, and whom you dare not arm, seems to me very bad policy as well as a most unprofitable and unnecessary expense to the Honourable Company. The expense of eight companies of Surat sepoys is Rs. 5672-2-0 a month. The expense of two companies of Bombay sepoys is Rs. 1903-1-42. For twelve months the expense of both amounts to about Rs. 89,900. To put the garrison of Surat in a more respectable more secure and defensible situation than it is at present, and to diminish very considerably the expense of the military establishment of the Honourable Company, the following proposal is submitted to your Honour's consideration. The two companies of infantry having been long at Surat being weak in Europeans, and having formed habitues and connections with the inhabitants, should be relieved by two companies from hence. It appears to me that if the eight companies of Surat sepoys were disbanded and the two companies of Bombay sepoys relieved by six companies of Bombay sepoys from hence with white officers and non-commissioned officers according to the new establishment, the Castle of Surat would be much better garrisoned than it is at present and the annual expenses of that settlement be reduced above Rs. 25,000. The expense of a complete battalion of sepoys on the present establishment is for twelve months Rs. 94,251. The expense of two companies of Bombay sepoys with the irregulars at Surat is for twelve months Rs. 89,900. The expense of one company of Bombay sepoys and the irregulars at Tellicherry is for twelve months Rs. 45,306. The total expense of three companies of Bombay sepoys and all the irregulars at Surat and Tellicherry is for twelve months Rs. 1,35,206. From this it appears that Surat and Tellicherry being garrisoned by ten companies of Bombay sepoys, there will be a yearly saving on the article of military expense at those settlements of Rs. 49,430 and the yearly Bombay expense be reduced Rs. 94,251 equal to the expense of one complete battalion. It is believed that both places will be much more in a state of defence than they are with the present garrisons and this Presidency will gain the additional strength of a complete battalion of sepoys which may be employed wherever the exigency of the service may require it. Upon the whole, I submit my humble opinion to your Honour's consideration that the duty of this garrison cannot be done with a smaller number than three battalions and the duty at Surat and Tellicherry with no less than one battalion of sepoys. By disbanding the irregulars at Surat and Tellicherry, the increased expense to the Honourable Company by keeping up four battalions instead of two will be only Rs. 44,821. I intend as soon as possible, with your\nHonour's approbation and permission, to go to Surat and afterwards to Tellicherry that I may form a judgment from what I shall have seen rather than what I have heard of the reduction that may be made in the military establishment at those settlements according to the duty which shall be thought necessary to be done there. On my return I shall be able to make a report to your Honours with more accuracy and precision than it is possible for me at present. Your Honours being well acquainted with the duty necessary to be done at the subordinate settlements are the best judges whether the plan I have sketched out and have the honour to submit to your consideration be either practicable or likely to prove advantageous to the Honourable Company. I am persuaded when your Honours reflect that in the fair season 500 sepoys were employed last year in the marine and that near 400 sepoys are now employed at Balambangan (in Borneo), in Persia, and on board the cruisers; that in three months 200 more men will be wanted for the daily duty here to guard the ordnance and stores in the new works, and when these men which fairly may be stated at 700 are added to 2031, the number now required for the duty in the town and island only, you will be of opinion that it will be necessary to keep three battalions of sepoys. Also considering the present situation of politics in this country with the duty required of the sepoys and the difficulty of enlisting them, perhaps your Honours will be of opinion that it would be imprudent to disband the fourth battalion of trained sepoys till the corps of topasses ordered to be raised for the service of the marine shall be completed. Before I conclude I must represent to your Honour that it appears to me indispensably necessary that there should be one adjutant to each battalion of sepoys. It does not appear to me that the sepoy officers upon the new establishment of one to each company in garrison have more duty to do than the officers of infantry. I cannot therefore see any reason why they should have any additional pay continued them. The Honourable the Directors in their last letter strongly recommended the most particular attention to be paid to the disciplining the sepoys corps. The sepoys can be brought into good order only by a choice of the most excellent officers. This choice, were it left to the Commander-in-chief under the Governor and Council which perhaps it should be, it would be difficult for him to make with a strict regard to merit alone, because while the pay is higher in the sepoys than in the infantry corps, earnest solicitations and powerful protection will probably often have more weight than the excellence of the officer. I would therefore recommend it to your Honour to strike off the additional pay of subaltern officers in garrison and to increase it whenever they may happen to take the field. I would likewise submit it to your Honour's consideration whether it would not be proper to give some gratification to such of the officers of the sepoys as shall take the pains to acquire the country language. I have omitted the establishment at Anjengo because it is at present so small that no alteration which can be made in it can be of any considerable advantage to the Honourable Company. The company now there would sometimes be relieved.\nOn the 26th October 1770 General Wedderburn further writes: By the establishment of the sepoys as settled by the Honourable the Court of Directors ten colour-men are allowed to each battalion. The sepoys at present have twelve colour-men. It appears to me that so great a number of colours do mischief, three or four at most being all that are necessary to guide the movements of a battalion. The present set of colour-bearers are not men who should be trusted with the colours of a battalion, the loss of which is always disgraceful. I would therefore humbly recommend it to your Honours to order that the twelve colour-bearers in each battalion be discharged. The colours will be better carried than at present by the jam\u0101d\u0101rs or by hav\u0101ld\u0101rs as at Madras or Bengal, and the yearly saving to the Honourable Company will be Rs. 3456.\n\nBy the establishment of the Honourable the Directors ten tom-toms a battalion are allowed by which I humbly conceive ten sets of tom-toms is meant. As your Honours know very well that one tom-tom is of no use, I would recommend that one set of tom-toms be allowed to each company, as the guidance and cadence of the march of the sepoys depend on them. It appears to me that ten trumpeters to a battalion are perfectly useless. The Honourable the Directors in the new establishment allow no trumpeters. But as it is certain that whenever the sepoys come to be employed in a close country, two trumpeters for each battalion would be extremely useful, I would humbly recommend it to your Honour to keep that number on the new establishment. The yearly saving to the Honourable Company by discharging the useless trumpeters will be Rs. 2304.\u00b9\n\nOn the above report at their Consultation on the 26th October 1770 Government observe: We entirely concur with the General that the number of sepoys ordered by our Honourable Masters is by no means sufficient for the establishment. On the contrary it appears evident the service of the island alone requires three battalions, and should the new arrangement which he proposes in the garrisons of Surat and Tellicherry take place, a fourth will be absolutely necessary. Resolved, therefore, that the whole of the four battalions be kept up until we determine on the proposed arrangement which it is agreed to defer until the General can visit both settlements when he will be better able to judge of the propriety of each. The battalions must be officered agreeable to the Honourable Company\u2019s orders and as by this means the duty of the officers will become much easier, the additional pay to those in this corps must be struck off at the end of this month and they put upon the same footing in point of allowances as the officers of infantry. But such officers as may distinguish themselves by acquiring the language will have a suitable gratification. By the above reduction in the pay, allowing for an adjutant to each battalion as the General recommends and which is agreed to, our Honourable Masters will save Rs. 27,840 a year. We greatly approve the General\u2019s\n\n\u00b9 General Wedderburn to Government 10th and 26th Oct. 1770. Pub. Diary 56 of 1770, 577 - 585.\nproposal respecting the invalids and would have them formed into a company accordingly for the service of the out-forts. We likewise approve the proposed discharge of the colour-bearers, the reduction of the trumpeters, and the increase of the tom-toms in the sepoys corps, which is ordered to be carried into execution accordingly.\n\nOn the 30th June 1772, with a view to effect reductions in the military and new fortification charges, the President Mr. William Hornby made the following proposals to the members of Council:\n\nThe expense and annual losses of this Presidency and its subordinates become a subject of the most serious consequence. The difference against our Honourable Employers on close of the books ending 1771 was no less than Rs. 24,30,329. It behoves us therefore to carry into execution every means that can be devised for decreasing the charges consistent with the safety and defence of the settlements and the nature of the service. I have already laid before you a plan for the reduction of the marine, and as the season is now arrived I desire it may be taken into consideration. I shall now give you my sentiments on some other branches of our expenses. The Honourable Court of Directors in the 68th and 69th paragraphs of their commands of the 6th April 1770 are pleased to direct that the infantry on this establishment do consist of one regiment containing two battalions of Europeans and two battalions of sepoys; and that the two battalions of Europeans, exclusive of the field officers, are to consist in the whole, commissioned officers non-commissioned officers and privates, of 1562 men, and the two battalions of sepoys, including commissioned and non-commissioned European and Black officers, of 2042 men. They were not pleased in these commands to give directions regarding the artillery. But in those of the 18th March 1768 they direct the artillery shall consist of four companies, making together 302 men including the field and all other officers. These numbers make 3906 men exclusive of the General and five Field officers of infantry, who, added to the above, make 3912 men. Our establishment on the island, and at Surat Tellicherry and Anjengo, consists of 7755 men, officers and privates including 609 Tivis and 32 Nairs at Tellicherry and 544 topasses here and 86 at Tellicherry and Anjengo, which together make 1271. This leaves for the infantry, artillery, sepoys, and lascars 6484. The Honourable the Court of Directors in their commands of 18th March were pleased to declare that the establishment they then ordered was intended for garrisoning the island and subordinates, but it is, I believe, universally allowed not to be sufficient. Our present establishment wants no more than 71 of doubling the number ordered by them, and the number belonging to the island alone being 5410 exceeds their establishment by 1498. I propose therefore to your consideration whether a regiment of infantry including the General and all the field and other officers consisting of 1772 men composed of the Europeans and the topasses doing\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Consultation 26th Oct. 1770, Pub. Diary 56 of 1770, 566 - 567\nduty at Tellicherry and Anjengo, a corps of artillery consisting of 517 men including all officers and 209 lascars, three battalions of sepoys consisting of 2632 men, and the 727 Nairs and Tivis at Tellicherry will be sufficient for the service of this whole Presidency. This establishment will consist of 5648 men whose monthly pay will amount to Rs. 57,487-3-17. The present establishment consists of 7755 men whose monthly pay amounts to Rs. 77,149-2-98. The establishment ordered by the Court of Directors is 3912 men at the net monthly charges of Rs. 47,849-0-20, allowing for no commissioned or non-commissioned officers or the staff surgeons nor cadets whose allowances, Rs. 2398-1-43, added to that sum cause it to amount to Rs. 50,247-0-63 monthly. The establishment I propose provides for all those officers and 1736 men more than that ordered by the Court of Directors at the additional monthly expense of Rs. 7240-2-54. It will reduce the present establishment by 2107 men and decrease the monthly pay Rs. 19,661-3-81; many contingent charges must decrease also. For your fuller information a statement is annexed particularizing the establishment as ordered by the Company, as it now stands, and as I propose it should be. The annual amount of pay to the establishment I propose will be Rs. 6,89,852, from whence deducting Rs. 2,20,000, the amount of the pay and allowances to the garrisons of Surat Tellicherry and Anjengo as reduced by General Wedderburn\u2019s plan, the remaining charge of Rs. 4,69,844 will fall on the island only, and with house-rent oil and peon-money being Rs. 37,370 a year, will amount to Rs. 5,07,214 for the pay and allowances to 3369 officers and privates included under the head of garrison charges. The head of garrison charges on the books of 1760-61 for 3142 men on the island, including 381 peons and 162 invalids, amounted to no more than Rs. 3,03,049-0-41: on the books of 1770-71 it amounted to Rs. 8,12,830-1-12 for 5006 men including 386 peons and 347 invalids. On close of the books of 1773, provided my plan is adopted, it may be expected not to exceed Rs. 5,60,000 for 4102 allowing for 386 peons and 347 invalids, in which case the yearly difference in our expenses between 1771 and 1773 will be Rs. 2,52,830. When it is considered that the number of Europeans, sepoys, and lascars is much greater than it was in the year 1760; that the increase of pay to the sepoys of every denomination and the addition of Europeans and augmentation of Black officers to sepoy corps, which took place in the years 1763 and 1769, occasions the expense of the proposed strength to exceed by the sum of Rs. 70,482 the charge of the like number till the year 1763; and that the increase occasioned by officers of higher rank in the staff and additional pay to commissioned officers of every rank amounts to upwards of Rs. 88,000 a year, and that the allowance for house-rent is double what it was in 1760-61, it follows that proportionably the garrison charges for the year 1772-73 will not exceed those of 1760-61. I have received certain intelligence that the French have sent to Europe 3000 of the troops they had at Mauritius, and that they were at the Cape, 20th March last, on their return on five large ships. We therefore need not\nhesitate to make our reductions on account of the reports we have heard of their having intended to transport that force to India. At the same time to obviate any objection that may be made to disbanding so many disciplined troops, I propose that the Chief of Surat be directed to endeavour to induce the Nabob to take them into his pay under the same control as those in the service of the Nabob of Arcot in lieu of the irregulars he now has. If he declines accepting them they may be discharged.\n\nThe monthly expense of the fortifications has been very high. I therefore propose that the labourers employed thereon should be reduced to 1200 or 1500 men, and also if possible to lower the artificers' and labourers' pay under what they at present receive. The charge of the storekeeper and his assistants, the engineer practitioners, engineers, surveyors, cadets, overseers, and others amounts according to the accompanying account to upwards of Rs. 2300 a month.\u00b9 I conceive\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 **Fortification Establishment, March 1772.**\n\n| Engineer | Rs. q. r. |\n|----------|-----------|\n| 1st.

In those of 25th March 1768, para 159, they direct that Captain Burr\u2019s yearly salary of \u00a3300 shall be in full of all allowances on account of that station. In their commands of 31st March 1769, para 104, they expect and require that no allowances be at any time made to their military unless warranted by their orders or by the practice of their other Presidencies. And they mention that on account of the gratuities added to the pay of their military officers they hoped we had of our own accord withdrawn every extra allowance whatever. Under the 6th April 1770, para 15, they direct the marine establishment to be adjusted on the most frugal terms possible.

We are of opinion the proposals herein contained are of too much importance to be immediately decided on, though we are in general desirous to concur with the President in every suitable reduction. The consideration of the whole is therefore deferred till our next meeting.\n\nOn the 3rd March 1773, agreeable to order in the previous Consultation, Colonel Robert Gordon laid before the Board a letter regarding the military establishment. On this the Board observe: The Colonel lays before us a letter, agreeable to order in our last Consultation, containing his sentiments on the military establishment and respecting the reduction proposed by the President under the 30th of June, as also on the letter from Messrs. Shaw and Garden dated the 8th of July. The Board then proceeded to take into consideration the military establishment at this Presidency and the subordinates, the minutes of Consultation, and several papers relative thereto under the 30th of June and 8th of July. Upon discussing the matter it was determined not to reduce any part of the force at present on foot, as since the President's statement was drawn out, upwards of 1300 men have been detached to garrison Broach, till the Committee of Defence has given us its sentiments on the establishment of forces necessary in their opinion both in peace and war. The only exception is in regard to the topasses who are generally allowed to be but an useless body of people, and were mostly raised about the month of March 1769 by reason that the battalions of European infantry were then very incomplete. As the contrary is now the case, and as from the present situation of the Honourable Company's affairs we have no prospect that it will be necessary to send any of our forces into the field, we are of opinion that it is a very proper juncture to ease our Honourable Employers of the expense they incur by the topasses. It is accordingly resolved and ordered that all the topasses at present in pay on the island without distinction being in number about 320 be discharged from the Honourable Company's service. But as they are a sort of people who are more proper to mount guard at the M\u00e1ndvi or Custom House than Europeans, and as it is probable that some of them may plead their age and long services in order to gain a pension, it is agreed that out of these a number not to exceed 40 be retained as reliefs for the Custom House Guard at the monthly pay of Rs. 6.\n\nReferring to the above order of the 3rd March the Committee of Defence submitted a report on which the Board passed the following orders on the 12th March 1773: The Committee of Defence acquainted the Board that agreeable to their resolution under the 26th ultimo and 3rd instant it had met and maturely considered of the force requisite for this garrison and for its extensive works, as well in time of peace as of war. It now delivers to the Board an establishment of forces\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Consultation 30th June 1772, Pub. Diary 61 of 1772, 617.\n2 Bom. Gov. Consultation 3rd Mar. 1773, Pub. Diary 63 of 1773, 140-141.\nrequisite for the proper defence of this place in war. In respect to the peace establishment the President informs the Board that he adheres to the opinion he gave in his letter to the Board under the 30th of June last, in which opinion Mr. Watson joins. But Colonel Gordon differing in opinion from those gentlemen now lays before the Board an establishment of forces in his opinion requisite for the garrison in time of peace. Both these estimates are ordered to follow this Consultation for the notice of our Honourable Employers, together with a list of the sentries judged necessary by the Colonel for the works. Upon this the consideration of the subject is resumed, and, after mature deliberation, the following resolution is taken thereon: The Board observe that if the battalions of infantry exceed in number the establishment fixed by the Honourable Company in their commands of the 6th of April 1770 it is owing to the large number of recruits sent out from England and consequently no reduction can be made in the number of officers posted to each battalion. The Board concurs with the President in his opinion of the sepoy establishment as stated in his letter and plan entered under the 30th of June last. It is therefore resolved and ordered that in future the establishment for the necessary services of the Presidency and for the garrison of Surat shall consist of two battalions with the addition at present of one battalion for the garrison of Broach. That each battalion of sepoys shall consist of eight companies, each company of 90 private sepoys, making 720 private sepoys to each battalion with the following officers to a battalion, namely one captain, two lieutenants, two ensigns, eight European sergeants, one commandant, eight subbedars, sixteen jumbledars, forty havaldars, forty naiks, two trumpeters, twenty-four tom-toms, one adjutant, five sabnises with one head sabnis to the whole, and eight watermen. The officers that by this establishment become supernumerary are not to be discharged, but to be kept up as supernumerary to each battalion and incorporated as vacancies happen. Owing to our having put a stop to the enlisting of any more sepoys under the 8th of July last, the number of private sepoys is nearly reduced by death and desertion to the establishment now resolved on. When they are brought to this establishment they must be kept up with young able-bodied recruits of a proper size who must be approved by the Muster Master previous to their being admitted into the service or their names being entered upon the muster rolls. As we are fully convinced that the monthly pay of Rs. 6 to a sepoy will be always a full sufficient inducement for any number to enter the service that may be wanted, without it being necessary to pay any bounty on this account as was some time ago allowed, it is resolved that no enlisting money be ever paid in future. The establishment of sepoys above resolved on is one hundred and nine sepoys to a battalion less than the establishment of the Honourable Company in their commands of the 6th of April 1770. The European and Black officers are also considerably fewer in number in proportion to the privates, nevertheless we are of opinion the duty of the battalions may very well be done as they are now modelled, and the expense of each will in time be considerably less by the dropping off of officers, by which the supernumerary ones will be incorporated in their stead, and no promotions made till those are all provided for.\nBoard wish it was in their power to adhere to the last military establishment ordered from home of the 6th of April 1770. They are of opinion it is too small for this place and the subordinates, and they flatter themselves the reasons that have induced them to deviate from it and which have been laid before the Honourable the Court of Directors will prove sufficient for their justification. The President observes to the Board that he has acquiesced in four battalions of sepoys being kept on foot, though three only were proposed by his letter of the 30th June, because one battalion is judged by the Broach Committee necessary for the garrison there, the possession of which place we had not acquired or even resolved to attempt at that time. Messrs. Shaw and Garden desire it may be minuted that they are still of the opinion mentioned in their letter laid before the Board on the 8th of July last, namely that the orders of the Honourable Company regarding their military establishment of the 6th of April 1770, which they have often since repeated, should be strictly adhered to and carried into execution, but as the Board do not think proper to acquiesce therein, they readily agree to the reduction that it is now in part made. Colonel Gordon declares that he adheres to the opinion he has given by the returns this day laid before the Board, and that no reduction ought therefore to take place. He observes that his predecessors Colonel Pemble and Brigadier-General Wedderburn were of the same opinion as appears by their respective letters.\n\nRegarding the state of the armoury and military stores, laboratory, and arsenal, Colonel Robert Gordon and other members of the Committee of Surveys report on the 7th November 1774: In discharge of the trust reposed in us by our Honourable Masters we beg leave to present your Honour a particular account of the present state of the garrison and are happy to inform you that on a survey made the 1st ultimo we found the armoury and military stores in good order, the laboratory and arsenal well provided and in excellent condition, and the granaries dry, well secured, and containing about 1066 mudds of batty and 6960 bags of rice which, considering the lateness of the season, is an ample stock.\n\nIn the same report the Committee add: The new works and fortifications agreeable to the plans, are in as great forwardness and as much work done as can possibly be expected from the few labourers which have lately been employed on them. For your Honour's more particular information on this head, we enclose you the surveyor's report specifying the different works carrying on with their progress from December 1773 to the last day of October 1774 with the number of superficial feet levelled on the Esplanade during that interval. The out-forts and forts are in as good condition as can be expected. We propose visiting them before the departure of the Thames, and are sorry the short period fixed for the sailing of the Europa puts it out of our power to make a report by her for the information of our Honourable\n\n---\n\n1 Bom.

On the 25th November following Government directed to record this letter in the diary.\\(^1\\)\n\nTwo weeks later, on the 20th November 1774, the same Committee of Surveys made a second report: Yesterday we visited the out-forts. We were informed that some of the magazines and store-rooms were not water-tight. We also found some gun carriages that want repairs. At present these out-forts are garrisoned by a sergeant and gunner, and a few invalids in each under the orders of a Captain of invalids, which are judged to be sufficient in these peaceable times. On the 25th November 1774 the Board ordered this report to be recorded.\\(^2\\)\n\nBefore the close of the year 1774 Government received instructions from the Court of Directors relating to the authority of Governors and Military Commanders. On the 13th April 1774 the Court write: We transmit you by this conveyance copy of such parts of our instructions to our Governor General and Council at Fort William as relate to the separate authority of our Governors and Military Commanders respectively. We have only to direct that you consider every instruction and regulation therein contained in the same point of view as though formed for your Presidency and that you proceed accordingly to carry them into immediate execution so far as local circumstances will permit. By the above instructions to the Governor General and Council of Fort William, you will observe that Commissions are to be given to the Governors of our several Settlements similar to that of Mr. Hastings. In consequence of that regulation we now transmit a Commission to Mr. Hornby Governor of the Presidency of Bombay, appointing him Commander-in-Chief of the Fort and Garrison of Bombay.\\(^3\\)\n\nOn the 12th December 1774 the following instructions relative to the military authority of the Governor were published: It having been determined that the instructions relative to the military authority of the Governors of the Company's respective Presidencies together with the Governor's Commission should be published this day (12th December 1774), the necessary orders were in consequence given to the Commanding Officer and the Gentlemen of Council were desired to meet the Governor for that purpose. The Honourable Company's Covenant Servants, the Mayor's Court, and other European and Native inhabitants were also summoned to attend. Accordingly this morning the regiment of Infantry, the battalion of Artillery, and the two battalions of sepoys were drawn up on the Green before the Castle when the Honourable the President with the Gentlemen of Council and the Brigadier General at eight o'clock proceeded to the Green where the Honourable Company's Covenant Servants and the other European also the Native inhabitants were\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Committee of Surveys Report 7th Nov. 1774, Pub.

The President walked along the line and was saluted by every Officer as he passed. After this, being returned to the centre, the following papers were read by the Secretary in the usual manner: The 34th and 35th paragraphs of the Honourable Court's commands to this Presidency, dated the 18th of April last, received per Stafford: Extract from the Honourable Court's commands to the Governor General and Council at Fort William, dated the 29th of March last, relative to the military authority of the Governors of the respective Presidencies received at the same time with the foregoing: The Honourable the Court of Directors' Commission constituting the President Governor and Commander-in-Chief of this Castle Garrison and Town: And, lastly, the Commission granted by the Honourable the Court of Directors to the Brigadier General, being in consequence of the foregoing, wherein he is styled Commander of the Forces instead of Commander-in-Chief as before. After reading the above a salute of 19 guns was fired from the Castle and the like number from the Field Pieces to the right of the Line which also fired three volleys and gave three huzzas when the salute was taken up by such vessels as were in the road.\n\nIn the beginning of 1775 the requirements of the lately conquered Salsette called for an increase to the military force at Bombay. In December 1774 an additional battalion was ordered and one more was deemed necessary. Besides application had to be made for a loan of military force to the other two Presidencies of Bengal and Madras. A Consultation of the 3rd January 1775 records: By the force that is indispensably obliged to be maintained on Salsette, our own garrison is so considerably reduced that we think it becomes us to apply to one of the other Presidencies for military aid till we be properly recruited. As, when occasion required it, we have assisted the other Presidencies with both men and stores, we can make no doubt but that our Honourable Employers will approve our making such an application. Resolved therefore that we write the President and Council at Fort St. George for two companies of European infantry and one complete battalion of sepoys. We shall return these when we are properly recruited. We shall probably receive them sooner, if they are sent by land to Anjengo. That route must therefore be recommended to them, unless direct conveyances should offer for this place. A week after, on the 10th January, the Board continue: Sensible as we were that a considerable part of the military force destined for the defence of the Presidency would for the present be required for maintaining the proper posts on Salsette, we therefore resolved under the 12th ultimo to raise an additional battalion of sepoys to be termed the fifth battalion. The General in the letter before us urgently recommends the raising two battalions. In the necessity of this measure we cannot help concurring as, from the General's accounts, at least for the present, a much larger force than was at first supposed appears to be absolutely requisite for the\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 12th Dec. 1774 Vol. 66 of 1774, 867-869.\n2 Bom. Gov. Consultation 3rd Jan. 1775, Pub. Diary 67 of 1775, 6.\ndefence of S\u00e1lsette. Resolved therefore unanimously that two new battalions of sepoys (including the one it was agreed to raise on the 12th ultimo) shall be raised and completed as expeditiously as possible. These battalions as to officers, non-commissioned officers, and private men, are to be on the same footing as the other sepoy battalions, and are to be termed the fifth and sixth battalions.\n\nIn the same year, 1775, more topasses were also entertained. The diary of the 14th January has the following entry: About eighty topasses lately offered to enter into the military, who have been enlisted and drafted into the European companies. As men are at this time much wanted, the Brigadier General requests to have their pay fixed. Agreed that they be allowed Rs. 6 a month for their subsistence, and Re. 1 a month for their clothing in like manner as those that are kept for the M\u00e1ndvi guard, that is Re. 1 a month less than the topasses were formerly allowed.\n\nLater in the same year (1775) orders were received from the Court disapproving any proposal for an increase in military strength and recommending reduction. The entries of the Select Committee's Consultations in the Secret and Political Diary attracted the attention of the Court to the expected increase of military force. To prevent this increase on the 12th April 1775, the Court write: On your Select Consultations we find the garrison proposed by one of the members of the Committee of Defence for Bombay in time of war consists of 14,776 men besides inhabitants, surgeons, attendants in the hospitals, and others, which he says will render the whole number equal to 20,000. On this we remark that our whole force at Madras when besieged by the French was 1758 Europeans including horse, infantry, and artillery, and 2220 sepoys and also about 200 horse belonging to the Nabob who were of no use to us. And if the fortifications of Bombay have been extended so far as to require the number set down in the estimate to man the works, we have reason to lament that any new works have been undertaken, being fully of opinion that if the old walls had been left as they stood many years ago, the interest of the money which has been sunk in fortifications since that time would have maintained troops sufficient to have rendered the place impregnable to the combined forces of Indostan and to have secured it from any attack which the French were capable of making in that quarter. As the Island of Bombay is small and the places where landing is practicable are few and not distant from the town; as the disembarkation of troops, stores, and artillery is tedious and the advantage of fresh troops over troops just landed from a long voyage without cannon must be very considerable, and as a retreat under the guns of the fort is at all events practicable, we persuade ourselves that with a good field train the troops we have at Bombay will at all time be able to prevent a regular siege unless a more formidable enemy should land upon that island than we have reason to believe will ever be sent against it. So long as a British\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Consultation 10th Jan. 1775, Pub. Diary 67 of 1775, 17.\n2 Bom. Gov. Consultation 14th Jan. 1775, Pub. Diary 67 of 1775, 40-41.

And so long as we maintain our superiority at Bengal and Madras we shall be able to provide those succours on the shortest warning. It is therefore our order that our infantry at Bombay non-commissioned officers included, and including also every command and detachment for the subordinates be forthwith reduced to 1200 Europeans. That the artillery corps do consist of 312 Europeans and no more, non-commission officers bombardiers and gunners included. That the corps of black troops be reduced to 3000 sepoys. That all black forces (except the above 3000 sepoys) such as topasses, Nairs, Tivis, or any other denomination, be disbanded. That no greater number of European commission officers be appointed to the said black troops than the establishment shall of necessity require. That all officers who shall become supernumerary by this reform do continue to receive their pay and that they succeed to commands as vacancies shall happen according to seniority in their respective corps. That all European non-commission officers and private men over and above the said establishment be sent to Fort St. George or Fort William according to such requisitions as shall be made from those settlements respectively or from either of them by our orders.\n\nOn the need of repairs to the magazines and store-rooms the Commandant of Artillery, Mr. Newton Burr, writes to Brigadier-General Robert Gordon on the 17th January 1776: I beg leave to represent to you that the cruisers as also the shot yard magazines in the Castle, which have been made from old store-rooms, are not only very improper but dangerous for this purpose. Two great objections to them are: First, the inner doors have large iron hinges with staples and hoops of the same metal. Secondly, the floors being on a level with the terreplein of the Castle, occasions their being damp great part of the year. This might be entirely remedied by having a proper flooring of plank in lieu of the old broken pavement. The flooring of the royal magazine is greatly damaged by white ants, to repair which no time ought to be lost. As some new magazines at Fort George and Cumberland Ravelin are now almost, if not quite, fit for receiving powder, I judged it my duty to give you this information.\n\nOn receipt of this through the Brigadier General the Board on the 18th January 1776 observe: The Brigadier General lays before us a letter addressed to him by the Director of the Laboratory setting forth the necessity of some repairs being made to the magazines in the Castle, and proposing that the powder should in the meantime be removed into the new magazines in Fort George. An estimate is ordered to be made of what these repairs will amount to, and the powder is to be immediately removed.\n\n---\n\n1 Court to Bombay 12th April 1775 paras 25 - 28, Pub. Dep.

Diary 69 of 1776, 9.\nAgreeably to this order Mr. Lawrence Nilson Acting Principal Engineer, on the 30th January 1776, reports: Having in obedience to your Honours' commands surveyed the magazines mentioned by Major Burr in his letter to General Gordon, I found the ceilings of both very much decayed insomuch that if they are not removed there is danger of them falling down in a year's time; the doors of said magazines are also insecure and require new ones to be made, being exposed to the open square of the Castle, so that the bursting of a bombshell before either of those doors might force them open. If therefore an arched passage be made as marked in the plan with the doors as there laid down, it would perfectly secure the magazines. And as it will be necessary shortly to remove the pavement and ceilings that are over these magazines, they might be made bombproof at the same time. The accompanying plan shews their dimensions and the quantity of masonry required for their alteration, the amount of which the enclosed estimate does also determine. I have also surveyed the royal magazine and found the flooring so much damaged by the white ants that it will be necessary to remove the powder and have a new flooring laid before any powder can again be put into it. The estimate for executing this work does also accompany this. As we are in great want of timber and neither of these works can be begun before the quantity required for either is brought up, I request the favour that your Honours will be pleased to direct that it be purchased and likewise five corge of large timber and three corge of small wanted for the immediate service of the Castle and Fort George. The present great scarcity of chunam renders it my duty to represent to your Honours the necessity there is for five hundred khandis being regularly delivered to the works every month, and that three thousand khandis be laid up for the use of the new fortifications during the rainy season.\n\nOn perusing the same day the above letter the Board observe: Read a letter from the Acting Principal Engineer enclosing an estimate of repairing the magazines in the Castle amounting to Rs. 8035. As this work is absolutely necessary it must be completed accordingly. The new fortification paymaster must be directed to lay in the necessary quantities of timber and chunam upon the most reasonable terms.\n\nAs regards the allowance to be paid to disabled soldiers for which there existed no rules, Government on the 6th February 1776 direct: The Muster Master reports to the Board that a number of disabled soldiers have lately arrived from the army, and that no regulation exists respecting the subsistence to be allowed to such persons from the time of their being disabled until an opportunity offers for their proceeding to Europe. As he requests our directions for his guidance the following allowances are ordered to be made in future to soldiers under the above description: To sergeants of infantry and artillery Rs. 9 a month, or if they have lost a limb Rs. 12 a month;\n\n---\n\n1 Principal Engineer Mr. L.

But that they do refer all complaints respecting them to the Chief or Senior Civil Servant of the settlement whose orders they may be under.\n\nOn the 18th June 1776 Government determine the allowance to be paid to Bhand\u00e1ris when employed as militia: The Bhand\u00e1ris who were lately employed as militia have repeatedly requested to be allowed provisions during the time they served. We think this request reasonable and therefore order that they be paid for the time past at the rate of Rs. 2 a month, and that upon future occasions the following monthly allowances be observed: Rice one man and 11 shers, dal 20 shers, ghi four shers, wood 90 billets, besides tobacco money.\n\nOn the 1st November 1776 Government resolve that it be made a standing order to be observed in all garrisons and detachments under this Presidency that no sepoys officers or privates be tried but by a court martial composed of Black officers.\n\nWith a view to regulate the Subhed\u00e1rs' and Jam\u00e1d\u00e1rs' pay, on the 22nd January 1777, Government direct: There is a great and most unreasonable disproportion between the pay of the subhed\u00e1rs and jam\u00e1d\u00e1rs of sepoys; the subhed\u00e1rs receive Rs. 54-1-60 and the jam\u00e1d\u00e1rs only Rs. 16\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) a month. It is therefore unanimously agreed to regulate the pay of these officers in a more equitable manner by subtracting Rs. 10 a month from the pay of the subhed\u00e1rs, and adding half of that sum to the pay of the jam\u00e1d\u00e1rs. By this method no additional expense will accrue to the Honourable Company. To prevent all discontent this regulation is not to affect the subhed\u00e1rs now in commission but only those created since the 1st instant (January 1777). Nor is it to take place with the jam\u00e1d\u00e1rs until, by the promotion of subhed\u00e1rs upon the reduced pay, a sufficient saving has accrued to afford the addition of the jam\u00e1d\u00e1rs' pay without any increase of expense.\n\nAs regards a corps of engineers, in their letter of the 16th April 1777, the Court write: We observe you have appointed a sufficient number of officers for forming a corps of engineers who\n\n---\n\n1 Bom.

Their pay is not to exceed the rate given below which is the same as at our other settlements, namely Lieutenant-Colonel \u00a3900 a year; Major \u00a3550; Captain \u00a32371; Lieutenant \u00a3127\u00bd; Ensign \u00a391\u00bc; Total \u00a31906\u00bc.\n\nOn the 6th June 1777 Government resolved that in future a clause be inserted in the commissions of the sepoy officers, subjecting them to the orders only of European commission officers, and that a garrison order subjecting jam\u00e1d\u00e1rs to the command of sergeants when on guard be abrogated.\n\nA Consultation of the 22nd October 1777 records: Our Europeans are now encamped upon Old Woman\u2019s Island, being lodged in tents, while the barracks there built at a great expense, and in our opinion much better calculated for their accommodation and protection from the sun, are not made the least use of. Ordered that a committee consisting of the land and military paymasters, the commanding officer, and the principal engineer be ordered to survey the barracks and to report their present state and condition.\n\nAgreeably to the above order the Committee submitted the following report on the 25th October 1777: In obedience to your orders we have met and surveyed the barracks on Old Woman\u2019s island, and are of opinion they are at present out of repair, being in want of some tiles window-shutters doors and flooring.\n\nOn perusing the above report, on the 29th October 1777, Government direct: The necessary repairs as noticed by the Committee must immediately be given to these barracks, and they must be put in proper order for the reception of the Europeans now encamped in tents, who must be removed into them as soon as possible. In order to make them still more cool and airy, skylights must be opened in the roof of the veranda to the land side, and a small pent-house shed by way of veranda made to the west side. Small buildings must be erected distinct from the barracks to serve as a k\u00e1nj\u00ed or conjee, that is gruel or correction house, and a temporary hospital. As it will conduce much to the health of the Europeans, and to the preservation of discipline to keep them constantly in cantonments upon Old Woman\u2019s island, the Engineer must be directed to prepare plans and estimates of the expense of erecting a range of barracks sufficient to accommodate the officers of two battalions, and also a plan and estimate of the expense of building separate bungalows for them upon the plan proposed by Colonel Pemble in March 1770.\n\nA Consultation of the 7th December 1777 records: The Colonel lays before us a petition from the head and other sabnis\u00e9s of the\n\n---\n\n1 Court to Bombay 16th April 1777 para. 44, Pub.

This they represent to be by no means sufficient for their subsistence and therefore request it may be increased. As the Captains of the battalions have certified under the petition that the smallness of the pay prevents their getting people equal to the duty required of them, it is agreed to augment the pay of the head sabnis to Rs. 12 and of the others to Rs. 8 which the reduction formerly made in the number of sabnises will enable us to afford without any increase of expense to the Company.\n\nA Consultation of the 7th December records: The establishment of artillery lascars necessary for the service of this place and the out-garrisons being now considered, Colonel Egerton lays before us a statement of the number in his opinion requisite. Respecting this he acquaints us he has consulted with the Commandant of Artillery. By this statement it appears that a body of 500 lascars will be sufficient for the service of Bombay Salsette Surat and Broach, which the Colonel proposes to distribute in the following manner: Bombay and Salsette 400, Broach 50, and Surat 50, total 500. This establishment is therefore approved and fixed. And it is resolved to divide them into five companies and to post one syrang and four tindals to each company according to the Madras Regulation. The proposal from the Engineer, conveyed by Colonel Egerton in his letter read the 3rd instant, for annexing to that corps a body of Lascar Pioneers is then considered and as a corps of that kind is indispensably necessary, it is resolved that a company of one hundred lascars be for the present appointed for that purpose upon the same footing as the artillery lascars and be put under the principal engineer. This will be but a small increase of expense as there are now by the establishment above settled upwards of sixty supernumerary lascars in the artillery which are to be transferred to the Pioneer company.\n\nA Consultation of the 25th February 1778 records: The European infantry is to be forthwith incorporated into one battalion agreeable to our resolution of the 14th ultimo. This battalion is to consist of two grenadier companies and eight battalion companies for the Presidency and two additional companies for the garrison of Broach as proposed by the Colonel. These companies, agreeable to a statement of our European force now laid before us by the Colonel, will consist of two grenadier companies of 70 each, 140; eight infantry companies of 50 each, 400; two companies for Broach of 65 each, 130; total 670. Exclusive of the above, there will be a nominal 13th company consisting of the Trivis at Tellicherry under the command of Captain Whippey. A Captain and three lieutenants are to be posted to each of the grenadier companies and a Captain one lieutenant and two ensigns to each of the battalion companies. The twelve senior captains are to have the command of the companies. And as by this new arrangement several will be deprived of their companies, it is resolved and ordered that all the Captains as well those who command companies as those\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov.

No further promotions of commission or non-commission officers are to be made in the infantry till the number is reduced to the proper complement of the battalion as now modelled. The staff and surgeon for one battalion only must be retained and the supernumerary ones of those last appointed struck off.\n\nThe battalion surgeons having applied to be placed on the same pay as the military surgeons at Madras, on the 18th March 1778 Government observe: As we are unacquainted with their allowances at that Presidency, it is resolved to write to the President and Council for information. But as we are sensible the pay of our battalion surgeons is unequal to their support, it is also resolved to allow them in the meantime ten shillings a day as their pay exclusive of the allowances for house-rent and a palanquin.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 13th May 1778, Colonel Egerton's proposal for appointing two sabnis to the artillery Lascars was taken into consideration. It was thought that one head sabnis and five assistant sabnis, the number allowed to each battalion, was too large being much greater than the establishment at Madras, where it appears only one sabnis and one assistant sabnis are allowed. It is therefore agreed to allow only one head and two assistant sabnis to each battalion which we think will be fully sufficient. And as the increase in the number of lascars makes such appointment necessary, it is further agreed to allow an assistant to the artillery purvoc to be on the footing of a common sabnis. A sabnis general for the whole sepoy establishment appearing to be a necessary office, it is agreed to allow a monthly addition of Rs. 4 to his pay.\n\n### Sepoy Pay Stoppages and Cost, 13th April 1778\n\n| Rank                  | Number | Monthly Pay | Monthly Stoppages | Yearly Stoppages | Cost of Clothing | Difference of Stoppages and Clothing | Total Cost of Rank |\n|-----------------------|--------|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| Subbedars Commandant  | 1      | Rs. q. r    | Rs. q. r          | Rs. q. r        | Rs. q. r         | Rs. q. r                            | Rs. q. r           |\n| Ditto Grenadier       | 2      | Rs. q. r    | Rs. q. r          | Rs. q. r        | Rs. q. r         | Rs. q. r                            | Rs. q. r           |\n| Ditto Battalion       | 3      | Rs. q. r    | Rs. q. r          | Rs. q. r        | Rs. q. r         | Rs. q. r                            | Rs. q. r           |\n| Jumledars Grenadier   | 4      | Rs. q. r    | Rs. q. r          | Rs. q. r        | Rs. q. r         | Rs. q. r                            | Rs. q. r           |\n| Ditto Battalion       | 5      | Rs. q. r    | Rs. q. r          | Rs. q. r        | Rs. q. r         | Rs. q. r                            | Rs. q. r           |\n| Sergeant Major        | 6      | Rs. q. r    | Rs. q. r          | Rs. q. r        | Rs. q. r         | Rs. q. r                            | Rs. q. r           |\n| Ditto Grenadier       | 7      | Rs. q. r    | Rs. q. r          | Rs. q. r        | Rs. q. r         | Rs. q. r                            | Rs. q. r           |\n| Ditto Battalion       | 8      | Rs. q. r    | Rs. q. r          | Rs. q. r        | Rs. q. r         | Rs. q. r                            | Rs. q. r           |\n| Havildars Grenadier   | 9      | Rs. q. r    | Rs. q. r          | Rs. q. r        | Rs. q. r         | Rs. q. r                            | Rs. q. r           |\n| Ditto Battalion       | 10     | Rs. q. r    | Rs. q. r          | Rs. q. r        | Rs. q. r         | Rs. q. r                            | Rs. q. r           |\n| Naika Grenadier       | 11     | Rs. q. r    | Rs. q. r          | Rs. q. r        | Rs. q. r         | Rs. q. r                            | Rs. q. r           |\n| Ditto Battalion       | 12     | Rs. q. r    | Rs. q. r          | Rs. q. r        | Rs. q. r         | Rs. q. r                            | Rs. q. r           |\n| Sepoys Grenadier      | 13     | Rs. q. r    | Rs. q. r          | Rs. q. r        | Rs. q. r         | Rs. q. r                            | Rs. q. r           |\n| Ditto Battalion       | 14     | Rs. q. r    | Rs. q. r          | Rs. q. r        | Rs. q. r         | Rs. q. r                            | Rs. q. r           |\n| Bhuddars Grenadier    | 15     | Rs. q. r    | Rs. q. r          | Rs. q. r        | Rs. q. r         | Rs. q. r                            | Rs. q. r           |\n| Ditto Battalion       | 16     | Rs. q. r    | Rs. q. r          | Rs. q. r        | Rs. q. r         | Rs. q. r                            | Rs. q. r           |\n| Drum and Fife Majo    | 17     | Rs. q. r    | Rs. q. r          | Rs. q. r        | Rs. q. r         | Rs. q. r                            | Rs. q. r           |\n| Drums and Pipes       | 18     | Rs. q. r    | Rs. q. r          | Rs. q. r        | Rs. q. r         | Rs. q. r                            | Rs. q. r           |\n\nDeduct lost by Jumledars:\n2 Grenadier at Rs. 4-2-84 each\n16 Battalion at Rs. 3-0-7 each\n\nTotal\n\n---\n\n1 Bom.

As Colonel Cockburn regularly signified to the Chief his intention of sending Captain Gordon to relieve Captain Panton, the Chief should have permitted it, as it does not appear that he has any good reason for wishing to continue Captain Panton at Ghodbandar. To prevent all future cause for complaint on this head, it is resolved and ordered that at Salsette and all our settlements where there are out-posts, a proper roster be kept and the officers in command be regularly relieved.\n\nTo meet the expense to which officers were put in transporting their baggage to and from camp, Government, on the 14th January 1778, order: The Colonel representing to us the necessity of our making some allowance to the officers for transporting their baggage off and from camp on Old Woman's island, it is resolved that Rs. 4 be allowed to a Captain and Rs. 2 to a subaltern each time going to and from camp.\n\nThe same year, 1778, the Diary of the 21st October records: It being judged highly proper to appoint an officer to take charge of the Mahim militia in quality of adjutant and to discipline them at Mahim, it is resolved that Lieut. Parker be appointed adjutant with the usual allowances and that he likewise take the command of Mahim subject to the orders of the Chief to whom he must make reports.\n\nIn (August) 1779 Government appointed a committee to frame regulations respecting the issue of arms and accoutrements of the troops. On the 23rd August 1779 the committee submitted the following report: To fulfil the orders of this Honourable Board, dated the 15th ultimo, as amply as in our power, we have framed the accompanying regulations which we submit to you, gentlemen, confiding that their being enforced by your authority will be productive of the good end to be wished. The person so repeatedly alluded to in the course of these regulations by the title of commissary or principal quartermaster is become no less necessary for the execution of the duties imposed by these regulations than the military storekeeper in establishing uniformity and brevity in the accounts of the military store office. By ever being on the spot the commissary or principal quartermaster will be able to adjust when called on, whereas at present each quartermaster of the battalions of sepoys being liable as the service may require to sudden removal from the Presidency, the military storekeeper is deprived of the necessary adjustment whence irregularities must consequently ensue in his office.\n\nThe following regulations respecting the arms and accoutrements of the troops are therefore proposed: Whenever any non-commissioned officer\n\n---\n\n1 Bom.

As it is the duty of every officer to see that the men keep their accoutrements in good order, the commanding officer will in consequence give orders that Captains of companies and sepoy battalions do review their companies and battalions once every week and that the Captain of each company or battalion does report the same to his respective commanding officer. No indent of military stores for the immediate use of the troops either in the field or garrison is to be complied with by the military storekeeper, commissary, or quartermaster unless the same be certified by the commanding officer of each regiment or corps on the spot or countersigned by the commanding officer of the troops, and unless the motives for such indents are therein to be specified. That the commanding officer of corps take particular care that their quartermasters keep a very exact account of receipts and expenditure of arms and accoutrements and that they settle with the commissary appointed for that purpose at the end of every month. When a soldier or sepoy is by sentence of a court martial ordered under stoppages, such stoppages must be mentioned in each pay roll given to the military paymaster, who will stop the whole and pay the money so stopped to the military storekeeper which amount must be brought to credit on his books. No exchange of any arms or accoutrements shall take place unless for immediate service before they have been regularly surveyed by the committee for that service. Every battalion or body of troops must therefore keep their unserviceable arms or accoutrements till the end of every month, when after having reported their number and quality to the commanding officer of the troops, he may order them to be examined by the committee. After this he may order them to be exchanged if found unserviceable; and for want of having such arms or accoutrements immediately exchanged when the troops may be in want of them each company should be directed to have a certain number of spare arms and accoutrements full ten of each sort. That field officers and commandants of battalions be strictly required to have a watchful eye that their captains and officers in charge of companies are very exact not only in keeping their arms and accoutrements in constant good order that nothing may be wanting for a march on the shortest notice, but also that they keep a constant and regular account with their quartermaster.\n\n1 The following are the details:\n\n| Cost of Arms and Accoutrements, 1779. |\n|---------------------------------------|\n| Rs. q. r.                             |\n| An Halberd                            | 4 3 0 |\n| A brass-mounted Sword                 | 3 0 38 |\n| A Musquet and Bayonet with Steel Ramrod | 12 0 75 |\n| A Bayonet                            | 0 2 31 |\n| A Scabbard for a Bayonet              | 0 1 84 |\n| Ditto for a Sword                     | 0 3 32 |\n| Extra Slings for a Musquet            | 1 1 91 |\n| A Steel Ramrod                       | 0 2 0 |\n| Double Cartouch Boxes                 | 1 2 25 |\n| A Musquet Worm                        | 0 0 69 |\n| A Europe Picker and Brush             | 0 0 29 |\n| A Country Brass Picker                | 0 0 8 |\n| Ditto Leather Sword-belts             | 0 2 0 |\n| Europe ditto                          | 1 1 0 |\n| Brass mounting for a Musquet          | 0 2 36 |\n| Heel piece                            | 0 0 54 |\n| Side ditto                            | 0 0 56 |\n| Top ditto                             | 0 0 56 |\n| Middle ditto                          | 0 0 56 |\n| Tail ditto                            | 0 0 37\u00bd |\n| Brass Buckles for Pouch Slings        | 0 0 93\u00bd |\narmourers are allowed to every battalion it is expected an exchange of arms will seldom be wanted. The quartermasters of sepoy battalions are therefore to keep such armourers constantly employed and see that the repairs of arms are properly executed and that such armourers as are unfit for their place be immediately discharged. A committee or board of ordnance might be appointed who are to take exact and regular accounts accompanied by their vouchers from the commissary, the commandant of artillery, and the director of the laboratory, together with the officers or sergeants commanding outposts. This committee should report to the Honourable Board in cases of failure in the compliance of these orders and regulations or of any other orders that may hereafter be issued on this head. Such committee shall be ordered to sit every muster-day or the day following. This committee to consist of the commanding officer of the army, the military storekeeper, the principal engineer, and the commandant of artillery, and, in case the army is commanded by an officer who is not of the infantry, then the senior officer of that corps should be one of that committee. All returns for stores for the army must be made at the end of a month by all quartermasters of corps to the commissary for such quantity as the quartermasters deem necessary for the ensuing month in order that the commissary may therefrom frame his general monthly indent to the military storekeeper. That all officers who may at any time be promoted to companies or battalions of sepoys or otherwise ordered to take charge, if for a short time only during the absence or sickness of the commanding officer of such company or battalion, shall receive charge of the stores from the last officer who had charge of such company or battalion granting a receipt to his predecessor for the same. And if the balance so delivered shall not agree with the balance which stands on the books of such company or battalion, then shall the officer who had last charge of such company or battalion be compelled to make good to the Honourable Company the amount of the deficiency, which being received by the military storekeeper he shall give credit for on his books. The quartermasters, the commissary, the director of the laboratory, the commanding officer of the artillery, and officers and sergeants commanding outposts, shall in the like manner take and receive charge and report all deficiencies and the persons who had last charge of either office shall make good all deficiencies to the Honourable Company in like manner as directed by the last article. That a muster of all accoutrements supplied by the military storekeeper be delivered to each corps and to the commissary after having been first fixed and approved by the committee. That the persons appointed to receive them from the military stores are to receive none but such as are equal to muster. Lastly, the committee beg leave to recommend that all the different regulations herein proposed take place minutely at the subordinate settlements observing only that the office of commissary may be held by the senior quartermaster on the spot.\n\n1 Pub. Diary 76 of 1779, 523-529.\nOn the above report the Bombay Council on the 8th September observe: Read a report from the committee appointed to frame rules for the better regulation of the supplies of military accoutrements to the army and a set of regulations they have framed for that purpose and submit for our approbation. These regulations having been attentively considered appear well calculated to answer the end proposed, and are therefore approved and ordered to be strictly observed at Bombay, Surat, Broach, and Thana. In consequence of the committee's recommendation to establish a commissary of stores, it is agreed to appoint Lieutenant Daniel Carpenter to that office with a daily allowance of Rs. 4 and to abolish the office of garrison quartermaster. A board of ordnance is also appointed, consisting of the officers mentioned in the regulations, and they are duly to observe the rules laid down for their guidance.\n\nOn the 4th September of the same year, 1779, the commandant of artillery represented to Government the want of non-commissioned officers. He said: The peculiar distress the battalion of artillery is put to for want of non-commissioned officers and gunners, makes me think it a duty incumbent on me for the good of the service humbly to represent the case to your Honours. The establishment of non-commissioned officers gunners and matrosses, in a company of artillery on this Presidency is 3 sergeants, 3 corporals, 8 bombardiers, 12 gunners, 2 drums, and 72 matrosses. But from the many detachments at Surat, Broach, Thana, Tellicherry, and other extra duties such as sergeant-major, laboratory sergeant, magazine sergeant, quartermaster sergeant, sergeant at the light-house and Malabar Point, the deficiency is so great, that for these as well as many other obvious reasons, particularly when posted to the different works on the fortifications, gunners and matrosses are obliged to be entrusted with posts highly improper for them for want of non-commissioned officers. Under the Madras Regulations a company of artillery consists of 6 sergeants, 6 corporals, 10 bombardiers, 24 gunners, 2 drums, 2 fifes, and 58 matrosses. As this is a sufficient number of non-commissioned officers and gunners I take the liberty most humbly to propose to your Honours to augment and allow the same number of non-commissioned officers and gunners in a company of artillery here as at Madras. This will make the duty in future easy and regular and will be of more service to the Honourable Company. I flatter myself your Honours will take this proposal into your serious consideration.\n\nOn the above report, on the 29th September 1779, Government direct: Reperused the letter from the commandant of artillery read last Council day and referred to the records for the occasion of the artillery corps being augmented beyond the establishment ordered by the Honourable Company. From this we find that in December 1773 the Select Committee on a prospect of important service judged it expedient to add 100 private men to that corps but without increasing the\n\n---\n\n1 Bom.

Lieutenant-Colonel Nilson the commanding officer, being sent for and consulted on this subject, is of opinion that, from the variety of duties incident to the corps of artillery and the increased extent of our works, it is absolutely necessary to put that corps upon the same footing in respect to non-commissioned officers as at Madras. This measure is also strongly recommended by the commandant of artillery, and it appears consistent with reason that an increase of non-commissioned officers should be made in proportion to the number of private men added to each company since the establishment ordered by the Honourable Company. For these reasons it is unanimously resolved to put the four companies of artillery upon the same footing as at Madras, whereby each company, exclusive of commission officers, will consist of 6 sergeants, 6 corporals, 10 bombardiers, 20 gunners, 2 drummers, 2 fifes, 58 matrosses, total 104. It is further resolved that the sergeants at Old Woman's Island and Malabar Point shall be put on rolls as extraordinary and not considered as part of the strength of the artillery.\n\nAt a Consultation on the 16th February 1780, after reading a letter from the Board of Ordnance, the Council resolve that the terms fixed for the duration of accoutrements still appearing too short, in future no limit be fixed, but that they be kept in use so long as they are serviceable. The regulation respecting arms and accoutrements appearing very proper must be observed at this place and subordinates.\n\nOn the 13th May 1780, the Court write: We have appointed Major Richard Mathews, late of the Fort St. George establishment, whose services to the Company have been very meritorious, to be second in command of our forces under your Presidency, with the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel next under General Goddard.\n\nA Consultation of the 27th November 1782 records: Desertions being very frequent in this garrison and having great reason to conclude that many men are carried off by the Europe ships, it is resolved that it be made a general and standing order that immediately on the arrival of any of the Honourable Company\u2019s ships the Secretary do send off an official letter strictly forbidding them to receive any men belonging to this garrison upon any plea or pretext whatever, and declaring that any breach of this order will be followed by absolute and immediate dismissal from the Honourable Company\u2019s service.\n\nOn the 10th April 1784 Government decided what military honours were to be paid by the guards to the Governor and all officers in the Presidency. They also laid down directions for the officers at the saluting battery for the different salutes to be given to all ships going in and out of the harbour. The following is a copy of these orders: The Honourable the Governor to be received with rested arms, the drummer\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Consultation 29th Sept. 1779, Pub.

The Commander-in-Chief of the forces, if a Colonel only, under the Honourable the President and Council, to be received with rested arms, one ruffle to beat, and the officer to salute as often as he may pass. A Colonel, if not Commander-in-Chief, rested arms. A Lieutenant-Colonel, when in command of the garrison, to be received with rested arms by all guards as often as he may pass, but as Lieutenant-Colonel commandant of a battalion, to be received with shouldered arms. Majors to be received with ordered arms. All battalion guards to turn out and receive their commanding officer, provided he be a field officer, with rested arms. Should the battalion at any time be commanded by a Captain, such guard to receive him with shouldered arms. All sentinels to rest to the Honourable the Governor, to the Commander-in-Chief under the Presidency, to each member of the Board, and to all field officers commanding battalions as often as they pass. The Commander-in-Chief of His Majesty\u2019s fleet in the East Indies, when at Bombay, to be received with rested arms, the drums to beat three ruffles and the officer to salute as often as he passes. Captains of His Majesty\u2019s ships of three years\u2019 standing to be received with rested arms, Captains of less than three years\u2019 standing with shouldered, and masters and commanders with ordered arms. The hour that these honours are paid is from sunrise till eight o\u2019clock in the morning and from four o\u2019clock till sunset. At all other times the guards are to lodge their arms in the guard-room. But the Governor to be received at all hours. Sentinels without fixed bayonets to rest to all Majors once in their two hours, at all other times to stand shouldered when they pass. They are also to stand shouldered when any officer below the rank of a Major passes. Sentinels with fixed bayonets to handle their arms to all officers below the degree of a Lieutenant-Colonel. Sentinels of honour are not to rest their firelocks except to the officers on whom they are posted and to the Honourable Governor or Commander-in-Chief, but the sentries at the Governor\u2019s gate are to rest to him only. The directions to be observed by the officers at the saluting battery are: Whenever the Honourable the Governor embarks from or leaves the island he is to receive 19 guns; the Second of the Presidency, if appointed successor, 17; if not appointed successor, 15; the Brigadier-General, 15; a member of the Board, 13; but all Chiefs of subordinate Settlements, 15, and the same on their return to their seats at the Presidency; Colonels, 13; Lieutenant-Colonels and Majors embarking on or returning from service, 11 and 9. The Company\u2019s Commodore on his first going off after the rains and on the conclusion of the season, 11; India-men to be returned gun for gun, and their Captains on their arrival from England and leaving India, 9; Super-cargoes on their landing from England and leaving India, 11; but should they not land or embark together, the compliment to be paid to the Chief Super-cargoes only. All foreign Europe ships to be returned gun for gun. All foreign country ships to be returned two guns less. No salutes to be returned to English country ships. The Rear Admiral\u2019s ship on his dropping anchor, 15, and on his coming ashore, 15; Captains of three years\u2019 standing, 13; Post Captains under three years,\nAND ISLAND.\n\n11; Masters and Commanders, 9. If the Captains come on shore with the Admiral, the Admiral's salute is sufficient. If they come at different times, they are to be saluted according to their ranks before mentioned. If a fleet of men-of-war or two or three ships, one salute to the Commodore is sufficient for the whole. No salutes are to be fired from the saluting battery or any other place for any person entitled to such salute before they have waited upon the Honourable the Governor when the signal will be made at the Government House and none are to be saluted on leaving the island, but by particular orders from the Honourable the Governor, his Aid-de-Camp or the Town Major. This order to be copied in the orderly book at the saluting battery and is in future to be strictly adhered to.\n\nGuards and sentinels within the garrison: The Honourable the Governor's Guard consists of a subaltern and thirty men, sentries in proportion. The Commander-in-Chief or Commanding Officer is allowed an orderly sergeant from each corps and two sentries at his door. A Colonel has one sentry at his door. A Lieutenant-Colonel the same. A Major the same. If any corps is commanded by an officer under the degree of a field officer he is allowed a sentry to guard the colours if they be lodged at his quarters, but such sentries are from his own barrack guard. At present two sentries are posted at the door of the Second during the residence of the Honourable the Governor in the country.\n\nIn their letter of the 11th April 1785 the Court write: We direct that in future no larger sums than the following be paid to the officers of His Majesty's regiments for the expense of their passage from India. Lieutenant-Colonel and Major \u00a385, Captain \u00a380, all other commissioned officers and staff \u00a365. These said respective sums are to be paid to the several officers, each according to his rank before his departure from your settlement. You must not fail from time to time to advise us of such payments.\n\nOn the 13th January 1786 Government ordered that all Lieutenants who have passed for the country language be paid the usual allowance whether attached to the sepoy or European corps.\n\n---\n\n1 Pub.

Diary 88 of 1786, 23.\nSection II.\u2014Gunpowder.\n\nThe military records of the first hundred and ten years (1670-1780) of the Company\u2019s management of Bombay contain several references to the making of gunpowder. These can conveniently be gathered in one section.\n\nOn the 10th April 1670 the Surat Council observe: Bombay is in a continual want of saltpetre for making powder. Saltpetre cannot be supplied from Surat because the king\u2019s minister engrosses that commodity for his use. It is therefore thought convenient to enorder the Factors at K\u00e1rw\u00e1r, where its price is reasonable, to buy and lade upon the first ship that shall come thence 1000 mans of saltpetre. By this means the Bombay garrison will be recruited without being beholden to the king\u2019s officers here.\u00b9 The K\u00e1rw\u00e1r supply seems to have proved insufficient. In their letter to R\u00e1j\u00e1pur, on the 12th February 1676, the Surat Council write: We have received letters from Bombay wherein they desire to be supplied with 150 or 200 bales saltpetre which we desire you to procure and send them.\u00b2\n\nIn the following year (1677) a Surat man offering to make gunpowder at Bombay at a specially cheap rate, the President, Mr. Aungier, writes to Bombay on the 1st February: One Mungi Dugi (Manji Dhanji) who now takes his passage to the island hath made some propositions to us touching the construction of a new mill and other engines for making powder better and at far cheaper rates than now you make it on the island. We have referred Munji unto you to discourse with him, and, if you judge it convenient, to employ him.\u00b3 Later references seem to show that Manji\u2019s propositions met with approval and that a powder mill was built to the south-west of the Castle between the Church and Apollo Gates apparently about the site of the present Secretariat.\n\nA Consultation of the 26th February 1731 records: Frequent complaints are made of the hardship of pressing women and boys to beat the saltpetre and other powder ingredients in wooden mortars. It is also represented that powder made by this hand beating is not so good as if the materials were mixed in mills worked by buffaloes. The general storekeeper to whom this affair was recommended lays before the Board a plan and calculate of the charge in erecting two mills which will amount to Rs. 1400; likewise a calculate of the expense of build-\n\n\u00b9 Swally Marine (Surat) Consultation 10th April 1670, Surat Fact.

The expense of the new house is computed at Rs. 1200 and of the house and mills at Rs. 2600; and by a moderate computation the said mills in two years will be paid for, and the powder rendered much better than at present. Agreed therefore that the land paymaster give directions for setting about the said house and mills with the utmost expedition.\n\nFor about three years this order seems to have remained in abeyance. In 1734 the clerk of the works laid before the Board a plan of a powder mill on which after debate on the 27th April the Board passed the following orders: Mr. Archibald Campbell First Lieutenant of the Princess Carolina galley, who, by Government order of the 27th April 1734, was appointed clerk of the works on Rs. 30 a month and master of arms on Rs. 40 a month from the 1st March 1734, lays before the Board the sketch of a mill for making of powder. Such a mill is greatly wanted on this island, partly through a deficiency of working people partly because they are unwilling to be employed in such service. The proposed mill is to work twenty-four pestles either by buffaloes or wind. As it is esteemed safer and more secure to have the mill worked by buffaloes, as these country people are not at all acquainted with wind mills, it is agreed that as soon as the workmen can be spared from more immediate services a house be set about for a powder mill on Old Woman's island to be worked by buffaloes according to the scheme which Mr. Campbell has laid before us. This house is to be made in such a manner that in case the buffaloes do not answer, a spire may be erected on the said house for a windmill. It is computed that the said mill with its forty pestles will make a sufficient quantity of gunpowder both for sale and for the service of this and the other settlements. The house was probably begun in the July following, as an item of Rs. 90 on its account is included in the land paymaster's monthly disbursements for July 1734.\n\nThough the powder house on Old Woman's island was completed it seems never to have been used. On the 20th November 1741 a model was obtained for a new powder mill. The question arose whether the powder house on Old Woman's island should be used or a new house built near the existing powder house. In 1742 as Old Woman's island was out of the way for the work people, had no fresh water, and no storehouses, a site close to the existing powder house that is near the present Secretariat was chosen.\n\nFive years later (27th January 1747) the house on Old Woman's island with the ground round it was sold to Mr. Broughton the renter of the island for Rs. 600.\n\n---\n\n1 Bom.

Though they thought it ought to be cheaper, the Court (25th Feb. 1747) admitted the Bombay powder was superior to Europe powder and ordered (7th March 1749) that it should be supplied to Bengal and the Coromandel Coast.\n\nAs regards the cost in 1750 the Bombay Government explained that a handsome profit was made on the brimstone and saltpetre supplied to the contractor so that the actual cost of the powder was considerably less than the normal cost. So great was the demand that in September 1750 orders were issued for building a fresh house.\n\nIn March 1753, to enable the Bombay workmen to construct a proper powder mill, the Court sent models of the different parts. They also engaged John Cairn, a man well skilled in the method of burning charcoal, to serve in the powder works on \u00a360 a year.\n\nIn December 1753 Sir James Foulis objected to the site of the existing powder house. It was confined on one side by the sea and on the other by the town. Enquiry failed to discover a better site and the work of building a new house was pressed on in February 1754.\n\nThe new powder house seems not to have lasted long. In March 1755 the Court sanctioned fresh buildings in the room of the gunpowder works lately blown up.\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Dep. Court's Letters Vol. 3 of 1742-1751, 139, 195.\n2 Pub.

Messrs. Hornby, Spencer, and Hough are appointed a committee for enquiring into the present state of the powder and powder works, and of the most proper means for making it in future, which they are to lay before the Board for their further consideration.\n\nAbout the same time (25th April 1760) a similar order was being issued by the Court that whoever may make or vend gunpowder except on the Company's account shall forfeit the service and be dismissed the settlement.\n\nAbout 1766 the powder house had by additions spread from its original site, outside of the walls to the south-west of the town between Church and Apollo gates, to within 210 yards of the Stanhope bastion where were many scattered buildings of which the two largest measured 105 and 115 feet long and 35 to 39 feet broad.\n\nAn account particular of the charges of making 1585 barrels of Gunpowder from the 1st July 1755 to the 15th July 1755\u2014continued.\n\n| Item                          | Quantity | Unit Price | Total Cost |\n|-------------------------------|----------|------------|------------|\n| Dangri 487 yards              |          |            |            |\n| Oil 174 muns at Rs. 42 the man |          |            |            |\n| Ghi 234 muns at Rs. 7 the man  |          |            |            |\n| Iron nail of sorts 244 lbs. at different prices |          |            |            |\n| Brass nails of sorts 84 at different prices |          |            |            |\n| Copper nails of sorts 38 at different prices |          |            |            |\n| Thread 3 lbs. at different prices |          |            |            |\n| Needles 36 of sorts           |          |            |            |\n| Tar 8 muns 8 shers            |          |            |            |\n| Europe line one bundle        |          |            |            |\n| Hemp cotton and dammar        |          |            |            |\n| Paper writing paper 3 reams   |          |            |            |\n| Hid earth 3 reams             |          |            |            |\n| Parchment 34                   |          |            |            |\n| Goat skins                    |          |            |            |\n| Sail cloths 5 wore out        |          |            |            |\n| Brass shells 1 lost           |          |            |            |\n| Burnt 31 dead                 |          |            |            |\n| Over 2 dozen                  |          |            |            |\n| Copper 24 muns at different prices |          |            |            |\n| Copper rope 4 coil 443 lbs. at different prices |          |            |            |\n| Hair bottoms for sleeves 47 at Rs. 1-0-43 |          |            |            |\n\nTotal: 37,919 0 3\n\n1345 Barrels of gunpowder delivered into the magazine at Rs. 24-2-49 the barrel 38,119 0 3\n240 Barrels in composition not finished valued at about Rs. 20 each 4900 0 0\n1585 Total Barrels 37,919 0 3\n\n1 Bom.

Diary 47 of 1766, 870-872.\nA return of the 31st May 1760 shows a total stock of 144 barrels of European powder of which 44 were damaged, and of Company's or Bombay-made powder 1675 barrels of three varieties fine flat and round of which 452 were damaged.\\(^1\\)\n\nOn the 24th June 1760 the Principal Engineer reports: There now remain in one of the tombs upon Old Woman's island 415 bags of composition sent down from Surat last year. It appears to me to contain more of charcoal and dirt than of any other ingredient. There is some sulphur and little saltpetre. Some seems as if designed for gunpowder and some I apprehend for country lights. I burnt some of it when it first came here and I then deemed it not worth keeping. Yet I had no particular orders concerning it. I have lately tried to burn some of it which scarce showed an appearance of combustible matter. I beg your Honour will please to let me know your directions on that head.\\(^2\\)\n\nOn perusing the above report the Board remark: Read a letter from the Principal Engineer desiring our orders in regard to the composition received last year from Surat and now lodged in one of the tombs on Old Woman's island. It is directed that the Major, the Military Storekeeper himself, and the First Captain of Artillery survey and make a report thereof.\\(^3\\)\n\nAgreeably to the above order Major Fraser, the Principal Engineer, and the Commanding Officer of the Artillery report (15th July 1760) in writing that they are of opinion the composition received last year from Surat is unserviceable. The Board however ordered the military storekeeper to enquire whether something cannot be made of it.\\(^4\\)\n\nRegarding the quantity of gunpowder which should be always in store the Court on the 6th April 1763 write: We should think four thousand barrels of gunpowder much too large a quantity to be always in store on your island in time of peace. But we must leave it to your discretion to govern yourselves according to times and circumstances. Not only your own wants are to be considered but the calls you may have from Madras and Bengal if they should not be able to provide themselves with powder equal in strength to what you can make, which however we are in hopes they will do, and thereby have no occasion for your assistance in that article. We need not remind you that care must be taken to keep the magazines dry and surveys frequently made on the barrels, which may have laid a long time in store, as they are apt to decay and rot from the least damp and will certainly require to be often turned.\\(^5\\)\n\nIn the matter of the saltpetre houses, on the 10th April 1762, para 156, Government write to the Court: As the powder-house committee represented the danger and inconvenience of the present saltpetre-houses and proposed to remove the same and in their stead to convert the houses intended for the weavers into proper saltpetre houses, we agreed thereto and issued necessary orders for that purpose.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Pub.

Vol. 6 of 1762-1764, 206.\nreply to this on the 6th April 1763 the Court write: Your converting the houses intended for the weavers into saltpetre houses we cannot disapprove, since the powder-house committee has represented so strongly the danger and inconvenience of the present saltpetre houses. On the 25th March 1764, para. 98, Government write to the Court: The powder-house committee representing on the 1st October the necessity of building a saltpetre house at a distance from the other works the same was ordered to be done and the present house converted into a composition house.\n\nIt was intended to remove the powder works to another place but this being an item of new expenditure the Court on the 3rd April 1764 write: As to the removal of the powder works which you mention as a new subject of expense, we know not what alteration the event of the present peace may have made in your opinion on this head. However in case it should have been found absolutely necessary for the security of your fortifications we cannot but think we have reason to complain that the situation was not more maturely considered when the houses were first erected. This would have freed us from the large expense which must attend the removal, even though the same materials are employed.\n\nTowards the close of 1765 the Powder House Committee submitted a statement of materials for making 2400 barrels of gunpowder in the next twelve months. The Bombay Diary of the 11th October records: Read a letter from the Powder House Committee accompanying their books as usual, also a statement of materials wanted for the ensuing year and proposals for contracting for gram at Rs. 18 the khandi if for one year and at Rs. 17 if for three years. The latter being deemed a very reasonable medium price it is agreed to as the most advantageous and the committee are ordered to contract accordingly and to lay in the other stores on the cheapest terms possible.\n\n---\n\n1 Bombay to Court 10th April 1762 para 156, Pub.

The following details (Ditto, 655-657) show (8th October 1765) the provisions and materials required at the powder-house for feeding cattle and making 2400 barrels of gunpowder in twelve months:\n\n| Item                                      | Quantity | Unit   | Total |\n|-------------------------------------------|----------|--------|-------|\n| Buffaloes for four relieves               | 160      |        |       |\n|                                            | 140      |        |       |\n| Gram for 160 cattle at 4 shers each per day |          |        | 20    |\n| Straw for 160 at 30 lbs. each per day     |          |        | 15,642|\n| Billet wood, pieces 400,000                |          |        | 332,180|\n| To be purchased as brought hither from the other side: Milkbnah, 37,000 mans |          |        | 36,180|\n| Expected from the other side: Saltpetre crude, cwt. |          |        | 2200  |\n| To be had from the warehouse: Brimstone crude, 290 |          |        | 262   |\n\nTo deduct the remains in the warehouse, 820; required\nOn the 23rd December 1766 the Principal Engineer Captain Thomas Keating reports the necessity of removing the powder works to some other place: The works of the new fortifications are now so far advanced between the Apollo and Church Gates and the glacis is carried out so far as to bring the road for carriages very dangerously near the powder works. This is especially the case as all drivers of stone and sand carriages constantly carry fire with them for the convenience of cooking, and, very often, gentlemen's carriages pass with mashals or torches whose sparks in high winds fly a long way to the grave danger of the works in this quarter and of every individual. Those dangers there is no possibility of avoiding by carrying the road another way as the powder works are distributed in such a straggling manner that, make the road which way you will, it must lead within a few paces of some one or other of the buildings. The above is but an inconsiderable affair in comparison to other considerations of a more disadvantageous and dangerous nature that arise from the present situation of those works. In the first place being erected only eight hundred and thirty-three yards from the centre of the town, if, as is often the case with powder works, the works take fire, when 600 to 700 barrels of powder are in the sifting-house, the shock from the explosion would be so severe that I make no doubt it would considerably ruin the works most contiguous thereto. I have next to observe that the powder buildings, as also the dwelling and out-houses formerly possessed by Mr. Court and now by Mr. Mostyn, are very favourably situated for covering an enemy in their approaches against the Marlborough and Stanhope bastions. Two of the largest of the powder works buildings are within 210 yards of the Stanhope bastion directly on the salient angle. No enemy could possibly wish a greater advantage than the cover of this powder building to shelter them in carrying on their attack against the place. When in possession of the largest powder buildings the enemy will find them of excellent use. With very little trouble they may be made very favourable batteries against the Stanhope bastion. It may possibly be said it is time enough to remove those buildings when a danger of this kind threatens us. In my opinion when it comes to extremities it is generally too late for putting every thing in a proper posture of defence. It will then be severely regretted the necessary steps were not taken at an early and convenient time. I shall not trouble the Board by the enumeration of the inconveniencies and dangers that may proceed from those works remaining as they are. I shall only further observe that the great sums laid out for removing buildings in order to have a clear and open esplanade have been expended for little or no use as the greatest and most dangerous buildings remain uncleared. No enemy will ever carry on an attack open and exposed when an advantage so glaring presents itself to them. The dimensions of the two buildings on the salient angle of the Stanhope bastion are: (1) 115 feet long and 39 broad; (2) 105 feet long and 35 broad; walls of each, two feet thick; besides buttresses.\n\n1 Principal Engineer 23rd Dec. 1766, Pub. Diary 47 of 1766, 870-872.\nOn perusing the above report from the Principal Engineer setting forth the necessity of removing the powder works the consideration of the question was deferred. Meanwhile the Board directed that a proper spot for the works must be pitched upon and an estimate framed of the expense which the moving would cause. They add, the Committee of Surveys is directed to frame the estimate and make a report of their proceedings to us.\n\nAgreeably to the above order the Committee of Surveys submitted the following report on the 16th January 1767: We have pitched upon a spot of ground which we esteem in every respect very commodious for the Powder Works. It is situated to the north of the entrance of the Mud Dock at M\u00e1zgaon on a rising ground, well sheltered from the salt sprays. A very good tank for the cattle lies contiguous thereto, stones for erecting the building are in great plenty within fifty or sixty yards, and chunam kilns upon the spot. The place is also very convenient for the boats to take off the powder and bring the materials. In short no site on the island appears to be so well adapted for this purpose. The Engineer will as soon as possible comply with that part of your orders regarding the calculate of the expense attending the removal.\n\nOn the above report the same day the Board observe: Read the report from the Committee of Surveys recommending a spot of ground at M\u00e1zgaon as very proper for the Powder Works. As we do not think the tenour of our Honourable Masters\u2019 present orders on the subject sufficiently authorizes us to carry this transfer into execution, it is agreed to recommend the same to their consideration as a measure which should on no occasion be any longer deferred, as in their present situation the Powder Works not only greatly incommode the Fortifications but would be very dangerous in the event of a war and the place being attacked. We cannot however but wish we had an authority for removing them immediately as the materials might be used in carrying on the works contiguous thereto, by which a great expense would be saved.\n\nIn the beginning of 1768 the blowing up of a magazine is thus recorded in the Bombay Diary of the 13th January: About nine o\u2019clock this morning a small magazine adjoining the Ramparts that contained about twenty-seven barrels of gunpowder, made up in musket cartridges, was unhappily blown up through the unparalleled villainy of Solomon Hart who was Quarter-Master Serjeant and was this morning broke by the sentence of a Court Martial and destroyed himself in the explosion. By this unhappy accident some lives were lost and many private houses much damaged.\n\nOn the subject of the explosion the Bombay Diary of the 22nd January records: The late unhappy accident to the magazine as minuted\n\n---\n\n1 Bom.

The Committee of Surveys are therefore ordered to look out for a proper spot on which to erect a magazine for this purpose, a calculate of cost of which must be framed and laid before us by the engineer with all expedition. Resolved also for the greater security that no powder be kept but in barrels with copper hoops or in chests made on purpose.\n\nOn the 29th January the committee submitted the required report. It runs: Agreeable to your Honour\u2019s orders relative to the choice of a proper spot for erecting a magazine at a suitable distance from the town, we have been looking out for such a place and have fixed upon one just to the northward of the M\u00e1zgaon Dock which we esteem a very convenient situation both with regard to the distance from the town and the powder mills and on account of the ease with which boats may come to it and receive any quantity of powder that may be thought necessary to be taken out. An estimate of the expense of the building is herewith laid before your Honours.\n\nOn the above report the same day the Board observe: Read a report from the Committee of Surveys acquainting us they have fixed upon a spot to the northward of M\u00e1zgaon Dock which they esteem a very proper and convenient situation for the proposed magazine; an estimate of the expense of which they likewise enclose, amounting to Rs. 16,203-0-97. It being judged absolutely necessary that a work of this nature should be completed without delay, it is ordered to be forthwith set about.\n\nThis measure was reported the same year to the Court of Directors in the Bombay general letter of the 18th April and met with the approval of the Court. In their reply of the 31st March 1769 the Court write: The building a magazine for your gunpowder in the room of the small one blown up, and the spot fixed upon for that purpose appear to be very proper, and we expect your utmost care and precaution to prevent such a catastrophe in future.\n\nAbout the middle of 1768, in connection with the intended removal of the powder works to M\u00e1zgaon, the Bombay Diary of the 30th July records: The Committee of Surveys with Colonel Campbell must be ordered to survey the island and report to us whether any other spot is more proper for removing the powder works to than that formerly recommended.\n\nOn receipt of the committee\u2019s report, the Diary of the 25th October has the following: Read a letter from the Committee of Surveys and Colonel Campbell, giving it as their opinion that the spot formerly\n\n---\n\n1 Bom.

Resolved that one of the mills be immediately removed thither and the other to be likewise removed as soon as the first is finished.\n\nAt a Consultation on the 28th October 1769 the Board read the powder-house committee's letter accompanying their books for the year ending 31st July 1769 and recorded: We are glad to perceive the cost of the powder made during the year 1768-69 is reduced by so much as Rs. 1-3-33 the barrel. As the committee desire to know what quantity of powder should be made in the course of the present season, they are directed to make 3000 barrels. Referring to this entry in the Diary on the 6th April 1770 the Court write: We are pleased to find that gunpowder is made cheaper than formerly and rely on your further care to direct the manufacture thereof on the lowest terms possible.\n\nThe Bombay Diary of the 19th February 1773 records: The land paymaster presents to the Board, conformable to directions, the report of the valuation of the house known by the name of the powder-house situated on the esplanade amounting to Rs. 7993-2-2.\n\nRegarding the requirements of the powder house on the 26th October 1779 Mr. Hallamby makes the following report to Mr. Draper: I have the honor of reporting to you what is requisite to be done at the powder house to finish the inside of the second beating house and to make the whole complete. The necessary changes are two new double-wheels and one new single wheel; a stone and chunam building 140 feet long and 28 feet broad, to be divided into the following: charcoal sifting house, composition mixing house, saltpetre and sulphur sifting house, warehouse for saltpetre and sulphur stores; two new terraces for drying powder. When the above are finished we shall then be enabled to make about 1000 barrels more in the season. But to render this still more certain I must here beg leave to recommend that spare horizontal and perpendicular wheels, axle trees, and cogs, may be immediately made up and kept in readiness as this work mostly must be made of particular wood and requires time attention and great nicety in fitting, the want of which has often stopped half the works for a month together, as a failure in the beating mills affects all the works.\n\nAt a Consultation on the 27th October Mr. Draper, the acting member of the powder house committee, lays before the Board the above letter from Mr. Hallamby the assistant at the powder house, respecting some additions requisite to be made thereto and by the completion of which the season's outturn of gunpowder might be increased by 1000 barrels. The Board records: As our stock of gunpowder is by no means adequate to our exigencies at this time and also to reserve a sufficient quantity for defence, it is resolved that the proposed works be imme-\n\n---\n\n1 Bom.

There is more great cordage sent out yearly than is serviceable to us, our expense being for the most part of the small coir cables, coir hausers being as strong and as serviceable as English. But for small rigging coir is very gouty and unhandy and requires more hands in a ship than when English-rigged. And the most necessary cordage is small lines half and three-quarter inch rope for ratlings and topgallant rigging for our small vessels. Small cordage is likewise most proper for sale.\u00b3\n\nAs regards seamen's pay, the Surat Council write to Bombay the 8th January 1677: We have paid unto the Master of the Malab\u00e1r Coaster Rs. 329 in full for two months' pay for five Englishmen and nineteen lascars and we have also furnished him with two months' provisions for his voyage.\u2074\n\nThe 22nd March 1677, the Surat Council write to Bombay: By the Hunter frigate we omitted to advise that we have paid two months' pay unto all her seamen and to four that we were intended to clear and put on board the Formosa in the room of some that are run away.

If you hear anything of them advise thereunto.\n\nA fortnight later (31st August 1694) Captain Howell received the following orders regarding the same deserters: We also order you to keep a good look-out and always to keep yourself in a good posture of defence against all manner of pirates and other enemies. And should you meet with any of them that are lately run from this island whom we require you to carefully look for in any ship or vessel, we do hereby enorder and empower you to bring them either by fair means or force to us, provided you are of strength to accomplish it.

The same order you must give to Sion and other places under your command.\n\nSome time before the close of 1720 Government accepted Captain Ingram's offer to sell his house. A Consultation of the 3rd September records: Captain Ingram petitions the Board that he and his wife may have liberty to take their passage on the first ship for England and that we would purchase his house for the Right Honourable Company. The house being very convenient for storehouses for keeping the naval stores and an office for the Marine Paymaster, and the same having been valued by Major Vane and the master carpenters and bricklayers at Rs. 3300, it is resolved that we purchase it at that price on our Honourable Masters' account, and that we grant his request for going home.\n\nIn the beginning of 1724 the difference in the pay of the commanders of galleys and grabs was removed. A Consultation of the 31st January records: The commanders of the galleys representing to the Board the disadvantage they and their ships' company serve under in reference to those employed in the grabs, that their pay is not more than Rs. 64 a month and the others' with diet to themselves and officers Rs. 96, it is agreed that the difference being Rs. 32 a month be allowed. But whereas the Honourable Company did allow them \u00a350 each for a table during their passage from England and indulged them in some other matters, it is directed that this our resolution take place only from the 1st instant.

The seamen's pay being but Rs. 9-2-40 a month, it is directed that the same be an established rate throughout the fleet and commence likewise from the 1st of this month.\n\nThe same Consultation continues: In order to prevent our people deserting from our vessels, it is directed that they be kept two months in arrears besides the month running; and in case the commander shall make it appear he has out of pure necessity advanced to any that shall afterwards desert, the sum if not exceeding one month's pay shall be allowed him.\n\nTo prevent the great expense of powder for salutes, in April 1725 the Court write: The owners of several of our ships have complained to us of divers matters wherein they suffer in their ships accounts. For remedy thereof we have sent our orders to the Coast and Bay this season, which we mention here for your notice and observance, namely: That to prevent the great expense of powder, lavished away under pretence of salutes, all our Europe ships at their first arrival at any port of India (where we have a fort) they salute it with nine guns and no more; that the Fort return the like number. That on the Captains first coming ashore from Europe, or despatch thither, they shall fire but nine guns and at all other times of saluting the Captains with only seven; that all country ships be answered with no more than five guns (Foreigners excepted). That the Governor or any of the Council, or any other persons belonging to the Company going on board, be not saluted with more than nine guns, on their coming aboard or going off. This gives us occasion to add that as much frugality as possible be used in the expense of powder upon all festivals or at funerals and at all other occasions of salutes. We have before herein given directions to prevent the waste of powder by salutes, and the Captains selling their guns and ordnance stores. However to render those directions more effectual we order as follows. Just before the despatch of our ships for Europe proper persons be sent on board each ship to survey and see that they have on board the number of guns mentioned in the Charter Party, and at least two-thirds of a barrel of gunpowder for each gun and twenty pounds of shot. In case the ship is not thus furnished the Captain be obliged to supply fully what is wanting before he leaves the port. This we direct shall be a standing order for the future.\n\nWith a view to reduce the expenses a Consultation, the 23rd August 1728, records: The President takes notice to the Board of sundry extraordinary allowances in the marine which he believes without any prejudice to the service might be pared off and would be the saving of a considerable sum in the year's expense to the Honourable Company. This being taken into consideration and debated it is agreed and ordered that all persons serving ashore be no longer allowed provisions besides their pay.

That the allowance of Rs. 32 a month table-money to the commanders be struck off after this month. That all Europeans serving on board the Honourable Company's cruisers be allowed only four flesh days in the week at the daily rate of $1\\frac{1}{2}$ lbs. of beef or $1\\frac{1}{2}$ lbs. of pork to each man to be provided by the marine paymaster at 5 pice the pound. That all their running rigging instead of Europe hemp be made of the best sort of country coir, nor any Europe duck made use of for their sails except for courses, and that another galivat be laid up. Ordered that the marine paymaster have a copy of this our resolution to govern himself accordingly.\n\nIn 1730 to meet medical charges on account of officers and mariners, on the 12th March the Court write: We direct that in time to come you deduct sixpence a month out of the wages you shall pay to the officers and mariners of our galleys, which we find they are obliged by Act of Parliament to pay to the use of Greenwich hospital, sending us annually the particulars and amount of said deductions in an account apart.\n\nIn the next year (1731) the Court provide a pension for the widows of officers and seamen. They write: For the encouragement of all officers and seamen in our service let them be acquainted that we have settled a handsome pension for life upon the widow of Captain Mumford; and upon application made we shall grant the like favour to the nearest relation of any who after behaving so well may meet the same fate in our service.\n\nTo encourage the capture of hostile ships, on the 19th November 1731 the Board observe: The President acquaints the Board that being informed that three of the enemy's grabs and eight galivats are sailed out of Kolaba, which we hope will give us an opportunity of meeting them with our cruisers, and to animate our people to behave themselves with the greater conduct, courage, and zeal in case of meeting with the enemy, he proposes to the Board to assure and declare to the commanders of each of the Company's fighting vessels that such of the enemy's fighting vessels as shall be taken in battle, with the artillery warlike and other appurtenances thereunto belonging, shall be the sole right of the captors, the value thereof to be divided according to an order established for that purpose in the marine office. And for their further encouragement, the President in his own name and in the names of the rest of the gentlemen of the Board proposeth at their own expense to make the said officers and ships' company an additional gratuity of Rs. 2000 for each fighting grab of Angria's by them taken in battle over and\n\n---\n\n1 Bom.

This is agreed to and it is resolved that the President issue out a publication signed by him to be affixed in a proper place on board of each of the Honourable Company's cruisers pursuant to this our resolution.\n\nAs regards the charge of marine and other ships' stores, at their Consultation of the 24th December 1731 the Board observe: Our Honourable Masters having been pleased to direct, in their commands of the 9th March 1720 by the London, that all marine and other stores issued out for the use of ships employed in their service and those belonging to their covenanted servants under this Presidency should be charged at the following prices: Stores that are perishable at 25 per cent upon the invoice and those that are not perishable at 30 per cent reckoning two shillings and three pence to the rupee and five per mill Europe charges. And whereas since that time some directions have been given in some respects different from those our Honourable Masters' orders relating to the sale of stores, it is agreed that for the future all perishable stores issued out for the use of the ships employed in the Company's service, as well as those belonging to the covenanted servants under this Presidency, be charged at 25 per cent and those that are not perishable at 30 per cent on the invoice, reckoning two shillings and three pence to a rupee with five per cent to the Storekeeper General, and that all other stores whether perishable or not perishable, sold to strangers, shall be charged at 50 per cent or what more can be got with five per cent to the storekeeper for his trouble.\n\nIn 1733 the great increase of Angria's power forced Government to add to the existing fleet. A Consultation of the 26th July 1733 records: Our troublesome neighbour Angria having, since the revolution lately happened in the Sidi's territories and the taking of Rajpuri with all the Sidi's fleet of grabs and galivats, added five of the said grabs and several of the galivats to his own fleet, and having certain intelligence that he is preparing and fitting out his said fleet for the sea as soon as the fair season will permit him to cruise, it behoves us to take all prudent measures for the security of this settlement and for the protection of the trade of this port. As the present number of vessels of war belonging to our Honourable Masters is not sufficient to oppose the united force of the two brothers, sons of Angria, and perform the other services that are daily required of them, we ought to think how to reinforce our fleet. As the proprietors of the Rose galley some time since taken by the enemy have repurchased that vessel for the sum of Rs. 7603, it is proposed to the consideration of the Board whether or no she is a proper vessel to be added to our fleet, if the proprietors will part with her at the price she has cost them. Debating thereon, it is the unanimous opinion of this Board that she is a vessel very fit for that purpose being strong and well built, a prime sailer, and three years old and that we ought not to let slip this opportunity of\n\n---\n\n1 Bom.

Directed that the marine paymaster treat with the said proprietors for the said vessel and make a report to this Board what he does therein.\\(^1\\)\n\nOn receipt of the required report, at a Consultation of the 3rd August 1733, the Board observe: Pursuant to our last Consultation Mr. Henry Kellet, Marine Paymaster, makes a report of his having discoursed the proprietors of the Rose galley and delivers in an account of what she now stands them in as new sheathed and fitted, but without guns anchors or warlike stores, amounting to Rs. 14,001-2-14, for which sum they are willing to part with her for the Honourable Company's service. Agreed that we accept of her on the terms demanded as she is a very fine vessel and fit for the service.\\(^2\\)\n\nIn consequence of complaints of seamen being enticed away, at a Consultation of the 31st August 1733 the Bombay Council direct: Whereas complaint has been made by Captain Tolson Commander of the Heathcote, and several other Commanders of Europe ships that the officers of the cruizers frequently inveigle and entice the men belonging to the Europe ships to run away and come on board the cruizers, thereby weakening the said ships and endangering our Honourable Masters' estate on board them. To prevent this evil it is directed that the Secretary send an order in writing to the respective Commanders of the Honourable Company's cruizers, signifying to them by order of this Board that if at any time hereafter it shall be found that any men belonging to Europe ships have been enticed and are found on board any of the cruizers, the Commander of the vessel on board of whom they are found, shall be mulcted a month's pay for the first offence, and dismissed the service for the second. But if the said Commander shall make it appear to us the President and Council that any of their officers, contrary to their consent or approval have enticed and inveigled the said men, that then such officers so offending shall incur the aforesaid penalty.\\(^3\\)\n\nA Consultation of the 27th September 1734 records: The Marine Paymaster for the time being is appointed to license such small presents and like articles as shall be sent to Europe by any inhabitant of the island, and likewise the private trade to be allowed to the officers of the ships. And he is directed to keep a register book of the same to be transmitted to England by every ship.\\(^4\\)\n\nIn consequence of the continued desertion of seamen on the 15th August 1735, the Bombay Council direct: The Marine Paymaster represents to the Board that several of our seamen have deserted this season and most of them in boats taken from the shore which it has\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Bom.

As we are but bare of seamen we can ill afford to lose any of them. To prevent therefore any more getting away in this manner, it is agreed to give public notice forbidding any boat being left ashore after sunset and imposing a penalty of Rs. 200, to be paid by the owners of the ship such boat shall belong to, for every mariner belonging to our vessels who shall escape in her. This sum we judge will reimburse the Honourable Company the charge they are at in sending mariners out. The like forfeiture is to be paid by the owner of any fishing boat which being suffered to lie on shore after sunset shall be the means of any of the mariners getting off the island.\n\nIn the matter of the increase of the Bombay fleet, a Consultation of the 5th December 1735 records: The Chief and Factors at Surat having sent us two large boats belonging to M\u00e1n\u00e9kji Navroji, which had been valued there at Rs. 3000 and our carpenters differing very little in their report of them, it is agreed to take them at that price, paying also Rs. 125\u00be for the charges of sailing them hither as otherwise we must have paid freight for the goods they brought.\n\nA fortnight later the Diary of the 19th December records: Being advised that Sambh\u00e1ji Angria and Khem S\u00e1vant have come to terms of peace and intend to join their fleets, we do not think it prudent to venture less than four of our vessels to cruise off the enemy\u2019s ports. But as it is necessary that the Commissary should proceed early to Mokha to begin the provision of coffee for the ship that may arrive there from England next season, it is directed that the four cruisers now in port be returned as soon as possible to the southward to watch the motion of the enemy and protect the trade.\n\nThe following statement shows the Marine Charges of 1735:\n\n| No. | Vessels                  | Jan. | Feb. | March | April | May  | June |\n|-----|--------------------------|------|------|-------|-------|------|------|\n| 1   | Victoria Frigate         | Rs.  | Rs.  | Rs.   | Rs.   | Rs.  | Rs.  |\n| 2   | Neptune Grab             | 6842 | 8308 | 1281  |       |      |      |\n| 3   | Prince of Wales Galley   | 1860 | 1965 |       | 527   | 3557 |      |\n| 4   | King George Galley       | 404  | 5780 | 786   |       |      |      |\n| 5   | HMS Caroline Galley      | 530  | 6093 | 902   | 415   | 2739 |      |\n| 6   | Rose Galley              | 463  | 5780 | 1149  | 452   | 2083 |      |\n| 7   | Salamander Bomb Ketch    | 377  | 565  | 572   |       |      |      |\n| 8   | Galivats and Boats       | 513  | 263  | 377   | 286   | 1287 |      |\n| 9   | Bandar Charges           | 1958 | 1933 | 1943  | 1910  | 1485 |      |\n| 10  | Building the Grab        | 534  | 488  | 479   | 429   | 401  |      |\n| 11  | Sidi Factory             | 537  | 675  |       |       |      |      |\n| 12  | Charges Extraordinary    | 177  | 207  | 75    | 4     |      |      |\n| 13  | On account of the Sidi   | 613  | 111  | 480   |       |      |      |\n| 14  | Tellicherry Factory      | 8085 | 1090 | 855   | 2238  | 600  |      |\n| 15  | Stores laid in           | 91   |      |       |       | 831  |      |\n| 16  | Mokha Commissary         | 66   | 4929 | 24    | 136   |      |      |\n| 17  | Peri Agency              | 12,746| 757 | 8     | 2321  |      |      |\n| 18  | Building the New Sloop   |      |      | 369   | 820   | 424  |      |\n| 19  | Defending Underl         |      |      |       |       |      |      |\n| Total|                          | 26,079| 48,826| 10,165| 7,488 | 15,297|      |\n\n---\n\n1 Pub.

Diary 8 of 1734-35 and 9 of 1736.\nThe 3rd September 1736 Mr. Thomas Stoneham writes to Government: Whereas your Honours last Council day were pleased to order me Purser Marine according to the Honourable Company\u2019s orders, I humbly pray that your Honours would be pleased likewise to order that I may have the supplying (besides beef) all other stores ballasting and watering ships, together with an allowance of salary diet-money house-rent and provoos and palanquin coolies as the late and other purser marines have had heretofore.\n\nOn receipt of this letter, 3rd September 1736, Government direct: That the Secretary acquaint Captain Thomas Stoneham that as at present we are taken up with the despatch of the Harrington to Bengal and preparing to send home the Britannia, we cannot spare time to make a separation and duly regulate the offices of marine paymaster and purser marine which of late have been vested in one person, but the same will properly be done when those ships are despatched. Also that we shall in the meantime, order the registers to be examined to find what has formerly been allowed a purser marine as such and that it is our orders he supply the Company\u2019s vessels with flesh provisions and necessaries till we have leisure to make the proper regulations.\n\nFour months later a Consultation of the 31st December records: The President lays before the Board instructions to be observed by the marine paymaster and purser marine for the due execution of their respective offices and a regulation of the prices they are to charge for the stores and provisions supplied by them. These being approved are now signed and ordered to follow this Consultation.\n\nThe Honourable Court of Directors in their last commands having been pleased to order that the purser marine\u2019s employ should be separated from the marine paymaster\u2019s post, and you (Mr. Thomas Stonestreet) being appointed marine paymaster we have thought fit to give you\nthe following instructions for your guidance in the discharge of your office. Our Honourable Masters having judged proper to direct that the purser marine shall supply their vessels and Europe ships with provisions and necessaries and Mr. Thomas Stoneham being nominated to that employ, he must monthly give you an exact and particular account of what he furnishes each vessel that the same may be inserted in your monthly disbursements. It must be your care duly to examine the same and to see that whatever he delivers is good of its kind and that nothing is over-rated or charged at extravagant prices. For the better preventing abuse we hereby direct that the price of beef shall be five pice the pound and that all petty stores be charged at no more than the several rates specified in the list hereto annexed. These we are persuaded are as much or more than some of the black merchants are willing to contract with us for. As the two offices of marine paymaster and purser marine have hitherto been always blended together and enjoyed by one person, in order to prevent any disputes on their separation, we have thought fit to order that the care of watering and ballasting the Company's vessels and providing timber and coir be committed to you and be under your inspection and management. But we expect and hereby direct that no more be charged for them than the prime cost. And also oakum cajans and chunam which have been always provided at first hand for the Company's use and for the rafters and the like which you advance your own money for and send up the rivers you are to charge the prices mentioned in the list annexed. The captains or supra-cargoes of all Europe or country ships and all private merchants must not be obliged to buy what provisions stores or necessaries they want either from you or from the purser marine. They shall have free liberty of purchasing them where and from whom they please that no just cause of complaint may be given on that account. Herewith you will likewise receive copies of all standing orders relating to the marine which will be a help to you in the execution of your office in which we strenuously recommend to you the utmost frugality.\n\nAt the same time the following instructions were issued to the purser marine Mr. Thomas Stoneham: Our Honourable Masters having thought proper to separate the office of purser marine from the marine paymaster's post, and having nominated you to act as purser marine, we judge fit to give you the following instructions for the more ready and duly executing the charge of that employ. The Court of Directors having ordered that you shall supply their vessels and Europe ships with provisions and necessaries you are accordingly so to do and render an exact account monthly to the marine paymaster of what you deliver to each vessel that he may charge the same in his marine disbursements. But we hereby direct that you charge no more than five pice a pound for what beef and pork you furnish their vessels with, as we are persuaded there is a reasonable profit to be made at that rate; and you must also take particular care that the provisions you deliver for the Company's cruisers are good of their kind. As the offices of marine paymaster and purser marine have hitherto been always blended together, we judge proper, in order to prevent any\nconfusion or dispute on their separation, to order that the marine paymaster shall have the charge and direction of watering and ballasting the Company's vessels and of purchasing what timber and coir may be wanted for their service. On this he is to charge no more than the prime cost except a small profit in lieu of risk for the money he advances and sends up the rivers to purchase rafters. All other necessaries, which used formerly to be supplied by the marine paymaster, you may for the time to come furnish the Company's vessels with. But we hereby direct that you charge no more for them than the prices mentioned in the list herewith delivered you, at which rates or something less several black merchants are willing to contract with us for them. So far as we know it has not been customary for the commanders or supra-cargoes of either Europe or country ships to be obliged to take their provisions or other necessaries from any particular person. However to prevent any ground of complaints on this head for the future we hereby direct that all commanders supra-cargoes and private merchants shall have full and free liberty to purchase whatever they may stand in need of where and from whom they please. On a strict examination of our registers and monthly disbursements it does not appear to us that any pay or allowance has ever been given to the purser marine as such. We therefore dare not venture to make you any stated allowance till we receive orders from our Honourable Employers to whom we have already represented your request on that subject.\n\nA Consultation of 10th December 1736 records: The President acquaints the Board that the marine paymaster had often represented to him the ruinous and decayed condition of the old Bandar where part of the marine stores have been kept, which being built only of tatt\u00e1s and cajans occasioned great damage to the stores in the time of the rains and was continually liable to accidents by fire.

The Board being convinced of the absolute necessity of such conveniencies and having reason to believe that the expense will be saved to the Honourable Company in a few years in the stores, it is agreed that the said warehouses be forthwith set about and the land paymaster is directed to see that all possible frugality be observed and endeavour that the expense do not exceed the sum computed.\n\nA Consultation of the 11th October 1737 records: The President observes to the Board that the duty of captain commandant having been rendered very fatiguing through the constant attendance given by him and issuing daily orders to the outposts garrisoned upon the island, he had requested the President in some measure to ease him by appointing an adjutant, for which employ he had recommended Ensign Peter Termin as a capable and deserving person which the Board now agrees to.\n\nThe 27th September 1738 Government write to Commodore Bagwell: In obedience to the orders of our Honourable Masters you have already been appointed Commodore of all the marine force belonging to this Presidency by the President\u2019s Commission bearing date the 6th of July last. The same day, 27th September 1738, the Commodore writes to Government: In the instructions given me by the Honourable the Court of Directors relating to my present station, they assure me they have wrote your Honour and Council to allow me one hundred pounds sterling for wine during my said employ. As your Honours are now sending me out on the cruise, I beg leave to apply to you for payment of said allowance. This allowance was accordingly agreed to and the money ordered to be paid.\n\nA Consultation of the 11th May 1739 records: Captain Stoneham applying by letter for his appointment by the Honourable Company of Rs. 80 a month for his salary and diet since his entry into office, with an allowance for house-rent and palanquin coolies, and the marine paymaster\u2019s post being abolished, he requests we will order him the marine house for the use of the purser marine, as heretofore always customary. This request being taken into consideration the Board agrees that he be paid the arrears due to him according to the Honourable Company\u2019s orders since his commencing purser marine, and an allowance of Rs. 20 a month for house-rent. But that he has no pretensions to be allowed for palanquin coolies. And as to the marine house, that the same is at the disposition of the Superintendent of Marine in right of his office, the purser marine having hitherto been a covenant servant generally of an high station in the service, which is not Mr. Stoneham\u2019s case.\n\n---\n\n1 Bom.

In the first place you are to take care to keep up the service of God on board the vessel you command according to the liturgy of the Church of England that the same be devoutly and decently performed every Lord's Day and on all other appointed seasons as often as can be done with conveniency. And be very strict in observing a good decorum and discipline among your ship's company, severely punishing all profaneness or blasphemers of God's holy name and on no account permit gaming of any sort. Keep your vessel always in a posture of offending as well as defending. And speak with and examine all vessels you make that are not of superior force to you, taking out of such belonging to any Prince or State all British subjects you shall find on board them. You are to take, burn, sink, or otherwise destroy all Shiv\u00e1jis or other pirates infesting this coast, such as Angria R\u00e1mr\u00e1o of Antigerah commonly cruising to the southward as well as the Sangarian Kolis or other rovers harbouring to the northward and commonly cruising on that coast and sometimes as far as the gulf of Mokha and Persia, that you at any time meet with, bringing hither such people's vessels and goods as you take. All ships and vessels of the Sidi's fleet or otherwise belonging to the Moghal Emperor, as also all such ships or vessels belonging to B\u00e1jir\u00e1o or Chimn\u00e1ji Apa, you are civilly to examine so as not to give them disgust; and if they prove to belong to the Peshwa or Moghal give them no molestation, but any aid or assistance they stand in need of. Khem S\u00e1vant who has a port between Vengurla rocks and Goa is at peace with us and at war with Angria. When you meet his fleet they will send a galivat with green colours to speak with you and you are to treat them as friends. Should they offer to join you and go against Angria you are to permit them, but always under your command. You are further hereby ordered to protect and defend and give convoy to all ships and vessels under English colours duly licensed to wear them and to no other excepting such as by accident shall fall into your company and be able to keep way with you, but not to lose time by shortening sail or seeing them into ports or any deviation whatsoever. That any time you meet with any vessels of war or merchandize under red colours, though they may pretend to belong to the Sidi or B\u00e1jir\u00e1o, if you have reason to suspect that they are not what they pretend, but enemies, you are to bring them here. Your sirangs and tindals will be best able to inform you on this matter, as they know and can distinguish the Sidi's subjects or vessels from all others that frequent these seas. The British soldiers and seamen who desert from this island having usually taken service in the ships belonging to Bengal and Madras, vainly flattering themselves that by taking such service they were screened from our authority and the punishments due to their crimes, to discountenance as much as in us lies a practice of such evil tendency to the safety and\nwelfare of this Government, we hereby authorize you to seize all such deserters when and wheresoever you meet them, taking care to secure them in a proper manner until you have an opportunity to report them to us or the Superintendent. For the better executing of these our orders and keeping up an exact register of all deserters, which you are to do on board your ship, you will have a list given you of their names and you are to do the like to the other commanders for all those that may desert from your own ship, certifying when and where and how many go at a time; and report the same likewise to the Superintendent. Also whereas we are given to understand that an ill use is made of our indulgence in permitting you to sell arrack to your ship's company, insomuch that the remainder of their allowances is not sufficient to provide them common necessaries and from thence they become discontented and mutinous and are induced at last to desert, we hereby strictly enjoin you upon pain of dismissal not to sell more than one bottle a day to a mess of five men and in proportion to a mess of four or three. Neither are you to demand or receive more than Rs. 1\u00bd the gallon on the like penalty. You are not to discharge or exchange any of your seamen nor to prefer them to posts of trust and better pay, nor to discharge any warrant officer without leave first obtained from the President or Superintendent. And, as in cases of infidelity disobedience or incapacity you have power of suspension, you are not to proceed any further without leave first obtained as above. You have our permission to enlist as many able men as you can, reporting them to the Superintendent. But beware of encouraging any of the seamen belonging to the Europe ships to desert on pain of our severest censure; and this you must likewise give in charge to all the officers belonging to your ship. In case of a vacancy happening by the death or suspension of a warrant officer you may recommend those you think best qualified to fill up such vacancies; but they are not to receive any advance in their pay till they are confirmed by the President or Superintendent. We have thought fit to appoint a person to be on board you as a steward or purser who is to have the immediate charge of all the Company's provisions and is to be accountable to the Superintendent for the same and we in an especial manner recommend to you that no waste or embezzlement be made of the ammunition and stores in general and that all stores and provisions be carefully preserved on such penalties and punishment on the offender as shall be judged reasonable and the crime may deserve.\n\nAt the close of 1739, seeing the necessity of increasing their marine force, Government resolved that a grab be set on foot of the following dimensions, to wit: 90 feet by the keel, 30 feet by the beam, and 12 feet and 8 inches in the hold to carry 20 guns (10 in a line) besides her prow guns. Her cost is computed nearest at that of Britannia grab.\n\n---\n\n1 Sec. Out. L. B. 8 of 1738, 108-110.\n2 Bom., Gov. Consultation 18th Dec. 1739, Pub.

As we are told many of those who came in the last detachment from Bengal have been bred to the sea and that with some encouragement they might be prevailed on to enter into the marine service, it is agreed that we give a license to the commanders of the cruisers to offer a bounty of three months' pay to such as will voluntarily engage to serve for the term of three years.\u00b2\n\nFinding seamen again disappearing on the 21st August 1741 Government issue the following order to Captain George Jackson Commander of the Nassau: The President and Council being informed that no less a number than twelve of our European mariners are missing, it is their order that you on no account entertain any of said people in your ship; and if any are now on board send them instantly on shore; nor must you presume to carry any person away without previous permission.\u00b3\n\nAfter inspecting the fleet on the 8th October 1741 the Commodore writes, that having in person repaired on board the several vessels, he thinks them entirely clear and in a proper posture for defence nor does he apprehend they are to be rendered better.\u2074\n\nAt a Consultation on the 29th October 1741 the Board record the following opinion on the necessity of strengthening the Fleet: Reflecting on the insufficiency of our present marine force to the many indispensable calls for good vessels that our situation naturally subjects us to, as well as on the decayed condition of the Prince of Wales and Rose gallies who are by no means proper for the cruising service, we are of opinion our Honourable Masters cannot be displeased with our building another vessel to answer these purposes. Therefore it is agreed that one be immediately set on the stocks and committed to the charge of Lavji, our head carpenter, of the following dimensions: keel 90 feet, beam 30, depth in the hold 14\u00bd, and to carry 11 guns in a line. But that she may be better able to proceed on voyages to Mokha or Persia, we judge it will be most eligible to make her ship-fashion with a head though not so full bowed as to obstruct her sailing. And the Superintendent is directed to contract for the timber at the first hand.\n\n\u00b9 Bom. Gov. Consultation 22nd March 1740, Pub. Diary 13 of 1739-40, 132.\n\u00b2 Bom. Gov.

As their presence seems very necessary to preserve the soldiers in good order when in two of the largest grabs the detachment consists of 40 men each, some allowance must be made to the lieutenant in charge. Resolved accordingly that in future a lieutenant while on command be allowed Rs. 22 and an ensign Rs. 15 the month for the extraordinary expense of a table.\u00b2\n\nAt the close of 1742 as the necessity of keeping up a special marine force seemed no longer to exist, agreeably to the Court's orders, Government, at a Consultation of 26th November 1742, resolve that the marine force shall consist of the Bombay and Restoration grabs, Trial sloop, Triumph and Defiance prahms with all the galivats. That the remaining vessels, namely Success and Rose galleys, Neptune's Prize, and Salamander bomb ketch be disposed of for the most they will yield. That any persons are at liberty to give in their proposals and the sale to be absolutely made on the 25th of March next ensuing. And as by this resolution there is a surplus of officers, it is ordered the number be reduced proportionable to the vessels, nor is the pay to be continued but to such as are in actual service on board.\u00b3\n\nNearly three months later the Diary of the 16th February 1743 records: The marine paymaster presents two lists, one shewing the number of officers and seamen now on board the cruisers and the other what is proposed for each vessel's fixed complement in future. This last is approved and confirmed. But though the number of Europeans now on board are more than what is therein specified which may also in future happen according as supplies are sent from England, yet to provide against the fixed complement being diminished by death desertion or other ways, any supernumerary Europeans ought to be continued but the number of lascars and topasses must not be increased unless Europeans are wanted to keep up the complement now settled. Ordered the abovementioned two lists follow this Consultation.\u2074\n\nWithin a year, 13th March 1743 and 30th March 1744, para. 23, the Court of Directors twice approve of the reduction made at Bombay in the marine force. The Court write: With satisfaction we observe that our marine was duly reduced agreeable to our orders, except in employing the Neptune's Prize instead of a sloop which you promise shall not occasion an exceeding in the expense; we therefore have no objection thereto if the continuance of that vessel was judged requisite.\u2075\n\nOn the subject of deserters in their letter of the 13th March 1743 the Court write: Having considered the great damage the Company suffer\n\n\u00b9 Pub.

A clause is inserted accordingly in each of the Captains' instructions to deter them from such a practice; but in case it has not the desired effect, be sure to acquaint us that so we may show a proper resentment.\n\nOn the arrival of any Europe ship from our other settlements, require of the Captain to inform you if he has any of our deserted soldiers or seamen on board. If he has, let him know that his refusing to deliver them up to you, must be at his peril.\n\nOn the 20th February 1752 Government write to the Court: We must request that a larger portion of mariners may be sent in our recruits as many are dead and a great number who have served out their time are uneasy that they are not discharged. Our marine is very weak.\n\nIn their letter of the 4th March 1752 the Court direct: In order to alleviate the heavy expense of our marine we have upon mature consideration resolved and do accordingly order and direct that a duty of one per cent (over and above all other duties) be levied and paid to the Company on the value of all goods wares and merchandise whatsoever (treasure excepted) imported and exported at Bombay and Surat in ships hired of the Company and in all country ships and vessels whatsoever that are entitled to our protection and wear English colours. With this proviso that you do not levy the said duty on shibars galivats and boats that supply the island of Bombay with timber, wood, fruits, grain, cattle, or provisions of any kind from the adjacent rivers and country. You must give directions to the proper officers for the regular and due collection of the said duty, calling it in your accounts a convoy duty and you must return to us an account of the annual amount thereof, at the same time that you send an account of our other revenues.\n\n---\n\n1 Court to Bombay 13th Mar. 1743 and 30th March 1744 paras 27 - 29, Pub.

Court's Letters Vol. 4 of 1752-1756, 15. Compilation of Standing Orders Vol. 1 of 1715-1721, 160. Niebuhr (1763) writes (Low's History of the Indian Navy, I. 174): The Bombay Government maintained eight or ten small ships of war with a number of armed barks, which are much employed in conveying the Company's ships and country vessels from port to port for which service, he adds, the natives are obliged to pay very dear. About the same time (1766) regarding Bombay supplies Mr. Forbes (Or. Memoirs, I. 22) writes: From being situated only a few miles from the Maratha shores and still nearer the fertile island of Salsette the markets (of Bombay) are daily supplied from thence with all the necessaries of life; for so circumscribed, so rocky, and so unequal is the surface of Bombay itself that it only produces a sufficiency of grain in one year to supply its population for six weeks. Yet each spot that will admit of cultivation and not occupied by houses is sown with rice or planted with cocoanut trees which in extensive woods lend their friendly shade to thousands of neat cottages and form delightful rides, impervious to a tropical sun.\nOn the 5th April 1754, with a view to put the marine on a footing which would ensure protection against any injury from Angria and other pirates, the Court write: Having with great attention considered the present state of our marine force at Bombay and the necessity of putting it upon such a footing as may best answer the purposes of securing our property and protecting the commerce upon the Malabar coast against the insults and depredations of Angria and other piratical people, many of whom are possessed of a number of cruisers of considerable force and Angria in particular being at present a very formidable and dangerous enemy, we find it necessary as well to make some alterations therein as to fix the exact plan of our marine force for the future. The marine force which we apprehend will be necessary to be kept up at Bombay to effectually answer the before-mentioned purposes is to be composed of four capital vessels, four ketches or sloops, and ten galivats. As the Protector is very unfit for the cruising service, and as altering her will be attended with a heavy expense, and probably will not answer at last, we therefore direct that another cruiser be built in her stead with all convenient despatch of about one hundred feet keel to mount her twenty twelve-pounder guns. This done, the Protector is to be disposed of at Bombay or elsewhere in the East Indies in such a manner as will be most advantageous to us. But she is on no pretence whatever to be disposed of so as to return to England again, nor is she to be sold to any foreigner in the East Indies, unless it be to a native or natives of India, to be employed in the East Indies only, and that not without the consent and approbation of the President and Council at that settlement where she shall be disposed of. This you must strictly observe yourselves, and take particular care to advise to our other Presidencies of in case you shall determine upon selling her at any other place than at Bombay. If the Protector cannot be disposed of for her full value at Bombay, you are to give her a full loading of cotton on our account for Bengal and direct her to be disposed of at that settlement. But previous to the disposal of her at Bombay or her proceeding elsewhere for that purpose, she is to be dismantled as a cruiser, and all such guns and stores are to be taken out of her as the Superintendent of the Marine shall think proper. You are likewise hereby directed to build another capital cruiser as soon as possible of such dimensions as you the President and Council with the advice of the Superintendent of the Marine shall think proper to mount eighteen short nine-pounder guns. And as the Guardian is represented to us as a prime sailer, but for want of breadth requires a great quantity of dead weight in her bottom to enable her to carry sail upon a wind, and even then is obliged to haul in her lee guns, you are hereby directed to reduce her masts and yards and girdle her, which we are assured will render her an effectual and good cruiser. The Bombay grab is to remain as she is, excepting only that she is to have a set of short guns instead of those she now mounts. The Drake ketch we are informed wants no alteration excepting the changing her long guns for short ones, which you are to supply her with whenever you have any fit for the purpose. The Defence ketch and the sloops Despatch and Content are to continue as they are. The Tyger schooner being very old and sailing ill is to be entirely laid aside.\nas a cruiser, as soon as you have completed the number of ten galivats and either disposed or employed in some other more suitable manner. With regard to galivats we would, as is mentioned before, have ten which are to be the Sharke, Dolphin, Swift, two of which were upon the stocks when Captain Hough left Bombay, and five small ones to be built if not already done. But as the Sharke and Dolphin are almost worn out, instead of rebuilding them, they are to be used as they are as long as they are fit for service and then replaced by two small ones. Our intention is to have ten galivats only and all of them small ones of about twenty tons each, which number is to be constantly kept up. Having thus acquainted you with the number sizes and the particular vessels of which our fleet is to be formed, we refer you to the following state thereof as a further explanation of our meaning. In this are inserted the number of the persons to be employed in each vessel, a number which must not be exceeded unless on very extraordinary occasions, and then only such an additional number of soldiers are to be sent on board as the particular service may require. The details are:\n\n| Bombay Marine | Tonnage | Europe Officers | Christian Topasses | Lascars or Country Sailors | Total Soldiers and Seamen | Guns |\n|---------------|---------|----------------|--------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|------|\n| New Cruiser, 100 feet keel | ... | 100 | 20 | 40 | 40 | 200 | 20 | 12 |\n| Bombay Grab | ... | 363 | 80 | 16 | 34 | 31 | 161 | 18 | 9 |\n| Guardian Ship | ... | 345 | 80 | 16 | 34 | 31 | 161 | 20 | 9 |\n| New Cruiser | ... | 80 | 16 | 34 | 31 | 161 | 18 | 9 |\n| Drake Ketch | ... | 290 | 40 | 10 | 24 | 20 | 94 | 14 | 6 |\n| Dolphin Ketch | ... | 70 | 10 | 10 | 15 | 18 | 92 | 12 | 4 |\n| Dispatch Sloop | ... | 65 | 16 | 6 | 14 | 18 | 54 | 12 | 4 |\n| Content Sloop | ... | 50 | 8 | 6 | 14 | 18 | 46 | 8 | 4 |\n| Sharke Galivat | ... | 35 | 6 | 6 | 20 | 10 | 48 | 1 | 3 |\n| Dolphin Galivat | ... | 37 | 6 | 6 | 20 | 16 | 48 | 1 | 3 |\n| Swift Galivat | ... | 15 | 2 | ... | 14 | 11 | 27 | 1 | 1/2 |\n| One new Galivat | ... | 20 | 2 | 2 | 16 | 11 | 31 | 1 | 2 |\n| One new Galivat | ... | 20 | 2 | 2 | 16 | 11 | 31 | 1 | 2 |\n| Five small Galivats to be built if not already done | ... | 20 | 2 | 2 | 16 | 11 | 31 | 1 | 2 |\n\nIn the same letter, 5th April 1754, the Court continue: We are aware that it is a custom to discharge the lascars when our vessels are unrigged generally about the middle of May and to impress them again at the beginning of August, being the time of rigging the vessels for the sea. This practice gives the two Angrias and others opportunity to get our best men from us, and in fact navigate their cruisers and fight us with our own people which are the best men they have in both respects. We are also informed the saving is inconsiderable, because for the want of these people you are obliged to pay day-labourers in the Bandar and Marine yards for what work the lascars so discharged would do if kept in pay. You are therefore for the future to keep the lascars belonging to our cruisers in pay the year round; and when they are not on board, they are to be employed in the Marine and\n\n---\n\n1 Court to Bombay 5th April 1754 paras 28 to 36, Pub.

This will be attended with this advantage that they will be ready on all emergencies.\n\nIn the same letter, 5th April 1754, they add: Captain Samuel Hough immediately upon his arrival at Bombay is to enter upon the duty of his office or post of Superintendent of Marine agreeable to the beforegoing regulations. He is to have an allowance of \u00a3250 a year which is to be in full for salary, diet, palanquin, servants, house-rent, and all other appointments whatsoever. But as a house near the Dock and Marine yard will be very convenient for him, when one so situated belonging to the Company can be spared, he is to have the option of living in it; and then the sum of Rs. 240 must be annually deducted from his beforementioned allowance. In case of the death or absence of Captain Hough the post or office of Superintendent of the Marine is to be filled provisionally by the Master Attendant for the time being until our further pleasure is signified to you, and in such case you are to appoint another Master Attendant likewise provisionally.\n\nOf the Bombay Marine in 1754, on the occasion of his first visit to Bombay at the time of the expedition against Gheria, Dr. Edward Ives write: Our East India Company had here one ship of forty guns, one of twenty, one grab of eighteen guns, and several other vessels; more also were building. Regarding ship-building at the same time he adds: Bombay is the most convenient place in the Indies for careening large ships. It has a good doek for small ships now (1754) being improved. On his return to Bombay in January 1758 Dr. Ives found a dock for 70-gun ships completed.\n\nIn March 1756 the Marine Superintendent Captain Samuel Hough writes to Government: As we have been so successful as to burn all Tul\u00e1ji Angria\u2019s fleet and have taken all his forts from him so that he is entirely destroyed, I beg leave to recommend to your Honours\u2019 consideration the reducing the marine expense in the following manner: The Protector to be dismantled and laid aside until such time as advices may arrive from England, when, should there be no war with France, she is to be sold out of the Honourable Company\u2019s service as she sails at a very great expense and she does not go so well as either the Revenge or Bombay grab and is not of so much real service. The Swallow to be relieved from Gombroon by the Drake and sold as we shall always be able to spare one of the cruisers as a guardship to that factory so long as it may be thought necessary to keep one there. The Despatch sloop to be sent to Surat in the place of the Content as she sails much better and has had a thorough repair and will last much longer. The Content sloop to be paid off and reduced to a luggage-boat which in my humble opinion will answer much better to the Honourable Company than selling her. The Triumph prahm to be paid off and laid up till such time as the service may require her being fitted up again as a bomb vessel which she is extremely fit for as she is\n\n---\n\n1 Court to Bombay 5th April 1754 para 37, Pub.

The Hardwicke, Warren, and Lively to be paid off and delivered up to their respective owners and all the fishing boats fitted out on the expedition to be discharged as soon as possible. On receipt of this letter, at a Consultation on the 9th March 1756, Government direct: Read a letter from Mr. Samuel Hough, Superintendent, proposing a reduction of the marine. This being approved he is ordered to give the necessary directions for that purpose as soon as he may be enabled by the arrival of the respective vessels.\u00b9\n\nTwo months later the diary of the 18th May records: Read a letter from Mr. Samuel Hough, Superintendent, enclosing lists of the commanders and officers belonging to the marine. He represents that our resolution of the 9th March last for reducing the number of cruisers will occasion the dismission of three second and seven third lieutenants. Besides he proposes to reduce several of the commanders and senior lieutenants and proposes a method of employing them to the Honourable Company's advantage by stationing them on board such vessels as are to remain in the service. Resolved, as we learnt by private overland advices received the 10th instant by the Neptune, that affairs between us and the French in Europe as to peace or war were altogether uncertain, that all the marine officers be employed as proposed till further advices are received.\u00b2\n\nAs regards the supply of cables a Consultation of the 10th August 1756 records: It being impracticable to make cables and extremely difficult even to make small rope for the marine during the rains, the Superintendent reports that it is absolutely necessary to cover the rope walk that the people may be enabled to work constantly. The Superintendent and Mr. Spencer propose, if we do not think proper to do it at the Company's expense, that they will undertake it themselves if we will allow Rs. 2 the khandi to be laid upon all cordage made therein till they are reimbursed, or to be otherwise regulated by us hereafter when they and we can judge how the above allowance will turn out. Esteeming it most for our Honourable Masters' interest, as the allowance is so very low and inconsiderable, that those gentlemen should cover the rope walk, their proposal is accordingly accepted.\u00b3\n\nNext year (1757) a Consultation of the 1st March records: Messrs. Spencer and Hough representing that they find it necessary that Rs. 2 more the khandi should be laid on all the cordage made in the rope walk to defray the expense of roofing it, as the Rs. 2 a khandi now allowed in consequence of our Resolution of the 10th August last (1756) will not near reimburse them, and that they shall annually lay an account thereof before the Board till they are cleared, it is agreed that they be permitted to charge accordingly.\u2074\n\nOf the proposed reduction to the marine force, on the 4th May 1757, the Court write: Although your success in taking Gheria with the entire\n\n\u00b9 Pub.

You must therefore continue the marine upon our last establishment until you have our further orders. Your intentions for reducing our marine expenses in the manner pointed out by the Superintendent were very commendable, and it would have given us great satisfaction if circumstances would have admitted of their being carried into execution. However we must earnestly recommend the utmost economy in the management of this unavoidably expensive branch of our affairs that the expenses may be kept within as moderate and reasonable bounds as circumstances can possibly admit of.\n\nAs regards the state and disposition of the marine force a Consultation of the 21st August 1759 records: Read a letter from the Superintendent, enclosing the state of the marine force, appointed by our Honourable Masters together with the present disposition of it; also a division of the whole (including the vessels taken from the Sidi) disposed in such manner as he thinks will best answer the service at this Presidency and Surat, which division being approved, he is ordered to proceed accordingly. The following statements give the details:\n\n**Bombay Marine, 1754.**\n\n| Names                  | Europeans | Christian Topasses | Soldiers | Lascars | Soldiers and Sailors | Guns, Pds |\n|------------------------|-----------|--------------------|----------|---------|----------------------|-----------|\n| New Cruiser, 100 feet keel | 100       | 20                 | 40       | 40      | 200                  | 20        |\n| Bombay Grab            | 80        | 16                 | 31       | 34      | 161                  | 18        |\n| Guardian Ship          | 80        | 18                 | 31       | 34      | 161                  | 20        |\n| New Cruiser            | 80        | 16                 | 31       | 34      | 161                  | 18        |\n| Drake Ketch            | 40        | 10                 | 20       | 24      | 94                   | 14        |\n| Defence Ketch          | 16        | 10                 | 18       | 16      | 60                   | 12        |\n| Despatch Sloop         | 16        | 6                  | 18       | 14      | 54                   | 12        |\n| Content do             | 8         | 6                  | 18       | 14      | 46                   | 8         |\n| Sharke Galivat         | 6         | 6                  | 16       | 20      | 48                   | 7         |\n| Dolphin do             | 6         | 6                  | 16       | 20      | 48                   | 7         |\n| Fly do                 | 2         | 2                  | 11       | 16      | 31                   | 5         |\n| Swallow do             | 2         | 2                  | 11       | 16      | 31                   | 5         |\n| Swift do               | 2         |                    | 11       | 14      | 27                   | 5         |\n| One new do             | 2         | 2                  | 11       | 16      | 31                   | 5         |\n| Do.                    | 2         | 2                  | 11       | 16      | 31                   | 5         |\n| Do.                    | 2         | 2                  | 11       | 16      | 31                   | 5         |\n| Do.                    | 2         | 2                  | 11       | 16      | 31                   | 5         |\n| Do.                    | 2         | 2                  | 11       | 16      | 31                   | 5         |\n\nN.B.\u2014The Swallow was left to the discretion of the Board whether to continue her in the service or not.\n\nTotal ... 468 132 360 396 1356 100\n\n---\n\n1 Pub.

representing that the firing a morning and evening gun from the Fort will be very useful and necessary for the better regulating the duty of this garrison, we concur therein. In order to obviate the expense attending it, which occasioned our Honourable Masters to take it off, it is resolved that we salute no other ships or vessels but such as belong to His Majesty, the Honourable Company, or foreigners, and that the\nsame regulation be observed at Tellicherry, Anjengo, Gombroon, Fort Victoria, and Onore, though any of the country powers, or other particular persons must be saluted as usual on their arrival and departure here and at any of the subordinates.\n\nA Consultation of the 24th June 1760 records: Mr. Hough, Superintendent, tendering the roof over the rope walk agreed in Consultation of the 10th August 1756, at the price it has cost him with interest thereon amounting to Rs. 19,599-0-40, and we deeming it proper that it should be our Honourable Masters' property in order to prevent any disputes that may arise with people concerned about the charge of Rs. 4 the khandi laid on all coir worked therein as noticed in Consultations of the 10th August 1756 and 1st March 1757, it is agreed that we accept said tender but that the above mentioned revenue towards defraying the cost (which since August 1756 to this time has produced Rs. 5074-2-16) be collected by the marine paymaster for the time being and that the building be completed under the Superintendent's directions.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 11th November 1760 read a letter from Mr. Hough remarking that the second dock has been finished some time; and is of great utility as he had been able to dock the largest ships in the squadron.\n\nRegarding the uniform dress of the Honourable Company's Marine, a Consultation of the 30th June 1761 records: For a Commodore a dress-coat, blue with a large boot-sleeve cuff turned up with yellow, two rows of broad and one of narrow gold lace, on the body one broad and one narrow with narrow lace button-holes. Waistcoat yellow the same as the facings and laced as the coat. A frock-coat blue with cuffs and lappells the same as the facings of the sleeves of the dress-coat, narrow lace button-holes and white single-laced waistcoat. A Captain's dress-coat blue with a large boot-cuff turned up with yellow, two rows of lace upon the cuff, a single lace on the body and narrow laced button holes. Waistcoats the same as the facings single laced and narrow laced button-holes. Frocks for captains of capital vessels, blue with cuffs and lappells the same as the facings of the sleeves of the dress-coat and single laced. Waistcoats white. Frocks for captains of the rank, blue with yellow cuffs, blue lappells laced. Waistcoats white. A Lieutenant's dress-coat blue with a boot-sleeve faced with yellow; waistcoat the same colour as the facings single laced. Frocks blue cut sleeves with yellow facings without lace. Waistcoats white. Midshipmen and masters of galivats blue with a small round cuff, no facings with a narrow cape faced with yellow.\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 34 of 1760, 271-272. Comp. of Standing Ord.

Lieutenant Charles Rathbone Low (History of the Indian Navy, I, 123) says: With increased numbers, improved discipline, and a regular uniform, the Bombay Marine became a little Navy, although it did not assume that name. The English fleets, with their line-of-battle ships and frigates, floating in the harbour, on various occasions during the next quarter of a century (1755-1780) under the command of Admirals Watson, Cornish, Pocock, and Stevens, threw the Bombay Marine into the shade, but, at the same time, taught it emulation and efficiency.\nIn 1762 on noticing the expenditure at Bombay on account of a rope-walk shed, in their letter of the 16th April, the Court write: We observe by the 129th para of your letter of the 20th November 1760 you have purchased a shed for the rope walk amounting with the first cost and interest to Rs. 19,599-0-40, which you intimate will be a valuable purchase for the Company and appears so from what was gained from 1756, being in three years Rs. 5074. We hope you will take care that it be as beneficial to us in future, though we are surprized to find that an additional expense will be necessary to complete it when it seemed before to answer all purposes. If such a work as this was necessary and so profitable it ought to have been done on our accounts. This leads us to make another observation of a practice we do not at all approve, the suddenness of things becoming necessary for the Company when gentlemen possessed of them are leaving the island and consequently can make no further advantage of them. Then we are told in support of your conduct that such are become useful to us.\n\nOn the 26th March 1766, regarding capital cruisers the Court write: We think it necessary here to acquaint you that you are not to order any capital cruiser to be put upon the stocks without first acquainting us with the necessity thereof and obtaining our express leave for that purpose, unless by any accident one of the cruisers upon your present establishment shall happen to be lost or rendered incapable of service and it may be evidently for the interest of the Company to begin building another in her room before such leave can be obtained but not otherwise. Even in this case you are hereby positively directed not to order or cause one to be set upon the stocks which shall exceed the dimensions of the Bombay grab, that is to say, breadth by the beam 30 feet, length of the keel 90 feet, and burthen 363 tons, and as vessels with bows are preferable to grabs with prows, you are in the case beforementioned to cause such cruiser to be constructed accordingly.\n\nA Consultation of the 16th December 1766 records: The Marine Superintendent representing that the rope walk will be rendered useless for making cables if the engineer persists in carrying on the retaining wall of the rampart in the manner he has begun it, that gentleman must be required to assign his reasons for the necessity of completing the rampart in that manner. In the meantime a stop must be put to the work.\n\nThe next day, the 17th December 1766, the Engineer reports: In compliance with your orders of yesterday I am now to assign my reasons for finishing the retaining wall of the rampart in the manner it is now begun. In the first place I am to acquaint the Honourable Board that the whole of the range of the rope walk in length eight hundred and sixty feet (exclusive of the part now in question)\n\n---\n\n1 Court to Bombay 16th April 1762 para 82, Pub.

Diary 47 of 1766, 327.\nis a general inconvenience to the works contiguous thereto by being so very close as not to admit of any passage for guns and stores to be transported unto them in the manner usual in fortified towns where it is always customary to leave a void space of at least forty feet between the rampart and any building whatever. But there is a greater inconveniency (if not danger) to be apprehended from the rope walk remaining in its present situation. Supposing the place to be attacked and the attack made on this part of the fortifications which is as likely as any other, this building may be set on fire by carcasses or shells and being entirely composed of timber and possibly with a quantity of coir in it may communicate a general conflagration to this quarter of the town. During such a scene of confusion, while most people's attention is turned on extinguishing the flames, the enemy may possibly make a successful assault. Even allowing this should not be the case the shot from an enemy in time of a siege will make the rope walk such a heap of ruins as will be found very troublesome to remove so as to leave proper passages for carriages to supply this part of the works with necessary stores and materials. Exclusive of the above disadvantages I am to acquaint the Board the rope walk greatly encroaches on the proper breadth of the rampart. So great is this encroachment at this particular spot that, if the walk was finished in the manner it was laid out, instead of the proper breadth of forty-eight feet, at the second flank adjacent to the Stanhope bastion there will be no more than seventeen feet three inches breadth of rampart. This encroachment goes on in an oblique direction so as to leave the rampart at the return of the flank only thirteen feet broad. This extreme small breadth makes it impossible for any kind of carriage, even a wheelbarrow, to pass in the rear of the platforms of the second flank, so that the communication between the Marlborough and Stanhope bastions is entirely stopped and you are in time of siege deprived of replacing any guns that may be dismounted in one bastion by those of the other. The above remarks and reasons are so obvious that I flatter myself the Honourable Board will see the necessity of entirely removing this building, the which at this season cannot be attended with any inconvenience by loss of time as the labourers employed on that business can work as well without as with a shade and long before the rains. Or, if thought necessary, I will for about Rs. 4000 take upon me in six weeks to remove and complete it as it now stands to near the Marine Boat Yard or to any other part which shall be judged more convenient. Referring the whole to the Honourable Board's consideration, I request that they will be pleased to give me their orders in regard thereto as speedy as may be convenient, the works in this quarter being entirely at a stand.\n\nOn perusing the above report, the 19th December 1766, the Board observe: Read a letter from the Principal Engineer assigning his reasons for carrying on the retaining wall of the rampart in the manner it is begun, and representing that the rope walk, situated where it is at present, is a general inconvenience to the works in that quarter of the town. But as he represents it may be removed for the sum of\n\n---\n\n1 Pub., Diary 47 of 1766, 849-851.\nRs. 4000, and as he says the expedient proposed to him for obviating the inconvenience he complains of, namely lowering the roof and making it flat by throwing a platform over the particular part, will cost more, he and the Marine Superintendent are ordered to look out for a spot at a proper distance without the town to remove it to.\n\nA Consultation of the 6th January 1767 records: Read a letter from the provisional superintendent and principal engineer representing that they cannot find any proper spot without the esplanade to remove the rope walk to. Also another letter from the superintendent, setting forth the advantages and conveniences of its present situation and pointing out the expedient mentioned in our Consultation of the 19th ultimo of throwing a platform over that part of the walk which interferes with the rampart to prevent its impeding the engineer from carrying on the same. This the engineer, who was present when it was mentioned, was of opinion would be equally strong. And as both he and the superintendent declare there is no proper spot without the town to remove the walk to, and as the latter urges, even if there was, it would be attended with a very considerable additional expense of cooly hire, for these reasons we are of opinion the platform expedient should be preferred. In order that the walk may be still less inconvenient to the works, it is further agreed to lower the present roof, the expense of which will be more than defrayed by the timber which will be taken out of it and which is ordered to be appropriated to other services.\n\nOn the 8th March 1766, in pursuance of the Court\u2019s order, the Committee appointed to inquire into the state of the Marine Department submitted the following report: Pursuant to the order of the Board for carrying into execution the commands of the Honourable Company received this year by the Fox respecting the Marine Department, we have carefully attended to the several orders on this head since the year 1754, and the regulations made in consequence thereof. We have examined the state and condition of each vessel, and of the marine yard. The annexed statement will point out to your Honours the number of cruisers employed, several of which are almost new and the rest in excellent order, having been thoroughly repaired in the course of the two last seasons. We have also annexed a statement of the marine for the year 1754, from whence you will observe the monthly expense of victualling and sailing the fleet is at present Rs. 2000 less than the former establishment. This indeed is chiefly occasioned by the number of the European seamen being less than the appointment, and which is the cause of the Royal Admiral being laid up. Here we think it our duty to represent to your Honours that many of the military recruits who came out this season declare they entered for the marine but being now obliged to serve in the military against their inclinations, it will prevent others from engaging in the marine service in future the consequences of which we need not point out to you. That, as far as the Board\u2019s authority extends, a proper discipline is duly observed we hope will fully appear to your Honours from the annexed copy of the general\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Consultation 19th Dec. 1766, Pub. Diary 47 of 1766, 844.\n2 Bom. Gov. Consultation 6th Jan. 1767, Pub. Diary 48 of 1767, 3-4.\ninstructions to the Commanders. We can only lament they are not properly empowered to enforce them with vigour. The seamen well knowing this are constantly inclined to a mutinous turbulent behaviour, which, to prevent dangerous consequences, the Commanders are at times obliged to take upon them to quell and chastise the offenders, though for want of a legal authority they lay themselves open to a prosecution. Nor can it be expected that the marine of Bombay will be conducted with the same order and regularity as the military is unless the Commanders are furnished with the same means of enforcing obedience. We do not nor cannot believe the Commanders of any of your cruisers sell spirituous liquors to the seamen. We have the pleasure to say you have a set of gentlemen in your service who are above making any mean advantage of that kind. Such slops as are necessary for the health and preservation of the seamen the Commanders are allowed to furnish them with. We are satisfied this liberty is not abused. For the reasons before recited we are of opinion that the vessels should each have three commissioned officers and a master-at-arms which we leave to your Honours' determination. The marine yard and rope walk are chiefly under the direction of the master attendant Lavji and his sons, all of whom we can with truth assure your Honours are men of care and assiduity in the several parts of the Marine committed to their care. In regard to the marine yard we have only to remark that it is too much confined, which prevents the timber from being kept altogether with that distinction and regularity which is necessary. Could the hospitals be thrown into the marine yard, it would be of great use. With respect to Mr. Hague's complaint against Mr. England the latter has already replied thereto in an address to your Honours to which we beg leave to refer. Upon the whole we have only to assure you that the several branches of the marine department are carried on upon the plan laid down in the year 1754, and we are convinced the greatest care and economy are observed in the execution thereof. This report would have been laid before your Honours sooner, but our attention being wholly taken up with the despatch of the True Briton prevented it.\n\nThe statements and instructions given below contrast the details of the Marine in 1754 and 1766:\n\n| Ships          | Built     | Launched   | Breadth of Beam | Length of Keel | Merchants Tonnage | Anchors | Grapnels |\n|----------------|-----------|------------|-----------------|---------------|------------------|---------|----------|\n| Protector Ship | London    | 23rd Nov. 1751 | Ft.

During any cruise you shall be directed to make or at any station you shall be appointed to by the President or Superintendent you are to follow all such orders as you shall receive signed by the Superintendent for your management or conduct. When you shall not be specially instructed you shall observe the following rules: In the first place you are to take care and keep up the service of God on board the vessel you command and according to the liturgy of the Church of England that the same be decently performed every Lord\u2019s Day and at all other appointed seasons as often as you can do it with convenience. Be very strict in observing a good decorum and discipline amongst your ship\u2019s company, severely punishing all profaneness or blasphemers of God\u2019s holy name, and on no account permit gaming of any kind. Keep your vessel\nalways in a posture of offending as well as defending, and speak with\nand examine all vessels you make that are not of superior force to\nyou, taking out of such belonging to any prince or state all British\nsubjects you shall find on board them. You are to take, burn, sink,\nor otherwise destroy all pirates you may at any time meet with\ninfesting these seas particularly the Sangarians, Cooleys, and other\nRovers harbouring to the northward and commonly cruising on that\ncoast and sometimes as far as the gulfs of Mokha and Persia, bringing\nsuch people vessels and goods belonging to them into this port for\ncondemnation. All people of the Sidi\u2019s fleet or otherwise belonging to\nthe Moghal Emperor, as also all ships and vessels belonging to the\nMar\u00e1th\u00e1s, you are civilly to examine so as not to give them disgust,\nand they, proving to be Moghal or Mar\u00e1tha, give them no molestation\nbut any aid or assistance they may stand in need of. You are hereby\nordered to protect defend and give convoy to all ships and vessels\nunder English colours duly licensed to wear them and to no others. It\nhaving been taken into consideration how much the trade and public\nservice of this island has at times suffered by our cruisers\u2019 giving\nconvoy to foreign ships and vessels up and down this coast, from\nwhich no advantage accrues to the Honourable Company but the\ncontrary, you are strictly commanded not to give convoy to such ships\nor vessels even from one port to the other ever so near, or to the\nMacao (or Hongkong) ships, notwithstanding they should be bound\nhither or to Surat. For though thereby the Company should benefit\nsomething by the customs on their cargoes, yet the encouraging or\ncountenancing their trade on this coast, has a pernicious effect on the\npepper trade, and in general all the commodities the Honourable Com-\npany deal in for China; that the benefit by customs by no means\ncounterbalances those inconveniences. It is for the Company\u2019s interest\nthat such commerce should by all suitable means be discouraged and\nthat thereby the Macao ships may be induced to restrain their trade\nto this coast, which of late has increased to an exorbitant pitch. This\nis not meant to extend so far as to prevent the mutual intercourse\nusual between nations in alliance with one another such as the grant\nof supplies of provisions wood and water in cases of distress, nor to the\nships or vessels actually belonging to the Moors or other merchants,\ninhabitants of Surat, as by our possession of the phirman for the\nMoghal\u2019s fleet they are entitled to convoy. The British soldiers and\nseamen who desert from this island usually take service in the ships\nbelonging to Bengal and Madras vainly flattering themselves that\nby taking such service they are screened from our authority and from\nthe punishments due to their crimes. To discourage a practice of such\nevil tendency to the safety and welfare of this Government, we hereby\nauthorise you to seize all such deserters when and wheresoever you\nmay meet them, taking care to secure them in a proper manner until\nyou have an opportunity of reporting them to us or the Marine\nSuperintendent. And for the better executing of these our orders\nand keeping up an exact register of all deserters which you are to do\non board your ship, you will have a list given you of their names. You\nare to do the like to other commanders for all those who may desert\nfrom your own ship, certifying when where and how many go at a\ntime and report the same likewise to the Superintendent. And whereas we understand an ill is made of our indulgence in permitting you to sell arrack to your ship's company insomuch that the remainder of their wages is not sufficient to provide them with common necessaries, and from thence they become discontented and mutinous and are induced to quit the service, and as the Honourable Company have thought proper to allow the commanders and officers an indulgence of trade, it is specified in the 11th article of these instructions, you are to suffer your people to take up slops and tobacco to the amount of Rs. 3 a month, and no more. Nor, on penalty of being dismissed the service for so doing, are you to sell or suffer to be sold any arrack brandy or any sort of liquors on board any of the Honourable Company's cruisers for ready money or on credit. You are not to discharge or exchange any of your seamen nor to prefer them to posts of trust and better pay without the leave of the President or Superintendent. In cases of infidelity disobedience or incapacity you have power of suspension. You are not therefore to proceed any further without leave first obtained as above. You have permission to list as many able men as you can, reporting them to the Superintendent but beware of encouraging any of the seamen belonging to His Majesty's or the Honourable Company's Europe ships to desert on pain of our severest censure the which you must likewise give in charge to all the officers of your ship. In case of any vacancy happening by the death or suspension of any warrant officer, you may recommend those you think best qualified for filling up such vacancy, but they are not to receive any advance in their pay till they are confirmed by the President or Superintendent. We in a special manner recommend to you that no waste or embezzlement be made of the ammunition and stores in general, and that all stores and provisions be carefully preserved on such penalties and punishments on the offenders as shall be judged reasonable and as the crime may deserve. It having been represented to the Honourable Company that the Commanders of their cruisers had nothing to live upon but their bare pay, they have out of their wonted compassion thought proper to annul their former order that no manner of goods should be laden either on their own accounts or any other person's account on their cruisers when on a cruise, and have thought proper when occasions may offer to load either their own goods or others when the vessels are under cruising orders. They have also indulged the commanders and officers to lade goods on board them but with this absolute restriction that such goods shall neither lumber the vessel nor put her out of her sailing trim, and that a regular register book be kept on board each vessel of all goods laden and unladen from any of the Company's cruisers, which book is to be signed by the first and second lieutenants and boatswain and to be delivered to the Superintendent on your arrival at Bombay, to be sent by the President and Council to the Honourable Company. This order you are strictly to observe at your peril. You are not on any account whatsoever to receive any goods belonging to any person or persons on board any of the Honourable Company's cruisers without having an order from the Superintendent for so doing. A regular account of those goods must be delivered into his office before the cruiser sails out-\nof this port. Likewise an account of what goods you receive on board at any other ports, particularly the subordinates for which you must have an order from the Chief or Chief and Factors which must be delivered on your arrival at Bombay with the report of your proceedings during your absence. In every boat sent on shore from the vessel you command with the Honourable Company's goods there must be a proper person to attend their delivery on landing. You will be deemed responsible for and obliged to make good any deficiency that may arise from pillaging or otherwise except unavoidable accidents. You are to give convoy to no boat loaded with salt unless it can produce a certificate in the following words signed by the Custom Master: Bombay Custom House . . . . . August 1766. This is to certify that this boat . . . . . , whereof this tindal . . . . . . is loaded with salt and has paid the Honourable Company's duties. You must call upon the tindals of all merchant boats that may at any time proceed under your convoy to produce their passes. And if any of those passes are out of date or if the tindal should not be able to produce one, you are then to levy a fine of Rs. 100 to be equally divided between you and the County, and likewise oblige the tindal to pay the Secretary's fee which is Rs. 4 for every boat under one hundred khandis, and Rs. 8 for one exceeding that burthen, and Rs. 16 for one above two hundred khandis, besides Re. 1 for the Gentu sirwan (escrivan).\n\nThese instructions were accompanied by the following remarks from the Marine Superintendent to the commanders in the Honourable Company's marine force at Bombay: Herewith you will receive instructions signed by the Honourable Charles Crommelin Esquire, relative to your conduct in general. It is notwithstanding thought necessary to give you the following additional instructions for your guidance during your command on board any of the Honourable Company's cruisers: Before you proceed on any cruise you are to station your people in their quarters. And that you may not be put in confusion by any sudden attempt, you are to keep a strict watch in all places, at anchor as well as at sea, and to be always ready to engage an enemy. You are to exercise your people at their great guns and small arms twice in every week when the weather will permit. You are to examine on the first day of every month the several expenses of the boatswain gunner and carpenter made use of in the preceding month, and if you find them warrantable you are to sign them in testimony of your approbation. Many fatal accidents have befallen the Honourable Company by fire. You are to suffer no pitch or tar to be heated on board, and strictly to prohibit all lights after eight o'clock at night except in your own or the lieutenant's cabin, or what are employed in the unavoidable service of the ship. You are to keep in your custody the key of the powder room, and in your absence the commanding officer on board. The gunner is to have the key only during his performing any service in the magazine by your direction. At all such times you are to place a midshipman at the powder room scuttle with a sentry to his assistance. You are directed at all times to advise\nme or in my absence the master attendant of the condition of your vessel and such other advice as may be safe and necessary to communicate. On your return from any cruise you are immediately to inform me or in my absence my assistant of your arrival giving in a report of all material occurrence during your said cruise. The expense of powder in the marine having been very great it is strictly recommended to you not to be too lavish of your fire, when you are in pursuit and not to make use of great guns in signals, without necessity for so doing. You are not to salute at any time on your going from or your returning to Bombay, or to fire any guns on days of rejoicing or company being on board without an order and the same is to be observed when you are at any of the subordinate settlements. You are not to salute any ships whatever except his Majesty's without an order. And if you are saluted by any Europeans you are to return gun for gun, but to all others two guns less, and when you anchor in ports of foreigners in amity with the English and which are garrisoned, you are to salute but not exceed nine guns, on being previously assured you will have gun for gun returned. You are not to punish publicly or privately a lieutenant, midshipman, boatswain, gunner, or carpenter without a public examination or court of enquiry consisting of the above officers and yourself. And no punishment inflicted by the said court on such officers is to be corporal, nor to extend beyond suspension or confinement. All acts of disobedience or other small offences that shall be committed by the petty officers, seamen, soldiers, and lascars, are to be punished by a judgment of such a court. But no punishment for any offence shall exceed twenty stripes, with a lash of nine tails, at one time, not to be repeated in less than three days. And all your proceedings of this nature are to be entered in your journal. You are strictly enjoined to prevent as much as possible the barbarous practice of beating, and as fatal consequences may sometimes attend such proceedings you are to give orders that no seamen or soldiers are to be struck except with a rattan and not even with a rattan more than six blows for one fault. With regard to the vessel's provisions and the military people who are from time to time ordered on board as detachments the following directions are to be strictly complied with. You are to take charge of all such provisions as are sent on board your vessel for the use of the people belonging to it, and any extraordinary number by way of detachment or otherwise that may be ordered with you, taking care the same be not wasted or damaged, you being accountable for all such deficiencies unless caused by unavoidable accidents. You are to take care that all provisions indented for be received on board and not left ashore, without giving notice at the marine office, and that the chits or orders for such provisions be returned, that they may be cancelled, otherwise it will be a charge to your account. That the people belonging to your vessel be daily mustered and all necessary circumstances entered in the books given you for that purpose, such as men changed, discharged, runaway, left behind on going out upon a cruise, sent into the hospital, or dead. Likewise such as are ordered from you on board any other vessel, or on shore upon any occasion, minutely down the same opposite the men's names, and under the day\nof the month wherein such alterations happen. The same method is also to be observed in case of entering or receiving men from any other vessel from the hospital or elsewhere, omitting no remarks that may be useful or necessary for the right adjusting your accounts of provisions, the expense of which you are to collect from your muster book, drawing out an abstract of the number of people you had on board the whole month, computing the quantity of each species of provisions expended from that month according to the Honourable Company's allowance to the several sorts of people on board. This account together with your account of remains of provisions and your note to what time you are victualled you are to sign and send into the marine office at the end of every month if at this port. But if at such time you happen to be out on a cruise you are to deliver in such accounts on your return, sending your muster books, with the said accounts, that the same may be examined. If any be lent or spared to any other vessel in company with you, you are to take a receipt for it, and enter such provisions in your account of expense, sending in the said receipt as a voucher. It being thought necessary to keep an account of the detachment ordered on board apart, a book has accordingly been delivered you for that purpose. In it you are to enter their number, names, quality, day of coming on board and when sent on shore, or any other occurrence relating to them that is necessary for the better stating your provision account. The expense of such detachments you are to draw out separate and deliver to me for my approval before you are to be credited for the same. And as mistakes may arise through the neglect of stewards concerning the weight of live cattle, when any are sent on board here, you are to order your officers to see that such cattle when slaughtered be justly weighed and entered down, which account weight of cattle is to be signed and sent with your monthly account expenses. This you are to observe with such cattle as you receive at Surat or any other of the Honourable Company's settlements; naming the place where you received them, and with respect to all other particulars received at any other subordinate settlements you are to be as particular as possible and deliver an account of the same on your arrival at this port. Before any provisions are returned notice must be given thereof in the marine office that proper chits may be given to you directed to the persons who are to receive such provisions; and that you order the steward to see the same returned, and take a receipt from the person to whom the same is delivered. This receipt to be lodged in the office, that you may be credited in your account for the same. If any provisions should be returned and happen thereby to be spoiled or rendered unfit for use, the same will remain a charge to your account as if no such return had been made. It sometimes will happen, notwithstanding our utmost care to prevent it, that part of your provisions by the badness of weather or the length of a voyage comes to be much damaged. In such case you and your officers are to proceed to a survey of the same of which survey a report is to be made in writing and to contain the following particulars: The time when and place where such survey is made, the special sort of provisions damaged, the number or quantity, how long since first received, whether damaged so as to be unfit for use, and how the same came\nto be damaged. This you and your officers are to sign. On your arrival deliver it in as a certificate of the same, and without such certificate no provisions said to be damaged or thrown overboard will be allowed. The receipt of bags, dippers (dab\u00e1s), and jars at Surat is thought unnecessary and it is expected that your best endeavours will be used to lessen any expense of that kind. If at any time any ensign or other commissioned officer of the military should be put on board your ship to command the detachment he will have orders from his Captain-Commandant frequently to exercise all the soldiers. If you find he neglects this service once a week when the weather is fair and occasion proper, you are modestly to put him in mind of his duty but not use harsh measures to force him to a compliance reporting only on your return to me any omission of this sort that he may be guilty of. When any soldier commits a fault, his punishment must be agreed upon by you and the commissioned officer of the military, and not inflicted without the officer's consent, that thereby order and good harmony may be kept up between the marine and military people on board your vessel. This is strongly recommended as absolutely necessary for the good of the service.\n\nOn your return from any cruise, you are to report to me or in my absence to the master attendant the condition of your vessel, what repairs she may want, and whether there is any necessity of bringing her on shore in order to new clean or pay her bottom. While you continue in port, you are to keel and scrub once a week, but when out at sea as often as the weather and opportunity will permit. That your muster books may be of more general use, you are not only to collect from them the expense of your provisions, but also your abstract or account of wages due to the several men belonging to your vessel. To this end all people victualled by you are to be paid their wages by your abstract commencing at the time of entry and ceasing at the time of discharge. No person sent from on board you to any other vessel is to be paid on your abstract for any longer time than he has actually been on board or victualled by you. Also such persons as are sent to the hospital are not to be on your abstract, as there is an hospital abstract kept separate and under that head they will be paid for the time they remain there. If they should be returned back to their respective vessel, their pay is to commence again on your abstract, or the abstract of such vessels or other place they shall be ordered to, from the day you receive and victual them. To prevent mistakes arising from men being ordered from one vessel to another, all commanders are to give notice to the man or men who are so ordered to be discharged or are sent into the hospital signifying how many days or to what time they have been mustered on board the vessel they are sent from, that the people belonging to the vessel or place to which they are to go may be informed from what time to commence their muster of such persons. By this means the charge of one or more men upon different vessels, or under different heads, for one and the same day will be avoided. It may happen when a vessel is ordered to sail that some of the people belonging to her are on shore, with the leave of the Commander or the business of the ship, and by\nthese means are accidentally left behind. Others there are who at such times do purposely abscond and hide themselves in such a manner that they are not discovered until several days after or perhaps not till the vessels return. In any of these cases you are not to muster such people or continue them on the abstract any longer than the day your vessel sailed and left such people behind. Nor are they to be received on board again without an order, in which order it will signify whether you are to muster such persons and continue them on the abstract for payment of their wages from the day of your sailing and leaving them behind, or whether they are to be mulcted their wages and provisions for such time as the case and occasion of their being left behind shall appear to be upon examination. Whenever you come to give in your abstract of wages or make up your account-provisions, you are always to bring ashore with you your muster books that such an abstract or account may be examined thereby. After which examination, provided no errors appear, payment of your said abstract will be ordered, and your account of provisions passed as adjusted with office books. You are always to have officers on board when in port except when getting ready to clear for the sea. They are then all to attend duly without exception. Every cruiser to keep a regular log book to be signed by the first or second lieutenant before they relieve each other at noon every day to be delivered in at the end of the cruising season or at the return from any voyage. Every Commander is likewise to deliver in a journal regularly kept, with such remarks as he may make from time to time that may be any way conducive to the service now or hereafter. No alterations are to be made in any of the cruisers in any manner whatever without orders for so doing. No stores of any kind are to be condemned without a regular survey. When so condemned they are to be returned into the proper stores from whence they were received except cables, cordage, and sails, and these must be returned to the master attendant in order that they may be converted to the use of the luggage boats in the bandar. The following instructions were at the same time issued by the Superintendent to the Lieutenants in the Honourable Company's Marine Service at Bombay: You being appointed by the Honourable Charles Crommelin Esquire to serve the Honourable Company on board any of their ships in quality of a lieutenant you are to pay a strict obedience to the Commander under whom you are appointed to serve. In instances where you apprehend yourself injured you are to represent the same to the President or Superintendent, and on no account presume to do yourself justice on your superiors by a personal resentment. You are not to conceal from your Commander any misdemeanor or irregularity that is to your knowledge committed on board, but acquaint him therewith as soon as you have an opportunity. You are to keep a regular Sea Journal in which you are carefully to insert the bearings and distances of the land in sight, with the depths of water. Also an account of what vessels you discover together with your transactions in chase or engagements, and any other remarks you think may be of use. This you are to deliver if required to the President or Superintendent. You are to keep a strict look-out during your watch that you may not at any time be surprised by enemies or other dangers. Therefore you must keep the people on duty stirring\nby night to prevent their sleeping, but by no means to be guilty of that fault yourself which will upon complaint be highly resented. You are, as much as in you lies, to prevent any damage to the Honourable Company's ships or any waste of their stores on board, and be very careful to prevent any accidents by fire. You are at all times when on command to execute your order with courage and fidelity, to behave with cheerfulness and humanity to your inferiors, and to endeavour in time of action to animate them by your good example.\n\nOn perusing the above report with its accompaniments, at a Consultation of the 10th March 1766 the Board observe: Read the report from the Committee appointed to enquire into the state of the marine agreeable to the Honourable Company's commands. Ordered that copy thereof and of the several papers annexed, be transmitted to our Honourable Masters and that also they follow this Consultation. Also that in future the officers be composed only of the number the Committee recommend.\n\nOn the same subject next year, 4th April 1767, the Court write: The state of your marine with the report of the committee of inquiry have been perused with attention. We have thought proper to order the several following regulations to be established for the better conducting this important branch to which due regard must be paid. It is expected the Commodore, Captains, and officers when on duty do wear the Company's uniform and ever behave themselves as gentlemen to do credit to the service. The rank of the officers and share of prize money be ascertained when on service with his Majesty's ships to prevent injury in this respect to individuals. Before any person receives a Lieutenant's commission he be examined as to his capacity as a seaman and good navigator by a committee of Commanders. And on his coming to the rank of a first lieutenant he be examined again as a pilot for the Malabar Coast and the harbours in those seas, and to be set aside if not qualified. For the better encouragement of capable officers entering into the Company's marine and to enable them to support their characters in a decent and proper manner their pay is to be augmented as will be spoke of hereafter. Here it may not be amiss to remark that from the trade and shipping of Bombay being much increased and greater encouragement given to officers in the merchants' employ than in the Company's service, few capable officers desire to engage in it but prefer the advantages of the merchants' service earned with much less danger and fatigue. Also some officers who have been dismissed the Company's marine for misdemeanours have met with such encouragement in the merchants' service that instead of looking on their dismissal as a punishment rather consider it as a fortunate event. To remedy this in future it is proposed that such officers as are dismissed be not allowed to remain in India but are to be sent to England. That the lieutenants be advised they are not entitled to the captain's table which they have claimed as their right. But that the captains may be left to act therein as they think proper, that\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 46 of 1766, 176-183.\n2 Bom. Gov. Consultation 10th Mar. 1766, Pub. Diary 46 of 1766, 159.\nclaim being sometimes attended with very disagreeable circumstances which may subvert the order discipline and subordination so necessary in all communities, and to keep up a harmony and good understanding in the cruisers. That the lieutenants next to a command should serve under the Commodore as the proper channel for preferment. That such volunteers as are sent out for the Marine service be not permitted to change into the military. That the present regulation of the galivats is very improper as their masters are taken from the class of boatswains and gunners who oftentimes from want of education are unfit to command vessels carrying eight to ten guns and a company of between forty and fifty men having often large convoys under their care. To obviate this inconvenience and for the advantage of the service in general, as well as an encouragement to the lieutenants in particular, it is recommended that the command of galivats be given to lieutenants. That an officer called a master-at-arms is necessary on board the capital cruisers, his duty being to discipline the seamen to small arms and to take care of the lights and to prevent disturbances in the ship. Such a station would be a comfortable provision to a sergeant who is rendered incapable of his duty in the infantry, and to teach seamen to shoot at a butt for exercising the artillery when their business will permit. The pay of the commanders of the capital cruisers to continue at the present establishment of Rs. 80 a month and two servants, and the commanders of the other ships at Rs. 60 a month and one servant. No lieutenants are to rank below third lieutenants. The pay of the first lieutenants to be augmented to Rs. 50 a month and of the second and third to Rs. 40 each, each lieutenant being allowed a servant. Surgeons to have Rs. 50 a month and a servant; and, as a farther encouragement, they are to be removed from the marine to the subordinate factories according to their seniority and as vacancies happen, and from thence to the Presidency. The boatswains' and gunners' pay to be Rs. 24 and the midshipmen's Rs. 16 a month, and the boatswains' and gunners' mates each Rs. 12.\n\nIn their letter of 18th March 1768 the Court write: The cruiser you inform us was building of five hundred tons burthen we suppose was absolutely necessary and consequently acquiesce in. At the same time we cannot agree with you that one of a larger burthen would be for our interest. We suppose this new cruiser and the Defiance are built to carry twelve-pounders which we think is heavier mettle than any of our cruisers have occasion to make use of. Another objection is that the additional number of men required to answer the purpose intended will be too great for us ever to keep up, finding it very difficult even upon the present plan to procure seamen sufficient. As we wrote you fully under the 26th March 1766 by Anson and Devonshire on this subject we refer you thereto.\n\nOn the 28th October 1769 a Consultation records: Read a letter wrote by order of a Bench of His Majesty's Justices representing the\n\n---\n\n1 Court to Bombay 4th April 1767 paras 10-25, Pub.

After consideration it is agreed to regulate the wages of the lascars in the following manner, and to issue a publication requiring the same to be strictly adhered to. If any of them are found hereafter to take more, they will be fined or receive such corporal punishment as any two of His Majesty's Justices of the Peace may think proper to inflict: Helmsmen, Rs. 10 a month; topasses Rs. 6; lascars Rs. 5; and batta lascars Re. \u00bd a day.\n\nOn April 6th, 1770, with a view to reduce the marine force the Court write: As peace is restored with Haidar Ali, and as, during the course of the war, his strength by sea has been much diminished, we direct that you do not keep up a larger naval force than is absolutely necessary for preserving that superiority and state of defence which must always be maintained at Bombay. It is our pleasure that you consult our Superintendent on this matter, and that you proceed to adjust the marine establishment on the most frugal plan possible which may be consistent with the safety of our possessions and the effectual protection of our commerce in those parts, taking care at all times to conform to the instructions given you by our letters of the 18th March 1768 para 12, and of the 26th March 1766 para 11, respecting the size of ships to be at any time built or employed at our Presidency of Bombay.\n\nOn the representation of the merchants regarding the exorbitant wages demanded by seafaring people, the Marine Superintendent writes to Government on the 6th August 1771: The merchants have often made representations to this Honourable Board of the exorbitant wages demanded by, and other impositions on the part of, the common seafaring people belonging to this port. In consequence thereof several regulations have been published by Government, to restrain the helmsmen, sirangs, lascars, and others belonging to this port from insisting on exorbitant wages. Yet the merchants notwithstanding are often obliged to submit to their impositions rather than suffer their vessels to remain in port to the great prejudice of trade. From the same cause the Honourable Company's cruisers are greatly distressed to make up their complement of men, and often go to sea with half their complement of lascars, though there are numbers in the place. But this evil arises from sirangs supporting and keeping them, though they have no money, and gives them this influence over this class of people. I beg leave to offer the following regulations to your consideration as a means to remove this great clog to trade, as well as to enable the Honourable Company's commanders of the cruizers to keep up their complements of natives for the stated pay allowed, and also to secure that on any emergency men can be found immediately for any sudden service:\n\n---\n\n1 Bom.

Vol. 8 of 1769-1771, 138.\nThat an office be established under the direction of the Superintendent, in which the names of all helmsmen, topasses, sirangs, and lascars belonging to this port shall be enrolled with the place of their abode; also all helmsmen topasses or lascars that shall be discharged from or leave any ship in this port shall be enrolled with the place of their abode and with whom they lodge. That a head sirang be appointed to look after and take cognizance of all lascars and a native Christian be appointed to take cognizance of all helmsmen and topasses. That all persons who shall entertain in their houses helmsmen or topasses or lascars shall on their entertaining them give notice to the office of their names and what ship they last belonged to, and their stations on board with a description of their persons and ages; and, on their leaving such houses whether to go on board ship or otherwise, the person with whom such helmsmen topasses or lascars lodged, shall within twelve hours give notice of the same to this office. That any person or persons refusing to comply with or neglecting the aforesaid regulations shall, for the first offence, pay a fine of Rs. 25 and for the second offence pay a fine of Rs. 50, and be disabled from keeping any house of entertainment in future. That the head sirang and head Christian native shall give Rs. 1000 security for their carefully and diligently discharging the duties of their offices. That every captain, commander or owner of every ship shall bring or cause to be brought all people who shall be shipped here, whether Europeans, helmsmen, lascars, or topasses, to this office to have their names registered and make their personal appearance. For this each person shall pay Re. 1, half of this to be paid either to the head sirang for such lascars as are shipped or to the head Christian native for every helmsman or topass and the other half to go towards defraying the necessary expenses of this office. That no Captain or overseer shall pay more than Rs. 12 a month to a sirang of a ship, Rs. 10 to a first tindal of a ship or a sirang of a two-mast vessel, Rs. 8 to a second tindal of a ship or a first tindal of a two-mast vessel, Rs. 7\u00bd to a nakhuda or second tindal of a two-mast vessel, Rs. 5 to a lascar, Rs. 10 to a helmsman, and Rs. 6 to a topass. That on proof and conviction of any more being paid, a fine of Rs. 500 shall be levied, one-half to go to the informer and one-half to the register-office. That batta lascars shall have only one-quarter of a rupee a day, and shall have no provision; their sirangs' and tindals' pay only as beforementioned. That any helmsman, sirang, tindal, or lascar requiring or demanding more pay than is fixed by these regulations, shall, on the evidence of two witnesses, be fined one month's pay and receive corporal punishment.\n\nIf these regulations meet your approbation, I beg you will recommend them to the Honourable the Court of Directors for their being established as a private law for this colony.\n\nOn receipt of this letter from the Marine Superintendent, the 13th August 1771, the Board record: In consequence of a letter from the Marine Superintendent respecting the pay and management of the sirangs helmsmen and lascars belonging to this place, it is resolved, as it appears for the benefit of the trade of this place, that the regulations proposed be carried into execution, and the Secretary is to issue a proclamation to give due notice of it.\n\nOn the 16th December 1771 the President communicated by letter to the Board the following plan for the reduction of the marine charges: The charges of the marine on close of the books for 1770 surpass the amount of customs near a lakh and a half of rupees and I fear from the late decline of trade that on close of those for 1771 the difference will be still greater. I now therefore lay before you a plan I have formed for a reduction in the expenses of the capital cruisers galivats and boats, and\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 58 of 1771, 780-783.\n2 Pub. Diary 58 of 1771, 766. Comp. of Standing Ord. Vol. 2 of 1759-1788, 269.\ncharges on merchandise. The present monthly pay and provisions, with provisions to the detachments, amounts on a medium to Rs. 24,200. The plan I propose to reduce it to, will not exceed Rs. 18,200 which, including Rs. 2190, the expense of patamars and luggage boats not inserted in the abstract laid before the Board in the year 1766, and allowing for the difference of pay and provisions to 274 Europeans more in the service, and the increase of the lieutenants and their advanced wages, will decrease the expense below what it then was. The real lessening of the present charges will be Rs. 6000 a month in the pay and provisions. And as I propose that the Resolution or Bombay grab, Expedition ketch, Triumph prahm, and four galivats should be laid up, the expense of their wear and tear will also be saved. I have calculated for the Resolution being continued in commission. But when the grab is repaired, the Resolution may be laid up or sold and the difference of their sailing charges being Rs. 1000 a month, the expense will be so much less. It is my opinion that it would be better to sell her as she is by no means calculated for a ship of war not being able to carry or fight her lower deck guns. In consideration of the additional number of European seamen that this alteration will occasion on board the respective vessels, you will be pleased to observe it is my intention that the detachments in future shall be formed of topasses which alone will cause a considerable difference in the expense of provisions. The charges of the galivat employed to and from Butcher's Island ought to be defrayed by the military paymaster under the head of garrison charges.\n\nTouching the above proposals on the 18th December 1771 the Board record: The President laid before the Board a letter proposing a reduction in the establishment and expense of the marine and enclosing a statement of it agreeable to his proposal. After consideration it is ordered that our Honourable Employers be advised thereof in our address per Dutton, and that the marine superintendent be furnished with a copy of it for his opinion on that subject till when the consideration of it is deferred.\n\nTwo months later, the 18th February 1772, Mr. Watson the Marine Superintendent, writes: The reduction of the marine is an object I have ever had in view, but as will fully appear by the accounts of the different services transmitted home by every ship, the troubles in Persia, the service at Balambangan, and the different expeditions have hitherto caused full employment for all our vessels. Nay, such have been the exigencies of the service that private vessels have been necessarily freighted to carry it on. After the Cooley (Koli) and Broach expeditions were over I did propose to the Honourable the President a reduction of the marine. In particular, as soon as our cruisers were returned from the different services on which they were employed, I proposed to lay up the Resolution and such other vessels as were not immediately necessary for the protection of our trade or to awe the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s who have lately increased their marine very considerably, and by their many and repeated insults\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 59 of 1771, 1510-1512.\n2 Pub. Diary 59 of 1771, 1499.\nshow how necessary it is to keep a watchful eye upon them to prevent their putting a total stop to our trade on every trifling occasion and otherwise annoying our settlements. I have carefully examined the plan laid before you by the Honourable the President which I cannot approve, and have now the honour to lay before you one for that purpose which differs in many respects from the Governor's as appears by the statement that accompanies this and will be sufficient to give the necessary convoys both to the northward and to the southward and to cruise off the port. The proposed force consists of two capital cruisers, three second rates, eight galivats, and a pilot vessel with two cutters for advice boats to be fitted out whenever wanted. The disposition, namely one capital cruiser, one second rate, and two galivats to give convoy to and from the Malabar Coast; one capital cruiser, one second rate, and two galivats to give convoy to carry the Honourable the Company's goods to and from Surat; two galivats to give convoy to the salt trade; one galivat at Tellicherry; one second rate and three galivats to cruise off the port and give convoy to vessels outward bound to go to Scindy and such like services. The Triumph prahm to receive the seamen from the northward. To the Revenge I have allowed a greater number of men in proportion to her force than to the others, as she is the Commodore ship and should be able on all occasions to succour other vessels either in fight or otherwise without being distressed, and it is expected that on all occasions his vessel should act with superior vigour.\n\nI have kept the Expedition in preference to the Drake as she has that essential good quality as a cruiser of being a prime sailer, and have left out the two bomb ketches to be laid up for future service as I think galivats would answer better to cruise and would be less expensive in wear. I have also increased the number of Europeans in the galivats and lessened the number of lascars in proportion to the guns they carry. The whole is regulated in the same manner in proportion to the number of guns and the weight of metal. As the Coolies (that is the Sangars) are not so numerous as formerly, I would propose three small galivats of the same establishment as the Fly for the Surat station in place of the Boneta, Otter, and Greyhound which will make a difference of Rs. 3647 annually besides the difference in the expense of their apparel. I must also beg leave to differ in sentiments from the President of sending topasses on detachments on board the cruisers as they are in general poor feeble men unable to bear arms. If Coffrees (negroes from Zanzibar) could be got, who in general are stout ablebodied men, they would be far preferable to any topasses I have seen or sepoys either Moor-men or Phar\u00e1s more particularly for the larger cruisers and to be formed in a battalion or independent companies as they would then be inured to the sea, learn the common ship's duty, and be accustomed to the manner of living on board ship and provide accordingly, and be able to render effectual service when necessary, when raw unexperienced men would from sea-sickness and want of knowledge be almost useless. The Resolution may either be sold or let out to freight or laid up as may appear most for the Honourable Company's advantage. If future circumstances can admit of any further diminution in this expensive branch I shall with pleasure embrace the opportunity of laying it before you as it ever has been my study to do the most effectual service.\nfor my Honourable Employers' interest at the least expense, at the same time having due regard to the protection of trade and the necessary superiority they indispensably must maintain in these seas.\\(^1\\)\n\nTouching the above proposals on the 18th February 1772 the Board resolve: The Superintendent laid before the Board a letter giving his sentiments of the President's proposal for the reduction of the marine and enclosing one of his own for that purpose. Ordered that this letter and statement of the marine be entered at the foot of this Consultation and that they be sent round together with the President's for the consideration of each member after which we shall take the necessary resolutions on it.\\(^2\\)\n\nTwo months later, the 28th April 1772, the President lays before the Board a modification of his former proposals. On the 23rd April 1772 he writes: In my former proposal for the establishment of the marine I calculated for the expense of the Resolution, the grab not being then repaired; but remarked when she was that the Resolution might be laid up or sold. The difference in the pay and provisions between the two, agreeable to my plan for manning the Resolution and my plan for manning the grab, is Rs. 20,000 a year exclusive of the wear and tear. The grab is therefore greatly to be preferred, but I do not see any necessity for increasing the number of vessels I proposed or changing them for others, except the six galivats for the Surat station for which I did not provide in my plan. The Chief and Factors having desired the Viper may be recalled the galivat being esteemed sufficient for their convoys renders her continuance unnecessary. The number of Europeans actually belonging to the cruisers that sailed from the island, alone occasioned the expense of the vessels I proposed to approach so near to that of the number proposed by Mr. Watson who has divided them between this and the Surat fleet. I concur in every part of Mr. Watson's proposal for manning the fleet except the Bombay grab, but as she only carries two guns less than the Revenge, I think the number of hands should be proportioned for the reason Mr. Watson gives that of being able to assist other vessels under their convoy that may be in distress. As it is they seldom go in company, one of them with a smaller vessel having always been esteemed a good and sufficient convoy. I now lay before you another calculate of the expense of the vessels I propose to keep on the establishment (including the six galivats for Surat and the yacht) manned agreeable to Mr. Watson's plan, exclusive of the wear and tear of five vessels more in his plan than mine. The Expedition, it is certain, goes well, but she is weak and sails at as much expense as the Drake, and the Terrible bomb will answer as well and sails at no more expense than the Success. The Fancy bomb will be of great service at Tellicherry in giving convoy to their trade to and from Onor, Mangalor, and other ports and save the heavy expense of armed machv\u00e1s. The Ranger, Wolf, and Fly galivats being the worst may be laid up or sold. The new galley not being needed need not be begun. We have no more enemies to encounter than we had in 1757 when\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Pub. Diary 60 of 1772, 187 - 190.\n\n\\(^2\\) Pub. Diary 60 of 1772, 167 - 168.\nsixteen cruisers answered every purpose. The plan I now lay before you, allows for 21, Mr. Watson proposes 26. I am of opinion they may be still further reduced. The commodore and seven captains, one of whom to command on the Surat station, are sufficient. The Spy cutter, Euphrates sloop, the Brigo and galivats ought to be commanded by the eldest lieutenants according to their rank.\n\nAt a Consultation, the 28th April 1772, after reading the above letter with the modified proposals from the President, the Honourable W. Hornby, the Board agreed to defer the consideration of it, but resolved, as soon as the season arrived for laying up the cruisers, to reduce the marine as much as possible.\n\nOn considering the different proposals regarding the marine charges and reductions, at a Consultation of the 8th July 1772 the Board came to the following resolution: The President and Mr. Watson having at different times laid before us their sentiments on the number of vessels necessary to form a proper marine establishment for the services of this Presidency and for the Surat station, as entered under the 18th December 1771 and the 18th February and 28th April 1772, and as the present season is the most proper for making such reductions herein as may appear necessary, the question is accordingly now taken into consideration and after being maturely debated the following resolutions are passed hereon: The ship Resolution being an improper vessel for the service for which she was intended must be put out of commission immediately on her return from Madras, and, at the opening of the season, we shall endeavour to dispose of her by public outcry. The following vessels are to be continued as the marine establishment for this Presidency for the convoy to Basra and for Balambangan which the Superintendent concurs with us in thinking sufficient, namely two capital cruisers the Revenge and Bombay grab, three second-rate cruisers being the Eagle snow, the Success ketch, and the Drake snow or Expedition ketch whichever on their return from the Persian Gulf be on survey esteemed most proper, six galivats, two cutters being the Spy and a new cutter lately launched, eight patamar boats, nine luggage boats, three water boats and the yacht, one galivat for Sind, and the two schooners on the galivat establishment for Basra. The Fancy bomb for the Tellicherry station, and for the Surat station the Terrible bomb as proposed by Mr. Watson with five galivats. The Superintendent is directed to lay before us a report of the galivats which are most proper to be continued and a plan of the establishment now resolved on accompanied by an estimate of the expense which will annually attend it and a list of the vessels hereby put out of commission when we shall determine on what shall be done with them.\n\nOn the 14th July 1772 the Superintendent writes: In obedience to your commands of the 8th instant, I now lay before you the state of the reformed marine establishment the whole amount of which for\n\n---\n\n1 Pub.

But I presume the Secretary erred in omitting the Triumph prahm as I thought it was the sense of the Board that she should be kept. Her annual charges of pay and provisions is Rs. 1711-1-76. The Patamar boats have hitherto carried a number of men that they might be enabled to row. This I am well convinced is an unnecessary expense, being well informed they never use their oars unless in coming in or leaving a port. I have therefore taken the liberty to reduce the number of people ten lascars in each boat in this present establishment which, I hope, will meet with your concurrence. The following statement shows the marine charges finally resolved upon at the Consultation of the 8th July:\n\n**Bombay Marine, 1772.**\n\n| Vessels          | Men | Yearly Pay | Yearly Provisions | Total Expense |\n|------------------|-----|------------|-------------------|---------------|\n|                  | No. | Quality    | Rs. q. r.         | Rs. q. r.     |\n| **Bombay**       |     |            |                   |               |\n| Revenge, Cruizer | 110 | Europeans  | 19,339 0 80       | 8089 0 80     |\n|                  | 16  | Christian Natives | 1320 0 0 | 432 0 0 |\n|                  | 80  | Lascars    | 1920 0 0         | 768 0 0       |\n| **Bombay Grab**  | 70  | Europeans  | 12,316 0 0        | 5720 1 60     |\n|                  | 10  | Natives    | 432 0 0          | 432 0 0       |\n|                  | 28  | Lascars    | 720 0 0          | 720 0 0       |\n| **Eagle Snow**   | 50  | Europeans  | 9004 3 20        | 4056 0 0      |\n|                  | 12  | Natives    | 984 0 0          | 336 0 0       |\n|                  | 20  | Lascars    | 1290 0 0         | 616 0 0       |\n| **Drake or Expediton Cruiser** | 40 | Europeans  | 7852 3 20        | 3268 3 20     |\n|                  | 10  | Natives    | 840 0 0          | 288 0 0       |\n|                  | 20  | Lascars    | 1990 0 0         | 616 0 0       |\n| **Success**      | 24  | Europeans  | 5860 3 20        | 1961 1 12     |\n|                  | 8   | Natives    | 696 0 0          | 240 0 0       |\n|                  | 16  | Lascars    | 1050 0 0         | 420 0 0       |\n| **Fox Galivat**  | 25  | Europeans  | 3168 0 0        | 1634 1 60     |\n|                  | 8   | Natives    | 576 0 0          | 192 0 0       |\n|                  | 12  | Lascars    | 810 0 0          | 324 0 0       |\n| **Swift**        | 12  | Europeans  | 1996 8 20        | 980 2 56      |\n|                  | 8   | Natives    | 432 0 0          | 144 0 0       |\n|                  | 12  | Lascars    | 1170 0 0         | 468 0 0       |\n| **Hawke**        | 12  | Europeans  | 1996 8 20        | 980 2 56      |\n|                  | 6   | Natives    | 432 0 0          | 144 0 0       |\n|                  | 12  | Lascars    | 810 0 0          | 324 0 0       |\n| **Antelope**     | 10  | Europeans  | 1766 1 60        | 817 0 80      |\n|                  | 6   | Natives    | 432 0 0          | 144 0 0       |\n|                  | 16  | Lascars    | 1050 0 0         | 420 0 0       |\n| **Boneto**       | 10  | Europeans  | 1766 1 60        | 817 0 80      |\n|                  | 6   | Natives    | 432 0 0          | 144 0 0       |\n|                  | 14  | Lascars    | 1050 0 0         | 327 0 0       |\n| **Fly**          | 6   | Europeans  | 1305 3 40        | 490 1 28      |\n|                  | 4   | Natives    | 288 0 0          | 96 0 0        |\n|                  | 10  | Lascars    | 645 0 0          | 258 0 0       |\n| **Spy Cutter**   | 20  | Europeans  | 8652 3 20        | 1634 1 60     |\n|                  | 6   | Natives    | 432 0 0          | 144 0 0       |\n|                  | 18  | Lascars    | 1170 0 0         | 468 0 0       |\n| **Petrel**       | 12  | Europeans  | 1996 3 20        | 982 2 56      |\n|                  | 6   | Natives    | 432 0 0          | 144 0 0       |\n|                  | 12  | Lascars    | 810 0 0          | 324 0 0       |\n\n1 Pub.

We approve the reduction he proposes in the number of people to be employed on the patamar boats and direct that it be done immediately. The vessels which are now in port and are out of commission must be laid up till the opening of the season when they will be put up at public outcry and sold if proper prices can be procured for them by which time we hope the remaining vessels will be returned that they may be tried at the same time.\n\nA Consultation, the 4th May 1773, records: Resolved in order to prevent complaints of a similar nature in future, which we fear will otherwise be too frequent, that no officer in command of a galivat or such like small vessel shall in future be permitted to accept of any money or other consideration whatever from the owner or nakhudds of any boats or vessels that proceed under their convoy, let them belong to whomsoever they may, under pain of immediate dismission from the Honourable Company's service.\n\nRegarding convoy money the diary of the 6th December 1774 records: By our Resolution of the 4th May 1773 it was ordered that no lieutenant in command of any vessel in the marine should be permitted to collect any convoy money. This was intended to put a stop to that avidity of gain which appeared amongst the marine lieutenants who had actually in several instances sacrificed the public service to their own emoluments. But as we have reason to conclude that it will be attended with benefit to trade and advantage to the service to settle this matter upon another footing, the following regulations are established to be in force from henceforward and respecting the rates to be paid and money so collected for convoys: That the captains of the several cruisers proceeding either to and from Surat or to the southward of this port shall, as hitherto practised, be entitled to the money collected from all boats or vessels proceeding under their convoy provided they do not collect more than the undermentioned established rates: That the money collected for convoy by all lieutenants in command of galivats or other vessels, whether belonging to this establishment or Surat, proceeding to Surat, must be paid to the purser marine there immediately after their arrival. He must remit the amount at the close of each season to the Superintendent here with the accounts of it. That the money collected by lieutenants in command of galivats or other vessels, whether belonging to this or to the Surat establishment, proceeding from Surat hither, must be paid immediately after their arrival to the Superintendent. That the convoy money so collected be divided at the close of the season by the Superintendent between the Commodore and the several captains in the marine, the Commodore to\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 61 of 1772, 678.\n2 Pub. Diary 63 of 1773, 359.\nreceive two shares and all the captains one share each. That all convoy money collected by lieutenants in command of galivats or other vessels proceeding from hence to the southward or on their return be paid to the Superintendent immediately after their arrival here. He is on the close of each season to divide the same in equal shares without regard to rank between the lieutenants in the marine belonging to the Bombay station who have been in command of galivats during the season or in proportion for the time they have been in command, unless they shall have been displaced for any improper behaviour in which case they are to receive no proportion whatever. That all convoy money collected by lieutenants in command of galivats or other small vessels proceeding to the northward of Surat bar and returning to the bar from the northward shall be esteemed the property of the captain commanding on that station and shall be paid him accordingly. That the undermentioned rates established for convoy in the year 1767 shall never on any pretence be exceeded and any officer that may be convicted of exacting more than allowed by those rates or who shall conceal any part of what he may actually have collected, shall be punished as guilty of breach of orders by absolute dismission from the service of the Honourable Company. These rates are:\n\n| Voyage                  | Vessel                      | Rs. |\n|-------------------------|-----------------------------|-----|\n| Between Surat and Bombay | A topsail vessel or batela   | 12\u00bd |\n|                         | A shibar between 200 and 300 khandis | 10\u00bd |\n|                         | Do. from 100 to 200 do.      | 7\u00bd  |\n|                         | Do. of 100 or under do.      | 5\u00bd  |\n| From Surat to Cambay    | A topsail vessel or batela   | 8\u00bd  |\n|                         | A shibar between 200 and 300 khandis | 7\u00bd  |\n|                         | Do. from 100 to 200 do.      | 5\u00bd  |\n|                         | Do. of 100 or under do.      | 4\u00bd  |\n\nFor all boats or topsail batel\u00e1s proceeding to the southward convoy money may be collected agreeable to the foregoing rates between Bombay and Surat and not more, and for all boats or topsail batel\u00e1s returning from the southward convoy money may be collected after the rate of one-quarter of a rupee for every khandi agreeable to the number of khandis specified in their pass. No convoy may be afforded to any boats or vessels on any pretence without they are furnished with English passes and colours.\n\nAt a Consultation on the 2nd July 1777 the Board resolve and order that it be established from henceforward as a rule in the marine and signified to every officer therein that the master attendant is to be considered and respected by them as the second officer in the marine and next in line to the Superintendent.\n\nA Consultation of 31st December 1777 records: The President acquaints us that he has settled with the Commodore respecting the allowance for himself and the captains of the squadron upon the same footing as at Bengal with which he is perfectly satisfied. These allowances are: For the Commodore, a house and forty shillings a day; each captain, a house and two hundred rupees a month.\n\n---\n\n1 Pub.

These will much contribute to their health and prevent the desertion experienced last rains while His Majesty's ships were at this port. For this purpose the proper orders will be issued and also for the enlarging the present reservoir of water there.\n\nA Consultation of the 25th January 1780 records: An estimate of the expense of building a banksaul on Butcher's Island for the accommodation of the seamen during the rains is now laid before us according to order of the 15th (13th) October last amounting to Rs. 39,835-1-50 exclusive of provisions to the workmen. Ordered that the work be executed accordingly agreeable to our said resolution.\n\nA Consultation of the 6th December 1780 records: A certificate must be transmitted to the treasurer in England for the amount of the money received into the treasury on account of subscriptions for the maritime school with a list of the subscribers, and it must be recommended to the Honourable Company to make good the amount thereof.\n\nOn the 19th March 1778 the Court write: We have determined not to consent for the present to any marine house being built.\n\nOn the 17th April 1778 the Court write: The ships Morse, Colebrooke, Royal Henry, and Royal Admiral, since we closed our despatches of the 19th ultimo, having been unexpectedly detained on account of the situation of public affairs, affords us an opportunity of acquainting you that we have resolved after mature consideration that the office of superintendent of the marine at your Presidency shall not be continued.\n\nThe same year, 23rd December 1778, the Court write: It is now our order and we hereby direct that immediately upon the receipt of this letter a Board of Marine be formed at Bombay and that the said Board do consist of the following persons: The President and such members of the Council for the time being as shall be resident upon the island of Bombay, in which the marine paymaster will of course be included; (also) the master attendant, the commodore, and the marine storekeeper.

That the Secretary to the Marine Board be (one) of our covenanted servants and that he be allowed a yearly salary equal to \u00a3100 sterling. That the assistant secretary in the marine office be allowed a monthly gratuity of Rs. 34, being the allowance made to the assistant to the late superintendent of marine during the existence of that office. That each of the members of the Board do in his turn officiate as auditor of marine accounts and comptroller of the marine office, beginning with the junior member who shall officiate the first week or the first month as the Board shall agree, and proceeding regularly to the senior member of the Board, the President and Marine Paymaster excepted. That in case of an attack on the island of Bombay as the office of superintendent is abolished the master attendant be added to the committee of defence. In case of the death or removal or coming away of the master attendant, it is our order that the commodore for the time being succeed provisionally to the office of master attendant and hold the same until our further pleasure therein shall be known.\n\nAccordingly the Bombay Government at a Consultation of the 16th June 1780 resolved that a Board of Marine be forthwith formed for transacting the business of the Marine Department and that the regulations contained in the Court's letter of 23rd December 1778 do take place from the 1st of next month (July 1780) and the (Marine) Board meet as soon after that day as may be judged convenient. Government ordered also that copies of the regulations established by the Honourable Company be delivered to each member of the Board of Marine. A Secretary and assistants will be appointed on the meeting of the Board of Marine. Government further add: We observe the Honourable Company in the 61st paragraph of their commands have excepted the President and Marine Paymaster from officiating as auditor and comptroller. We will suppose that the President is excused from these offices on account of the many other avocations of his station, and the auditor and comptroller being himself under the control of the President. But on whatever principles they have excepted the Marine Paymaster, we are decidedly of opinion that it is equally proper the Master Attendant, Commodore, and Marine Storekeeper should be exempted from acting in those capacities which it is presumed the Company have overlooked in their arrangements, and it is therefore unanimously resolved that the Master Attendant Commodore and Marine Storekeeper be exempted from serving in turn with the other members as auditors and comptrollers and that only the Members of Council with the exceptions made by the Company do officiate in those offices. It is also ordered that the necessary extracts from these regulations be sent to the subordinates with directions for their being duly observed.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 5th July the Board remark: We had intended this day to have opened the Marine Board agreeable to our resolu-\n\n---\n\n1 Pub.

But as we afterwards determined to defer the decision on Mr. Hasell\u2019s conduct till the arrival of the Prime which may be soon expected and we shall then either by appointing Mr. Hasell to his office (of marine storekeeper) or some other person in his room be able to put this department upon the footing directed by the Company and to form a complete Board, it is now resolved to defer meeting as a Board of Marine till we have decided with respect to Mr. Hasell\u2019s case. In the meantime the business of the marine will be carried on agreeable to the Company\u2019s regulations under the inspection of the Governor who will sign all indents and issue necessary orders.\n\nOn the 27th May 1781 the Bombay Government write to the Court: We have from time to time explained in our diary the causes which have prevented our forming a Board of Marine. Since Mr. Coggan has taken charge of his office of marine storekeeper it has been a season of too much business to permit us to enter upon a new institution with the requisite attention. In other respects the business of the marine has been conducted according to the late regulations under the immediate inspection of the President, with this difference in point of form that the accounts instead of coming before us in the capacity of a Board of Marine are as formerly subject to the control of the Committee of Accounts and are finally audited by us as President and Council.\n\nOn the 10th February 1784 they further write: At our first meeting in Council after Mr. Hornby\u2019s departure, the President (the Honourable Rawson Hart Boddam) acquainted us that his other more necessary avocations would prevent his attending to the interior part of the business in the Marine Department so attentively as he could wish. He therefore desired that it might be conducted by the Marine Paymaster in the same manner as it was previous to the receipt of your orders dated 23rd December 1778, the assistant, late in the office of superintendent, but who since the abolition of that post has been placed under the Master Attendant, was directed to obey the paymaster\u2019s orders. This will occasion no alteration whatever in the mode of conducting the business of the marine or any additional expense to you, and all orders will in future be issued through the paymaster as was heretofore usual.\n\nOn the 18th March 1785 the Court write: The reasons which you offered during the war that the ships belonging to His Majesty\u2019s squadron so fully engrossed the marine yard that you could not then carry into execution our orders and regulations of December 1778 for forming a Marine Board, can no longer exist, now that peace is restored. Nor can the excuses offered in your letter of the 10th February 1784 of the many more necessary avocations in which our President is engaged be admitted for further postponing this essential business. In our opinion the Regulations bid fair to produce the most beneficial\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 77 of 1780, 293-294.\n2 Pub. Dep. Letters to the Court Vol. 26 of 1781-82, 22.\n3 Pub. Dep.

They have been drawn up with all the care and attention due to so salutary a measure. And we are determined our orders shall in this respect be obeyed. You are therefore to consider it as our positive command, to which we will not admit any further evasion or excuse, that immediately upon receipt of this letter you do form the Marine Board and comply with the several orders and instructions respecting the same as directed in our letter of the 23rd December 1778.\n\nA Consultation of the 19th August 1785 records: Government proceed to take into consideration the Honourable Company's commands of the 18th March last (1785) relative to the appointment of a Marine Board when the following resolutions are taken: That the members who are to compose the Board of Marine be summoned to meet us on Thursday, the 1st of September next, for conducting the business agreeable to the Company's orders. That Mr. Robert Kitson, senior merchant, be appointed Secretary to the said Board with a yearly salary of \u00a3100; that Mr. Frederick Reeves be appointed assistant secretary to the Board of Marine with a monthly allowance of Rs. 34 and removed from the accountant's office. That the commanders of the Company's cruisers when despatched on distant services or to the settlements subordinate to this Presidency shall receive their orders from us as heretofore customary. But the detail of marine affairs in this part is to be managed by the Comptroller of the Marine Board agreeable to the instructions contained in the 62nd paragraph of the Honourable Company's regulations in their letter of 23rd December 1778.\n\nA Consultation of the 2nd October 1786 records: Having resolved at our meeting of the 15th of August last to take into consideration the mode of conducting the business of the marine in future, this subject is now resumed. After an attentive perusal of the Honourable Company's orders of the 21st September 1785, respecting the departments for conducting the public business of this Presidency, it is resolved that from this day all business relative to the marine shall be conducted by this Board in the Public Department; and that the Board of Marine as established under the 19th of August 1785 shall be abolished of which the members constituting that Board are to be acquainted. And that it be signified to the Marine Paymaster, Marine Storekeeper, and Master Attendant that the business of their respective offices is to be carried on agreeably to the orders of the Honourable the Court of Directors as signified in their commands of the 23rd December 1778 and the orders and regulations which have from time to time been issued by the Board of Marine. It will be the duty of the Comptroller of the Marine to see these regulations are strictly attended to. Resolved that the two junior members of Council do in rotation continue to act as Comptrollers of the Marine and that all orders relative to the detail of the marine be in future issued in the\n\n---\n\n1 Pub.

Mr. Robert Kitson is to continue to act as secretary to the Comptrollers with Mr. Frederick Reeves for his assistant.\n\nThe 5th January 1786, a Consultation records: The Board take into consideration the orders necessary to be given the commanders of the cruisers respecting the accommodation of the Company's civil and military servants who may be ordered on board on public service. Resolved that they be directed to admit all civil and military servants to their tables who are to have a reasonable part of the cabin assigned for their accommodation with a constant free passage to their quarter galleries. This regulation must be considered as a standing order and is to be communicated by the Board of Marine to the different officers in command of the Honourable Company's cruisers.\n\nIn 1788 the Polish savant Dr. Hov\u00e9, who considered himself slighted by the Bombay Government, recorded the following somewhat ill-natured and ignorant notice of the Bombay Marine: The Government of Bombay have a marine of several vessels, mounting a few guns, which are to my idea quite useless in time of war, for the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s have twice that strength, and usually give defiance to the English marine. As the Bombay vessels are solely calculated to protect the trade, it might be easily so contrived that the trade would protect itself, by destroying the pirates which have straggled from the opposite continent, and for the immense expense these protectors are maintained with, to construct a couple of ships of war, which would oppose those that are now building at Tippoo's expense in time of emergency. The convoys consisting often of two hundred batel\u00e1s, generally set out from Surat at the lift of high springs. According to its size each boat in the convoy pays the Commodore Rs. 12 to Rs. 28. This is the sole emolument belonging to the Commodore, as they call him, who has this station for one year, and generally makes an immense fortune during that period. Though the honest merchants pay him this exorbitant demand, of which the Company have not a single farthing, they very often lose their merchandise under this protection. In 1788 I saw two batel\u00e1s carried off by the Koolys without further hindrance than a short chase by the Commodore.\n\n1 Pub. Diary 89 of 1786, 33 - 34. Comp. of Standing Ord.

Garcia paid a yearly quit-rent of about \u00a335 (1432\u00bd pardaos). In his work called Conversations on Drugs, written in 1563, Garcia mentions the island under the names Bombaim and Mombaim. He also notes that his tenant Simao Toscano sent him mangoes from a tree that yielded twice a year. In 1554, though in this there is probably some error, the island is said to have been held by one Diogo for about \u00a380 (1875 pardaos).\n\nIn 1664, when Bombay was received from the Portuguese, Mr. Cooke the first Governor fixed nothing regarding the titles of landholders. Sir Gervase Lucas his successor, who thought Bombay an important and valuable possession, could not find on what rights the land was held. Lucas seems to have acted on the view that there were few rights in the land as in 1667, to a total revenue of \u00a36491 (Xs. 75,000); land contributed \u00a32243 (Xs. 25,920).\n\nIn spite of Sir Gervase Lucas' efforts to increase the King's revenues on the island, in 1668, when made over to the Company, Bombay was almost a desert. At this time the yearly revenue of the island was calculated at \u00a32833, perhaps the average receipts of the four years' (1664-1668) management for the Crown.\n\nSince the transfer to the Company the details regarding revenue expenditure and finance may be brought under three periods, the first from the transfer of Bombay to the East India Company in 1668 to the union of the two Companies in 1708; the second from 1708 to the French War in 1744; and the third from 1744 to the treaty of Bassein in 1803. In each of these periods the main items of revenue are land customs and excise, including liquor tobacco and intoxicating drugs.\n\nBetween 1664 and 1664, while Bombay was under the Crown, the attempt to inquire into titles and assess landholders caused such serious injustice and discontent that the Company instructed their President, Mr. Aungier, in Surat, while maintaining their sovereign rights over all for\u00e1s or outlying lands, to forego inquiry into title, and, in conjunction with the landholders, to fix a lump sum as their rent payment leaving to the seniors of the landholders to allot his\n\n---\n\n1 Dr. Gerson DaCunha in Cong.

In accordance with these instructions Mr. Aungier, when in Bombay in 1672, concluded the following agreement, dated the 12th November 1672, with the representative landholders. The original instructions included a survey of the island, but on the ground of expense this part of the instructions seems not to have been carried out. The text of the agreement of the 12th of November 1672 runs:\n\nWhereas since this isle of Bombay was surrendered to the possession of His Sacred Majesty of Great Britain, some occasion of great discontent did succeed through the want of a due understanding what did belong of right to the Crown and what did belong to the people, which gave the original cause of seizing of lands and estates of several people to the general disquiet of His Majesty's subjects; And whereas since His Sacred Majesty did by his Royal Grant bestow the isle of Bombay to the Honourable East India Company, orders were issued out by the Governor and Council of this isle, in obedience to His Majesty's and the Honourable Company's commands, for restoring the said lands to the persons who were aggrieved, provided that upon examination of their titles they could show just right thereunto. It so happened that, in the examination and decision of the said titles, many doubts and important causes did arise which might have given great cause of disquiet to the present possessors of houses and estates in the isle that the titles in right of which they held their lands had become exposed to censure. The people therefore thought fit of their own free motion, by mutual assent in a public declaration and manifesto, to propose to the Governor and his Council that they would pay a yearly contribution, or composition of twenty thousand Xeraphins to the Honourable Company, including the present quit-rent or for\u00e1s, provided that the present possessors of their respective lands and estates may be confirmed and established in their possessions and thereby be secured from all doubts and scruples that may arise thereafter. Also that the lands formerly seized may be restored to the pretenders thereunto. The Governor and Council have duly weighed the said proposals, and having just regard to the quiet content and satisfaction of the good people in general and to the establishment of this Government on the firmest basis of an everlasting and universal peace and tranquillity, did think good to appoint a general assembly of the chief representatives of the said people to be held at the Castle of Bombay on the 1st of October last. In this assembly the said Governor and Council, for the reasons before expressed, did cheerfully give their assent to the people's own desire for the further confirmation of this agreement. Thereupon the said representatives of the people did, on the 4th of October following, present unto the Governor and Council a paper containing twelve articles, wherein matters of consideration and further debate arising, it pleased the said Governor and Council to appoint another general assembly whereunto all the people in general interested in this affair were invited to appear, that the debates and controversies on both sides being publicly and fairly stated and all scruples amicably and justly controverted, a happy issue and accommodation might be confirmed to the security as well of the Honourable Company as of their subjects and inhabitants in general. This assembly was held in Bombay Castle on the 1st of this\ncurrent November, where was then present the Honourable Gerald Aungier Governor and President, Mr. Henry Chowne, Mr. John Child, Mr. Geo. Wilcox, Mr. James Adams Attorney General for the Honourable Company, Mr. Stephen Ustick, all of the Council. As also Mr. Samuel Walker Secretary to the said Council, Signor Antonio Ifretis de Silva the Portuguese Secretary, Signor Luis Cassadive de Lima assistant to the Attorney General, Father Reginald Burgos Procurator for the Reverend father of the Society of Jesus, Mr. Henry Gary, Signor Alvaro Perez de Tavaro Lord of the Manor of M\u00e1zgaon, Signor Pedro Luis Timon Procurator, Signor Martin Alfius de Mello, Francisco Pretto, Juan Pereira, and Antonio de Lima of Bombay, formerly chosen representatives of the people of this isle in general. The said declaration and articles presented by the people were publicly read, the contents whereof are as followeth: The substance of the composition between the Honourable East India Company and inhabitants of this isle, Bombay and Mahim, subjects of the said Company and others having lands of inheritance on this isle or living in other places:\n\n1. That, for the better way of agreeing in the express charges that the Company have for the defence of this isle, the inhabitants and others aforesaid do offer to the Honourable Company 20,000 Xeraphins (Rs. 13,850) yearly including in this sum the quit-rents that they did pay formerly and desire these conditions, namely:\n\n2. That by virtue of this contract all law suits and controversies shall cease between the Honourable Company and the said subjects interested in this isle, concerning the possession they had formerly in their estates thereon when His Sacred Majesty of Great Britain took possession of it.\n\n3. That by the said composition the Honourable Company shall of new confirm the estates of the said inhabitants notwithstanding any suspicion that the present possessors may have fallen into until this present time.\n\n4. That if the Honourable Company do grant to any person not to pay what may come to their shares, then that the said sum shall be deducted out of the 20,000 Xeraphins, and this in respect of this composition is made upon all estates and lands of inheritance of those interested on the isle.\n\n5. That the estates that are seized on shall be delivered again to the old possessors of what conditions soever.\n\n6. That in respect the restoring the several estates the Honourable Company would be pleased to excuse the measuring the same that the people may not be also at great charge considering their extreme poverty.\n\n7. That for the time to come if any estates on the isle come to the Honourable Company by any title whatsoever, or likewise by cutting any tree, or seizing any carts or batty grounds for the use of building the city or other ground for the defence of it or any other fortification, that the quantity that amounts to the said estate with the quit-rents shall be deducted according to the value of the palmeras or the ground.\n\n8. That the possessors may dung the trees and ground with babaxim and cuta as they ever did do, without paying anything for the same as a duty by way of excise or custom, but what was formerly paid.\n\n9. That in case of any storm or other damage (which God forbid) the Honourable Company shall deduct out of the 20,000 Xeraphins according to the loss of their estates which shall be done by honest persons from the said inhabitants.\n\n10. That for the more expedient raising the sum as likewise for the valuing the estates, and for the giving satisfaction to the Honourable Com-\n\n---\n\n1 Babaxim generally written bobsay small fish; kut fish manure.\nChapter VIII.\n\nRevenue and Finance.\n\nMr. Aungier's Agreement, 1672-1674.\n\npany at the time to come, the inhabitants shall appoint the persons, to whom the Company shall give power for raising the said sum which shall be done for the quietness of the inhabitants and the interest of the Honourable Company as it will but only be at the Company's charge to allow two guards at both places, Bombay and Mahim.\n\n11. That the said 20,000 Xeraphins shall begin to be paid on the 9th February 1673 in three payments every year, and the said Honourable Company shall not demand the payment before that time.\n\n12. That one of the principal things in this composition is the quietness and security of the inhabitants, who desire his Honour with the Gentlemen of his Council and other Ministers of the Honourable Company, to accept and establish this contract with the conditions herein mentioned, and that it be confirmed by his sacred Majesty of Great Britain and the Honourable Company with all that is necessary to be done without any invocation (innovation?). All which the inhabitants desire to be done with all possible speed.\n\nThese Articles being seriously and publicly debated, and all material scruples discovered and answered on both sides, it pleased the Governor and Council out of their earnest and unfeigned desire to promote the public good peace and tranquillity of the isle, and to unite the hearts of the inhabitants in a firm and indissoluble tie of obligation to his sacred Majesty and Honourable Company's service, to declare their assent to the said articles in the manner and on the conditions following:\n\n1. That in consideration of the twenty thousand Xeraphins to be paid annually at three payments into the Honourable Company's treasury, the said Governor and Council do in behalf of the Honourable East India Company promise to put a final end to all claims, pretences, and law suits whatever which have arisen or may arise between the Honourable Company and the people touching the titles lands or estates of palmeiras, cocoanut trees, or batty grounds, throughout the whole isle excepting what is by joint agreement accepted.\n\n2. That to the present possessors be granted new patents, confirmed according to the respective titles, by which their heirs and successors shall enjoy their estates.\n\n3. That if the Governor and his Council at present in power, or their successors shall think good, in behalf of the Honourable Company, to exempt any person enjoying the said lands from paying his proportion of the said contribution, or shall make use of any part of the said lands for the necessary occupation of the public, abatement shall be made out of the said contribution, in proportion to the lands so exempted or disposed of, and this in respect the said contribution is made upon all the estates and lands of inheritance of the whole isle.\n\n4. That all estates of batty grounds and cocoanut trees seized by former Governors and now in possession of the Honourable Company shall be restored to their respective owners, and they, their heirs and successors confirmed in their said possession as above is expressed.\n\n5. That if, in time to come, any of the said lands or estates shall fall to the Honourable Company by any title whatsoever, as also if any trees shall be cut down, or any carts of batty ground made use of for the building of cities towns or fortifications, then the value of the said lands or trees shall be computed, and a proportionate abatement made out of the contribution, as is expressed in the third article.\n\n6. That as to the particular of dunging the palmeiras and batty grounds with fish it is agreed unto by the Governor and Council and granted of as much import to the contribution that what part of the isle hath this year been permitted to be dunded with babasim (small fish) shall be still permitted\nreserving the ground which is comprehended within the line of the city which by God's assistance is intended to be built. But in respect the above said dungening the ground is forbidden generally by express orders from the Honourable Company of London, it is necessary that their license be had thereunto. For the effectual securing of this it is convenient that the people do send their humble petition to the Honourable Company by their ships and the Governor and Council will intercede in their behalf and doubt not but the Honourable Company will be pleased to confirm the grant, seeing it is so profitable to the public.\n\n7. That in case hereafter by reason of any storm or calamitous accident (which God divert) part of the said lands or estates be destroyed or rendered incapable of bearing fruit it shall be referred to the Governor and Council then being to make such reasonable allowance of the contribution, as shall consist, with equity, good conscience, and ease of the inhabitants.\n\n8. That for the greater convenience and ease of the people in raising the said sum of 20,000 Xeraphins liberty shall be granted to the interested for to nominate and appoint from among themselves such persons of sober and honest reputation as they shall think fit for the proportionable valuation of all estates and lands and for the collecting and receiving the said money and paying it into the Honourable Company's treasury, which said persons are to be confirmed by the Governor, and shall take an oath on the Holy Evangelists to deal justly and impartially with all. That the Honourable Company shall not be at any charge in receiving the said sum. But for the greater authority and accommodation of the said persons so appointed, two officers shall be ordered by the Governor in behalf of the Honourable Company to assist them in their said office, as occasion shall require.\n\n9. That all royalties, rights, privileges, and immunities which did formerly belong to the Crown of Portugal of For\u00e1s and Royal rents of what nature or condition soever shall be reserved as of right they belong to the Honourable Company.\n\n10. That in regard the little isle Colio (Col\u00e1ba) reaching from the outer point westwardly of the isle to the paccari (p\u00e1kh\u00e1di) or parish called Polo (P\u00e1lav = Apollo) will be of great use to the Honourable Company, in the good design which they have for the security and defence of this whole isle, it is hereby agreed that it shall be totally and wholly reserved for the use of the said Company they making such reasonable satisfaction to the person interested therein as hereafter is expressed.\n\n11. That whereas by the manifesto presented by the people the first payment of the 20,000 Xeraphins should begin the 9th of February next ensuing it is agreed the first payment due on the 9th February shall be suspended to the 9th June following being the year 1673, which said sum shall be left in the hands of the people, by the Governor and Council, towards purchasing and buying out those persons who have estates and lands in the Colio, whom they are obliged to satisfy in their respective demands, always provided that the people shall pay the quit-rent due the 9th February as was formerly accustomed.\n\n12. That in regard the Company have expressly ordered a survey to be taken of the whole isle it is necessary that the lands and estates of each person be measured, the charges whereof shall be limited with a just moderation for the ease of the people.\n\n13. That there shall be reserved for the Honourable Company all grounds on the water-side within the compass of the isle to be disposed of in necessary occasions for the public excepting such grounds wherein there are at present planted gardens of cocoanut trees or rice-grounds, as also churches houses or warehouses of stone. And whensover, for the public good, it shall be necessary to make use of any of the said places or properties the Governor and Council shall make satisfaction to the interest in a reasonable manner. But the people are to take notice that in this they receive a particular favour from the Honourable Company their Governor and Council, in regard that\nin all kingdoms of the world, the ground on the water-side from the distance of forty yards at least from high water-mark belongs as a sovereign right and privilege to the Kings or Princes thereof.\n\n14. That seeing the principal aim and intention of this happy agreement and composition is designed for the security, tranquillity, peace, and universal content of the respective inhabitants, the Governor and Council do in behalf of the Honourable Company establish and ratify this agreement, as perpetual and irrevocable, between the Honourable Company and the people, and, for the further satisfaction of the inhabitants and people, they do promise to prevail with the Honourable Company to establish and confirm the same by patent made under their hands and seals, and given under our Hands and sealed with the Honourable Company's seal in Bombay Castle, the 12th of November anno 1672.\n\nGERD.

Whereupon the Governor summoned all the Povo to meet at a General Assembly in Bombay Castle this day, where, being assembled accordingly, the Governor declared the cause of their assembly here this day desiring them to declare their minds freely without the least apprehension of fear concerning their sense of the said contract and whether they owned those exclamations against it, declaring further that they were at their own liberty whether it should be disannulled and made void, or be confirmed. Whereupon the Povo in general stated they never exclaimed against the said contract, but were thoroughly satisfied therewith and of the justice thereof, it being an affair of their own requesting and seeking after.\n\n\u00b9 Rev.

Ditto, 2046 and 1852.\nThey desired that the Governor and Council would be pleased to ratify unto them and confirm the said contract. This was unanimously on both sides agreed on, and signed and confirmed by both parties in Bombay Castle, the 16th July 1674, 26th Caroli Secundi Regis Angliae.\n\nCertain English landholders in Bombay took objection to this agreement. The matter was allowed to rest till 1676, when, on the 17th January, the Surat Council write to the Company: In Bombay when the yearly contribution of 20,000 Xeraphins raised on the lands was established, certain very few English who possessed lands refused to pay what was assessed on them pretending they did not sign the contract. This we thought not prudence to take much notice of during the war. Since the war we have demanded what they owe thereon which they have much complained of and we presume will present your Honours with a petition. To any such petition we have only to say that a few might be gratified if the consequences thereof were not evil. Private property is generally so eagerly pressed, without regard to public inconvenience, that it may so fall out that a great part if not all the lands on the island may fall into the hands of the English who might pretend the same privilege. We therefore thought it not safe to begin an evil example, but we submit to your better judgment. It were well that the English were encouraged to plant (settle) on the island which would be more secure if all the land were possessed by them. But some better way may be found to privilege them above others, which we humbly recommend to your Honours' better judgment.\n\nIn 1682 the Court write to Bombay: We do not wonder the Povo (people) would not pay us the quarter parts of the lands they possess; but that was the measure, and we shall expect the performance of it. The Xs. 20,000 was computed at that time as agreeable to the proportion of a fourth part, and it may be was fully so much then. But we know the mildness of the Company's Government. The great charge they have been at in the fortifying of Bombay and consequently the increase of trade hath augmented the value of the lands of that place, and it is but equitable that the revenue should grow better with the meliorating of their lands at our great charge. We therefore require you to exact that proportion from them.\n\nRegarding the disposal of the rent of the batty ground under M\u00e1zgaon hill, on the 28th November 1694 the following entry is recorded in the letter book of that year: These are to certify whom it may concern that Nars\u00e1ji Purvo has rented of the Right Honourable Company all their batty ground with what trees upon it which lieth under M\u00e1zgaon hill known by the name of Vale for nine years from the date hereof at 20 mud\u00e1s of white batty a year to be paid yearly at the harvest time.

If there be occasion of a judge advocate to condemn those lands to our use that were really forfeited, we leave it to our Lieutenant General Sir John Gayer to appoint some discreet person by commission under our seal to that office with such instructions as he shall think most convenient to our service.\n\nThe records of this period (1672-1703) contain the following references to the reclamation of the flats or ground liable to be flooded by the sea. In 1675 the Bombay Government submitted a proposal for draining the swamps. On the 11th January 1676 the Surat Council write: Regarding the overflown lands we have referred ourselves to the Honourable Company for their approval and directions. The same month, in their letter of the 17th January 1676, the Surat Council write to the Company: Several surveys have been made touching the draining of the overflown lands by persons intelligent and practised in such works and it is concluded by all to be a feasible design. The profit proposed to accrue thereby is reasonable, but neither will the charge nor the profit be so extraordinary as was at first suggested by your surveyor. Some overtures were made to us before your President left the island concerning it. But multiplicity of business hindered their prosecution. We are of opinion that, for many reasons too tedious now to trouble you with, it is more consistent with your interest to leave them to be drained by others than to drain them at your own charge. We therefore shall embrace any fair proposals by able undertakers reserving to you those just rights and advantages which we can acquire and in such case shall give a faithful account of our proceedings together with a scheme of the project as to the charge it will stand in and advantage expected therefrom.\n\nNext year, on the 8th March 1677, the Bombay Council write to Surat: We formerly advised that some persons had intentions to secure a considerable piece of the overflown lands. But they deny to pay any other rent to the Company than a bare acknowledgment and to have the fee-simple for ever. They pretend that though those that have taken in little patches pay a small rent yet it benefits nothing to the other overflown ground. But they intend to take in a piece from side to side which will stop the whole breachway, and will consequently secure less charge to whoever undertakes the rest, but a great charge to them who must secure their land from the water on both sides. Please to order us how we shall proceed in it.\n\nOn the 20th March 1677 the Surat Council reply: We observe the declaration made by the undertakers for the recovering the overflown\n\n---\n\n1 Court to Surat 3rd Jan. 1694, Sec.

To this we cannot consent having no such power from the Company who do not order us to grant any undertaking beyond a lease for some limited time paying a small rent or acknowledgment to them. Therefore you must let this design fall until we receive further orders from the Honourable Company, who, we believe, will hardly be persuaded to give away their right to the land.\n\nOn the 7th April 1684 the Court wrote to Surat regarding redeeming the drowned lands of Bombay: Redeem those drowned lands of Bombay for which we shall now propose you a method which, we think, cannot fail: That is you may agree to give the undertakers every Saturday night a day and a half\u2019s pay for every day\u2019s work for every man they shall employ in that service, part money and part rice; the rice at a price by which we may be a little gainers. And promise the undertakers, over and above such daily pay to give them...3000 (?) dollars when the whole work is completely finished. Whatever use you shall give the ground to hereafter, it will be absolutely necessary to frame a substantial strong sluice in the middle of your great dam to drain the ground upon occasion, if you should plant it, or to let in the salt water if you should make a salt work of it. This we leave to your consideration being nearer the place, with this note only that salt is a commodity in the Bay (of Bengal) and in some places of the south seas. If from any of the coasts near Bombay you can exchange equal quantities of salt for rice, nothing can be so profitable to us as to convert all those drowned lands when they are rescued from the sea into salt pans after the manner of those at Rochelt in France or Santuvaly in Portugal. This you may discover from many seamen in our ships which have seen those salt pans in both places, and the manner of causing the brine to shoot into small grains. Whether you resolve upon a salt work or not we conceive that when the sea-water is pent out the bottom or lowermost part of the valley must be filled up with earth from the higher parts of the ground to the level of the sea without your dam at half flood or thereabouts, and your sluice must be set accordingly in height. Otherwise when in the time of great rains, you draw up your sluices to let out the fresh-water the sea-water may troublesomely return upon you. We conceive likewise that, when you have levelled the whole to such a height as is fit for draining the valley, it will be necessary from your sluice to draw a ditch or trench quite through the lowermost parts of the valley if you should plant or till it, as well as for keeping the fresh-water out of your salt, if you should turn it into salt ponds. If you should agree with the undertakers for draining of the drowned lands as aforesaid, it is necessary that you should appoint some trusty English to keep constant check upon the workmen that we may be sure to pay no more days wages to the workmen than we have full days work done.\n\n---\n\n1 Surat to Bombay 20th Mar. 1677, Surat Fact.

Vol. 1 of 1681-1685, 80-82.\nThree months later; 2nd July 1684, the Court resume: Prosecute with effect the draining of our overflooded ground at Bombay as we wrote you last year (April 1683-84). If for the furtherance of that or for any other cause you shall find our President's own presence necessary at Bombay and that he may be spared from Surat, we leave to him and our Council to take such a time for his going thither, stay there, and return from thence, as you shall find most accommodable to our general affairs and our interest.\n\nTwenty years later (1703) the Court again impress on the President at Surat the necessity for fresh effort to prevent the sea flooding Bombay. On the 4th June 1703 the Court direct the Surat Council to agree with any undertakers to stop the breaches, where the sea overflows the island; and, on that consideration, to let them now have the land they recover for a term of years, free of rent, receiving only a small quit-rent to the Honourable Company.\n\nOn the 20th April 1708 the Court add: The breaches may be stopped without much charge with a sand bank made with a layer of straw and covered with sand, and then new straw and sand on that and so on. To make a bank in the nature of a sloping breach or shore cajans will serve instead of straw. At K\u00e1rw\u00e1r are people well skilled in stopping breaches.\n\nOn the 24th March 1710 the Court again direct the Bombay Government to stop the breaches on any tolerable terms. And as an encouragement to the undertakers to let them have leases for a number of years at a small quit-rent, reserving the simple fee to the Company.\n\nIn connection with the sea customs and harbour revenue the following notices occur. On the 17th January 1676 the Council in Surat write to the Company regarding an increase to the customs duties: We have already advised that we have raised the customs of Bombay to $2\\frac{1}{2}$ per cent besides the one per cent appropriated to the outworks which is $3\\frac{1}{2}$ per cent for all but certain excepted goods. We have drawn out certain rules and orders to be observed by your officers of the respective custom-houses of Bombay and Mahim, copy whereof you will receive in the Bombay packet. We had several debates whether to keep the customs in your hands or to let them out to farm and concluded on the latter as most advantageous to you. Accordingly they were exposed to sale by the inch of candle and were raised to Xs. 31,050 a year. But the buyer, Mr. Joseph Burges, not being able to give security, we were forced to take them again into our hands and now manage them by your own servants, Mr. Stephen Ustick and Mr. Francis Day, who, we hope, will render you a good account of their service.\n\n---\n\n1 Court to Surat 2nd July 1684, Pub.

Touching this we shall discourse with the Deputy Governor and when we are fully satisfied as to the advantage and disadvantage may thereby accrue to the Honourable Company we shall give you our definitive answer.\n\nTwo months later on the 21st November 1676 the Surat Council resume: You will see the Company have made a proposal touching the lessening the customs of goods imported that are to be manufactured, wherein we presume cotton yarn and raw silk are chiefly intended. In this affair we would have you consider whether the lessening or entire remission of the customs on those goods will contribute anything to the manufacture of calicoes or wrought silk on the island. If so it would be a laudable and hopeful design. Wherefore let us know your opinion therein. Let it be one of your main designs to encourage the said two manufactures and especially that of calicoes and to invite as many weavers as you possibly can. In order whereunto you must promise them such privileges immunities and exemptions from public duties as they shall reasonably desire from you. Nothing will fright weavers more than hard services in watching and attendance on the militia. From this they are to be wholly exempted.\n\nOn the 16th January 1677 the Bombay Council apply to Surat for instructions touching the farming of the yearly rents. They write: The chiefest occasion of this express is by reason of the near approaching time our rents must be put to sale in which please to send us full orders and instructions. We have some few things to offer to your Honours' consideration as to the customs which is our great rent. We find our island to be but a small limited place, a free egress and regress up the country being much hindered by the Portuguese and Shivaji and very few merchants inhabiting here. It follows that all ways of inviting merchants and drawing a trade hither must be sought. No place can invite merchants but where they hear goods are to be bought and sold; and who will land goods and be at a certain charge in paying customs without having the certainty of selling his goods. Besides when they are sold the buyer pays another custom. For ours being a small island the goods must be transported, whereby goods become so dear the merchants cannot buy. This is dissonant to the custom of the whole world. For either they are large countries over which most part of the goods are transported without custom; or else the goods are suffered to be carried inland by paying some small duty as in the Surat inland custom-house, and out of Holland into Germany France Denmark and the like. Further if the same owner retransports his goods he has half custom repaid him. Now if this be thought requisite\n\n---\n\n1 Surat to Bombay 21st Sept. 1676, Surat Fact. Out. L.

Our eyes have had the experience of several merchants who have brought grabs laden with corn, who have offered to land for half a custom, but, on being pressed to pay the full, have carried it all to Chaul. We find by the several farmers' accounts that raising the customs to $3\\frac{1}{2}$ per cent has not increased the revenue in the same proportion; so that though the revenue has become greater yet the quantity of trade (has become less) ...... Some other way must be adopted such as, all goods that are landed and transported by the same person in shipping or boats without Chaul and Bassein to have half custom repaid; but if sent up-country or anywhere between Chaul on the south and Bassein on the north, then nothing to be repaid. Also that all goods pay custom only at landing and pay nothing at being carried out though re-bought never so often. That the anchorage of one rupee a ton be taken off as it sounds a part of bad nature to lay hold of or take advantage of people's necessities and miseries. Besides it will easily be seen where the ship is bound; so that the Company cannot be wronged in their custom by false pretences. That the duties of anchorages be settled at a penny a ton (which is near what is usually taken) or what shall be thought convenient. That the Company reserve to themselves the privilege from the renter of letting the particular goods or things of any king or r\u0101ja pass without custom or allowing the renters any deduction. We are informed letting the customs for two years will encourage bidders; for they say some disaster may happen one year which may be recompensed in the next. We see small hopes of advancing the customs rent the present farmers being in a great fear of a loss. The like they say of the tobacco rent.\n\nIn reply to this letter on the 26th January 1677 the Surat Council write: The many reasons you give for some abatement on the customs of the island we have duly considered. We do not approve the motion you make of allowing back half custom on goods exported to the southward of Chaul or northward of Bassein, in regard it cannot but cause prejudice to the Company and continual disputes between the renters and the merchants. We enorder that all goods landed pay the same custom inwards of $3\\frac{1}{2}$ per cent without making allowance of half custom at exportation. You say that it may be an encouragement to the merchant to pay no custom outward though the goods be never so often sold or alienated. This we approve. We would therefore have you declare it publicly that whatever goods have paid custom inwards shall pay no custom again at their exportation though sold or alienated by the first importer. We would have a register kept of all such goods transported as well as imported and to meet the charge of this register we think good that you impose some small duty on the merchants. As to the rupee a ton anchorage duty we judge it not at all consistent with the honour and reputation of the Honourable Company nor the benefit of their island. We therefore leave it to you totally to disannul it or to lessen it as you shall think most beneficial to the Company's interest and the increase of trade on the island. We cannot approve your proposition.\n\n---\n\n1 Bombay to Surat 16th Jan. 1677, Sec. Out. L. B. 4 of 1677-1687, 2-3.\nthat the Honourable Company should reserve to themselves the privilege from the renter of letting the particular goods or concerns of any king or r\u0101ja pass without custom to the renters. In such a case the farmer could not know certainly what he buyeth, and it would be a means to encourage kings' and r\u0101jas' ministers frequently to make their applications (knowing their farmer hath such an exception) to the Company's prejudice. We do rather require the customs to be sold undeterminately and indefinitely, and if the Company are forced or obliged to gratify any persons, they must do it at their own charge allowing the farmer his just due.\n\nA few months later, on the 2nd May 1677, the Bombay Council write to Surat proposing the following changes in Customs arrangements: Upon farming our customs this year some few alterations were made. Among these the chief was that whatever goods had on importation paid the custom, should pay no more custom at exportation though alienated never so often. Now, according to a standing order, the Company's goods pay no custom. But the customers allege that though no custom is paid at importation, yet, if the goods are sold, the buyer ought to pay custom at exportation. Upon this we have had a serious debate and we ourselves are divided in our opinions. Some of us allege that the alteration made in the custom was this, that what goods had once paid custom should pay no more. But the Company's goods having never paid any custom, if they are sold ought to pay custom at exportation. The others allege that though the literal words of the article are that those goods which have once paid custom, shall pay no more, yet when the Company's goods have passed the custom-house, and the customers are satisfied that they can make no further demands, it is equivalent to payment; so that at exportation these goods ought to be esteemed as other merchants' goods. Otherwise, if they pay at exportation, the Company give away the privilege which they reserve to themselves of paying no custom. For formerly when all merchants' goods, sold on the island, paid two customs, the Company's goods, which were sold, paid but one. So now when all merchants pay but one custom, the Company ought to pay no custom or else they lose their former privilege. Also if the customers demand custom of the goods sold, because they paid no custom before, they may by the same rule when they have bargained with a private merchant to take but half custom, demand the other half of the exporter alleging the goods have paid but half custom. The argument is just the same logically. For if the Company's goods must pay custom if sold at exporting because they paid none at importing, then those goods which paid but half or a quarter custom at importing must pay the remainder when exported; for one is granted as much by the customer's consent as the other who condescended to pass the Company's goods in the custom-house at landing without taking custom and many times condescend for their own advantage to let merchants land goods for half and quarter custom. Surely no man will argue that any more custom can be\n\n---\n\n1 Surat to Bombay 26th Jan. 1677, Surat Fact. Out.

We have hopes to put off large quantities of Europe goods this year, which will be a great deal of money out of the Company's pocket if custom must be paid at exportation. We shall wait your Honours' decision of the case.\n\nIn reply on the 17th May 1677 the Surat Council write: As to the customers' allegations that in regard the Company's goods pay no custom atimportment, they ought, when sold and exported, to pay custom by the buyer, we do rather give it as our opinion that the Company's goods ought to pay no custom in nor out though bought and sold never so often on the island. Should it be otherwise, we foresee the Honourable Company would receive great prejudice and would really pay the custom themselves out of their own pockets. Also it would be a means to discourage the current vent of Europe manufactures on the island, the increase of which is one of our great aims and continual industry to effect. Wherefore we would have you to declare to the farmers of the customs that we cannot assent to their unreasonable demands.\n\nRegarding a customs duty on butter, on the 7th August 1694, Sir J. Gayer writes to Mr. Aislabie at Mahim Custom House: I understand by yours that a great quantity of butter has been brought on this island by \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) man a time by some certain persons. These are to enorder you for the future to let none have the liberty but make them pay custom (except poor people) for whom that article at first was designed. Make strict enquiry of the people this butter was brought by as near as you can the quantity and advise.\n\nIn the matter of anchorage fees levied by the Bombay Council, the 4th May 1676, the Surat Council write: We have considered of the new duty you have raised in making the Portuguese vessels pay anchorage. We cannot conceive wherein it will be beneficial to the Company, but rather a discouragement to all vessels trading to your port. Wherefore we desire you to advise us what the annual revenue of this new imposition will amount to, and, if it be inconsiderable, we would have you let it fall and remain as when the President left the island. We would not have you innovate anything without advising us thereof and receiving our sense and concurrence therein.\n\nOf the other farms of rents the tobacco and the excise the following notices occur:\n\nIn 1672 the tavern rents of the island were farmed by Mr. Hill. The result was an increase in the Company's revenue but an injury to the Bhandaris. A letter from Surat dated the 6th April runs: You have written, Mr. Hill hath this year monopolised the tavern rents of the island advancing 300 Xeraphins more than was formerly paid. At the same time that the Bhandaris were dissatisfied with his proceedings in making them pay an exaction more than they ever yet did. As we\n\n---\n\n1 Bombay to Surat 2nd May 1677, Sec. Out. L.

The same letter, 6th April 1672, continues: We observe the estanque of tobacco is fallen this year 1000 Xeraphins and are unsatisfied therewith. The reasons which you allege for this fall seem to carry little force with them. We are therefore apt to conjecture some design hath been laid by the farmers to the Honourable Company's prejudice which pray enquire into and let us know those that bought the monopoly thereof.\n\nOn the 24th January 1676, touching the revenues to be farmed the Surat Council write to Bombay: We would have you to put to sale the public revenues at the usual time and to use all just and prudent means to raise them as high as you can. The customs also we would have farmed out; for we judge it will ease the Company much of their expenses; and if you find it will prove to the Company's advantage to let it out for two or three years we leave it to you. Only be careful that you take good security for all your farms according to the usual customs. We shall not limit you any price to bid on the Company's account or any other particular but leave it to your care and prudence. Act therein as you shall think most consistent with the Company's interest and the public good.\n\nIn the next month, February 1676, the Company's revenues at Bombay were farmed, and two months later, 7th April 1676, the Surat Council intimate to the Company: Your Deputy Governor and Council of Bombay in February last (1676) did make sale of the public rents of your island at the following prices:\n\n| Rent                  | 1675 | 1676 |\n|-----------------------|------|------|\n| The Tobacco License   | 20,300 | 20,400 |\n| The Arrack ditto      | 5050 | 5340 |\n| Mahim Passage        | 850 | 690 |\n| Sion Passage         | 360 | 300 |\n| The Customs           | 31,050 | 27,000 |\n| Rende Verde a new monopoly sold for | ... | 1600 |\n\nThe new rent called Rende Verde or Fresh Customs, consists of oil, opium, bh\u00e1ng, and mahuda.

We hope this will in time prove a good addition to the revenue, the merchants and all others being well satisfied therewith.\n\nOn the 17th February 1677 the Bombay Council write to Surat: We have now sold all our rents much better than expected. The new rent of oil we were fearful would not have sold for half last year's price, but it went off within 60 Xs. of as much as last year. The arrack rent is increased 50 Xs. As to the tobacco rent we were sensible the renters got nothing in the last year, and as this year tobacco is near cent per cent dearer, so that it will cost them 4 or 5000 Xs. more in tobacco than last year, we were fearful the receipts would fall much. To prevent this fall we put the farm to sale for two years; for it would be a discredit to the island to have a rent fall and discourage future bidders. But it went off for 20,850 Xs. which is 450 Xs. more than last year. Our customs we looked upon in a standing condition; for though the Company will not make the 26,000 Xs. they took off from Mr. Burges, yet we supposed the customers might have realised some small profit though not enough to encourage them to a next year's bidding. If the management remains in the Company's hands, 2000 Xs. will not pay the expenses of the factors who will also be obliged to gratify more people in giving away custom than when it is rented. Neither will any person take the same care and diligence in another's concern as he takes in his own. Because of some alterations made in the custom this year we put in the two passage boats of Mahim and Sion which will not amount to 100 Xs. this year, and the same guards and Purvos that look after the custom for the same charge can receive the passage boats' rent. We likewise put it up for two years which we are informed is the only way to increase the rents though we did not expect any great rising. It was carried by Rangu Dalvi for 30,250 Xs. which is 3250 Xs. more than the last year.\n\nIn reply, the 12th March 1677, the Surat Council write: We like well of the sale of the Honourable Company's rents concerning which we would have you advise the Honourable Company in particular. But we are not well satisfied in what you write that the Company will make but 26,000 Xs. of that year they took them off from Mr. Joseph Burges. We are certain that others bid 30,000 Xs. before he bid anything and why the Company should lose so much we desire you to satisfy us.\n\nA week later, the 19th March 1677, the Bombay Council intimate to the Court: We have according to our usual custom exposed to sale the annual rents of your island which were bought far better than our expectation. For the tobacco rent, what with the roguing and cheating of the Sidis' fleet and tobacco this year being nearly double the price of the last which must all come out of the rent, we expected undoubtedly it would fall. But it advanced 450 Xs. being sold\n\n---\n\n1 Surat to the Company 7th April 1676, Surat Fact. Out. L. B. 2 of 1675-76, 104-105.

We shall likewise put the rest (rent?) of all your lands to sale which will be far more profitable than to keep them in your Honours' hands. For we can oblige the tenants to deliver all or what batty we shall want for the use of our garrison stores at a certain rate or at the market price.\n\nOn the 31st October 1686 the Bombay Council write to Surat: As to the public rents our diligence shall not be wanting in getting them in; and as for our being bare in money, it was occasioned in Mr. Zinzan's time, remitting several sums of money to you and furnishing His Majesty's ship Ph\u00e6nia to the amount of a considerable number of Xeraphins.\n\nOn the 19th January 1687 regarding rents or farms the Bombay Council write to Surat: It is now high time to consider about putting the rents up for the following year. We therefore crave your Excellency's assistance. We cannot tell how things may be carried on as to the advancement thereof. We believe the tobacco rent may rise if there be any hopes of procuring tobacco from Surat; the customs we fear will not advance, because they have had but a bad year to encourage bidding. All the other small rents we hope will not fall. When your Excellency's orders arrive with us we shall use all diligence to make the most for the interest of our Right Honourable Masters.\n\nOn the 25th February 1687 having disposed of the cotton rent the Bombay Council write to Surat: We acquaint you that this day we have disposed of the next year's cotton rent to one Shankar Sinay for Xs. 2240, and the tobacco rent to R\u00e1m\u00e1ji K\u00e1m\u00e1ti for Xs. 30,700; but the Bhand\u00e1ris did not bid for the arrack rent. So we do fear we must abate them something of what they paid the last year. We have appointed them to be at the Court on Tuesday next and then we will settle, if possible. We have according to your order omitted disposing of the custom and shall do nothing in that till further orders from your Excellency. We now put you in mind that the present rendeiroes' (revenue farmers') year is almost out and do pray your Excellency's orders about the matter, whether to dispose of the rent, or who you will please to employ to manage it.\n\nOn the 23rd March 1687 they resume: Since our last of the 8th instant we have disposed of the arrack rent to the Bhand\u00e1ris for Xs. 8800 a year to be paid monthly, the one being bound for the other, and R\u00e1m\u00e1ji K\u00e1m\u00e1ti to appoint a shroff to collect the money at the Bhand\u00e1ris' charge.\n\n---\n\n1 Bombay to Court 19th March 1677, Sec.

And you are hereby licensed to sell by retail in your house or otherwise all sorts of wine, beer, mum, arrack (except phul arrack or bevda), as also all sorts of mixed liquors as punch lemonade and others at such reasonable rates as shall from time to time be adjudged and allowed of by me. Provided always the license be of force and value during your good behaviour and for the term of one year from the date hereof and no longer. Given under my hand and sealed with the Right Honourable Company's seal in Bombay Castle, the 30th May 1694.\n\nWith a view to prevent extortion Sir J. Gayer issued the following order to all tavern and victualling house-keepers on the island of Bombay on the 13th August 1694: Being informed that there is extortion used by the forementioned tavern and victualling house-keepers in taking more for punch and wine than what hath been formerly ordered and practised, these are to enjoin all whom these presents may concern that they sell all liquors hereafter mentioned at the following prices and no other, namely: All sorts of wine and ale (except canary and shyraz) at two Xeraphins the bottle; punch at two larees the bottle holding two quarts full measure. If any man comes into a victualling house to drink punch, he may demand one quart of good Goa arrack, half a pound of sugar, and half a pint of good lime water; and make his own punch. If the bowl be not marked with the clerk of the market's seal, then the bowl may be freely broken without paying anything either for bowl or punch. All persons concerned herein are required to give due obedience as they will answer it at their peril. Given under my hand in Bombay Castle. (Sd.) John Gayer.\n\nOn the 19th March 1680, with the view of providing a sum equal to the civil and military charges of the Government, the Court required that all houses should be valued, and a proportionate tax imposed on each; the uncultivated land surveyed and let out on rent; and the marshy grounds drained and rendered fit for agriculture.\n\nOn the subject of fresh taxation to meet increased expenditure the Court write to Bombay on the 15th August 1683: We are not yet\n\n---\n\n1 Sec.

If our charge must be increased to secure our inhabitants, it is but just that you should create some new taxes levied upon the inhabitants by way of excise or otherwise as you shall find more convenient and easy to them, which, in times of danger and increase of public defence, is the necessary practice and policy of all nations throughout the whole world. This we recommend to your care and discretion, to contrive with the advice and concurrence of our President. You must consider that what you spend in Bombay, great though it be, is not half our charges, furnishing the island with soldiers, ammunition, paying their passages, medicines, building and repairing small ships and many other things, having amounted to a vast sum since we were possessed of that island, which first or last it must repay us. We have at St. Helena among other things established a duty of anchorage of one dollar a ship, great or small, to be paid by all our own ships, and any others that have the benefit of that port, each ship or vessel to pay one dollar every time she stops there. If our President at Surat discovers no great inconvenience in doing the same thing with you, we would have you exact half the duty at Bombay from all ships or vessels that shall have the benefit of our port of Bombay, except the Moghal's and Sambhaji's fleets of war when we are at amity with them, and such other necessary cases as our President shall find expedient to restrain this order for the conservation of the peace of our island and for other political reasons. The Dutch nation could never have made such a progression and empire in India if they had not been masters in this indispensable requisite to all government, namely to make all places conquered or possessed pay the charge of their settlement and security. This the Dutch have done to such a degree at Batavia that although their charge there be immense, they have brought up their constant revenue of that place to over-balance the annual expense by at least \u00a390,000 sterling. We have insisted the longer upon this subject, and you must the more copiously and effectually employ your thoughts about it, because we are now embarking into a far greater charge not only for the security but for the grandeur of Bombay. In order thereunto we have now on board the ship Charles the Second, Sir Thomas Grantham-Commander, a complete company of foot soldiers under the command of Lieutenant Ogletorpe which, after they have been at Bantam, are to return to your place.\n\nAt the same time, 18th August 1683, the Court write to Surat: We desire you to apply your thoughts seriously to the contriving proper methods for the increase of our revenue at Bombay and directing our Deputy Governor and Council there in observing and performing with more punctuality what we wrote to them.\n\nThree months later, 16th November 1683, the Court again writes: Invent all the ways you can for the improvement and increase of our revenue upon the island of Bombay the rather because you see we are...\ndaily at a vast increase of charge to secure it by enlarging our garrison there; because we apprehend it may be a place of great consequence to this kingdom and Company in case we should happen to have a war with any nation in India.\u00b9\n\nSix months later, the 7th April 1684, the Court resume the subject of fresh taxation in Bombay: Besides the duties we have enjoined to be levied towards the Company's charge, we would have you, while Sir Thomas Grantham is in Bombay and of our Council, to take into your serious consideration the Company's whole present charges upon that island, the charge of the works and repairs now to be done, and the charge of sending new recruits of soldiers thither which the Company pay here, and all other constant charges of the three companies of English troops, the Deputy Governor's Council's and Factors' salaries, house-keeping, charge of ammunition, shipping sloops, and all other contingencies, and to introduce such moderate new levies by imperceptible degrees, sensim sine sensu, as may best balance the Company's full expense in the protection and preservation of that island and its inhabitants. This we would have you do in such gentle manner as may cause no great disgust among the people. But if you find any of them very perverse and wholly unreasonable, deal sharply with two or three of them in terror of the rest. Our design, you will see, is to make Bombay as useful and serviceable to us as Batavia is to the Dutch. In so doing if you do not pursue their method in creating a revenue that may support the charge, we shall but eat out our stock.\u00b2\n\nThree months later, 2nd July 1684, the Court further writes: Study all the methods you can to improve our revenue and to lop off extravagant pompous expenses that our disbursements may run out mostly into real force and power, not into gaudy shows and luxury. If we be really strong rich and powerful, we shall be reverenced feared and have good quarters with our neighbours without wearing feathers.\u00b3\n\nIn the same letter (2nd July 1684) regarding accounts of stores the Court writes: By the excessive demand of stores and by our intelligence we have great cause to fear waste and embezzlements have been made of our stores in Bombay. We therefore require our Deputy Governor and Council there to make a diligent inquiry and inspection thereinto. Whoever they find have been remiss or culpable therein, turn them out of our service without favour or affection to any; and let a (way) be established upon deliberate consultation to prevent the like abuses there for time to come. One way for this (after the removal of the unfaithful and putting honester men in their places) is to have a monthly account of remains and all rests in stores of every kind taken by some one of our Council there, the person entrusted therein making report to our whole Council upon every monthly account how and in what\n\n\u00b9 Court to Surat 16th Nov. 1683 Pub.

And if our Deputy Governor shall not call and assemble constant Councils, suffer full debates, and put the question fairly, and govern our island and affairs by the major suffrage of such of our Council as shall be present at all Consultations, we would have you displace him and tell the next of our Council there to succeed as Deputy Governor.\\(^1\\)\n\nOn the need for economy during this period (1668-1708) the records contain the following warnings. On the 8th February 1676, the Surat Council write to Bombay: We require you to follow the directions which we have already sent touching the sale of the public rents and for settling the two companies. Seeing it is our duty to use all prudent means that can be contrived for retrenching the great charge of the island and garrison, we think good to recommend to you here enclosed certain proposals which we concluded on in Council before the late war (4th December 1672). But the war then falling so unexpectedly these proposals could not be put in execution. Now it pleasing God to give a peace, which we hope will be lasting, we require you to put the said order in execution so soon as conveniently you can and advise what difficulties or inconveniences you apprehend therein.\\(^2\\)\n\nA month later, on the 7th March 1676, Surat writes: We are sorry to find the great abatement in the general revenues of the island; yet being assured of your integrity and zeal for the Honourable Company\u2019s interest we cannot dislike of what you have acted therein.\\(^3\\)\n\nOn the 11th November 1677 the Bombay Council reply to exception taken by the Court to certain items of expenditure: We shall answer what clauses of the Company\u2019s letter we find concern us. Some things were acted by the President which lie not within our sphere to take notice of, as the President\u2019s state-horse which is said to cost Rs. 1200, though Girdhar hath since brought to accounts Rs. 1500 for him. Mr. Gyfford\u2019s house-keeping and servants\u2019 wages, the soap-house, and three months\u2019 wages paid to the last seamen which came from Metchlapatan and the like with Mr. Francis\u2019 horse-keeping, though we think the horse would be at the same charge in the stable as if he rode him and his servant\u2019s wage which is but 5 Xs. a month. However we shall act therein as your Worships shall order us.\\(^4\\)\n\nOn the 24th January 1677 the Bombay Council write to the Directors: We send our Consultation books and copy books of letters with a roll of all the English on the island and a list of all your Honours\u2019 houses with their dimensions and the materials they are made of with the prime cost of the court of judicature hospital and mint. Our books of accounts are unfinished and indeed there hath been nobody here to do them, your late Deputy Governor, Mr. Gyfford, dying of a lingering distemper which incapacitated him to all business for many months.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Court to Surat 2nd July 1684, Pub.

Notwithstanding which the books should have been finished were the accounts but rightly stated and in good method. But the books are full of nothing but errors and false accounts. There has been no account given in of the warehouse these four years; several accounts remaining upon balance time out of mind, and on the whole a general confusion. So that there will want a great deal of care, assiduity, and time to bring the books into due order and method.\n\nThis confusion in the accounts continued for six months more. It was then found they could not be set right and continued in order unless a Banian accountant was employed. On the 2nd August 1677, the Bombay Council write to Surat: We do very much want an able Banian accountant to keep the general accounts of the island. The often removal of the Seconds and their inexperience in these accounts has been the chief cause of those many errors that have crept into the books. But a Banian that always resided here could give the accountant satisfaction in any thing demanded.\n\nOn the 31st October 1696 the Government of Bombay write to the President and Council at Surat: The charges of this island for more than twelve months were extraordinary by reason of the pirates and the approach of the French, also the charge of sundry factories having been borne by it, as well as preparations for fortifying Anjengo. Besides it was necessary we should not be reduced to the straits we were last year when this island might have been lost for want of money ere the brokers would have contributed one pice to supply our necessities.\n\nThe record of 1672-73 gives the following list of Factors and other Officers of the Company at Bombay: Gerald Aungier, Governor; John Shaxton, Deputy; John Child, James Addams, George Wilcox, Stephen Ustick, Members of Council; John France, Minister; Samuel Walker, Secretary; Francis Day, George Robinson, John Horringold, Richard Stanley, John Woolhouse Lawrence, Richard West, and John Gape, merchants and writers.\n\nThe Surat Factory Outward Letter Book for 1675-76 contains the following list of Factors residing (January 1676) in the Honourable Company's service in Bombay: Philip Gyfford, Deputy Governor; John Petit, Stephen Ustick, of Council; Francis Day, John France, William Flower, ministers; John Horringold, Secretary; Thomas Pettit, John Gape, Robert Harbin, Robert Carver, William Thornton, Jonathan Came.\n\n---\n\n1 Bombay to Court 24th Jan. 1677, Sec.

It being a business wherein each of us was so particularly concerned, we thought it not proper to decide it among ourselves, and therefore desire your Honours would please to determine what servants each person shall be allowed, and whether those that diet themselves ought to have more than those which diet in the fort, they pretending their Rs. 25 a month is only for bare victuals and drinks.\n\nRegarding Commissions to Members of Council on the 11th July 1677, the Bombay Council write to Surat: The late President did formerly give Commissions to some of the Council here to act as Commissioners for the island which has been long discontinued. Please to order what shall be thought convenient in it. Both the judge and all the commission officers of the island had their commissions signed only by the late President which are now become invalid, concerning which we wait your Honour's further orders. In the meantime we have ordered that all the soldiers pay the same obedience to their officers as formerly, and that the Judge and the Justices of Peace act in the same capacity and station as before till we receive your Honours' commands concerning them.\n\nOn the 24th August 1677 the Bombay Council further write: Herewith goes a list of all the officers who will want commissions on the island as likewise a copy of the Judge's commission.\n\nWomen on Bombay.\n\nMadam (3) Jane Ward, Mrs. Susanna Smith, Mrs. Mary Gape, Mrs. Elizabeth Jessopp, Mrs. Alice Adderton, Mrs. Katherine Baines, Mrs. Sarah Thorneburne, Mrs. Isabella Novello, Mrs. Sarah Massell, Mrs. Elizabeth Hughes, Mrs. Dorothy Walton, Mrs. Dorothy Sugar, Mrs. Mary Rose, Mrs. Mary Brock, Mrs. Elizabeth Bigott, Mrs. Anne Cooper; Mrs. Anne Butler (4), Mrs. Katherine Fletcher, Mrs. Frances Fleming, Mrs. Anne Hilder, Mrs. Jane Meadows, Mrs. Mary Perry, Mrs. Joane Cully, Mrs. Anne Walter, Mrs. Elizabeth Rush, Mrs. Mar.

The Deputy Governor not having seen Captain Carr on two mornings asked him where he was in the morning that he missed him on the parade. Captain Carr answered that he had business and could not be there. The Deputy Governor said he believed his business was not so urgent, but that he might have been there did he care for doing his duty. Upon this Captain Carr fell aswearing and affronted the Deputy Governor who bid him leave swearing or he would punish him. Then the Captain shut his fist and swore that no man should punish him for swearing and did in a manner give him the lie. The Deputy Governor did not send for him, neither did any of us know of his coming. It was about halfpast ten o'clock in the forenoon. So for his ill language swearing and base behaviour the Deputy Governor sent him home to his house and has confined him there until farther order. He is so surly that the Deputy Governor has thought not to give him his enlargement until your Excellency shall give order concerning it; for if commission officers fly in the Governor's face, other people may well do it. After his confinement instead of acknowledging his fault Captain Carr sent the Deputy Governor a letter the copy of which is enclosed. We never saw or observed that the Deputy Governor behaved himself any way unkindly or unhandsomely to him or any officer on the place. His common way is to meet on the parade, which is just without the gate, in the morning and give orders and from thence to prayers, and then the guard is relieved, and so the people disperse.\u00b2\n\nOn the 29th December 1686 the Bombay Council write to Surat: The general books of this place for 1685 are gone to Surat by the Worshipful C. Zinzan with other the Consultations. Those for this present year are not finished by reason we want writers. The accountant and Secretary have none to assist them, but such as we are constrained to take from their duties in the garrison and those we cannot hinder from the knowledge of what we ourselves are under an oath to keep secret. Now if your Honours will please to send us a supply of honest sober young men, we shall go on with our business much the better.\u00b3\n\n\u00b9 Bombay to Surat 13th Aug. 1686, Sec. Out. L.

They add: We strictly enjoin that all our affairs be transacted in Council, and ordered and managed as the majority in Council shall determine, and not otherwise, upon any pretence whatsoever. And though we hope you will all be unanimous in the pursuit of our common interest (as we do most earnestly recommend unto you all to be), yet if on any occasion it happens that your votes are equally divided, the same must be determined by lot.

Regarding the constitution of the Bombay Council and the administrative duties of its members, a despatch of the 24th March 1710 directs: The Council of Bombay is appointed to consist of the General and eight others, to reside on Bombay, and not to consider seniority without merit. The Court continue: You must settle the business which is to be under the more particular management of each member of the Council, and of our factors and writers as on the other side of India. The President to keep the cash. The Second to have the care of the books. The Third of the warehouse or as at the Bay the Third to have charge of the export, and the Fourth of the import warehouse. The next to be purser general that is to have charge of all disbursements whether of fortifications or factory. Another to have the more particular inspection and care of the rents and revenues. Another of general stores. These we think are the proper charges of the first five or six of the Council. And, unless you can give us very good reasons to the contrary, we would have it so settled at Bombay. The Council of Surat are to come to Bombay, to take their places as so settled, otherwise to be dismissed the service. We commit all our affairs at Bombay and the subordinate factories to the management and control of the whole Council, and order that the final decision rest with the majority of the Council, all being duly summoned.\u00b9\n\nRegarding the duties of Members of Council the Court of Directors write on the 5th April 1715: We will not allow any to be of Council barely on that account. Some one branch of our affairs must be committed to the care of each Member or else he is not fit for the Council. Nor indeed ought Members of Council or any other covenant servants continue in our service unless they have some business assigned them, either directly under them or under an assistant. This complaint equally affects all the subordinate factories. Take care they acquaint you, and do you, us, what employment every person has at the subordinate factories.\u00b2\n\nOn the 24th March 1721 the Court direct: Our Council shall consist of the President and six others. No one or more members of Council be suspended or expelled unless for plain and fully proved infidelity to us, either with respect of making use of our money, embezzling our goods, criminal correspondence with the country governments, or others in an interest opposite to ours, or such other breaches of our orders and their covenants, for which we have or shall direct suspension or expulsion. No person of the Council shall be browbeaten or intimidated on account of making exceptions, for men may differ in opinion and yet both sides mean honestly.

We have been told here by some of the then Council of Fort St. George they signed to Consultations or Letters against their liking to prevent farther displeasure.\n\nOn the 7th March 1733 the Court write: For the future, without our previous and express order, no member of Council must be suspended from his office for any offence unless for a notorious breach of trust or unfaithfulness antecedent to a dissent to the President\u2019s opinion.\n\nA Consultation of the 27th September 1734 has the following entry regarding the duties of the different Members of Council: Agreeable to our Honourable Masters\u2019 standing rules and orders, Mr. Taylor as Second in Council is ordered to take charge of the Accountant\u2019s office, and Mr. Braddyll as Third to receive from him the charge of the warehouse the 1st of next month taking an account of the remains that is stock to be signed by them both and laid before the Board. Directed also that at the same time Mr. Braddyll deliver and Mr. Percival receive charge of the Bombay custom-house, and that Mr. Percival deliver and Mr. Whitehill receive charge of the Mahim custom-house, taking inventories of the effects belonging to the Honourable Company remaining in both places to be signed as before and delivered into Council.\n\nRegarding the duties of the Members of Council on the 11th March 1735 the Court write: The several Members of the Board shall have such employes assigned them as upon due consideration you shall judge them most capable of discharging for our benefit. Do not confine the Custom Master or any other post to the third or fourth of Council.\n\nOn the 5th April 1715 the Court write to Bombay: We send all factors and writers first to Bombay, thence they are distributed to the subordinate factories; and ought, and we expect, they shall have their rise in our service equal with those residing at Bombay of younger standing, if they have equal merit.\n\nOn the 21st February 1717 the Court write: Our covenant servants\u2019 salary is not to commence till their arrival at Bombay. They are to take their standing as in the list though the ship that has the juniors should arrive first at Bombay.\n\nThe Court\u2019s letter to Bombay of the 17th April 1711, shows the salaries of the different Members of Council: The General of Bombay to receive \u00a3200 a year, and, if he be found to deserve the\n\n---\n\n1 Court to Bombay 24th March 1721 paras 87, 101, 105.

And, on the 24th March 1721: The President to pay prime cost for wine and other necessaries sent out for his table, at 2s. 3d. the rupee.\n\nIn their letter to Bombay, the 5th April 1727, the Court allowed the President Rs. 600 for the four festival days in the year, namely Christmas, New Year\u2019s Day, the King\u2019s birthday, and the King\u2019s coronation day, at Rs. 150 each.\n\nIn 1739 in consequence of the dearness of provisions the covenant servants applied to Government for an increase in their allowance. Their petition of August 1739 states: Whereas the dearness of all manner of provisions has for some years past made it impossible for your petitioners to subsist on their monthly allowance of Rs. 30 settled at a time when every thing was much cheaper than at present, so long ago as Governor Cowan\u2019s time (1732) the increased cost of provisions influenced him and his Council to represent the case to the Honourable Court of Directors (by ship Prince William), being, as your petitioners presume, thoroughly satisfied that those who were not so fortunate as to have friends in England to make them remittances, must inevitably involve themselves in debt. As no addition has yet been made, your petitioners now find themselves obliged to apply to your Honour. Since 1732 prices have been greatly augmented by the Marathas dispossessing the Portuguese of Salsette and their other northern territories from whence this island was usually supplied with the greatest part of the necessaries of life. The truth of this representation is best demonstrated by the calculate hereto annexed, which, your petitioners believe, will be esteemed by your Honour no more than a bare subsistence. Your petitioners therefore most humbly pray such addition to their present allowance of diet money as to your\n\n---\n\n1 Court to Bombay 17th April 1711 para 80. Comp. of Standing Ord.

As the Board does not apprehend they have authority to relieve the petitioners by increasing their allowance, although sensible that their case is justly enough stated, agreed that it be recommended home to the determination of our Honourable Masters, for whose notice it is ordered that the petition be inserted after this Consultation with the annexed calculate of necessaries for a month designed to show and explain how much their diet money falls short and the streights to which those of the servants must be drove to live upon it who have no other provision or dependence, excluding all extravagance or superfluous expense. A motion being made to allow the late Governor (the Honourable John Horne) diet money servants\u2019 wages and house-rent, as the same has been usual to such as have served in that station during a reasonable time of residence on the place, as was instanced in the allowance granted to Governor Cowan, the President (Honourable Mr. Stephen Law) remarks that (as the Board knows) the delay of settling this point hitherto was purely accidental, and that it was ever his meaning and intention and believes it likewise to be the Honourable Company\u2019s meaning and intention that their President should be distinguished and allowed competent support as before mentioned. In which opinion this Board had long before concurred, when it only wanted the form of minuting expressly the Resolution in Council. On estimating therefore the said charge for six months, it appears to come out at about\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 12 of 1738-39, 345 - 346.\nRs. 5400. Agreed therefore that we fix and limit the said allowance to the sum certain of five thousand rupees in full of the ordinary appointments in such cases.\n\nWith a view to provide State conveyances for the President and other covenant servants and strangers and foreigners, a Consultation of the 28th February 1741 records: Besides the necessary port required for the President which our Honourable Masters have hitherto acquiesced in, and that their servants and others may be furnished with a conveyance for the benefit of their health and at leisure times to go to different parts of the island, it is agreed to settle the number of horses and oxen to be kept as follows:\n\n**Horses.**\n\n- Horses for the President's coach and chaise, of which one may happen to be lame and less cannot be sufficient ... ... ... 6\n- Saddle horse for the President ... ... ... ... 1\n- Chaise horses for the use of the covenant servants and military officers attending the out-posts ... ... ... ... 4\n- Horse for the gunner and bombardier who are often obliged to visit the fortifications distant from the town and daily repair to see the exercising and training the people near the Breach ... ... ... 1\n- For common service and to carry the Ensigns who are monthly relieved at Sion as well as answer other calls ... ... ... 3\n\nTotal ... 15\n\n**Oxen.**\n\nTwo pair of oxen for a coach and chaise are esteemed necessary as well for the use of the inhabitants and to accommodate strangers or foreigners who at times are on the place ... ... ... 4\n\nTotal ... 4\n\nOn enquiry into the number of oxen now kept we find in fact only four in use though six appear charged in the Moody's account as receiving provisions. From the information we have of the additional number it is found to stand thus: The Romish Bishop some time since obtained an indulgence for two beasts designed for his own coach to be maintained at our Honourable Masters' charge. Afterwards the beasts being laid aside, an equivalent in money has been paid him by the Moody though inserted in the account as provisions for bullocks. The Board concur in opinion that the revenue of his bishopric is very small and our Honourable Masters themselves were pleased to annex thereto in the time of his predecessor a monthly appointment of Rs. 40. As the sum now allowed is no considerable amount sufficient only to furnish him with palanquin cooleys, it is agreed to continue the same. At the same time as the present method is in its nature extremely irregular, the land paymaster must in future see to the payment and that it be carried to the head of charges general. This will be more satisfactory to our Honourable Masters and they may then give such orders as they think proper.\n\nSix months later a Consultation of the 3rd August 1741 records: The President, the Honourable Mr. Stephen Law, desires the opinion of\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Consultation 25th Aug. 1739, Pub. Diary 12 of 1738-39, 339-340.\n2 Bom. Gov. Consultation 28th Feb. 1741, Pub. Diary 14 of 1740-41, 105-106.\nthe Members with respect to the purport of the 123rd paragraph whether it is thereby meant that the expense of a coach and horses which has been hitherto esteemed a necessary state for one in his station as also decent furniture for his apartments ought to be defrayed by him out of the allowed sum of Rs. 800 a month for diet. At the same time he observes that as to his own part he is far from being fond of an ostentatious show except so far as it appeared to him requisite to be kept up for the credit of the Honourable Company. If this expense is thought properly to fall upon him he shall with great readiness discontinue it, as his appointments are not equal to such a charge and with the utmost economy hardly suffice for the support of his table.\n\nAs regards the article of table linen, though it may with some propriety be reckoned part of the table expense, he is willing to take it upon himself and repay a sum of Rs. 323 which has been heretofore charged on that account. After perusing the prementioned paragraph the Members give as their sentiments that as our Honourable Masters have all along submitted to the expense of a distinguishing equipage for a President, so indispensably requisite in the eyes of our inhabitants and strangers who resort hither from the neighbouring governments, and as it cannot be imagined that every gentleman who has the honour to be advanced to be President is provided with proper furniture and other necessary utensils equal thereto, the charge ought to be borne by the Honourable Company. Nor can they conceive the paragraph now before them implies a contradiction thereto.\n\nRegarding perquisites and fees to the Company\u2019s servants a Consultation of the 25th May 1742 records: The President remarks that certain fees or emoluments arise to several employes annexed to the Company\u2019s servants which are not punctually stated or at least are not generally known. That he is led to this observation from the good method practised at the Bombay Custom-house where a table of all fees collected and established by the President and Council to the Custom Master is publicly affixed and which he apprehends would be more regular to have extended to all other officers. To this the Board acquiescing direct that the Members of this Board, the Secretary, and all other persons in charge of any office do prepare and give in a list of the fees perquisites, or other emoluments arising to them by virtue of their respective employes for notice and observation.\n\nOn receipt of these lists a Consultation of the 18th June 1742 records: The several lists of perquisites and fees having according to order at last meeting been perused by the Members, and coming now under examination, some alterations and amendments are made. The Board then direct those relative to every office to be affixed in some open and convenient place and that a register of the whole be preserved in the Secretary\u2019s office for reference on all occasions.\n\nIn a letter of the 24th March 1721 the Court write: We direct that no person but such as we appoint and order commissions for, shall\n\n---\n\n1 Bom.

A Consultation of the 4th October 1734 records: The several Company's servants on the island who are of age and have not already taken the oath of fidelity to the Company are now sworn, being Messrs. Whitehill, Pattle, Redshaw, Stonestreet, Dudley, Sedgwick, Marsh, Dacres, Owen, Munro, Cleland, West, Sewell, Hamilton, and Bertie. Directed that copy of said oath be sent to the several subordinate settlements to be there taken by such as have not already been sworn to the purport thereof.\\(^2\\)\n\nRegarding the Covenant executed by the Company's servants, an order of the Court, dated 2nd August 1739, runs: We direct that on attaining the age of twenty-one years, our servants do execute their covenants before two witnesses; that these covenants be transmitted home by the first ship, and security proposed for their faithful performance pursuant to a former order dated 2nd March 1736.\\(^3\\)\n\nThree years later (11th March 1742) the Court write regarding the oath of fidelity: Remember to comply with our orders by administering the oath of fidelity to every covenant servant on attaining the age of one and twenty, or on being admitted to a new employ, noting the same upon Consultation.\\(^4\\)\n\nOf censures and complaints the records contain the following. On the 26th April 1721 the Court write: We are sorry to read and find some of our covenant servants do not write so good hands as they should and might be reasonably expected to write. Among others the muster roll of the Fordwich's mariners signed by Allen Chambre, was so shamefully wrote that he ought to be censured for suffering it as he did by signing. You have given us an account that many of our covenant servants are very diligent and deserve encouragement, which seems implicitly to hint as if others were not so. If this be the case, give these others fair warning to amend. If they do not amend send them home. At least dismiss them our service for insufficiency or idleness and want of application to business. Those whose handwriting is but ordinary, for sometimes we are overprevalled upon to send one or two such on their friends' assurance they will improve in the voyage and when in India, they ought and we expect they shall take care to write better, for fair writing will turn to their own advantage as well as to ours. If they take pains in what they write, and not slubber and scrawl it over at any rate, they may improve. Those under whom they are employed.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Court to Bombay 24th March 1721 para 120. Comp. of Standing Ord. Vol. 1 of 1715 - 1721, 191.\n\n\\(^2\\) Bom. Gov.

If they are refractory, their superiors should complain of them to the Council that they may be called in and reprimanded to awe them into better manners. If that be not effectual, then dismiss them. Give copy of this to every person who has one or more writers under him, for his direction; and let him bear the blame if he do not observe it. We have said much to the same purpose in former letters and now say it once for all. Therefore let us hear no more the excuse of weak hands; for if they are weak and will not do better, lay them aside to make room for those that will.\n\nBesides for careless handwriting, the younger writers seem to have been open to censure for irregular office hours. At a Consultation of the 8th March 1734 Government issue the following orders: Whereas it has been found that sundry young gentlemen assistants in some of the public offices have not given such regular attendance as the public affairs do require and have absented themselves without license and due permission granted by their superiors; and some branches of the business committed to their care have been transacted in their private apartments instead of at the offices to which they belong; as such a procedure may be attended with most pernicious consequences, it is hereby directed that the sundry assistants in the several public offices on the island do regularly attend in the said offices from the hours of eight in the morning till twelve at noon and from three to five in the afternoon. And that they do on no pretence whatever absent themselves from the respective offices during the said hours without a particular license granted them by those who have the superintendency and direction of the said offices, under the penalty of being severely censured by the President and Council for the first offence, fined one month's diet money for the second, and suspended the Honourable Company's service for the third. Directed that a copy of this our Resolution be affixed up in the sundry offices.\n\nSix years later, at a Consultation of the 3rd October 1740, the subject of office attendance was resumed: The President reminds the Board of an order passed in the late Governor Cowan's time, which had also met with the approbation of our Honourable Masters, for the better regulating and fixing the punctual attendance of the several assistants in the public offices. The neglect hitherto shown to this order renders it the more necessary to be revived and enforced. And to the end that it be strictly observed and the penalties duly inflicted on the negligent, the accountant (or his deputy) and the Secretary are to be directed to report daily to the President such as are absent from their respective offices. At any time when assistants are inclined to go to Mahim or other places distant from the town, the President is to be previously acquainted and his permission obtained. In this the Board concurs, and orders that\n\n---\n\n1 Court to Bombay 26th April 1721 para 65. Comp. of Standing Ord. Vol. 1 of 1715-1721, 189.\n2 Bom. Gov. Consultation 8th March 1734, Pub.

Previous Presidents had in constant employ at least three covenant servants appropriated to that service. As he found the number on the island insufficient even to carry on the several branches of the Company's affairs, and to supply the subordinate factories, not one hand was to spare to his own assistance. That he had, therefore, entertained Mr. Laurence Sullivan in quality of an assistant, and was the only one he had. And though he should have been glad to take him into the Company's service, he would not transgress the Directors' positive orders against such admissions, so that he could only refer the matter with recommendation home, as was done in the general letter by the Harrington. That in the meantime it was just to make Mr. Sullivan some allowance until arrival of an answer. And as Mr. Sullivan undertook the business which used to be divided between three assistants furnished by the Company, he proposed an appointment of Rs. 80 a month, which he understands was no more than the late President allowed him out of his own pocket. The Board, being of opinion that since there were no hands to spare and it was very unfit that the President should remain without a proper assistant or be at the charge of it himself, agrees that the said appointment be accordingly allowed and confirmed to take place from the 1st of January when Mr. Sullivan entered on his business.\n\nA Consultation of the 26th September 1740 records: There being a real want of assistants in the Secretary's office to carry on the several parts of the business, and, by the list of servants now laid before the Board, there appearing none who would be of assistance that can be spared from other branches, Mr. John Robinson a young lad that came hither with Mr. Rigby, and at present writes under the Superintendent of the marine, is directed to attend in that office. For his encouragement it is agreed to raise his monthly allowance from Rs. 20 to Rs. 30.\n\nA Consultation of the 1st November 1735 records: The correspondence with the country governments growing very large and proving\n\n---\n\n1 Bom.

Mr. John Cleland being well versed in the Portuguese language and otherwise well qualified for the employ is accordingly placed in that office.\\(^1\\)\n\nRegarding the Company's interpreter at Bombay a Consultation of the 25th August 1738 records: There being a great want of a proper interpreter to be employed in transactions with the country governments and Bhiku Sinay having for some time past served as interpreter without pay it is agreed that we allow him Rs. 8 a month. Also as it is not possible that one shroff should constantly attend all receipts and payments, which it is necessary some trustworthy person should do, the President recommends one Venk\u00e1ji Sinay as an honest and diligent person for that purpose, who is accordingly appointed thereto at Rs. 12 a month.\\(^2\\)\n\nInterpreter's Pay, 1739.\n\nA Consultation of the 18th June 1739 records: Bhiku Sinay interpreter presenting a petition praying an increase of his monthly pay of Rs. 8, as being too small for the trouble and support of his place: Ordered that the petition lie upon the table for a farther examination into the merits of it. Resuming, 27th July 1739, the consideration of Bhiku Sinay's petition mentioned in our Consultation of the 18th June, who acts upon all occasions in the quality of our Linguist and some of the Members attesting favourably the nature of his past and present services, agreed that we allow him a gratuity of one hundred rupees for the time past and an appointment of fifteen rupees a month as Linguist to this Government.\\(^3\\)\n\nSubordinate Establishment, 1741.\n\nA Consultation of the 10th July 1741 has the following entry regarding the pay and recruitment of the subordinate establishment: The M\u00e4hum Custom Master recommending one Minguell Gonsalvez who assists under him as worthy of some consideration for his diligence and capacity, his present monthly allowance being no more than Rs. 8, it is observed our Honourable Masters in their commands per Harrington are pleased to forbid the employing Purvoes or black fellows in the several offices on the island. On our parts we are greatly inclined to comply with this order could we procure a sufficient number of Europeans whose abilities and sober course of life might render them capable to carry on the business. But as we are unprovided with Europeans, we must of necessity submit to its continuing in the former course, though certain it is, the appointments (or pay) of some Purvoes are so limited as hardly affords their family a subsistence and may therefore influence them to take indirect measures to gain merely to the end of a necessary support. Agreed therefore as an encouragement to the said Minguell Gonsalvez and to excite a faithful assiduous discharge of his duty that his pay be increased to Rs. 12 the month, being the same as is allowed to some assistants in other offices.\\(^4\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Bom.

He therefore proposes they be fixed as follows and none in future admitted but by an order of this Board, which is approved. From the present proposal a saving will arise as appears by the following calculation:\n\n### Subordinate Office Establishment, 1743.\n\n| Office | EXPENSE | Less | Office | EXPENSE | Less |\n|--------|---------|------|--------|---------|------|\n|        | May 1743 | July 1743 |        | May 1743 | July 1743 |\n| 1.

We apprehend this will require the proposed strength of Purvoes and others at least till we are supplied with a sufficient number of covenant servants. We therefore hope the above establishment will, for the present, meet with the Honourable Court's approval.\n\nIn a letter of the 24th March 1710 the Court proposed that the land of Bombay be surveyed and registered. As regards Customs, so long as they were not allowed to abuse the people, the Court held that the duties would yield more in the hands of farmers than under direct management since the farmers will be more careful of letting the water run by their own mill. The same letter contains the following orders regarding accounts: Send us by every shipping the best computation you can of our annual charge at Bombay. That is to say how much the salary of our mercantile people comes to, mentioning the persons and their salaries; how much the other charges of the garrison and factory amount to, namely so much each month; how much the charge of building and repairs; where and for what presents are made; where and for what and how much the charge of peons or other servants, and by whom and how employed; and the like of all other particulars that make up our annual charge of expenses there; and let this account be from the last of December to the last of next December; or if it cannot be with convenience, then to September or October preceding; and where any article is dubious, explain it.\n\nIn their letter to Bombay of the 17th April 1711, the Court recommend the raising and improving the revenues, as the great foundation of power and riches. In a letter of the 27th March 1714, paras 80 and 82, they add: For the year ending July 1712 the revenues of Bombay are \u00a39867 and the charges \u00a319,241 14s. Unless we can raise a revenue to make good these expenses, we shall be exhausted insensibly.\n\nOn the general subject of Trade and Revenues the Court write on the 5th April 1715: We come now to give you our directions touching the revenues. Whatever will most effectually and fairly promote them will be acceptable to us. Our President must have observed how regularly the revenues are settled in Madras; the Madras practice will be some guide to you in the methodizing the collecting and looking after the customary revenues of Bombay in the like manner for all such as are and shall be established there. We are told you are straitened of provisions and forced to get supplies from abroad; and that the duties laid thereon, prevent their coming in and that it would be for the general benefit of the island to take off all duties laid upon butter, oil, rice, paddy, and wheat. These we direct be taken off accordingly.\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Consultation 1st July 1743, Pub. Diary 16 of 1743, 164-168.\n2 Comp. of Standing Ord.

Take into serious consideration whether it would not be more for our service to take off all customs, and give us your reasons why, that we may give you our ultimate resolution. And what view you have of making our excises to rise in some proportion, in case we should, for the improvement of the island, declare Bombay a free port.\n\nIn the same letter the Court continue: Settle proper times for payments of all revenues farmed out. At Fort St. George the farmers pay their rents, some monthly such as the tobacco betel and arrack, which are great farms and the renters not very rich, and others every two or at least every three months, by which means they now make no bad debts. Whereas before, when the rents were paid but once a year, the farmers became insolvent or ran away. Do you take care in the like manner, and in particular be sure to call for and get in the aforementioned debts. And for your better remembrance let a rent roll or a memorandum be always lying on the Consultation table to remind you of what is standing out to call for it in, of the times when any payment is due to call for the money, to call for and receive into cash the monthly produce of the customs at Bombay and Mahim from the collectors; and the like from any of the covenant servants, for goods and other stores sold; and not let the money lie out.\n\nOn the 21st February 1717, the Court repeat the orders issued in 1715: You should always have lying on the table an account of the several branches of the revenues, whether the farms, pension, tributes, or other duties, and at what time they are payable that you may call upon the persons to pay it as it becomes due; that customs received be paid into cash, and the custom-masters' accounts be passed monthly. By these means with due care you will recover old arrears and prevent new ones.\n\nTo secure a fuller knowledge of their revenues and expenditure the Company write on the 17th April 1711: The account of your revenues and from what branches they arise and how much each yields, must not want a place in every year's letters.\n\nOn the 21st February 1717, to enable them to exercise a proper check over the revenues and expenditure, the Court issue the following orders: Send us annually not only to the end of the year which determines in July but to the month preceding the ships coming away, an account of the following particulars, namely Customs of Bombay and Mahim; the duty of a Xeraphin a ton on water; the two per cent towards the charge of the wall on goods imported in vessels under three masts; the amount and particulars of the pass-money towards the charge of the grabs; mentioning in each every month's receipt that\n\n---\n\n1 Comp. of Standing Ord.

And let the persons receiving these, sign the accounts, certifying the truth and expressing the times when so signed.\\(^1\\)\n\nRegarding the revenue management the Court write to Bombay on the 4th November 1719: We take notice of the contents of paragraph 75 shewing how the standing revenues of the island arise, and how they are collected; and in the packet do find abstract of the revenues of Bombay for the year 1718. It should have been mentioned when the year ended. But this abstract makes the total only Rs. 1,12,264; and on comparing the difference between this signed by Mr. Courtney, and the amount in the President\u2019s letter which makes them Rs. 1,25,454, we suppose some branches are new, besides Puckerawall; because paragraph 89 per Morice makes them but Rs. 1,09,365. We observe the President computes what the new two per cent duty may amount to and reckons it in. He also brings in an article of Rs. 4000 for tonnage which is not in Mr. Courtney\u2019s. We suppose the reason is that Mr. Courtney who signs as receiver specifies those articles only he doth receive. Therefore we should have had another list of their amount, of the other branches of our revenue, such as contribution to the town wall, pass-money or tonnage duty, pier duty for water, and the rest; and the abstract fixed to the time above desired that we might have seen a complete list of all actually received to that time. We desire it may be so sent for the future.\\(^2\\)\n\nTo increase their control over the subordinate settlements on the 2nd April 1725 the Court write to Bombay: That we may be able to make some estimate of the retrenchments necessary to be made at the subordinate settlements even when their books are not sent us, direct each place to give you annually, and do you send us, an abstracted account of the several items that compose the yearly charge, namely so many soldiers, naming their number, and therein how many officers and how many private sentinels with their respective pays, so many peons and other servants with their different wages, so much for stable charges, so much for diet, for charges merchandise, for charges extraordinary, for repairs, and so of every other article of disbursements that compose the total. By this means you will be able to make a tolerable judgment wherein they exceed and what superfluities should be pared off; and we shall judge accordingly here.\\(^3\\)\n\nIn their letter of the 11th March 1736, the Court enjoin the utmost frugality and recommend the curtailing expenses in every item that will admit of it.\\(^4\\)\n\nOn the 6th January 1737 the Court again complain of the heavy charges of the Presidency, and recommend the curtailing and lopping off every item that may be safely spared. They add:\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Comp. of Standing Ord. Vol. 1 of 1715-1721, 150.\n\n\\(^2\\) Comp. of Standing Ord. Vol. 1 of 1715-1721, 153.\n\n\\(^3\\) Comp. of Standing Ord.

Vol. 1 of 1715-1721, 153.\nThe accomplishing hereof must be heartily set about, and to that end every particular head of expenses must be taken into serious consideration by you, in the leisure part of the year duly weighing whether there is any necessity for each article, what benefit we receive from thence, if the prices are reasonable or not, contriving the cheapest way of going to work in all respects, noting the results of your debates on this important affair upon Consultation for our notice that we may see how far our interest has been promoted. This strict enquiry must not be confined to your place but likewise extend to each subordinate settlement by making proper regulations and limiting the expense in all confineable articles. We expect to reap a very considerable benefit on your heartily setting about a vigorous compliance with these our orders.\n\nOn the 2nd July 1738, for the safeguard of their cash balances the Court direct: We order for the future that our cash be kept under three locks; our President, the Second, and one more of the Council, each to keep a key, as is done here; and that the balance in specie be produced monthly before the whole Council. In the same letter they further order: We direct that a committee of treasury be appointed as we have here, and that the same consist of the President, Second, and Third of Bombay, for the time being; that all our bullion rupees and other treasure be kept by them under three different locks, except a running cash of about one hundred thousand rupees which must be in the President's possession; and the balance of the same with what is in the bullion office must be monthly produced before the whole Council, and the accounts entered upon Consultation. On the 5th February 1741 the Court insist upon the President's taking charge of the running cash.\n\nA Consultation, the 3rd August 1741, records: The 113th paragraph of the Company's letter declares whoever is trusted by the three seniors with the cash, still the said three seniors are answerable for any loss that may ensue. The gentlemen now in charge take occasion to observe that as from the nature of their employ in other branches of the Company's affairs it is impossible for them to give attendance at all receipts and payments, there is a necessity of appointing one particularly to that trust. This has hitherto been committed to one of their covenanted servants, and the greatest care and inspection observed in so material a charge. Seeing they cannot in person conduct the business of the treasury, but by means of an assistant, they apprehend they cannot be deemed absolutely answerable for any loss that may arise though they acknowledge at present they have no reason to imagine that will ever be the case. Our Honourable Masters in the 133rd paragraph insist on the President's taking charge of their running cash agreeable to the practice at their other head settlements. The agreeing and fixing on such a sum\n\n---\n\n1 Comp. of Standing Ord. Vol. 1 of 1715-1721, 158.\n2 Comp. of Standing Ord. Vol. 1 of 1715-1721, 207, 208.\nas may be sufficient to answer the design and laying down the necessary rules to be observed on the proposed division of the cash is referred to another opportunity.\n\nTwo days later, the 5th August 1741, the Diary records: Resuming the consideration of our Honourable Masters' orders for the President's taking charge of a running cash, the members are desired to examine the current receipts and issues of money in the treasury upon a medium of any one month and then allot such a sum as may be reckoned sufficient with the receipts of the revenues and other incidental monthly sums to answer the payments. This medium is to be under the President's charge, the other balance of cash to be kept in a separate room under three keys, each treasurer to have one. For a clear and distinct view two books are to be kept, the one entitled Treasury Dr. and Cr., and the other Running Cash. This, it is presumed, will answer the intention of our Honourable Masters.\n\nRegarding cash balances in a letter of the 11th March 1742, the Court write: So long ago as the year 1738 we gave particular directions for the keeping our cash, both for our own and your security. Instead of complying those orders have been cavilled at, in an unbecoming manner. We are now told that those who are entrusted by us therein are not absolutely answerable for any loss, because an assistant must be employed under them. We for our parts cannot see the force of the argument. People in all employ may plead the same. And we say once for all that whoever is employed by or under them must be well looked after by them; for our treasurers or cashiers are and shall be accountable and responsible to us.\n\nFor the sixteen years ending 1744 the Collector's records show a land revenue rising from Rs. 25,469 in 1728-29 to Rs. 35,897 in 1740-41.

On his going off he was saluted with three volleys from a detachment of military and 21 guns from the fort, the several ships in the road saluting as he passed them. The Somerset on whom he embarked immediately got under sail in company with the Britannia, Neptune's Prize grab and Moor ship, together with the Bombay and Restoration, who after seeing them so low as Gheria were to return hither.\n\nOn the 28th March 1717 the Court write: We find in Consultation the 9th December 1719 (1715?) an old house and ground called Sir John Wybourne's sold to Mr. John Hill for Rs. 180 to him and his heirs forever. We do not like this way of giving anybody a fee simple or absolute inheritance of any house or ground on Bombay. It may one time or other be of ill consequence. We will have no more of it. But do allow you to grant leases for a term of years or for lives with a liberty of renewal. In that case do not give a very long term; for once Bombay could be made secure and fit to invite merchants and useful inhabitants to reside there, we cannot doubt the ground-rents rising considerably.\n\nOn the 21st February 1717 the Court write: Remember your promise, paragraph 12 of 7th January, to improve the ground within the city wall by the method therein specified of letting leases renewable or by fines or quit-rents or whatever way you should judge most for our interest. The consideration of our prodigious charge and the people's protection and liberty are, if rightly managed, very cogent arguments to convince every one why that ground ought to be valued higher than it otherwise would be.\n\nA Consultation of the 30th September 1720 records: A petition was presented to the Board by the principal inhabitants setting forth that the quit-rent is a heavy tax on them and desiring to be relieved from the same. As it appears to us that there is reason for the said complaint, in consideration thereof and of the tax agreed to be laid on the Gentu cattle (which will be more than the whole quit-rent amounts to), resolved that from and after Michaelmas Day the quit-rent shall be reduced to one half. And several of the inhabitants to avoid paying said quit-rent having built without the town wall, ordered that all houses within cannon shot of the town wall pay the same quit-rent in proportion as those built within, which will in some measure make amends for what we have reduced the others to. The Secretary is hereby directed to\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Consultation 15th Nov. 1742, Pub. Diary 15 of 1741-42, 536.\n2 Court to Bombay 28th March 1717 para 49. Compilation of Standing Ord.

The proclamation ordered the 30th ultimo being drawn out was this day (3rd October 1720) published as usual.\\(^1\\)\n\nIn 1731 an attempt seems to have been made to equalize the quit and ground rent. A Consultation of the 3rd December 1731 records: The mensuration of the ground within the town walls at present occupied by the English as well as Black inhabitants made, by order of Council, by a committee of this Board with the assistance of Captain William Saunderson clerk of the works and of R\u00e1mji and Rango Purvoes, is now laid upon the table with a calculate of quit-rent and ground rent at a certain sum the square yard, which is and has been hitherto paid in a manner entirely unascertained, whereby some people have been prejudiced and others favoured. To prevent this abuse for the future it is agreed that the English inhabitants shall hereafter pay the same quit-rent for their houses that they have hitherto been assessed in. But for such ground as they may have taken in since the building of their houses or may hereafter take in they shall pay an additional quit-rent of 6 res for each square yard but be free of ground rent. All Native or Black inhabitants shall pay for the ground that they now occupy or shall hereafter occupy a quit-rent of 6 res and a ground rent of 5 res for each square yard.\\(^2\\)\n\nIn the next year (1732) the Bombay Government went further suggesting to the Court that ground and quit-rents should be remitted. In reply, in 1734, the Court of Directors decide that they cannot admit of taking off or abating any of the taxes whatsoever.\\(^3\\)\n\nOn receipt of this decision, on the 27th September 1734, the Bombay Government, referring to their order permitting the discontinuance of the payment of ground and quit-rents, observe: The Honourable Company, in the 52nd paragraph of their last commands, having been pleased to order that the ground and quit-rent be collected from the time it has been discontinued (1732), it is directed that the receiver of the revenues give in an account of the said duty from that time next Council day for our coming to a resolution thereon.\\(^4\\)\n\nOn the 4th October 1734 on receiving the required information the Board observe: The Collector of the revenues delivers in an account of the amount of the ground and quit-rent since June 1732; the time they have been discontinued, being Rs. 10,504-2-21\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\).

Diary 7 of 1734, 180.\nbitants of Bombay most humbly sheweth that in the month of July 1732 your petitioners did in behalf of themselves and the poor inhabitants of this island represent to the late Honourable President and Council the hardship and discouragement they laboured under in paying the Honourable Company the duty of ground and quit-rent from which they humbly begged to be relieved. To ease the poor people your petitioners offered to continue a duty on their trade equal to the amount of the said ground and quit-rent as may more fully appear from the said petition. Whereupon the said President and Council gratified your petitioners in their request and the said duty was accordingly relinquished. Soon after the arrival of the last ships from England the receiver of the Honourable Company's revenue, to the great grief of your petitioners and the rest of the inhabitants, did demand from them the arrears of the said duty of ground and quit-rent which many of the poor people are utterly unable to pay. The hire they receive for their labour very barely affords them and their families subsistence, and the said duty of ground and quit-rent being very discouraging to the merchants as well as a great burthen on the poor people, the merchants and principal inhabitants do in behalf of themselves and of the poorer sort again trespass on your Honour and Council's goodness humbly begging you will be pleased to relinquish the same. As an equivalent to the Honourable Company they will cheerfully continue such a part of the duty they at present pay towards building the town wall after that work is paid for as may be judged sufficient to clear the amount of the duty or tax of ground and quit-rent. Your petitioners also beg leave to represent to your Honours that in the first agreement between the Honourable Company and the inhabitants of this island it was stipulated that in consideration of the annual payment of Xeraphins 20,000 (which pension is now collected) the land that had been taken from any of the inhabitants should be restored and their estates ascertained when your petitioners conceive it was intended they should not be subject to farther taxes on estates. Notwithstanding which they now pay quit-rent for all houses built on their own ground. Also that when they made a voluntary gift of Rs. 30,000 (besides the two per cent) towards building the town wall they humbly hoped they should not be liable to any farther charge for such ground belonging to the Honourable Company as they might obtain liberty to build upon, though they are now obliged to pay the heavy duties of both ground and quit-rent. Your petitioners relying on your Honourable Company's goodness and favour, humbly submit their case to your consideration and rest fully assured that you will grant such relief as will be to the entire satisfaction of the whole body of your inhabitants.\n\nOn the 27th December 1734 on the above petition the Board observe: Read a petition from the merchants and principal inhabitants of this island setting forth the great discouragement to them and hardship to the poor people occasioned by our renewing the ground and quit-rent duty. But as our Honourable Masters have positively ordered that the arrears be collected and the duty continued, we can no\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 7 of 1734, 243 - 244.\notherwise relieve them than by representing their case home, which it is agreed to do by the next ships.\\(^1\\)\n\nRegarding the quit and ground rent a Consultation of the 18th June 1742 records: In the account delivered to the 31st July 1741 the rates for people within the town wall are 6 res the square yard for Europeans, 11 res for others, and 30 res for one Fakir Raffik No. 233. Why this is so we know not. For those without the town wall the rates are 15, 30, and 45 res the square yard but why the same differs must be explained.\\(^2\\)\n\nRegarding the origin of the pension tax a Consultation of the 25th May 1742 records: In our Consultation of the 19th of June last the President and Second undertook to inquire in what manner the pension was first settled, how it was assessed, and in the end to discover if it was kept up to the original purport or if any augmentation could be made. But the shipping from England arrived shortly after and other business more immediately requiring attention (besides the difficulty of obtaining a competent knowledge in that concern as no light or help could be procured from any registers remaining and therefore could be collected only from the most intelligent of the inhabitants) unavoidably prevented the inquiry being sooner executed. The President now tenders an account thereof from the best information he can procure and orders it to be inserted here for reference on any future occasion.\n\nOn the English assuming this island an account was taken of the true value, at that time, of the annual produce of all the lands according to which the produce was reckoned to be worth 80,000 Xeraphins (Rs. 43,636). The Government judging it to be necessary that a taxation or what is called pension should be laid, it was agreed that one-fourth part of the produce that is Xeraphins 20,000 (Rs. 10,909) should be annually paid to the Company. Accordingly, as stands particularly explained in the registers kept in the Secretary's office and with the Collector of the revenues, up to this day the levy has continued since that time. Here it is to be noted that the Company had then no lands, and therefore what hath since come into their hands must be rated suitably, in order, with what others pay, to complete the 20,000 Xeraphins pre-named:\n\n| Pension in the District of Mahim first established | 10,160 1 37 |\n| Ditto within the Bombay District | 9839 1 43 |\n| **Total** | **20,000 0 0** |\n\nThis makes Rs. 10,909 nearest at the rate of 11 Xeraphins to Rs. 6, being the manner of reckoning at that time. Taking these accounts for July 1741 they are found to stand as follows:\n\n| Rs. qrs. res. | Rs. lar. res. |\n|---------------|--------------|\n| Mahim Pension as per list | 2962 0 47 that is 5430 1 641 |\n| Bombay ditto | 4131 0 79 ditto 7573 2 464 |\n| **Total** | **7093 1 26 that is 13,004 1 31** |\n\n\\(^1\\) Bom. Gov. Consultation 27th Dec. 1734, Pub. Diary 7 of 1734, 240.\n\\(^2\\) Bom. Gov. Consultation 18th June 1742, Pub. Diary 15 of 1741-42, 292.\nThe Company's possessions that have come to them since the first settlement of the pension are here reckoned in order to ascertain and adjust the full primitive establishment of 20,000 Xeraphins. The result is:\n\n| Rs. qrs. res. | Xs. lar. res. |\n|---------------|--------------|\n| Company's Possessions ... | 3887 2 87 that is 7127 1 36 |\n| Existing Payments ... | 7093 1 26 ditto 13,004 1 31 |\n\nTotal ... 10,981 0 13 that is 20,131 2 67\n\nThe reason why the total is Xs. 20,131-2-67 and not Xs. 20,000 is that at first the dividing of every small share was attended with difficulty, and as the matter was so insignificant the parties consented that the overplus of Xs. 20,000 should be taken by the Collector. In this manner it has continued ever since as his perquisite and is Rs. 71-3-88 at eleven Xeraphins to six rupees.\n\nBetween 1726 and 1739 special inquiries in connection with a scheme for the purchase of Bombay by the Portuguese Government supply interesting estimates of the revenues of the town and island. On the 18th January 1727 the Viceroy of Goa, Jo\u00e3o de Saldanha de Gama, supplied the King of Portugal with the following details of the revenues received from the different divisions of the island: The village aldea of M\u00e1zgaon, held on quit-rent by D. Sie de Souza e Tavora, yielded about 184 mud\u00e1s of rice and 250 brab palms (palmeiras bravas) representing a yearly revenue of Xs. 4000 (Rs. 2769\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)) that is a sale value of Xs. 40,000 (Rs. 27,692\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)). The village of Warli (Varoli), held on a quit-rent by Antonio da Silva, yielded 34 mud\u00e1s of rice representing a yearly revenue of Xs. 700 and a sale value of Xs. 7000. The village of Parel (Parella) with its hamlets pacarias Bhoiv\u00e1da Pomalla and Salgado, once the property of the Jesuits, yielded 154 mud\u00e1s of rice and some brab palms representing a yearly revenue of Xs. 4000 and a sale value of Xs. 40,000. The village of Vad\u00e1la and its divisions Aiv\u00e1di and Gov\u00e1di, once the property of the Jesuits of Agra, yielded 75 mud\u00e1s of rice and some brab palms together representing a yearly revenue of about Xs. 1900 and a sale value of Xs. 19,000. The village of N\u00e1gaon, once the property of the Jesuits, with a produce of 42 mud\u00e1s of rice and some unimportant brab palms representing together a yearly rent of about Xs. 1000 and a sale value of Xs. 10,000. The village of M\u00e1tunga (Matuquem) yielded 65 mud\u00e1s of rice and 100 brab palms representing a yearly rent of Xs. 1700 and a sale value of Xs. 17,000. The village of Sion (Siao), once the property of Miquel Muzzello Coutinho, yielded 54 mud\u00e1s and a few brab palms representing Xs. 1400 a year and a sale value of Xs. 14,000. Dh\u00e1r\u00e1vi, once the property of the Jesuits, a sub-division p\u00e1khd\u00e1i of Sion, yielded 8 mud\u00e1s of rice and some brab palms representing a yearly revenue of Xs. 225 and a sale value of Xs. 2000. The hamlets of Bamanavali and Coltem (to the north of Parel), once the property of the Jesuits, yielded 15 mud\u00e1s of rice and had some brab palms representing a yearly rent of Xs. 400 and a sale value of Xs. 4000.\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Consultation 25th May 1742, Pub. Diary 15 of 1741-42, 256 - 259.\n2 Compare O Chron. de Tissuario, I, 130 and II. 14.\nThe Kasba of Bombay, the property of various people, had 40,000 cocoa palms worth Xs. 6 to Xs. 9 each that is a sale value of about Xs. 3,00,000. Some plots of land yielded 8 to 10 mud\u00e1s of rice representing Xs. 224 a year and some salt-rice land paid a quit-rent of Xs. 200. That is for the town of Bombay an estimated yearly rental of Xs. 30,424 representing a sale value of Xs. 3,04,240. The Kasba of Mahim had 70,000 cocoa palms of which about 23,000 belonged to the English Company. Some gardens and paddy fields which have fallen to the Company from want of heirs yielded 592 mud\u00e1s of rice. The Company has also land yielding 18 mud\u00e1s of rice once Jesuit property and other lands yielding 18 mud\u00e1s once held by other quit-rent payers. That is a total yearly rental of about Xs. 50,000 representing a sale value estimated at about Xs. 5,00,000.\n\nBesides the land yielding rice and palms Rauli in Matunga has salt pans yielding 36 r\u00e1sis or heaps of salt representing a yearly rent of Xs. 1200 and a purchase value of Xs. 12,000. In Siwri and Vadala were salt pans belonging to the Company yielding 34 r\u00e1sis or heaps representing a yearly rent of Xs. 1100 and a sale value of Xs. 11,000. Also some private salt pans yielding 9 to 10 r\u00e1sis representing a yearly outturn of Xs. 350. Near the west of the island the point called Koleo (Kolaba) yielded the Company Xs. 4000 to Xs. 5000 a year. Bombay, M\u00e1zgaon, Warli, Parel, Sion, and Dh\u00e1r\u00e1vi had Koliv\u00e1d\u00e1s or Koli hamlets which together yielded about Xs. 7000 a year. At Mahim and at Bombay were two Bandvastaes or distilleries where the juice or sura of brab and cocoa palms was made into country spirit yielding an estimated yearly revenue of Xs. 2000 representing a sale value of Xs. 20,000. In 1668 the customs of Bombay and Mahim were rented for Xs. 60,000 and in 1708 for Xs. 62,000. In 1726 they were only Xs. 52,000 the fall being due to a reduction in the duties on articles of food.

The 1537 totals are remarkably small. The details are: Mahim Land, Xs. 1098, Customs, Xs. 1239; M\u00e1zgaon, Xs. 300, Mombayim, Xs. 698; Total, Xs. 2335.\nAs regards the value of the fortresses the Viceroy wrote: The Castle of Bombay has six modern bastions begun in 1716 and well defended with artillery. The fort called Dongri opposite the city is of small importance. M\u00e1zgaon Fort with a garrison of one sergeant and 24 men has small bastions and three guns. The fort of Siwri or Suri, on the shore in front of the S\u00e1lsette village of Maula, has a garrison of 50 sepoys and one subhed\u00e1r, and eight to ten guns. Sion facing Kurla has a small tower and one breast-work with nine to ten guns, 60 soldiers and one captain. M\u00e1him on the shore in front of B\u00e1ndra has three bastions and thirty guns with 100 soldiers. Warli on the high point facing the chapel of Our Lady of the Mount has seven to eight guns, one ensign and 25 soldiers. The island of Patecas, that is Butcher\u2019s Island, annexed to the village of M\u00e1zgaon does not yield any revenue. In 1722 General Charles Boone began a fort now (1727) perfect with six or seven guns and a garrison of about seventy lascars.\n\nRegarding the means by which the required purchase money could be raised the Viceroy writes: It seems to me that it will be enough to pay the capital of the revenue (which at ten years\u2019 purchase would represent about Xs. 24,00,000) by permitting your Christian subjects to buy the properties. As on account of poverty the Christians could not produce more than Xs. (or pardaos) 5,00,000 or 6,00,000, your Majesty should allow the Hindus to buy the remainder continuing to them the privileges allowed them by the English. This is convenient not only with the object of raising money, but because many of those at present in the island fled there from your Majesty\u2019s estate, because of the horror of the Inquisition. As these men have attracted the commerce of Asia to the island, if they go they will take the trade with them, and thus your Majesty\u2019s custom house would become quite useless. The Fathers of the Company (Jesuits) will require the restitution of their revenue. I submit that your Majesty should not make them this grace unless they pay their value for which they have sufficient means. If your Majesty allows them to buy all these properties I believe in their own interests they will not hesitate. With regard to the payment of the fort and buildings it seems to me not possible without your Majesty\u2019s help. I remember that the Christian Armenians have sent a petition to the Government of India, asking them for an harbour whence they could make a fort for defence submitting to regular laws. As the Armenians are oppressed by all nations both European and Asiatic, I doubt not they will embrace this concession when it is proposed. If the Armenians do not, then your Majesty will have to satisfy this amount through the Royal Treasury sending the money in dollars which yields 50 per cent premium or in some other coin which might yield 30 per cent. In order that your Majesty may recover this expense, it can be arranged by means of obtaining from the custom house so much per cent to be collected and sent to Lisbon in articles which might bring profit.\n\n---\n\n1 Archivo Portugu\u00eas Oriental Fasc. 6 Supplement New Goa, 1876, pages 287-292.\nAt a Consultation of the 26th August 1737 the Board write: Our Honourable Masters, in paragraph 44 of their commands by the Grafton, being pleased to take notice of our omitting to send our promised remarks on the several branches of the revenues of this island, the President observes that such omission was owing to our being convinced from the examination then made that none of the articles would well admit of the least augmentation without actually becoming a grievance to the traders. This indeed was hinted to our Honourable Masters in paragraph 143 of our address by the King William wherein we gave it as our opinion that their revenues were then on a very good footing. At the same time seeing that, since the arrival of the Grafton, the abstracts of the revenues had been laid before the President, he made the following remarks upon each article:\n\n1. Rents and revenues under the care of the Collector include the following articles:\n   (a) Tobacco Rent.\u2014Let out to the highest bidder for the sole liberty of selling country tobacco to the inhabitants. As the tobacco farm is exposed to sale in the most public and open manner, and as every person who thinks a profit can be made by renting the farm is at liberty to bid; the augmentation or decrease of this article depends entirely on the consumption of tobacco amongst our inhabitants. It is yearly let out at present for Rs. 29,225 0 0\n\n   (b) Arrack Rent.\u2014For the sole liberty of selling parriar arrack and toddy to the inhabitants. Had this article been put up to public sale it might possibly have let out for more than the Bhand\u00e1ris give. But whether that had been prudent under the dangerous consequences set forth in Consultation the 12th July, must be submitted to our Honourable Masters. It is now let to the Bhand\u00e1ris for Rs. 12,000 a year, though the last three years it yielded annually Rs. 14,300 0 0\n\n   (c) Old Woman's Island.\u2014This island has been farmed to Mr. Richard Broughton upon lease for twenty-one years. His time does not expire till July 1743, till when no alteration can be made in this article. Its yearly rent is Rs. 200 0 0\n\n   (d) Malab\u00e1r Hill.\u2014This hill has been farmed to the highest bidder for the term of three years, being the most certain method of letting it for what it is worth. This article will not admit of augmentation Rs. 131 0 0\n\n   (e) Brab Trees on Butcher's Island.\u2014These trees have been let to Mr. Richard Hollomore, who constantly resides there. And as no inhabitant upon this island will farm them, and there being no people on Butcher's Island except the soldiers and their families, we are obliged to let said trees for what anybody will give Rs. 15 1 0\n\n   (f) Pension.\u2014This was agreed to by the inhabitants in 1672 and was then settled at Rs. 20,000 (Rs. 10,909). Since that time several carts and batty grounds being forfeited to the Honourable Company, the pension was proportionably lessened and it last year amounted to Rs. 7228 3 73\n\n   As this article is in pursuance of an engagement made with the inhabitants when the island came into the possession of the English, and as it has so long been punctually observed, I cannot think we ought to infringe the same by an alteration.\n\n   (g) Bombay Coolery.\u2014The produce of this article arises chiefly from a head tax collected from every Koli for the liberty of fishing and following other occupations. The\nAND ISLAND.\n\nremainder is the amount of sundry small tributes collected by the overseer. The whole for the last year being Rs. q. res. 1512 1 95\n\nThe head-money paid by the fishing Kolis is Rs. 3 to Rs. 4 a year. It is specially for those who follow callings other than fishing. The palanquin Kolis (whose wages are only Rs. 3 a month) pay the same as the fishermen, which we think will serve to show this article is not capable of being increased without oppressing those poor men in too great a degree as they have for a long time past made heavy complaints of their burthen.\n\n(h) M\u0101gaon Coolery.\u2014This item arises in the same manner and the same remarks are applicable to this as the foregoing.\n\n(i) Petty Tributes.\u2014Salt and Batty grounds. The persons who make the salt in the pits belonging to the Honourable Company pay either at a certain rate of each pit or the half of what they actually make. The price of the salt is settled according to the times and circumstances, and the way of collecting the revenue arising from this article having by experience been found the most beneficial to the Honourable Company, I presume they will continue it and think half the produce of the salt pits a sufficient quota, they being at no other charge than making the pits and keeping them in repair. The batty grounds in general belonging to the Honourable Company are cultivated by the Kunbis and their produce is equally divided between the Honourable Company and them. The taka or estimate of the whole produce of the Company's batty grounds is computed in a good season to be 516 mudas 7 ph\u0101ras and 9\u00bd adholis; but in case of a bad season a reasonable amount is always allowed. That is the Company receive half the real produce of the grounds instead of the settled rate. And as the lands are cultivated at the expense of the Kunbis I cannot but esteem half their net produce a sufficient rent for the grounds.\n\nThe tributes from the Bhandaris for drawing toddy from the Company's trees, from the Kolis of Warli and Sion for fishing, and the rent of sundry hills and small pieces of ground, are according to ancient establishment and will not therefore admit of alteration. These articles last year amounted to Rs. 11,188 2 27\n\n(j) Quit and Ground Rent.\u2014The houses within the town wall pay annually for every square yard 6 res quit-rent and 5 res ground rent. Those without the wall pay 5 res quit-rent and 4 res ground rent.\n\nI am so far from thinking this an improvable article that I am convinced of the great burthen it is to the poorer inhabitants and am in some hopes our Honourable Masters will be induced to relieve them upon considering our second representation of their case in paragraph 98 of our letter of the 30th September 1736.\n\nTotal Rs. 70,116 2 69\n\nDeduct\u2014The salaries and wages to the several officers and servants employed in collecting the above revenues Rs. 3851 2 68\n\nNet amount of the Collector's list for 1735-36 Rs. 66,265 0 1\n\n2. Customs:\n\n(a) Imports and Exports.\u2014All goods imported and sold pay 3 per cent unless they have already paid duties at Surat.\n\n---\n\n1 This paragraph is incorrect. The Collector's Rent Roll for Quit and Ground Rent 1728 - 1737 shows a total for 1735-36 of Rs. 5461-1-40 as in the text. The rates in the town are 6 res and 11 res and outside of the town 15, 30, and 45 res as stated at page 304.\nor Cambay. The only exception to this 3 per cent duty is in the case of sundry articles whose importation, being judged of advantage, is allowed free and of others whose importation is judged detrimental and is subject to special duties. These articles are: Timber free, Indian tobacco 9 per cent, grain free, horses 6 per cent, jewels free, soap 9 per cent, plate free, opium 9 per cent, country iron 9 per cent.\n\nA special export duty is levied on the following articles which are necessary to the island, namely: Timber 5 per cent, grain 5 per cent, boats sold 6 per cent, salt 20 per cent, cocoanuts 9 per cent, cloth made on Bombay 2\u00bd per cent, sundry other necessaries such as corn, fish, and cojans 9 per cent.\n\nThe duties of Bombay paid by the traders are esteemed as reasonable as at any port in India. When it is considered that goods brought from Bengal have already paid a consulage there and if exported from hence to Persia pay another duty at that place, we cannot suppose the Honourable Company will think it reasonable to augment the one without taking off the other. In this respect we trade on a more disadvantageous footing than the Moors, who, having paid the Moghal's duties at one of his ports, are at liberty to carry their goods to all the rest within the year custom free. We can from experience affirm that the Honourable Company are the greatest gainers by the private trade carried on by the English in India.\n\nThe amount of this article in 1735-36 was ... ... ... 62,234 1 18\n\n(b) Contribution to the Town Wall.\u2014All goods imported by the country merchants (except in three-mast ships) pay 2 per cent ... ... ... 14,590 2 18\n\nThis town wall duty was voluntarily paid by the inhabitants of Bombay to defray the expense of building the Town Wall. They no doubt expected when the cost was repaid, they would be relieved from the duty, though I believe they may be prevailed willingly to continue the 2 per cent, if our Honourable Masters gratify them in relinquishing the ground and quit rent. I am inclined to hope our Masters will agree to this proposal. The difference will be greatly in their favour, and by their compliance the body of our merchants will be gratified and our poor relieved.\n\n(c) Duty towards building a new Custom House.\u2014This duty is collected on all goods imported; it was originally given towards building the Church and when the church was finished (1718) the merchants hoped it would be taken off. It has since been applied to the Custom House and other services 3\u00bd per cent being collected upon all imports without separating this duty from the real customs. The traders seem to despair of being relieved from this duty, though when a donation of that kind is made they think it ought to be applied to no other use and ought not to be continued after the work for which the duty was first levied is completed ... ... 8488 0 27\n\n(d) Weighing and Measurage Duty.\u2014All goods weighed or measured at the Custom House pay \u00bd per cent on their value over and above the customs contribution. This in effect increases the custom to 3\u00bd per cent. This duty was laid on by the late President and Council and has been submitted to by the traders in general who do not pretend to dispute the Honourable Company's power of levying and continuing what duties they please on the trade carried on under their protection. In spite of this whether the overburthen of it will not have a bad effect and lessen the Customs revenue is referred to our Honourable Masters ... ... 2827 3 89\n\n(e) Duty on Pepper exported from the Coast-Factories.\u2014I cannot but confess I think this pepper duty a hardship on the\nEnglish traders who alone are subject to it. I apprehend the original design of the tax was to lessen the export of pepper on account of private persons from the Honourable Company's settlements. But it has been taken in a much more unlimited sense; for this duty is collected on all pepper sold by the English traders in any of the Honourable Company's settlements, though bought from such parts of the coast as noways interfere with our Honourable Masters' trade. Nay the duty was carried even farther and collected on pepper bought at Cochin and sold in China. From this we were obliged to desist on the Dutch threatening to deny us the liberty of their port. As at this time all merchants (except those under the English protection) can buy pepper at K\u00e1rv\u00e1r, Onor, Cochin, and other parts of the coast where our Honourable Masters have not settlements, and sell it at any market in India without paying this additional duty, the levy puts the English on a worse footing as regards pepper than any other merchants, even than the Moors or Banians. It is to be hoped the Honourable Company taking the same into their consideration will be pleased to relieve them by taking it off.\n\n(f) Excise on Punch Houses.\u2014Liquors sold by retail pay an excise as follows: Goa arrack, Rs. 15 the hogshead; Europe wine of all sorts, Re. 1 the dozen; Persia wine, Rs. 5 the chest; Drams in cases, Rs. 5 the case; Brandy and Beer, Re. \u00bd the dozen. Considering the expense of house rent and servants wastage and damage, and the prime cost of liquors the above duties are as much as the Punch-house keepers can really afford to pay.\n\n(g) Coinage Duty.\u2014In pursuance of the Honourable Company's orders the coinage duty was settled at 1 per cent. This duty will not bear augmenting since silver may be coined in Surat upon near as good terms as in our mint. It is therefore undoubtedly the Honourable Company's interest and that of this island in general to encourage the merchants to bring their money by coining it for them to more advantage than can be done elsewhere.\n\n(h) Convoy Duty.\u2014This is collected on small vessels belonging to the island (that do not pay tonnage) according to the following rates: Those under 100 khandis, Rs. 10; from 100 to 150, Rs. 15; from 150 upwards, Rs. 20. Vessels pay this duty every trip and some boats make two, others three, voyages in a season. As upon such boats the convoy duty amounts to more than the tonnage, I think it is for the Company's interest not to attempt to enhance this duty.\n\n(i) Pier and Water Way.\u2014All private ships that take in water at this port pay Re. 0 qrs. 1 res. 60 a ton for the same. The amount of the duty is small and will not admit of any considerable addition.\n\n(j) Account Freight.\u2014This article is very uncertain. Goods are freighted on such terms as can be settled. All gold and silver belonging to black merchants brought on the Company's ships or vessels from Persia or the Red Sea, pay 2 per cent and from Basra 27 the thousand, and what belongs to the Company's covenant servants pays 1 per cent. Should this duty be augmented the merchants would freight on other vessels on more easy terms. It is certainly the Company's interest to continue the rate as hitherto. The encouraging the merchants to freight their money to this island is of very great consequence to the Honourable Company as well as to the merchants of the place. For the greatest part of the silver freighted on the Company's vessels is coined in our mint; whereby the Company receive an advantage, besides the\nfreight. And the proprietors of such silver being generally\nthe northern merchants export near the whole amount of it in\ngoods which tends to the benefit of the island and the increase\nof the Honourable Company's customs\n\n(k) Account Tonnage at Bombay and Surat.\u2014All ships that\ntake our pass pay Re. 1 the ton to the Company, which duty\nis also collected on the English ships from the other side of\nIndia. Also all foreign boats belonging to the inhabitants of\nCutch, Sind, and other places are obliged to take our pass and\npay the said duty of Re. 1 a ton. Many of those people think\nit very hard to be obliged to take our pass on such terms,\npleading that without passes their vessels and boats would be\nas safe from any of the pirates who infest this coast. There-\nfore whether it will be prudent to attempt increasing this\narticle of the Honourable Company's revenue and hazard the\nwhole by disgusting those traders must be submitted to their\nconsideration. Amount collected here and at Surat in 1735-36.\n\n3. Cocoanuts and Oarts Rents.\u2014The produce of this article is\nlittle more than the amount of the cocoanuts sold at public\noutcry, which method I think will not admit of an alteration\nfor the better. The revenue arising from the small pieces of\nvacant ground in and contiguous to the oarts let out for\nplanting greens, does almost defray the charges of looking\nafter the oarts and keeping the wells and water-courses in\nrepair. The net amount of this article in 1735-36 was\n\n4. Surat and Cambay Customs.\u2014As this item is a duty of\n2 per cent on all goods imported and exported at and from\neither of those places by the traders under the Honourable Com-\npany's protection, which with other charges amount to upwards\nof 10 per cent on the gross sales, I presume our Honourable Masters\nwill not think fit to discourage the private trade by\nan augmentation of these duties\n\n5. Batty produced by salt grounds not included in the Col-\nlector's list, but arising after the same manner as the revenue\nof the other batty grounds\n\nSeveral parcels of the ground recovered by the Breach or\nVellard are now being measured by the vereadores and will be\ndistributed among such of the inhabitants as are willing to\ncultivate them on the best terms that can be obtained. As the\nground becomes freshened by the rains, I hope this article will\nin time admit of great improvement to the Honourable Com-\npany's advantage.\n\n6. Account Fines\n\n7. Confiscations\n\n8. Account Interest\n\nThese three articles depending entirely upon accidents, it is\nnot in our power to improve them.\n\nNote.\u2014The total net revenues of Bombay, including the ton-\nnage collected at Surat and the Customs at that town and\nCambay, on close of books k k ending July 1735 as per the\naccountant's Abstract sent our Honourable Masters by the\nWyndham and Lynn, is Rs. 2,34,082-0-2. There is a difference\nbetween this and the sheet abstract of Rs. 15\u00bd, this sum being\nadded in said abstract to the amount of the Collector's list\nthough therein included.\n\nTotal ... 2,34,082 0 2\n\nThe several members of the Board having in course duly examined\nthe above remarks on every article think they are just and therefore\nunanimously concur in opinion with the President, and it is agreed\nthat the same may be submitted to the consideration of our Honourable Masters.\n\nIn 1727 Government decided to have the waste ground near Back Bay planted with trees. With the view of carrying out this Resolution a Consultation of the 26th April 1728 records: Our Consultation of the 28th July last (1727) agreed to make over the Back Bay waste to such persons as would plant the same with cocoanuts for the consideration there specified. The waste land along Back Bay being now divided into five parts an indenture is passed to each party.\n\nBut as people fail to show the same readiness to occupy the waste ground in the oarts of Mahim, it is resolved that the same be planted on the Honourable Company's account. When the planting is complete the receiver is to give in a list of the number of trees planted to be entered in Consultation. The grant of the waste lands in Back Bay was in each case confirmed by an indenture.\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Consultation 26th Aug. 1737, Pub. Diary 10 of 1736-37, 197 -207.

Phipps Esq. President and Governor, and Council of Bombay for and on behalf of the Right Honourable United Company of Merchants of England trading to the East Indies of the one part and Antonio de Silva, inhabitant of Bombay, of the other part. Witnesses that the said President and Council upon the covenants and agreements hereafter mentioned have devised, granted, and to farm letten unto the said Antonio de Silva his heirs executors administrators and assigns a piece or parcel of waste land called Degouri (Degavadi) situate in the Back Bay, whereon is newly planted or about to be planted 125 palmyras having for boundaries east the cart Dassoury (Dassavadi) belonging to Jiji Moody and the oart Carvel belonging to the said Antonio de Silva, west the highway, south a passage and the cart Banoury (Bannvadi), belonging to Jesing Ranchhod and Panduji Posji. And also on this third part of a piece of ground called Dadouri (Dadvadi) situate in the said Back Bay, whereon is now or is about to be planted 100 palmyras being bounded on the east with the oart and a wadri belonging to Duarqua and Ignatio de Souz, west with the highway, south with the other two-thirds of the said oart, and north with a passage. To have or to hold the said pieces or parcels of ground unto the said Antonio de Silva his heirs executors administrators and assigns forever, yielding and paying unto the said President and Council or their successors at the end and expiration of ten years from the date hereof a yearly rent charge of fifteen cocoanuts a tree, rating the cocoanuts at Rs. 20 per 1120, and from the date hereof until the end\nRegarding the proposed plantation at Mahim a Consultation of the 21st June 1728 records: Our resolution of the 26th of last April determines that the waste ground in Mahim woods shall be planted with cocoanut trees and further orders a survey and calculate to be made of the expense during the nine years before the trees will reach perfection. A report is now brought in calculating the expense of 1200 trees during nine years to be about Rs. 4500, and further that owing to the barrenness of the land and the nearness of salt water the said plantation will not then be worth more than Rs. 7000. As this will not even allow common interest on the expense, it is resolved that we decline to make any such plantation.\n\nA Consultation of the 26th June 1736 records: It is directed that public notice be given that next Council day the unemployed space without the Church Gate belonging to the Honourable Company will be let for a term of years with this condition that no houses are to be built or trees planted thereon that may hinder the air coming to the city. Two weeks later, 9th July 1736, it is further recorded: Nobody appearing to rent the piece of ground taken notice of in last Consultation, it is directed that the receiver of the revenues endeavour to let it out for the most he can, acquainting us of his proceedings.\n\nRegarding the leasing of the vacant ground round the Town Wall, a Consultation of the 8th March 1743 records: The ground round the town wall rendered vacant by the clearance of houses and trees, may be made fit for producing batty. It is therefore directed that a publication issue for letting these lands upon lease for five or seven years on condition that no wall or standing fence be erected.\n\nTwo months later a Consultation of the 6th May 1743 records: The waste ground round the town wall is put up to be let for nine years from the 30th April last, on the following conditions: That the extent of the ground is to be from the angle of the Prince's Bastion to the English burying ground, reserving a sufficient space round the powder house. As some small parcels are already occupied, the renter shall permit the present occupiers to continue in possession for the space of two years they paying the same as what has hitherto been paid the Honourable Company, or otherwise consenting to make such an allowance and expiration of the said ten years 7\u00bd cocoanuts a tree a year, rating them as aforesaid.

A Consultation of the 8th March 1747 records: The persons who rented the waste ground without the town walls for nine years at the rate of Rs. 615 a year, commencing from the 30th April 1743, being desirous of relinquishing the same and one Purshotam Gop\u00e1lji Purvoe offering to give Rs. 650 a year for those grounds on the same terms for the five remaining years of the lease, it is agreed that Purshotam\u2019s offer be accepted.\n\nA Consultation of the 25th April 1735 records: The rent of Malab\u00e1r Hill expiring the 25th March 1735, it is now put up for three years from 25th March 1735 when the highest bid is Rs. 131 a year.\n\nOn the 30th March 1738 the rent of Malab\u00e1r Hill for three years from the 25th March was put up to be let to the highest bidder. The conditions were as usual except that the renter was not obliged to plant any mango trees. Jiji Moody appeared to be the highest bidder at the rate of Rs. 150 a year.\n\nA Consultation of the 24th March 1744 records: Conformable to public notice that we should this day put up to auction the farm of Malab\u00e1r Hill for three years commencing the 25th instant, several persons attending without were admitted and the conditions declared as follows: The farmer to have the entire possession of that part of the Hill usually esteemed to belong to the Honourable Company, as also the benefit of the fishing wares, but not to cut any live wood, and hay to be cut as usual for the Company\u2019s use. When Savaji Dharamset, Rupji Dhanji, and Vithald\u00e1s Keshavr\u00e1m jointly were the highest bidders at the rate of Rs. 175 a year.\n\nIn 1743, regarding an application for the renewal of the lease of Old Woman\u2019s Island, a Consultation of the 13th June 1743 records: The lease granted to Mr. Richard Broughton of Old Woman\u2019s Island expiring the 6th of next month, application is made on his behalf for a renewal thereof for the term of 21 years. Considering that, by the tenure of his former lease, the Company must pay Mr. Broughton for the improvements he has made according as they may be valued which may amount to more than the rent would compensate in many years; and that the expense and trouble he has been at ought to have some weight in his favour, it is agreed that on his paying a fine of one year\u2019s rent and as an encouragement to his industry the lease be renewed for the term of 21 years at the same rate as formerly that is Rs. 200 a year.\n\n---\n\n1 Pub.

Bombay Collector\u2019s Revenue Accounts Vol. 4.\nOn the 6th March 1724 the President acquaints the Board that the persons appointed to prepare and cultivate the salt ground recovered by the causeway made from Sion to Mahim, as by our Consultation of the 17th June last (1723), have represented to him that after a great deal of labour and some expense, through the scarcity of last season's rain the ground yielded no produce at all. He had therefore directed the vereadores of Mahim and the mahataras of the Aldeas and Cassabys (that is villages and towns) to survey and measure the contents of the said ground and according to the best of their judgment estimate its yearly rent and certify the same to be delivered unto this Board. The report of the vereadores is as follows: The limits of the new salt ground recovered by stopping the great breach between Mahim and Sion and lying in the middle of the old salt ground, namely from the great causeway of Sion Dharaivi and Mooree (Mori river) to the point of Mahim within the causeway leading into Mahim woods, contain 23,332 measures of 14 covits to each measure of which 15,000 are valued annually at 12 res and 8332 at 8 res. It is objected that as, by reason it lies low, 700 measures of the above ground will want labour and new earth to fill up and make it useful, the same should be free of rent. And likewise that some other allowances must be granted for grounds employed for making tanks to preserve water for the benefit of the batty during the too long intervals between the rain. The vereadores and mahataras are thereupon called in and offer the people among whom they propose to distribute the said grounds on the above terms. These people insist on a lease of 21 years. And being told this could not be consented to they are at last with difficulty brought to accept a lease of seven years allowing the 700 measures at present unfit for tillage to be rent-free, but no allowance to be made for what they make use of for tanks. Agreed therefore to rent the land to them as follows, namely 15,000 measures at 12 res a year is Rs. 450 and 7632 measures at 8 res a year is Rs. 152-2-56, that is a total of Rs. 602-2-56.\n\nRegarding stopping the Great or Mahalakhshmi Love-Grove Breach a Consultation of the 11th April 1720 records: The President informs the Board that Captain Bates had made a proposal for stopping the Great Breach, which the undertaker seemed pretty confident was very practicable. If this proposal should be approved it would necessarily occasion an increase of our expenses. Therefore as the monsoon draws near, he thought it proper to make a provision accordingly and offers to pay into the treasury Rs. 20,200 here and take a bill for Rs. 20,000 on the Chief and Factor at Surat Rs. 200 being the customary exchange. Ordered that the accountant draw out a bill accordingly.\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Consultation 6th March 1724, Pub. Diary 2 of 1724, 34-35. Forrest's Home Series, II. 34-35.\n2 Pub. Diary 1 of 1720, 36. Forrest's Home Series, II, 4.\nTwo days later, 13th April 1720, a Consultation records: Mr. Elias Bates now delivers in a proposal for stopping the Great Breach in one season. Ordered that Messrs. Brown, Courtney, Midford, and Phillipps consult with and take the opinions of Major Vane and Captain Johnson on this affair and make a report thereof to the Board.\n\nIn obedience to the above order of Council on the 13th of the next month, May 1720, the Committee report: We have examined the scheme and method laid down by Captain Bates for stopping the great breach of water, and took to our assistance Major Vane Captain Johnson Captain Ingram and Captain Hamilton and now crave leave to offer the result of our examination. All the aforementioned gentlemen (excepting Captain Johnson) are of opinion that the only sure and least expensive method for completing this great and useful work is by the means and manner proposed by Captain Bates according as he has explained his draught in writing to which we refer without troubling your Honours with a recital of it here. Captain Johnson on the contrary thinks it more advisable that the work be undertaken and carried on one of these two ways (either of which he thinks will be less chargeable and less liable to be obstructed), namely: First by continuing the old works in the same place and manner as formerly and employing 2000 sepoys to carry stones which may be thrown (without any great exactness) in the mouth of the Great Breach. He observes that the hills on each side being very rocky, he can easily break them with the force of gunpowder so as to afford a sufficient supply of stones and if the number of sepoys before mentioned are so employed, he thinks it cannot fail of success notwithstanding the great breadth and depth of water and the force with which it comes in. Captain Johnson's other proposal, which he says will be more expensive but subject to no hazard of succeeding, is to cut a channel of 100 feet broad and 7 feet deep or thereabout quite across the island in a direct line from the mouth of the breach to the north side of the hill by M\u00e1zgaon. And because the water as it enters the breach immediately spreads itself upwards of 3700 feet, namely from the point of the little hill on the north side to the foot of Malab\u00e1r Hill, and so on all spring tides spreads wider and wider as it is forced forwards, to draw this great breadth of water into the narrow compass of the channel, he proposes that walls be built from the two hills aforesaid, to confine the water and bring it into the channel. These are Captain Johnson's methods which we apprehend lie open to these objections: First we doubt it is but too certain there can be no hopes of stopping the water at the mouth of the Breach where it comes in on all spring tides with a very great rapidity and besides the channel is now worn so deep as to render fruitless all such efforts. The objection against his other proposal seems to us equally strong, namely: If a wall must be built to bring the water into the channel (which in such case is certainly true; other-\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 1 of 1720, 40. Forrest's Home Series, II, 6.\nwise the water will spread on each side of it), then that wall may as well be carried on the other 100 feet and thereby save the expense of cutting about two miles of ground of which a great part is very rocky. Thus it appears to us that Captain Bates' scheme is preferable to either of Captain Johnson's proposals.\n\nOn receipt of this report on the 24th May 1720 a Consultation records: According to an order of Council of the 13th ultimo, Messrs. Brown, Courtney, Midford, and Phillipps deliver in their report of Captain Bates' scheme for stopping the Great Breach. The President first acquaints the Board that he had brought Captain Bates to accept of a Rs. 6000 gratuity, though in his proposals he had demanded Rs. 10,000. After some debate it was agreed that, as it has been so often recommended to us by our Honourable Masters and will be of the greatest advantage to them when completed, we set about the filling of the Breach as soon as the season will permit. Further for more frugal and effectual carrying on the work it is ordered that Messrs. Braddyll, Brown, and Phillipps be appointed to buy all the materials, pay the workmen, and inspect into and manage the whole affair.\n\nIn connection with this Resolution the Surat Diary of the 2nd July 1720 records: The President and Council write in their letter of the 14th June that Messrs. Braddyll, Brown, and Phillipps being managers of the work of the Great Breach, we are to supply them what they write for. It is further added: Received a letter of the 14th June from the gentlemen managers of the works of the Breaches, who indent for 1000 mans jagri (raw sugar) and 300,000 tiles to be sent them as soon as the monsoon is over and recommend the procuring ten large shibars of 400 to 600 khandis.\n\nOn the 13th August 1720, Mr. Braddyll represents to the Board that the office of Chief Justice and a close application to the accountant's work employ him so fully that he has not time to give the due attention that is required as manager of stopping the Great Breach, and begs leave to be excused from that employment. The Board agree that his request be granted.\n\nAt the same Consultation, 13th August 1720, the account submitted by the managers for stopping the Great Breach of disbursements for the month of June, paid in July, showed that the total amounted to Rs. 4542-0.25. The records show that during the remaining months of the monsoon, sums varying from Rs. 1266 to Rs. 1842 were spent on the Breach works.\n\nIn 1726, the Directors impress on the Board the necessity of carefully checking any damage after the work is complete.\n\n---\n\n1 Pub.

This experience demonstrates the necessity of a good sloping for the security of that work. As, until such a slope is completed, the dam will be subject to damage every spring during the rainy season, some provision for its ready repair and for progress with the sloping seems absolutely necessary. At the same time our Honourable Masters' orders, received by the Duke of Cumberland, that all expense on the Vellard should cease raise the question how far we can undertake the necessary repairs. After consideration it is decided that, especially after the orders of 1726, to fail to repair and protect the dam with a slope would result in such serious waste that any risk of censure must be run. It is therefore resolved that such an expense be continued as shall be thought necessary for the preservation of the dam until the work be secured.\\(^2\\)\n\nSix months later, 3rd January 1729, it is recorded: The President the Honourable Mr. W. Phipps acquaints the Board that, when the work of the Great Breach was in danger of receiving considerable damage at the setting in of the last rains, to encourage the Sangarian prisoners to be active for preserving the work, he did promise to give them their liberty. And as they are of more expense to the Company than the value of their work comes to, he recommends it to his successor the Honourable Mr. R. Cowan and the rest of the gentlemen of Council to release them when they shall think proper.\\(^3\\)\n\nAt a Consultation of the 6th October 1738 the Board observe: In order to ascertain and improve the revenue arising to our Honourable Masters from the said recovered ground, and that the inhabitants may be encouraged to till more of it by settling the rent on some certain easy terms, it is ordered that the vereadores and matras (mihat\u00e1ras) do in the fair season survey and make report to us of the produce dimension and boundary of each piece of ground already occupied and by whom, that they may take leases at a reasonable rent for a certain number of years to be then renewed and the rent advanced according as the produce of the ground shall be found to afford. And the term of the lease of sundry salt batty grounds in the district of Mahim being expired, it is ordered that the vereadores and matras of the district do make the like survey and report of those grounds to the end above mentioned.\\(^4\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Pub.

At the same time Government issued out a publication giving notice thereof. But during the term limited in the said publication not one appeared to make me any offers. I have since used my utmost endeavours to induce the Kunbis of the several villages round us to undertake the whole or some part of the same, but with very little effect. To this day I have been able to prevail on them to engage for a very small parcel only at the rate the former was let at, they making indeed very reasonable objections. For your Honour's better understanding I shall here give a state of the whole.\n\nSince your order to me 1440 square yards have been let to the Kunbis at four res each, that is Rs. 14-1-60 a year. 7880 square yards computed to be yet under water and some part very deep, if drained and let at the above rate would amount to Rs. 78-3-20. But then the making two more flood gates in the valade at Warli, which is the only method to carry off the said water, will probably cost the Honourable Company more money than this land will yield in a great number of years. Your Honour will therefore judge after getting it computed whether it may be worth while to be at the expense. I cannot say what it may amount to as I am no judge of such calculations. 5960 square yards is so very bad and full of chunam stone as not to be rendered fit for cultivation without a great expense to undertakers; so that I apprehend nobody will undertake it at any rate. Notwithstanding the above objections I shall not be wanting in my further endeavours for letting what part is possible.\u00b2\n\nOn this report, at a Consultation of the 15th May 1741, the Board order Mr. Marsh to cause an estimate to be made of the charge of constructing two new flood gates at Warli, and to lay the estimate before the Board for their final determination.\u00b3\n\nAt a Consultation on the 10th of July 1741 the Board observe: Mr. Thomas Marsh, who, in our Consultation of the 15th May, was appointed to procure the best information of the expense incident to the opening two more passages with proper flood gates at Warli sluice, represents the impossibility of procuring competent judges at Mahim to form\n\n\u00b9 Pub.

Ordered that so soon as the season will permit our Engineer assisted by R\u00e1mji and Gamb\u00e1ji Purvoes do proceed to inspect the place and make an estimate of the sum required for that work.\n\nOn the management of this reclaimed land a Consultation of the 18th June 1742 has the following: The amount outstanding to the 31st July 1741 was Rs. 282-1-90 among which list several persons appear poor and insolvent. In the rains the water from the high ground which formerly passed through the work at the Breach occasions a great quantity of water to lie within which overflows the adjacent low land and renders it impracticable to tillage. Nor can this be otherwise remedied than by deepening and widening the channel leading to the sluice at Warli. This being of a considerable extent will cost a large sum, though, unless the Warli sluice is improved, the work of the Breach must in time be injured and the ground contiguous be irrecoverably lost; for through the saltiness entering the land nothing will grow. Besides the prementioned batty grounds out of Malab\u00e1r Breach in charge of Francisco D'Penha there are others with Augustine D'Mello and which did to the 31st July 1741 make a balance to be due of Rs. 524-3-46 the obtaining whereof must be attended to and the account drawn out to the 31st July 1742 in the manner done last year.\n\nOf the returns and management of the Customs Revenue the records between 1717 and 1744 contain the following details. On the 21st February 1717 the Court write to Bombay: We find in your Consultation of the 16th February (1715) that among other regulations settled for the custom master in collecting the customs, one is that goods traversed in the road or exported again for want of being sold at Bombay in three months, shall pay but half customs; that goods in quantity do not pay custom till all or part are sold; but if they are not sold in three months, then they are to be valued by two persons one on behalf of the owners, the other on ours. An entry of the 27th December following, where you speak of the Madras supercargoes and their ships' goods being undervalued from twenty-five to forty per cent, suggests that this valuation does not represent the full worth of the goods. We should be glad to find we do not rightly understand this fact, and must recommend to you to take effectual care that all goods on which a valuation is set are computed at near their true worth. And the rather because you know we condescended to lower the sea customs from five to three per cent for the greater encouragement of trade. If goods are underrated, we suffer yet worse, which will be a more disingenuous return than we could have supposed possible till we saw that entry. As to the other part of it, if we understand it rightly, for it is but oddly expressed, relating to the said supercargoes claiming an exemption from customs at Bombay by virtue of certificates that they have paid at Madras, we say we consider such trade to Bombay to be of the same nature with the trade to Surat; and as the supercargoes think it their interest, they choose either market. Still as the ports are\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Consultation 10th July 1741, Pub. Diary 14 of 1740-41, 247.\n2 Pub. Diary 15 of 1741-1742, 293-294.\nso near it is with a view to Surat they come to your side; though perhaps sometimes the tempestuous weather may force them into or keep them at Bombay. And as in our overland letter beforementioned we told you that if the Moghal had granted us to be custom free on paying Rs. 10,000 yearly *peshcash*, we would lay a duty of two per cent consulage on all goods imported into Surat by his Majesty's British subjects under our protection; and as that would prove a benefit to the said subjects, being less than what otherwise they must have paid, there can be no repining. As we have this season advised the Coast and Bay of it we now say that Madras and all other ships under our protection trading to Bombay, shall pay us the said consulage of two per cent.\\(^1\\)\n\nIn the same letter the Court continue: In your Consultation of the 30th July (1715) we find an order that all the Company's servants have liberty to import their liquors, wearing apparel, and necessaries for the immediate use of themselves and families custom free. This we do not approve and you should not have consented to it, considering that we have lowered the customs from five to three per cent. The rule of customs must be alike to all, and for that reason we did not think fit to allow Governor Pitt, when President of Fort St. George, his own liquor from England custom free, for the precedent's sake, though he paid five per cent there. Only in lieu we did allow him now and then a little surplus in tonnage outwards. He wrote us word that he paid there for all his liquor, because he would not set an ill example, and the same for other necessaries. Wherefore break this ill custom, and do not let it be in part or in whole revived.\\(^2\\)\n\nRegarding customs duties a Consultation of the 26th February 1720 records: Whereas the debate on the Order of Council made the 6th February 1718, that all goods belonging to persons living under the protection of the Company which have paid the duties of this island should be exported custom free to Surat or to any other port where the Right Honourable Company should enjoy that privilege, was on the 16th December last through multiplicity of business deferred for further consideration, the same was now resumed, and, on consideration that executing that order may be of very great advantage to our Honourable Masters by the encouragement it will give to trade and the consequent increase of revenues, the Board resolved that the said order be executed accordingly, and that no goods imported by such persons as aforesaid and paying the full duties of the island, shall pay any further custom to the Right Honourable Company either at Surat or at any port belonging to the great Moghal on this side India from the 1st of January last.\\(^3\\)\n\nThe same Consultation, 26th February 1720, continues: The Right Honourable Company having directed in the 8th paragraph of their\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Court to Bombay 21st Feb. 1717 para 69.

For the further encouragement of the trade of this port ordered that whatever goods shall be exported from Surat and the other ports abovesaid and paying the said duty of two per cent, shall, on their being imported here, after the term the customs are now farmed to R\u00e1ma K\u00e1m\u00e1t\u00ed expires, have the said duty reckoned in part of the duties of this port.\n\nAt a Consultation, the 25th July 1720, the Board observe: As the additional duty of two per cent towards carrying on the war against K\u00e1nhoji Angria ceases the 31st instant the Honourable President moves the Board to consider whether or no we shall continue it another year. After some debate the same was referred to our next meeting. The 30th July 1720 the consideration of the same subject was resumed. The Diary of that date records: The debate whether the two per cent additional duty towards carrying on the war against K\u00e1nhoji Angria and for finishing and repairing the Church shall be continued or not, was this day resumed. After some time spent in arguments pro and con, in consideration that, after the full customs have been paid here, if the goods are sent to Surat or Cambay, they must pay a consulage of two per cent more, so that in boats in which chiefly consists the trade of this place the whole will amount to nine per cent namely:\n\n| Customs | ... | ... | ... | 3 per cent. |\n|---------|-----|-----|-----|------------|\n| Additional War Duty | ... | ... | ... | 2 per cent. |\n| Contribution to the Town Wall and Church | ... | ... | ... | 2 per cent. |\n| Custom at Surat or Cambay | ... | ... | ... | 2 per cent. |\n\nTotal ... 9 per cent.\n\nAnd at the earnest desire and representation of the principal inhabitants, and from our own experience that the customs did amount to near as much when at three per cent as since at five, it is resolved that, for the further encouragement of the trade of this port, the duty of 1\u00bd per cent towards carrying on the war against K\u00e1nhoji Angria be taken off and only the half per cent for repairing the Church be continued, which will be a great means to induce merchants to try this market first. Ordered that the Secretary draw out a proclamation accordingly. On the 1st August 1720 the proclamation was published by beat of drum as usual.\n\nAt the close of the year 1720 to meet additional expenditure a fresh duty was ordered to be levied. A Consultation of the 16th December records: The President proposes to the Board, in consequence of the great expense our Honourable Masters are at in fitting out fleets to go in search of the pirates and other pickeruns on this coast, and that\n\n---\n\n1 Bom.

And as the Honourable the President will pay a greater proportion of this duty than any one person in India, we think it sufficient motive to prevent any of the traders from shewing the least uneasiness on this account. Resolved therefore that we order the Chiefs of our subordinate settlements to collect it and that a proclamation be made here accordingly.\n\nAt the same Consultation, 16th December 1720, the following instructions were issued to Owen Phillip Esq. of Council, Commissary and Agent of Persia: The Right Honourable Company being at a very great expense to protect from Kanhoji Angria and other pickeruns on this coast the commerce of all subjects of England who trade to these parts by their license, we have thought fit to lay on all such shipping as should import here or at Surat a tax of one rupee a ton to alleviate that heavy charge as it is absolutely necessary a warlike force should always be kept up for that purpose. We now direct for the time to come the same duty be collected on every English ship trading to Gombroon. If the supracargoes or masters refuse to comply therewith, let the duty be stopped out of what money of theirs comes into your hand.\n\nOn the 22nd March 1722 the Court write: In answer to paragraph 28 of the 11th May we say that for the encouragement of trade at Bombay we are content that such goods as are brought thither but designed for the Surat market, and which do pay custom at Bombay, shall be excused the two per cent payable at Surat so as they be sent up thither in twelve months.

On the 4th October 1734 it is further recorded: The churchwardens requesting that the half per cent duty for the last year being Rs. 8893-0-60 may be paid to them pursuant to a resolution of Council of the 18th January last, the same being received into the treasury, it is agreed that we comply with their request and the President is desired to discharge it accordingly. And as sundry necessary repairs have lately been given to Parel house, it is likewise agreed that the amount of said duty for the next year be applied for clearing of the same.\n\nWith the object of securing a regular account of the Bombay customs the Court in their letter of the 2nd August 1739 write: Our President and Council of Fort St. George send us annually a regular book of customs for all goods and grain imported at that place inserting therein the importer's name, the particular parcels of goods, and by what ship, together with the value of each species, and the customs on every entry made. We direct that the like accounts for the whole year ending the last of November be sent us annually from your place, drawn out in a careful and accurate manner, attested by the custom master.\n\nA Consultation of the 30th January 1741 records: In the Bombay custom master's account it is noticed that a shroff more than formerly is charged at Rs. 6 the month. As the custom-master assures the Board the shroff is absolutely necessary to examine the money received, it is agreed to continue the extra shroff at that allowance.\n\nRegarding the imposition of a customs import duty on grain a Consultation of the 2nd January 1742 records: Understanding that according to a former indulgence the English merchants are exempted from paying duties upon whatever grain they import which we conceive must have proceeded from a scarcity that now there is not, it is directed that from this day a duty of 2\u00bd per cent be collected on all sorts of grain imported by the English from any of the neighbouring rivers as the risk from those places hither is very small. But in consideration of the risk attending the transportation of this commodity from more distant parts the same privilege be still continued.\n\nOn the 8th March 1742 Mr. Geekie writes to Government: According to the standing orders the duties on all goods imported are to be paid in two months' time and on all goods exported in one month. Hitherto the principal merchants have been indulged with a forbearance till the 31st of July when they make up their accounts for the whole year, and it is generally the middle of October (sometimes later) before the whole is collected which amounts on an average of the last seven years' accounts for the month of July to Rs. 58,094-3-64.\n\n---\n\n1 Bom.

The truth of this I believe everybody that trades is acquainted with and that this indulgence can be no detriment to the Company provided no bad debts are thereby incurred. On which account I desire the Board will direct what merchants the custom-master may in future have leave to credit for the whole year out of those who have hitherto enjoyed that indulgence.\\(^1\\) On the 23rd March the Board considered so long a trust as one year to many merchants for the amount of their customs to be attended with hazard, and referred the matter to the Court. In the meantime the Board allowed the common method in practice to go on except in the case of N\u00e1g\u00e1r L\u00e1lji and Lakhmichand Govind who were ordered to pay ready money.\\(^2\\)\n\nAt a Consultation of the 16th March 1744 the Board read the following petition from certain Moormen, inhabitants of Bombay, to the Bombay Government: At the time a clearance was made round the Town Wall your petitioners were ordered to rebuild their houses and warehouses by the seven Brab Trees near unto the Hill of M\u00e1\u017agaon. This being so much further from the town than their former habitation the late Governor Law indulged them to bring their boats laden with batty and wood to that place where a chawki and some sepoys were appointed to take an account of what they imported reporting the same to the Custom House. This was intended to save your petitioners an extraordinary expense of carriage hire; but as the same indulgence is now discontinued, your petitioners are greatly prejudiced as well by loss of time as by the great expense incurred in carriage. Your petitioners beg leave further to represent that in the time of Governor Aislalie (1708-1715) they paid a ground rent of only two to six l\u00f3ris each house, but after building the Town Wall, they were ordered to pay a certain rent for each yard which they submitted to, as their habitations were so near the wall, esteeming this a protection. Seeing they are now removed to so great a distance, they hope for some abatement in the said rent. After considering this petition the Board resolve that, as such a permission may give great opportunities for fraud, the same is rejected. They add: Nor do we see any good reasons for complying with the other part of the petition for an abatement of the ground rent the petitioners now pay. The present ground rent must therefore be continued.\\(^3\\)\n\nA Consultation of the 28th August 1744 records: There being no public orders affixed for collecting the customs since July 1740, it is\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The names of the merchants in enjoyment of the concession are: Shivji Dharamset, Keshavram Vithald\u00e1s, R\u00e1md\u00e1s Rupji, Kharsedji Hirji Modi, N\u00e1rand\u00e1s Santok, Rupji Dhanji, Ambaid\u00e1s Takidas, Manekji Navroji, Banna Limji, R\u00e1ms\u00e9t Gamb\u00e1s\u00e9t, N\u00e1g\u00e1r L\u00e1lji, Dhanji Gop\u00e1l, Gang\u00e1d\u00e1s Rupji, Fr\u00e1mji Baman Jiva, Lakhmanset Lakhmichand.

A new set of orders is therefore drawn up and read examined and approved. The details of the new set of orders are:\n\nDuties to be collected by the Bombay Custom Master on importation by Europeans. All sorts of merchandise except those undermentioned shall pay four and a half per cent, namely:\n\n- **Bombay Customs** ... ... ... 3 per cent.\n- **The Town Ditch** ... ... ... 1 per cent.\n- **The New Custom House** ... ... ... \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) per cent.\n\nFor any goods afterwards exported to Surat or Cambay the Custom Master shall grant certificates.

All goods except grain exported from the Revani Panvel and Kalyan rivers not landed at Bombay but carried out in the same vessel to pay three and a half per cent; all goods exported from Bandra to pay whole duties in Bombay. Salt exported from Karanja one rupee the r\u00fas or heap and from Trombay two rupees the heap.\n\nDuties to be paid at Bombay Custom House by black merchants on importation: All goods imported in three-mast vessels except the undermentioned to pay four and a half per cent; Bombay customs 3 per cent; the Town Ditch 1 per cent; the new Custom House \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) per cent.

If designed to be carried to Surat or Cambay, the Custom Master to give a certificate of their having paid the duties. If through any accident the necessity arises of landing goods, which were not designed for this market, application must be made to the President and Council who will give proper orders with respect to the duties.\nChapter VIII.\nRevenue and Finance.\n\nCustoms Duties, 1744.\n\nJewels and plate custom free. Inland merchants called Vanj\u00e1ras if their goods are sold here to pay five and a half per cent; onions from B\u00e1ndra two per cent; additional duty on pepper from the coast three rupees a khandi. All goods weighed and measured at the Custom House to pay a quarter per cent. Cotton imported from Jambusar to pay four and a half per cent; if from Surat and declared for exportation no duty; if sold here to pay two and a half per cent; timber three per cent.\n\nDuty to be paid at Bombay Custom House by black merchants on exportation: Grain of all sorts and timber five per cent; the inland merchants called Vanj\u00e1ras to pay no customs if the goods they buy are exported in eight days. Boats sold to foreign merchants to pay six per cent; salt twenty per cent; cocoanuts nine per cent on the Company's sale rate; kepra or cocoa-kernel, coir, dry fish kuta, cajans, country arrack, and iron wrought in Bombay to pay nine per cent; country redlead two and a half per cent; redlead prepared in Bombay two and a half per cent; every boat of fish called buckshaw half a rupee; grain in general exported out of any of the rivers and not landed at Bombay but carried out in the same vessel to pay eight per cent, namely five per cent custom, one per cent to the Town Ditch, and two per cent to the Town Wall.\n\nAll goods, except grain exported out of Revani Panvel and Kaly\u00e1n rivers, not landing at Bombay but carried out in the same vessel to pay five and a half per cent. All goods exported from B\u00e1ndra to pay whole duties. Cloth made on Bombay to pay two and a half per cent. Salt exported from Karanja one rupee the r\u00e1s or heap and from Trombay two rupees the r\u00e1s. All goods carried in Bombay boats from foreign ports to Bassein Chaul or any of the adjacent places to pay six and a half per cent.\n\nThe following retail duties on liquors are classed under customs:\n\n- 15 rupees the hogshead on Goa arrack.\n- 1 rupee the dozen on all wines.\n- 5 rupees the chest on Persian wine.\n- 5 rupees the case on Europe Drams.\n- \u00bd rupee a dozen on brandy and beer.\n\nThe following reasons for the changes are appended. The second article in the former orders for charging half customs on goods sent to Surat or Cambay is omitted, as producing a certificate from the Custom Master will show that the merchant has paid the full customs here and consequently will not be charged with the duty of two per cent either at Surat or Cambay. One per cent for the ditch is charged on all goods except tobacco. Tobacco is excused paying until the expiration of the present lease. If it is then thought proper, the said duty for the ditch may be added as on other goods. Within the last four years two per cent has been ordered to be collected on grain from the rivers as there was reason to suspect that some of our own people fathered grain belonging to foreign merchants. The duty on goods transported from ship to ship affects Europeans but little. Yet it is made a very bad use of by the black merchants who often pretend that their goods are to be transported from one vessel to another for a foreign market, notwithstanding a fair sale has been made and the property actually transferred. Besides as many goods are now sent in this manner to Gogha, Jambusar, and other ports where the Honourable Company receives no duties, there is a considerable loss which would not be the case if as formerly Surat and Cambay were the chief markets. The last article in the former orders for exporting goods custom-free, if designed for a foreign market, and if exported within three months' time, is of a late date. If strictly observed, the customs\non Bombay would be very trifling, as much the greatest part of the goods imported is again sent off the island generally within three months of importation. Indeed, if goods which were not designed for this market are landed through an accident, the President and Council will permit their export custom-free as was at all times practised. As the Bengal gentlemen have ordered cotton for some years past from Surat to be lodged for them at this place, where ships can call for it in the wet monsoon which they cannot safely do at Surat, their paying an additional duty here would not only be a discouragement to trade having before paid the usual duties at Surat, but it would prevent their touching here at that time of the year. This would certainly be a prejudice to the customs, as they always bring some goods to dispose of.\n\nThe records between 1720 and 1744 contain many references to the management and farming of cocoanut trees which at that time yielded the most important item of land revenue.\n\nA Consultation of the 30th September 1720 records: This day being appointed for renting the Right Honourable Company's cocoanut trees of Bombay and Mahim, all the merchants and principal inhabitants being present, the same were put up at 2\u00bd larees (9\u00bd as.) a year for nine years. No one advancing thereon and Mr. Midford offering to take them at that price, the Board resolved that they be farmed to him and the Secretary is hereby ordered to draw out articles accordingly.\n\nA Consultation of the 10th July 1724 records: Bala Krishna Kamaati the overseer of the Honourable Company's oarts, brings in his accounts of the year's produce ending the 23rd March last (1724). They are laid before the Board amounting to Rs. 12,376-3-33; also his account charges for repairing of the wells wheels and walls, amounting to Rs. 5659-2-82; and the balance being Rs. 6717-0-41, is paid into the treasury. From all this the Board observes there is an increase in the produce of cocoanuts of near 25 per cent on the preceding year, namely the produce from 24th March 1723 to 23rd March 1724 is 409,499, while the preceding year's produce, that is from 24th March 1722 to 23rd March 1723, was 328,300, that is an increase of 81,199 cocoanuts. His account charges are likewise observed to increase by a large number of new wheels, a greater quantity of kuta or fish manure being used, and by putting the oarts in repair which through long neglect have gone greatly to ruin. The overseer being called in is further interrogated. He alleges that a greater part of the estate has been manured this season which required more kuta than usual, sufficient not being to be procured during the former year for that purpose; therefore more than half the estate remained unmanured. He likewise lays before us a list of... new wheels necessary to be made the ensuing season. This increases the charges Rs. 1000 to Rs. 1500 more than in the present year, but that the charges will then considerably decrease. It appears likewise from his list of the improvement of young trees made in Bombay and Mahim the\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 17 of 1744, 256-263.\n2 Bom. Gov.

B\u00e9la Krishna K\u00e1m\u00e1ti the overseer, Dalba Bhand\u00e1ri, and sundry of the vereadores and mh\u00e1t\u00e1r\u00e1s of Bombay and M\u00e1him, appearing according to summons, are examined thereon. Though we find them differ in opinion, we judge from their reasoning that it will be most for the Honourable Company's interest to let the oarts to farm. The rendeiros or farmers nevertheless should be under the inspection of the Honourable Company's overseer to secure that they take care of the trees and of the several young plants conformable to the custom of the town. Whereas many of the oarts have a large number of empty spaces now preparing to be planted it is agreed that such oarts be proportioned and lotted into several parcels, a good and a bad oart together, and be set up at public sale on the 29th instant. Directed that public notice be given accordingly.\n\nThe next day's Diary records: Gave public notice that the Honourable Company's oarts would be put to sale the 29th instant pursuant to yesterday's resolution.\n\nAccordingly on the 29th September 1724 the oarts were set up to farm. The proceedings are thus recorded in the Diary of that date: This meeting being appointed to set to farm the Right Honourable Company's oarts in Bombay and M\u00e1him and the vereadores pursuant to our directions having divided them into 80 lots for the better and readier putting them to auction as appears by the list thereof now before us, wherein the Board observes the Bombay trees are separated from those in M\u00e1him for the convenience of the inhabitants of either place. In Bombay and M\u00e1him the number of trees good indifferent and espigadas or spike-bearers that is the first year of blossoming, are at present 22,315, namely:\n\n| District | Good | Indifferent | Espigadas | Total |\n|----------|------|-------------|-----------|-------|\n| Bombay   | 5267 | 2093        | 450       | 7810  |\n| M\u00e1him    | 9948 | 3410        | 1147      | 14,505|\n\nTotal ... 22,315\n\n---\n\n1 Bom.

The gardens also contain 16,750 vacancies, 68 brabs, 251 betelnut trees, 937 mango trees, 188 jacks, and 197 lime trees. There are likewise 298 wheels for drawing of water in good repair, 128 more wanting, and 75 wells to be repaired.\n\nThis being the present state of the Honourable Company's oarts, the President observes to the Board that the cocoanut trees at Bombay have always been preferred to those at Mahim, besides which they are now in their prime, most of them having been planted since the Sidi war (1690), whereas those at Mahim are in general old and almost gone to decay. That the Honourable Company's estate there will not be valuable in proportion to the Bombay estate for six or seven years to come when the young plants will be in perfection. From this he concludes it will not be proper to let the Mahim trees to farm separate from the Bombay. He therefore proposes as the course most conducive to our Honourable Masters' interest that for their first seven years all the oarts in Bombay and Mahim be let out together to some substantial persons in partnership if there are any who are willing to farm them in that manner and will give what we may think reasonable. To this the Board unanimously agrees, and the Portuguese Secretary is sent to give notice to the people attending without that we had found reason to alter our resolution for putting the oarts up in parcels, and that we were now resolved to let them to such a Junto, as would agree to take the whole on the terms we should think reasonable and that we expect their answer in half an hour. Ambaidas appearing in behalf of Pasqual Bareito and Pandu Sinay and agreeing to the price the President had fixed of three larees a tree for the Mahim and five larees for the Bombay oarts it is unanimously resolved that the Right Honourable Company's oarts in Bombay and Mahim be let to them accordingly, and that we consider of further necessary articles and conditions for the farmers against our next meeting.\u00b9\n\nAccordingly the Honourable Company's oarts at Bombay and Mahim were let out on the following conditions to Pasqual Bareito Fazandar, and Pandu Sinay Mugaro both considerable landed men on this island, Ambaidas Takidas being broker:\n\n1. That they shall accept of the same according to the present rent-roll of good, indifferent, and espigadas, namely Bombay 7855, Mahim 14,698, in all 22,553 cocoanut trees to allow five larees a year for each tree at Bombay and three larees for each tree at Mahim, to grant them a lease for the same for seven years beginning from the 1st day of October 1724 and ending the 30th September 1731; the Honourable Company to have the benefit of this separate gathering as they (the farmers) are to have of the gathering at the expiration of the lease.\n\n2. But though the said farmers accept of the espigadas in the present rent-roll at the instigation of the President and Council, this is contrary to custom which never brings espigadas on the rent-roll till the third year after blossoming. It is therefore agreed that espigadas shall not be brought on the rent-roll but according to custom three years after blossoming.\n\n\u00b9 Bom. Gov. Consultation 29th Sept. 1724, Pub.

All plants that are or shall be planted in those carts until they are entered on the rent-roll are to be manured with fish at the charge of the Honourable Company, but the farmers to give them as much water as the overseer shall require. For such trees as are entered on the roll the farmers are to be at the whole charge of manuring with kuta, putting to each tree a sufficient quantity and to take care the same be mixed with earth and buried according to the proclamation to prevent any offensive smell; otherwise to be liable to the penalty.\n\n4. The President and Council, on behalf of the Honourable Company, agree to be at the charge of putting into good order the wells wheels and waterways necessary for and appertaining to the several oarts on the farmers' entering thereon, which they on their part agree to keep and deliver in good order at the expiration of this lease.\n\n5. It is likewise agreed that such enclosures as are necessary for the young plants and such as are transplanted shall be made good at the charge of the Honourable Company, which enclosures the farmers agree to keep in repair during the term of their lease, and in case any damage happens by neglect thereof they agree to make ample satisfaction.\n\n6. The said farmers are to admit of such a number of trees as are customary to be rented to the farmers of the arrack of which the overseer is to keep a list.\n\n7. The farmers are at all times to admit the Honourable Company's overseer to view and inspect the oarts as well that they may be duly managed as to take cognisance of those trees to be entered on the roll, one list of which to be delivered yearly into Council.\n\n8. In case, through storms or other accidents not owing to the neglect of the farmers, any trees shall be destroyed or totally decayed during the term of this lease, the farmers shall not be charged with such in their rent, they giving from time to time notice to the overseer when such damage happens.\n\n9. The said farmers are to be served with kuta from the several cooleries on the island in the same manner the Honourable Company's were supplied before letting the oarts to farm; and in case sufficient kuta is not to be had on the island, so much more as they import for the service of the said oarts shall be custom free.\n\n10. In consideration of the price they have farmed the trees at and including those which are at present espigadas, the President and Council agree that the farmers shall have the benefit of all the brab betelnut and other fruit trees; this concession is not to become a precedent in future.\n\n11. The rent the said farmers are to pay after the rate of reckoning 5\u00bd larees to the rupee to be made either in gold or silver, and paid every four months to the collector of the revenues, the President and Council, however, agreeing to indulge the said farmers as has been customary being two payments in arrear to be made good at the expiration of their lease.\n\n12. The collector of the revenues and overseer of the oarts are to be aiding and assisting to the farmers for recovering of their debts on account of any contracts made relating to renting out their oarts or selling their cocoanuts.\n\n13. Larcenies from the oarts shall be severely punished when the offender is found.\n\n14. If the farmers shall suspect where any stolen cocoanuts are lodged, on their making application they shall be permitted a guard to search such places.\n\n15. All shopkeepers or any others that shall be convicted to have bought or received stolen cocoanuts, or all in whose houses shops or habitations stolen cocoanuts are found shall be subjected to such corporal punishment as the Government shall think fit to inflict on them, besides a penalty; they shall pay for every such offence Rs. 500 to be distributed: Rs. 100 to the informer, Rs. 200 towards erecting a new custom house, and Rs. 200 to the said farmer.\n\n16.

The Secretary explains to them the conditions of sale, namely that the cocoanuts both of Bombay and M\u00e1him are to be set up at the same price and the amount of the whole is to be paid by the purchaser, who is to be the highest bidder, at or before the 31st of July next ensuing, the cocoanuts to be delivered by the Company's overseer as they are gathered and as the purchaser may require.

In order to encourage them and employ them in that manner the said Esu N\u00e1ik proposes to rent for the term of seven years betwixt 300 and 400 cocoanut trees belonging to the Honourable Company, situated within the town walls, at a certain yearly rent for each tree. As the said Bhand\u00e1ris are highly deserving of encouragement being not only laborious and industrious in their occupation but likewise bred to the service of arms and ready on all occasions, it is agreed that the said Esu N\u00e1ik have betwixt 300 and 400 trees for the term of seven years at the usual rent of 4\u00bd larees for every tree or three-quarters of a rupee silver money or sixty pice in pice money. That they shall deliver up the said trees at the end of the sixth year in the same good condition that they received them, but shall pay the said rent for the term of seven years complete as is more particularly expressed in the conditions of this farm; and that the said rents shall be punctually paid in quarterly payments. Directed that Antonio de Silva, overseer of the Company's oarts, give in an account to this Board on Friday next the 29th instant of the exact number of trees that can be spared for this service, and that a lease be prepared to be executed by the said Esu N\u00e1ik conformable to this our Resolution.\\(^4\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Pub.

Forrest's House Series, II, 50.\nAgreeably to the above order a week later, 27th April 1733, Antonio de Silva, overseer of the Honourable Company's carts, brings in a report of the number of cocoanut trees situated within the Town Wall which were designed to be let at rent to Esu Naik Mukadam of the Bhandaris for accommodating and employing some families of that caste of people that were desirous of coming from Chaul to reside on this island. The Board observe: By the said report it appears that no more unemployed cocoanut trees are within the town wall than 111, and as these are dispersed in sundry carts and stations amongst other trees already let to Bhandaris, we cannot let the said 111 trees as was proposed to Esu Naik for any term of years at a certain annual rent. Yet as we are desirous of accommodating, as well as we can, such families of Bhandaris as are actually come upon the island on account of the encouragement given them, it is agreed that Antonio de Silva, overseer of the carts, do let the said 111 trees to the said Bhandaris at the usual prices such other trees are let for, and that the produce of the same be entered in his annual account.\n\nA Consultation of the 31st August 1733 records: This being the day appointed for setting up to public sale the Honourable Company's cocoanuts of Bombay and Mahim and sundry merchants attending the doors are thrown open and they are called in. The Secretary then explains to them the conditions of sale, namely that the cocoanuts both of Bombay and Mahim are to be put at the same price and the amount of the whole to be paid by the purchaser who is to be the highest bidder at or before the 31st July next ensuing, the cocoanuts to be delivered by the Company's overseer as they are gathered and as the purchaser may require. Navroji Rustamji and Sivaji Dharamset appear to be the highest bidders at Rs. 22\u00bd per thousand of 1100 cocoanuts.\n\nThe Diary of the 13th September 1734 records: Having appointed this day for the sale of the Honourable Company's cocoanuts produced in their carts at Bombay and Mahim and sundry merchants attending they are called in and acquainted that the terms of sale are the same as hitherto customary, namely the cocoanuts of Bombay and Mahim to be sold at the same price, eleven hundred to be allowed for a thousand, and the amount to be paid by the 31st July next, with this additional article that the buyer be obliged to take the whole quantity from the overseer of the carts before the 10th May next. When being put up to public sale, Revadas Ambaidas appears to be the highest bidder at the rate of Rs. 24\u00bd a thousand the highest price ever given.\n\nTowards the close of 1735 (November 1st) the Bhandaris presented the following petition to Government praying for a reduction of their rent: The humble petition of all the inhabiting Bhandaris of Bombay and Mahim humbly sheweth that whereas when this island first passed under the Government of His Britannic Majesty there lived on it a certain number of Bhandaris of the caste called Ambatias; and soon\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Consultation 27th April 1733, Pub. Diary 5 of 1732-33, 108.\n2 Pub. Diary 5 of 1732-33, 184.\n3 Bom. Gov. Consultation 13th Sept. 1734, Pub. Diary 7 of 1734, 157.\nafter from the neighbouring countries others of the castes Quitas (Kit\u00e1s) and Shindas came likewise to live on the island; all being encouraged to fix their dwellings here by the permission they had of drawing toddy and distilling arrack without any acknowledgment save the duty of defending the island and keeping up out of their tribe at the door of the Governor's house a small guard or chauki. The guard was a regular allotment of men for every day in the week who entered upon duty from the hours of nine in the morning to eleven and from three in the afternoon to five. When the Government passed into the hands of the Honourable Company the above disposition continued without any alteration for about seven years. The Government then intimated to the Bhand\u00e1ris that for the better security and effect of the privileges and favours granted them, and to assure them the necessary use of the palmiras which the fazand\u00e1s had often refused them, they should pay a small acknowledgment for the liberty of drawing toddy and distilling arrack. The Bhand\u00e1ris did accordingly oblige themselves to an annual certain payment of something more than Xs. 200. From that time the said sum was raised by a general cess at a reasonable rate by their muk\u00e1dam chaughul\u00e1s and p\u00e1t\u00edls who were made answerable for the same and annually paid it into the treasury. But as the headmen from time to time proceeded to impose heavier rates, Government ordered there should be an annual renter or farmer, but without prejudice to the exemption from payment enjoyed by their muk\u00e1dam chaughul\u00e1s and p\u00e1t\u00edls. They were therefore still obliged to assist the renter in distributing the amount of the rent into reasonable rates and proportions that the poorer might not be oppressed or suffer. After the Bhand\u00e1ris had behaved with that courage zeal and fidelity which it is notorious they shewed in the defence of the island when it was invaded by the Sidis, as a reward for their services on that occasion, the Government was pleased to promise them an exemption from paying any rent for the future. The delays of successive Governors prevented this promise being carried into effect. Meanwhile the increase in population raised the price of toddy and arrack in proportion, and the strife and competition of the renters carried the price of the annual rent to such an excessive height that to indemnify themselves they did not, as had always been the custom, proceed to distribute the rates amongst the Bhand\u00e1ris with the advice and consent of their muk\u00e1dam chaughul\u00e1s and p\u00e1t\u00edls but took the whole into their hands, hindering the Bhand\u00e1ris from drawing toddy or distilling arrack. As this is all the Bhand\u00e1ris have to depend upon for their support and sustenance it leaves them entirely at the mercy and disposal of the farmer or renter for the time being. In time past their own muk\u00e1dam chaughul\u00e1s and p\u00e1t\u00edls being acquainted with the circumstances and necessities of the respective families used to proportion their allotments accordingly which for want of that\n\n---\n\n1 Ambatids, apparently sellers of sour \u00e1mbat toddy, is preserved in the surname \u00c1mbte; Kit\u00e1s, Hindu Bhand\u00e1ris from the south Konkan from Malvan as far north as Alib\u00e1g, claim Kita as a corruption of Khatri or Kshatriya; Shindas, probably slave-born Marath\u00e1s, are Hindu Bhand\u00e1ris from Bassein, most of whom are tappers of brab trees, a few of cocoanut trees, but none of date trees; Gaur Bhand\u00e1ris are from Bassein T\u00e1luka.\nknowledge the renters can never do with any certainty. By this means your petitioners are reduced to extreme poverty and misery for which no remedy other than the following appears:\n\nThe rent shall be reduced to the fixed sum of Rs. 10,000 a year under an agreement to be made betwixt the Government and your petitioners upon the following conditions:\n\n1. That your petitioners shall be obliged and bound jointly and separately for the yearly payment of Rs. 10,000 without doubt or delay, which the Honourable Company will order to be levied by receivers appointed at their pleasure, conformable to the list to be annually furnished by your petitioners.\n\n2. That the muk\u00e1dam chaughul\u00e1s and p\u00e1t\u00edls of your petitioners' castes shall be the persons authorized to distribute the said sum of Rs. 10,000 to be ceased in proportion among the different castes of Bhand\u00e1r\u00eds without any other person intermeddling; and these headmen shall furnish a list signed by themselves to direct the receivers in levying the sum aforesaid.\n\n3. That in case of the death or running away of any Bhand\u00e1r\u00ed the Government shall not make any abatement but shall recover the entire sum of Rs. 10,000. Similarly in case of any fresh Bhand\u00e1r\u00eds coming from other countries to live upon the island the new comers shall be incorporated with your petitioners and be rated by the muk\u00e1dam chaughul\u00e1s and p\u00e1t\u00edls to pay what they shall judge a reasonable proportion. And the Government shall not on account of the new Bhand\u00e1r\u00eds raise their claim above Rs. 10,000.\n\n4. That in consideration of the payment of the said sum of Rs. 10,000 your petitioners shall have full liberty to draw toddy from the palmairas, distill arrack phul and nippa, and sell arrack for the certain price of 4 pice the ser and one pice the measure of toddy without any necessity of further license or authority than that of the muk\u00e1dam chaughul\u00e1s and p\u00e1t\u00edls. In case your petitioners stand in need of more palmairas the Government shall supply them what it can on your petitioners' paying the same price which they now actually pay to the fazand\u00e1rs which is not to be altered.\n\n5. That in return for the great favour they shall in this manner receive from the Government in assisting and helping them to a livelihood your petitioners shall bind themselves to be ready on all occasions for the defence and service of the island with arms to be supplied them by the Government without pretending or requiring any other reward or pay except necessary provisions.\n\nIf these articles are agreed to, your petitioners may hope to be able to obtain a competent livelihood and be relieved from the great necessities and want to which they are at present actually reduced. These therefore your petitioners humbly submit to your Honours' consideration for such relief as your Honours shall judge fitting.\n\nOn the 1st November 1735 the President lays before the Board the above petition presented by the heads of the Bhand\u00e1r\u00eds, setting forth the difficulties they labour under through the excessive high rent paid for the arrack farm. The President also acquaints the Board that on discoursing with the heads of the said Bhand\u00e1r\u00eds he had with some difficulty prevailed on them to engage to give Rs. 12,000 a year for the sole liberty of selling toddy and arrack. He had thereupon sent for the present farmer to know if he was inclined to relinquish his contract, who, though he confessed that he had hitherto suffered by it, was in\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 1st Nov. 1735 Vol. 8 of 1734-35, 242-245, Forrest's Home Series, II, 66-68.\nhopes to retrieve his loss during the time remaining of his contract and therefore was unwilling to give it up. The Bhandaris being a very useful set of people and of all our inhabitants the most to be depended on in any exigency, they being of a military caste and having on several occasions behaved with courage, we should be very glad to preserve those already upon the island as well as encourage others to come and settle among us, as the increase of their number would tend to the better security of the place which during the time that our vessels are out, we are sorry to say, is but ill provided. The method now proposed will we hope not only prove effectual for that end but in our opinions is highly advantageous to our Honourable Masters. It is therefore unanimously agreed humbly to recommend the same to them for their concurrence; and by the time we receive their answer, the present contract will be expired. We must observe, continue the Board, that the rent was run up to such an extravagant height through a pique between two of the bidders. We therefore cannot expect it will let for so much the next time. And this we hope will have some weight towards obtaining our Honourable Masters' consent to an agreement that we are sincerely of opinion is so much for the true interest of this settlement.\n\nA week later, 7th November 1735, the overseer of the Honourable Company's oarts submits his accounts of charges thereon for the last year (1734-35) amounting to Rs. 4652-3-75\u00bd. The produce of the trees let to Bhandaris to draw toddy from and other fruit trees in the said oarts (exclusive of the cocoanuts sold) amounts to Rs. 4299-1-48.\n\nThe Bombay Diary of the 5th December 1735 has the following entry: Rupji Dhanji desiring to purchase an oart belonging to the Honourable Company, which, according to the ancient valuation made by the vereadores and which is generally esteemed about half the real worth, amounts to no more than Rs. 362. As the same is situated close by another oart belonging to himself Rupji is desirous of making improvements. For convenience sake he has offered as far as Rs. 1040 and as this is advantageous to the Honourable Company being more than the real worth of the oart, it is agreed to accept his offer.\n\nRegarding the yearly sale by public auction of the Company's cocoanuts a Consultation of the 30th July 1736 records: According to public notice several merchants attending to bid for the Honourable Company's cocoanuts they are called in and the terms of sale declared to be the same as last year, namely the produce of Bombay and Mahim to be put up together; the money to be paid on or before the 31st July next; and the purchaser, who is to be the highest bidder, to take all the cocoanuts from the overseer of the oarts before the 1st of May next. The oarts are then put up and Haribhai appears to be the highest bidder at Rs. 26\u00bd the thousand of eleven hundred nuts. Later\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Consultation 1st Nov. 1735, Pub.

Vithaldas Keshavram and Rupji Dhanji appear the highest bidders at Rs. 25\u00bd the thousand of 1100 nuts and they are accordingly declared the purchasers.\n\n1738.\n\nOn the 2nd March 1738 the Court direct that the overseer of the oarts should keep his accounts in English. And that instead of as formerly being brought in annually they should be produced monthly and examined by the Collector of the revenues before they are passed by the Board.\n\nCocoanuts, 1741.\n\nThe supply of the Company\u2019s cocoanuts for the season, that is from 1st May to 30th April next, was (15th August 1740) sold at public auction at Rs. 24\u00bd for one thousand of eleven hundred cocoanuts. The price at which the highest bid stood on 7th August 1741, at a similar sale for next year, was Rs. 26\u00be for 1000 of 1100 nuts.\n\nTrees Produce, 1740.\n\nA Consultation of the 26th September 1740 records: Read a letter from Mr. Richard Sanders overseer of the oarts representing the want of a safe lodgment for the security of the produce of the Honourable Company\u2019s trees in the district of Mahim. Mr. Sanders states that from the present method of trusting the cocoanuts in the houses of underservants they are liable to frequent pilferage and accidents by fire. He therefore requests permission to build a proper warehouse of sandstone and chunam. An estimate of its charge now presented amounts to Rs. 1875. The Board being convinced of the truth of this report, and that in a term of years such work may be a real saving to our Honourable Masters, it is ordered to be set about according to the plan laid down, and to prevent any imposition or overcharge, the Chief of Mahim for the time being is to have the overseeing and forwarding the same.\n\nOarts, 1741.\n\nRegarding the administration of the oarts a Consultation of the 19th June 1741 records: The President on inspecting the account of the oarts cannot find satisfactory information whether they are duly administered, namely in regulating the waterways or channels,\n\n---\n\n1 Bom.

To secure improvement in this matter it is proposed: That the overseer assisted by the vereadores who are well skilled do enter on a full examination and pursue the proper means for rendering this branch of the Company's estate as beneficial as possible, remarking withal if the wells are in order for supplying the necessary water. Further that we may be thoroughly satisfied of the improvements or loss, let an account be drawn out at the end of July ensuing shewing the state of the trees in the year 1740 and comparing that state with the actual condition in July 1741. That this account contain the true number bearing fruit, others that may bear in a certain time, those that are decayed, and how many young plants can be introduced in the vacant spaces.\n\nSix months later a Consultation of the 19th December 1741 records: Read a letter from Mr. Richard Sanders accompanying a report of the condition of the Honourable Company's oarts compared with that in March 1740, as also a list of certain oarts wherein are wanting new wells and waterways or the old ones to be thoroughly repaired, and adding a request to be allowed the extraordinary expense he alleges he has been at in taking this survey amounting to Rs. 53-2-4. The whole of this is deferred till we can with more leisure and exactness peruse those accounts for passing the necessary directions.\n\nA Consultation of the 24th July 1741 records: Read a petition from an inhabitant of this island setting forth that in August last he exported a parcel of cocoanuts but in making up accounts with the custom master the duties are charged on a valuation of Rs. 34\u00bd the 1000, though at the real time of shipping them, they were actually worth no more than Rs. 24\u00bd, as was proved by the Honourable Company's selling theirs a few days afterwards at that price. The President then observes that the occasion of this application hath arisen for want of a fixed and certain time, when the year should expire, as all cocoanuts are valued at what the Company's yield and the duties levied accordingly. It is therefore directed as a rule in future that the year be reckoned from the 1st day of August to the 31st day of the succeeding month of July. And as the Honourable Company's cocoanuts are always disposed of early in August, the price they go off at is to be esteemed the standard for collecting the duties on all other cocoanuts exported within the above computed space of twelve months.\n\nRegarding the Company's coconut trees a Consultation of the 18th June 1742 records: Under the orders of the 19th June 1741, notice was given to the overseer of the oarts to prepare and deliver a true account of the condition of the Company's coconut trees.

As, in consequence of the number of private trees cut down in connection with the fortification works, a large share of the Company's trees will go by way of equivalent, it cannot be to any purpose to enter on any regulations with respect to the Company's trees until we see what may remain after rendering the satisfaction intended to private persons.

It has heretofore been thought most advantageous for the Company to rent out their oarts, the charge of collecting being very considerable in respect to the produce and the natives that may hire small parcels of trees of the farmer giving better attendance in looking after them than hired servants will do. It is proposed that publication be made for receiving offers for taking the Company's oarts at Bombay or Mahim jointly or separately on lease for the term of seven or nine years as shall be most suitable to the bidders. And that all such proposals be delivered to the overseers of the oarts for their further consideration and comparing with the net produce of the oarts since the Company have kept them in their own hands.\n\nTwo months later a Consultation of the 6th May 1743 records: Agreeable to the Resolution of Council of the 8th of March last, publication having been made of our willingness to let out the Honourable Company's oarts, several proposals had been made to the overseer.\n\n---\n\n1 Bom.

In such case the Honourable President and Council shall be at full liberty to take back the said carts from the farmer and lease them out to such other persons as they shall think proper, and if any loss arise thereby to the Honourable Company, the farmer shall make the same good to them.\n\n4th. In case, by storms or other unforeseen accidents not owing to the neglect of the farmer, any damage shall accrue to the trees during the said term of nine years such allowance shall be made to the farmer as to the said President and Council shall seem meet and just.\n\n5th. That out of the trees which shall be blown down, the farmer shall have a sufficient quantity allowed him for repairing the wheels and waterways and the remainder shall be for the use of the Company.\n\n6th. That the farmer shall make proper fences for preserving the young plants and shall keep them in good repair. If any damage happens by his neglecting so to do he shall make ample satisfaction to the Company for the same.\n\n7th.

On the contrary he shall have such allowance made him as to the President and Council shall seem meet and just.\n\n23rd. That the farmer shall at his own expense during the term of his lease plant young trees in lieu of all such trees as shall be blown down and in all the vacant spaces in the said oarts and shall water and manure them and the young plants now in the oarts not transplanted.

That should any of the wells or wheels be broken or destroyed by the falling of trees or other accident (not occasioned by the neglect of the farmer) the Company shall at their own expense make new ones in lieu\nthereof. But the farmer shall at his own charge repair all wells and wheels and deliver them in good order at the expiration of his lease.\n\nThe foregoing being fully explained and understood by all present the farm of the oarts was publicly put up to auction when R\u00e1msset Ganb\u00e1sset appeared the highest bidder at Rs. 9250 a year the first three years and Rs. 13,250 a year for the last three years, R\u00e1msset stated that Mukundset Padamset, Bhiku Sinay Nevrekar, and B\u00e1bulset Ganb\u00e1sset were his partners in the said farm, who severally declared their assent. A lease was directed to be prepared according to the above conditions as also a bond to be executed by the farmers assigning over their estates and effects as security for their punctual performance of what on their parts is to be observed.\u00b9\n\nA Consultation of the 20th June 1743 records: The farmers of the Company\u2019s oarts having executed writings for the said farm, they are now, as customary on such occasions, called in and presented with shawls.\u00b2\n\nA Consultation of the 21st February 1744 records: The owners of the oarts deliver a report of some repairs necessary to the wheels and wells in the Company\u2019s oarts as also of some new wells that are wanted which by the terms of the lease to the farmers are to be built at the Honourable Company\u2019s expense. Ordered the overseer make enquiry whether any person will undertake the same for a sum certain and how much.\u00b3\n\nA month later, 30th March 1744, the farmers of the oarts offering to undertake the repairs of the wells and wheels in the oarts for the sum of rupees four thousand five hundred being something less than Messrs. Sanders and Smith\u2019s calculate, the farmers\u2019 offer is agreed to, and they are told the several works must be performed in the manner proposed by Mr. Smith and subject to his inspection.\u2074\n\nA Consultation of the 19th October 1744 records: From the Honourable Company\u2019s oarts being farmed out, the office of overseer does not require so much attention as when they were in the Company\u2019s hands. It may therefore be executed by the person who has charge of the revenues. This at present is Mr. Hugh Howard one of the Members of Council whose allowance as Collector, notwithstanding the office is of great consequence, was no more than twenty-three rupees three-quarters and twenty-six res a month, although the overseer of the oarts had fifty rupees a month. As from the nature of it this office ought to be immediately under the Collector, the Board resolve to vest those offices in one person with a monthly appointment of sixty rupees. By this a yearly saving will result of one hundred and sixty-five rupees three-quarters and twelve res.\u2075\n\nThe records between 1720 and 1744 contain many references to abk\u00e1ri or liquor excise. Punch-houses and palm-tapping appear among the leading heads of revenue, and the disputes between the toddy farmers,\n\n\u00b9 Pub. Diary 16 of 1743, 124-128. \u00b2 Pub.

The Secretary was directed to draw out articles accordingly.\u00b9\n\nRegarding the arrack farm or rent a Consultation of the 19th July 1728 has the following entry: The arrack rent expiring the first of next month and nobody, on public notice being given, appears but Pasquel Bareito and the old Rendeira or farmer. The old farmer being considerably in arrears with the Honourable Company is objected against, and Pasquel offering to take the farm for three years at Rs. 10,000 a year being Rs. 45 advance on the last farm, his offer is accepted and a bond and articles are ordered to be prepared to be executed accordingly.\u00b2\n\nOn the 25th June 1731 a Consultation records: This being the day appointed by public proclamation for the letting of the arrack rent for three years to commence from the 1st of August next ensuing sundry inhabitants attend and the doors are thrown open and they are called in and the conditions of the said rent now to be put up at public sale are explained to them. Joseph de Crouse inhabitant of Mahim and Essennick (Esu N\u00e1ik?) Bhand\u00e1ri inhabitant of Bombay appear to be the highest bidders at Rs. 10,300 a year. Ordered that the usual obligations be prepared for the renters to sign.\u00b3\n\nThe three years\u2019 term of the arrack farm having expired on the 31st July 1734 the arrack rent was again let by public auction for three years for Rs. 14,300 a year.\u2074\n\nOn a representation of the Bhand\u00e1ris that the trees allotted to them did not prove sufficient to enable them to maintain themselves and their families a Consultation of the 12th March 1736 records: The Bhand\u00e1ris representing that from the small number of trees already allotted them they cannot get a sufficient quantity of toddy to maintain themselves and families or supply the renter of the arrack farm, who is therefore obliged to import toddy from other parts to the great prejudice of said Bhand\u00e1ris; and they requesting us to let them have about 900 trees more of the Honourable Company\u2019s for which they are to pay at the rate of nine pice a month for each tree; and as they are a useful set of people and we believe there is room for their complaint and our complying with their request will be no disadvantage to the Company, it is agreed to relieve them in the manner they request the muk\u00e1damas and chaughul\u00e1s of the caste being security for their performance of their agreement.\u2075\n\nRegarding the sale of the arrack farm a Consultation of the 12th July 1737 has the following entry: Having appointed this day for the\n\n\u00b9 Bom.

Diary 9 of 1736, 114.\ndisposal of the arrack farm, the President takes occasion to observe to the Board that upon issuing public notice that the said farm would be put to sale this day, the muk\u00e1dams chaughul\u00e1s and p\u00e1tils of the Bhand\u00e1ris immediately represented to him by petition, which is now read, how greatly they have suffered and the hardships they laboured under during the last farm, which was run up to such an excessive high rate that many families of the Bhand\u00e1ris were thereby ruined. Further the said muk\u00e1dams claimed the performance of the promise given them by the President that they should be relieved at the expiration of the present farm. They declare that in hopes of this relief they have so long sat easy under their misfortunes. Now the President informs the Board that being sensible of the hardships the Bhand\u00e1ris would suffer, and not doubting but our Honourable Masters would comply with the request we made in their behalf, he was induced to give them hopes that at the expiration of the present farm they should be made easy. But as our Honourable Masters in their commands of 22nd December 1736 by the Grafton, in answer to our representation concerning the Bhand\u00e1ris, are pleased to say that the practice of letting the rents to the highest bidder must be continued, he recommends to the consideration of the Board whether for the following reasons the necessity of relieving the Bhand\u00e1ris will not justify us to our Honourable Masters for so far breaking through their orders especially at this critical juncture. At present there are upon the island between 400 and 500 Bhand\u00e1ris fit to carry arms who have no other means of maintaining themselves and families than by following their occupation of drawing toddy and distilling arrack. For many years past the sole liberty of selling these articles has been farmed out and gradually risen in the price till it let for Rs. 10,000 a year from which the last rent was at once advanced to Rs. 14,300. Whoever rents the said farm, the advance in the price affects only the Bhand\u00e1ris as the sum the rent lets for is divided in proportion among them and something added for the trouble and charge of the renter. This last farm running so excessive high, it has fallen so hard upon the Bhand\u00e1ris that many families have been ruined, not being able to earn sufficient in the way of their calling to maintain themselves and pay their proportion of the rent. That the Bhand\u00e1ris are of a military caste and ready to serve the Company in the defence of the island upon any emergency, is a plea not without foundation. When the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s invaded S\u00e1lsette (April 1737) and we did not know how soon they might be encouraged to the like attempts against us, the Bhand\u00e1ris willingly repaired to defend the several outposts where they were some time stationed without any other consideration than being allowed provisions. By this they were great sufferers, being all that while deprived of the opportunity of following their business in drawing toddy and selling arrack and their trees for want of being regularly drawn were greatly damaged. To this they the more readily submitted in hopes that it would be considered at the expiration of the present farm. Nor should we have trusted them to defend a place of such importance without having a very good opinion of their fidelity and courage. At that time the safety of this island chiefly depended on them, they being stationed about Sion where many places in the river are fordable at low water.\nSuch a trust we can never again think of reposing in them if we cause them to be dissatisfied by renting out the arrack farm on terms that render it impossible for them to secure a maintenance for themselves and families. It is likewise remarked that the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, whose treachery we ought to be guarded against as if they were open enemies, are now in our neighbourhood. It is a general observation that they have gained more by their money in corrupting their enemies than by the force of their arms. Should we therefore put the arrack farm to public sale and it run to a high price, the Bhand\u00e1ris would continue uneasy and discontented, in which case we cannot doubt that the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s by their emissaries would privately endeavour to inflame them to shake off their allegiance to this Government. They would not be wanting to make them the most fair and specious promises and that the Bhand\u00e1ris be gained over thereby to take part with the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. Such an enemy amongst our own people would be more to be dreaded than any force from abroad and the safety of the island be greatly endangered. This we cannot think ought to be risked for the sake of the gains that might accrue to our Honourable Masters by putting the said rent up to public sale. As, on the other hand, by keeping the Bhand\u00e1ris satisfied, we may depend upon their fidelity which will be a great addition to the strength of the island upon an emergency; and in the situation which we at present are and likely to continue, surrounded by neighbours whom we must guard against as enemies, we know not but we may have occasion to put the fidelity and courage of the Bhand\u00e1ris to the proof. Should we have occasion for them, and on account of their discontent not dare to trust them, the charge of raising other men and maintaining them one month would be equal to the difference in the arrack farm for one whole year between letting the Bhand\u00e1ris have it at Rs. 12,000 a year certain or farming it to the highest bidder. Nor would the same number of any men we could raise be of equal service. The Bhand\u00e1ris are bred to arms from their infancy and have a courage and fidelity which, we think, may be depended upon. At the same time without our Honourable Masters\u2019 permission, we do not think it prudent to come to a final agreement with the Bhand\u00e1ris for letting to them the arrack farm forever at the settled rate of Rs. 12,000 yearly. Still for the reasons before given we persuade ourselves our Honourable Masters will not disapprove our gratifying the Bhand\u00e1ris in some measure. It is therefore agreed that we let them have the said farm for three years (the term it has usually let) at Rs. 12,000 a year and that we again represent their case to the Honourable Company requesting their consent to come to a final agreement with the Bhand\u00e1ris on the terms first proposed. For we are sincerely of opinion it is a point of prime necessity for the welfare and safety of this island.\n\nOn the 1st May 1738 the following license for keeping a public tavern is recorded: The Honourable John Horne President and Governor doth hereby license and permit you Michael Razor inhabitant of Bombay to keep a public tavern or victualling\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Consultation 12th July 1737, Pub. Diary 10 of 1736-37, 161-163.\nhouse whereto all strangers and others may resort for eating and drinking. You are likewise hereby licensed to sell by retail in your house or otherwise all sorts of wine, beer, mum, arrack (except parriar arrack), and also all sorts of mixed liquors as punch and lemonade, taking particular care that your liquor and provision be good and wholesome in their respective kinds, at such reasonable rates as shall from time to time be adjudged and allowed. And you are strictly to observe and follow the orders given you for the government of your house, and entertain no company in your house after nine o'clock, lodgers and inmates excepted. In case of any failure this license to be forfeited and you to suffer such fine as is mentioned in the instructions. Otherwise this license is to remain in force for the term of one year from the date hereof. Sealed with the seal of the aforesaid Honourable Company in Bombay Castle this 1st day of May in the year of our Lord 1738.\n\nA Consultation of the 18th July 1740 records: Read the Bhand\u00e1ri\u2019s petition for the renewal of the lease of the arrack rent to them on the approaching expiry of their term of three years on the 1st of August next on the like terms. The fullest consideration being had to this petition, and of the latitude given us in the 50th paragraph of our Honourable Masters\u2019 commands by Hastingsfield, dated 2nd March 1738, to act thereon as may be most for the interest and security of the island, without making the lease perpetual, the Board are of opinion that the reasons urged in our Consultation of the 12th July 1737 still subsisting, it will be by no means prudent in our present situation to take this lease out of the Bhand\u00e1ris\u2019 hands. It is therefore agreed that the same be renewed to them for the three ensuing years on the like terms of Rs. 12,000 a year, which we esteem to be entirely for the interest of our Honourable Masters in the encouragement of the people.\n\nA Consultation of the 1st August 1740 records: The muk\u00e1dam of the Bhand\u00e1ris on renewal of the lease of the arrack farm to his caste is called and acquainted with the favour done them, and exhorted to preserve due gratitude and fidelity to the Honourable Company. After this he is in their name presented with two shawls valued about Rs. 20 each.\n\nRegarding the arrack farm and the Bhand\u00e1ris\u2019 complaint a Consultation of the 19th December 1741 records: Our Honourable Masters in paragraph 60 of their commands by Princess Louisa, are pleased to remark that the Bhand\u00e1ris complained of some hardships they laboured under from their muk\u00e1dam Esuji Naik, and that the same had not been enquired into as they ought, and the arrack farm put upon an equitable footing. The President has since with the assistance of proper persons endeavoured to settle\n\n---\n\n1 Sec. Out. L. B. 8 of 1738-1741, 3-4. Mum is ale brewed from wheaten malt.

Diary 13 of 1739-40, 300.\nthat matter, and, by fixing the privileges of each person as well as what they ought to pay, to prevent any impositions. He now lays before the Board certain regulations with accounts annexed shewing how the annual amount of Rs. 12,500 with other incidentals will arise with the number of trees allotted to the Bhandaris and what each tree is to pay. The details are:\n\nThe Honourable Company having consented in order to assist the Bhandaris (who are reputed good subjects and useful in the exercise of arms) to give them the arrack farm at the rate of Rs. 12,500 a year, and sundry disputes having arisen among themselves and some detriment supposed to lie on those people through the maladministration of their mukadams or heads. We, the President and Council of Bombay, do, on considering the premises and being previously assured the whole of them will be satisfied with our determination, direct that from the 1st of August 1741 the subsequent rules shall be strictly observed excepting only that part relating to the persons we nominate for assisting the mukadam Esuji Naik, who are not to receive their stipulated wages until they enter on the execution hereof. And here it is to be noted that the proper rent is only Rs. 12,000 a year and the surplus Rs. 500 appertains to an ancient tax on the Bhandaris styled aut salami or knife-tax, which, with the other, makes the Rs. 12,500 prementioned:\n\n1. That Esuji Naik the administrator of this farm and collector thereof shall make good to the Company's servant appointed the receiver Rs. 1041-2-66 at the end of every month or within 20 days after, which sum will in twelve regular payments make the sum appointed of Rs. 12,500 a year. And as it is intended that he shall diligently attend this office, he shall for his reward be allowed out of the general produce from the farm Rs. 30 a month.\n\n2. And for satisfying the farm the cocoanut and brab trees must give the necessary supply. For the better ascertaining what each shall pay, it is directed there be appointed four inspectors by us, the President and Council, namely two for the district of Bombay and two for Mahim, who shall be allowed severally the wages of Rs. 10 a month to be satisfied in the same manner as what is given the mukadam Esuji Naik, namely from the general produce of the farms. These inspectors must monthly count the trees actually occupied by the Bhandaris in order to ascertain what each man shall pay according to the settled rates hereafter to be mentioned.\n\n3. Whereas by a calculate now furnished and taken by order of the President in September 1741 there were actually occupied by the Bhandaris 1767 brab trees and 12,254 cocoanut trees for drawing toddy, we have from thence framed our rule what each tree shall pay in order to satisfy the farm of Rs. 12,500 to the Company as well as the incident charges of Rs. 30 a month to the mukadam Esuji Naik and Rs. 40 a month for the four inspectors as well as Rs. 66-0-65 for Purvoes and under-servants, with paper, oil, twine, bags, and somerades or sunshades which last articles may vary as circumstances shall arise. But as it may so happen that the number of trees occupied may not always be the same but often more or less, which must consequently occasion an increase or decrease in the amount, it is directed that admitting there be an increase of trees there shall be a proportionate diminution in the rate; and if a decrease of trees then a proportionate increase of said rate which shall be conducted by our inspectors nominated for counting the trees monthly and by this means every Bhandari will have justice done him.\n\n4. And as there has been an old custom excusing the chaughulas and patils (who are persons appointed by the caste or sect to decide differences amongst\nthem) from paying anything towards the arrack farm, they are now, pursuant to such custom, to be relieved accordingly, every chaughula and patil being to enjoy 36 trees free.\n\n5. The mukadam Esuji Naik, being, as he pretends, a sufferer in the sum of Rs.1464-0-30 during the course of four years' administration through too small an assessment of the Bhandaris on account of the farm, the body of these people do consent to the paying the same in the following manner and according to custom, namely:\n\n(a) Every tree called consented, meaning such as are hired from the fazandars, to pay 35 res each.\n\n(b) Every tree called ordered, meaning such as the fazandars by ancient practice are obliged to furnish from their oarts to the Bhandaris, being 3 per cent to pay 50 res each tree.\n\n(c) Every brab tree to pay 65 res.\n\nThe above regards only the district of Bombay.\n\nAs to Mahim each Bhandari must pay agreeable to his condition, which is too voluminous to enter particularly here from the number of people being so considerable.\n\nThe following is a calculate of what the Bhandaris are now to pay towards the arrack farm, what they did pay until the time of our forming the present regulations commencing the 1st August 1741, and what the said Bhandaris did pay to the arrack farmers when not under their administration. The number of trees are taken by the review made by the President's order in September:\n\n**Palm Trees, 1741.**\n\n| PROPOSED CHARGE | EXISTING CHARGE | PREVIOUS CHARGE |\n|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|\n| Monthly.        | Yearly.         | Monthly.       |\n| Brab Trees.     | Rs. q. r.       | Brab Trees.    |\n| At Mahim ...    | Rs. 1050        | Rs. q. r.       |\n| At Bombay ...   | Rs. 717         | Rs. q. r.       |\n| Total ...       | Rs. 2385 1 80   | Rs. 3445 2 60   |\n| At 9 pice or 45 res |               |                |\n| Cocoanut Trees. | Rs. q. r.       | Rs. q. r.       |\n| At Mahim ...    | Rs. 4520        | Rs. q. r.       |\n| At 9 pice or 45 res |               | Rs. q. r.       |\n| At Bombay 700 ordered trees | Rs. 11,739 3 6 | Rs. q. r.       |\n| At 12 pice or 60 res |               | Rs. q. r.       |\n| At Bombay 6664 consented trees | Rs. 6997 2 90 | Rs. q. r.       |\n| At 35 res | Rs. q. r.       | Rs. q. r.       |\n| M\u00e4gaon Arrack House | Rs. 222 0 0 | Rs. q. r.       |\n| J\u00e4gri Distillation | Rs. 192 0 0 | Rs. q. r.       |\n| Total ...       | Rs. 14,347 0 80 | Rs. 19,241 2 50 |\n\nIf the other details are right, Rs.11,739-3-0 should be Rs.11,888-3-0 and Rs.14,347-0-80 should be Rs.14,494-0-80.\n\nOn enquiring why the present allotment should be only Rs.14,347-0-80, and the preceding be Rs.19,241-2-50, and yet an old debt is said to remain on the Bhandaris of Rs.1464-0-30 though the difference is so great, it is alleged that before there was not a strict account taken of the trees and some of the Bhandaris might probably conceal many trees whereby the produce of the rent as\nstipulated then might fall greatly short of our present calculate. But as to the produce when not rented by the Bhand\u00e1ris but by Antonio De Lima, it is affirmed his recovery could not fall short of Rs. 31,761-0-24 in the manner precited, provided which is much to be doubted the number were equal to the present and he obtained the whole let out. By our method now to be observed the Bhand\u00e1ris will individually reap the benefit of having the trees at a lesser price than heretofore; besides enjoying the privilege of selling what each distils in the best manner he can. Whereas before the said Bhand\u00e1ris could sell only one kind called arrack and two other sorts, one called phula which is more spirituous, the other styled nipa which is still stronger, these could be sold only by the farmer, and in this the body of the Bhand\u00e1ris were excluded from any benefit whatever. The inspectors proposed for counting the trees are Antonio de Mouro and Pascoal de Almeida for Bombay, and Tome Rodriguez and Antonio de Azavedo for Mahim.\n\nThe following is the general account of the arrack farm according to the rules established in December 1741:\n\n| Dr.                                                                 | Monthly | Yearly |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------|\n| To the Honourable Company                                            | 1041    | 12,500 |\n| To the Muk\u00e1dam Esuji Naik                                             | 30      | 360    |\n| To the four inspectors, namely two at Bombay and two at Mahim, for counting the trees | 40      | 480    |\n| To the incident charges for under-servants, oil, paper, bags, twine   | 66      | 793    |\n| To the servants of the President at the feast of Dually (Div\u00e1li)       |         | 9      |\n\nTo the difference which appears in the calculate\n\n| Cr.                                                                 |         |        |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------|\n| By the sundry assessments to be made on the trees which is taken from the number of trees actually occupied by the Bhand\u00e1ris in the month of September 1741 when the account was taken by the President's order: |         |        |\n| Brab Trees                                                          |         |        |\n| At Mahim 1050 and at Bombay 717 or in all 1767, at 9 pice or 45 res each | 198     | 2385   |\n| Cocoanut Trees                                                      |         |        |\n| At Mahim, 4829 trees at 9 pice or 45 res each                       | 543     | 1      |\n| At Bombay, 760\u00bd ordered trees at 12 pice or 60 res each             | 101     | 2      |\n| At Bombay, 666\u00bd consented trees at 4 pice or 20 res each            | 333     | 1      |\n| Total... 12,254                                                     | 978     | 1      |\n| By what the arrack house at Magaoon belonging to the aldea or estate lying there does pay annually for a license to sell country arrack |         |        |\n| Total ...                                                           | 222     | 0      |\n\n1 Arrack is toddy spirit of about 10\u00b0 under proof; Phul (flower) is toddy or mahuda spirit of and above 10\u00b0 under proof; Nipa, commonly called lip, is toddy spirit of 40\u00b0 to 50\u00b0 under proof that is of a little higher strength than the present rasi (inferior?); Nip is occasionally called Burakh of about 70\u00b0 under proof.\nHeretofore a farm has been collected from those who distil arrack from j\u00e1gri dates or otherwise. This was then understood to be appropriated to and incorporated in the arrack farm, but there is no revenue arising therefrom at present. It is therefore not inserted in the above.\n\nA Consultation of the 7th August 1741 records: As the season for renewing the licenses to the several punch house-keepers is approaching the President desires the opinion of the members whether it may not be proper to restrain the number of punch houses, as so many tend to encourage the vice of drunkenness among the lower sort of people. The Board apprehending it may be extremely detrimental to the persons hitherto licensed to carry on that business from the stock they may have by them as well as outstanding debts which they will not be able to recover, it is agreed to continue the same to those hitherto possessed of licenses and now on the spot. But as they die or remove, none to be permitted in their room till the licences are decreased to four which is to be the established number.\n\nA Consultation of the 10th June 1742 records certain changes in the regulations relating to the arrack farm: Notwithstanding the regulations laid down in our diary under the 19th of December 1741, with respect to the arrack farm granted to the Bhand\u00e1ris under the administration of Esuji N\u00e1ik their muk\u00e1dam, it appears that the individual Bhand\u00e1ris are not treated with the justice intended and requisite for the good of our Employers\u2019 service. As the evils seem to arise from the muk\u00e1dam administering the said farm, it is proposed the same be no longer entrusted to him, but to one Manuell Barretto, subject to the following conditions:\n\n1. The above Manuell Barretto shall, from the first day of June 1742, assume the care of this farm and levy from every occupier of cocoanut and brab trees, the rate ascertained from such trees, respectively mentioned in the rules laid down in our diary of the 19th of December 1741. This will be easily performed as the inspectors then appointed for counting the trees and knowing their several renters are to deliver to the muk\u00e1dam the account of each man. The muk\u00e1dam must then draw out every distinct person\u2019s debt for the month and give to each a paper specifying the same in order to obtain payment. When payment is made a receipt must be written on the said paper to serve and remain as a voucher in every man\u2019s possession.\n\n2. The strictest care must be taken that no Bhand\u00e1ri runs into arrears, but is called upon for the payment of every month\u2019s debt. It is recommended that within twenty days after each month is over, the whole amount of the farm be delivered to the Honourable Company\u2019s collector of revenues. The said collector is to see to the performance of this and punctually pass his receipt to the manager of the farm for the respective sums that shall be paid.\n\n3. In our precited regulations under the 19th of December 1741, it is inserted that the farm stands according to the terms stipulated at Rs. 12,000 a year, exclusive of Rs. 500 more which by ancient custom hath been paid by the Bhand\u00e1ris to the Company under the denomination of petty tributes. This amount it is presumed had better continue annexed to the method now practised of recovering this tribute from the occupier of trees on a supposal. It will fall more fairly in that than in any other manner.\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Consultation 19th Dec. 1741, Pub. Diary 14 of 1740-41, 511-516.\n2 Bom. Gov. Consultation 7th Aug. 1741, Pub. Diary 14 of 1740-41, 305.\nAccording to the above rate the sum of Rs. 1041-2-66\\(\\frac{3}{8}\\) must be recovered every month and paid to our receiver. Besides this we do imagine it to be just to levy the following items for defraying the incidental expense, namely:\n\n| Charges | Monthly | Yearly |\n|---------|---------|--------|\n|         | Rs. q. r. | Rs. q. r. |\n| 1. To the muk\u00e1dam Esuji N\u00e1ik for managing the body of Bhand\u00e1ris | 20 0 0 | 240 0 0 |\n| 2. To Manuell Barretto, the manager of the farm | 20 0 0 | 240 0 0 |\n| 3. To the four inspectors appointed for counting the trees held by every Bhand\u00e1ri, namely Antonio de Mouro and Pascoal de Almeida for Bombay, and Tome Rodriguez with Antonio de Azavedo for Mahim, at Rs. 10 the month each | 40 0 0 | 480 0 0 |\n| 4. The incident charges for under-servants to the manager of the farm together with oil, paper, bags, twine, by the calculate in December 1741 are esteemed at Rs. 66-0-65 the month, though it is possible this may be too much and may admit of a reduction hereafter. Till that is known we will compute it the same as before | 66 0 65 | 793 3 80 |\n| 5. To the servants of the President at Diw\u00e1li | ..... | 9 1 44 |\n| 6. To this add the monthly amount as precited to be paid the Company | 1041 2 66\\(\\frac{3}{8}\\) | 12,500 0 0 |\n\nTotal | 1187 3 31\\(\\frac{3}{8}\\) | 14,263 1 24\n\nThe total to be annually collected from the trees will be about Rs. 14,263-1-24.\n\nFor satisfying this the cocoanut and brab trees occupied by every Bhand\u00e1ri must, pursuant to the 1741 regulations, defray the same by adding or diminishing the rate of each tree as will best answer the sum to be monthly collected as above declared.\n\nAnd whereas on the 31st May 1742 Esuji N\u00e1ik the muk\u00e1dam now in trust of the farm stands indebted to the Honourable Company for the large sum of Rs. 8172-2-66\\(\\frac{3}{8}\\) for said farm and petty tributes, it is hereby directed that Mr. Richard Sanders, who is esteemed equal to the trust, does in virtue of our publication to be made take from every Bhand\u00e1ri the account of what each may be indebted to the time pre-named of the 31st May 1742, and this to be given him within twenty days from the time of publication. It is likewise farther ordered that Esuji N\u00e1ik the muk\u00e1dam does also within twenty days give unto Mr. Sanders the true account of every Bhand\u00e1ri\u2019s real debt, whether for arrears in the farm or petty tributes distinguishing each in separate columns and to make one total at last. Then by comparing and liquidating every man\u2019s account, we may enforce payment to Mr. Sanders. All recoveries must be paid to our Collector of the revenues, and credit given unto Esuji N\u00e1ik the muk\u00e1dam for the sums at times so to be made good. From the 1st of June 1742 the said Collector must open a head on his books for Manuell Barretto, whom we appointed manager of the farm who is, however, to be under the control of said Collector, and, in case of want of diligence integrity or otherwise, a report must be made to this Board. Bhand\u00e1ris like other Gentus having customs\npeculiar to their castes or sects, it is hereby directed that for deciding all matters of dispute, whether relative to the caste or otherwise, the following persons be appointed with a proper authority in writing as a standing Council with equal votes, the majority to prevail, namely:\n\n1. Esuji Naik, mukadam.\n2. Dadji Naik, Deputy mukadam.\n3. Esuji Naik\n4. Madaji Zaddi (Jadhav)\n5. Balaji Mahacar\n6. Gunji Padencar\n7. Dattoji Zaddi (Jadhav)\n8. Raghoji Zaddi (Jadhav)\n9. Habaji Patil\n10. Patti Patil\n11. Ben Queny\n\nThese seven persons are in the country language styled chaughulas and are of the caste called Kettia (Kita).\n\nA chaughula of the caste called Sindia (Shinda).\nDo. do. called Ambattia.\n\nThe chaughulas for Malim are not included in the above as their characters are not yet justly inquired into. As Madaji Naik, Ramaji Naik, Rangu Queny, and Kanaji Naik have been long employed as chaughulas, and are rendered incapable of further service purely through age they are allowed to rank as chaughulas until they die without the right to vote, but with the allowance of the double koita or tapping knife, that is the exemption of 36 trees free of all duties. The same privilege of a double koita of 36 trees must as heretofore continue to be given to every chaughula as well as to the deputy mukadam. As to the head mukadam his allowance is before settled at Rs. 20 the month. The precited persons nominated as mukadams and chaughulas are to act in their offices immediately on their respective warrants in writing being delivered. None of them can be dismissed without the direction of the President or if necessary by him and his Council. But as many evil consequences may arise by rendering any office perpetual, or descending to a successor in nowise equal to the discharge of the trust, be it known that the character and ability of the party will be punctually considered, and the election of such to office ensue thereupon to which purpose a clause will be expressed in the warrant. In case the head mukadam Esuji Naik cannot or will not assemble the deputy mukadam and chaughulas when business requires their meeting, it is ordered that the deputy Dadaji Naik may, after representing the matter to the President and having his consent, issue out his summons for convening the chaughulas wheresoever he may direct. Should any of the chaughulas omit to come without just reason for his absence, the party will be fined Rs. 2 to be levied by the President's order. When the body is assembled, the majority shall prevail and their determination be esteemed of equal validity as if the head mukadam had been present. Should any of the body of Bhandaris apprehend himself aggrieved in any case or manner whatsoever, he may deliver a petition representing the same to the officer in command of the fort guard for being instantly committed to the President who will proceed therein as to him shall appear right. The body of Bhandaris within the district of Bombay being 418 men, namely 200 of the Kettia and Gaur caste, and the remainder 119 Sindias and 99 Ambattias, it is fixed that the Kettias be divided into seven companies to be commanded by the seven before-named chaughulas of that caste. The Sindias to be commanded by\nPatti P\u00e1t\u00edl, also a chaughula and an old inhabitant. And the Ambat-\ntias by Sayan Queny (Siva Kini?) another chaughula.\\footnote{Kini is a common surname among the Son Kolis of M\u00e1tunga and Sion.} To these\nseveral persons in command orders must be given by our Captain Com-\nmandant to assemble their respective companies as may at any time be\nrequired; and then only may the muk\u00e1dam Esuji N\u00e1ik or in his absence\nD\u00e1dji N\u00e1ik assume the command of all. Here it is to be observed that\nno company of the Bhand\u00e1ris do appear in a body of more or less with\narms without first receiving an order in writing from our Captain\nCommandant. The rules laid down in December 1741 make it easy to\ncompute the tax necessary to be levied on every tree for defraying the\nmonthly farm and incidental charges. It sometimes happens that some\nof the Bhand\u00e1ris bring Goa arrack as well as country arrack from the\ncontinent, and sell it to the sole profit of such seller though the farm is\nlet to the whole in a body and each should as near as possible receive a\nbenefit. To meet this difficulty it is proposed that the said Goa and\ncountry arrack brought from the continent be subject to a certain\ntaxation to be hereafter fixed as the Bhand\u00e1ris shall among themselves\nwith Manuell Barretto's approval; the proceeds being thrown into\nthe common farm stock towards easing the incidental charge of manage-\nment. Until this matter is finally determined it is expressly ordered\nthat, previous to the carrying the same to any man's dwelling, all\nGoa and country arrack from the continent shall be reported to Manuell\nBarretto the manager of the farm, who must register the same in order\nto levy the tax which shall be agreed on hereafter.\n\nOn serious debate of what is above precited the Board entirely\nagree in opinion with the President and consider that the methods laid\ndown by him for the administration appear the best calculated. It is\ntherefore directed the same be instantly put in execution and strictly\nobserved.\\footnote{Bom. Gov. Consultation 10th June 1742, Pub. Diary 15 of 1741-42, 272 - 278.}\n\nA Consultation on the 18th October 1742 records: The President\nobserves that since our nomination of Manuell Barretto to the manage-\nment of the arrack farm he seems to have acted with great uprightness.\nIn spite of this he meets with many insults from some of the\nBhand\u00e1ris, two of whom in particular had accused him of indirect\npractices though the contrary was evidently clear. As such behaviour if\npassed without notice will in the end bring many inconveniences,\nbesides contempt of ourselves by whom the person is appointed, it is\nagreed to direct Mr. Thomas Marsh, Chief of M\u00e1him at which place\nthe two present offenders inhabit, to make inquiry whether they have\nany family possessions upon this island. If not, then in the most\npublic manner to give them each twenty lashes and send them to the\nother side. Should their removal be productive of detriment to their\nfamilies or estates, then to increase their punishment to 39 stripes.\nThis we hope may have the good effect of deterring others from the like\nrefractory conduct.\\footnote{Bom. Gov. Consultation 18th Oct, 1742, Pub. Diary 15 of 1741-42, 493 - 494.}\nA Consultation of the 14th February 1744 records: Read a petition from certain chaughul\u00e1s of the Bhand\u00e1ris, requesting the continuance of some peculiar rights such as distributing betel and sandalwood on their public festivals, which the new chaughul\u00e1s would deprive them of. On recourse to the Diary under the 6th (10th) of June 1742 we find the new chaughul\u00e1s were appointed to command the Bhand\u00e1ris in a military capacity. At the same time the former chaughul\u00e1s were not excluded from the abovementioned privilege. It is therefore to be continued in the same manner as formerly.\n\nA Consultation of the 3rd June 1743 records: The term of the arrack farm to the Bhand\u00e1ris being near expired, the President moves for taking into consideration that part of the Honourable Company's revenues. How far is it consistent with the Company's interest to continue that favour to the Bhand\u00e1ris, who to this time have paid no more than Rs. 12,500 yearly, when it is acknowledged in the Consultation of the 12th July 1737 that Rs. 14,300 a year could then have been had for the farm and in all probability more will now be offered. It is remarked the only reason ever assigned for gratifying the Bhand\u00e1ris in so extraordinary a manner was their being of a military caste and likely to be of service in defence of the place on an attack. Admitting that some of them know the use of arms and have a common share of resolution, it is uncertain the number of such would be found very considerable. On the other hand it is certainly our duty to increase our Honourable Employers' revenues in such a reasonable manner as they will bear without oppressing any part or caste of people upon the island. In any case should there be any occasion for such military service as the Bhand\u00e1ris can perform, they may be paid for it according to their deserts. One great evil which arises from the farm being kept in the Bhand\u00e1ri's hands is the great number of houses which sell arrack, whereby frequent disturbances happen in the garrison from the people being in liquor, and, when absent, the officers know not where to look for them which often gives them time to desert. On the whole it is the unanimous opinion of this Board that the arrack farm be put to public auction on the 6th July and let to the highest bidder for three years ensuing to commence from the 1st August next, and that the terms and conditions of the said farm be speedily prepared, and public notice be given of the same.\n\nA Consultation of the 6th July 1743 records: This being the day appointed for putting to auction the arrack farm for three years, a letter is presented and read signed by Savaji Dharamset representing ill-health prevented his coming abroad, but that he was willing to give Rs. 27,000 for the said farm on the conditions which have been shown publicly at the custom house. He desired the farm might be put up at this rate and if no advance was made he declared his acceptance thereof, and desired he might be mentioned as the farmer and would give security for performing the conditions. The doors were thrown open and all persons admitted when the conditions were read and explained.\n\n1 Pub. Diary 17 of 1744, 63.\n2 Pub. Diary 16 of 1743, 148 - 149.\nin the country language, and the farm put up at Rs. 27,000 as requested by Savaji Dharamset. No one advancing on that sum, after waiting a considerable time, it was cried down and Savaji Dharamset declared the farmer. The following are the details of this agreement:\n\nThat the said President and Council doth by these presents grant unto Savaji Dharamset the arrack farm and aut salami or toddy knife tax of this island of Bombay for three years at the rate of Rs. 27,000 a year to be made good and paid to the said President and Council or their successors in manner following: That is to say two months from the date hereof or on the 1st of October the sum of Rs. 4500 and from thenceforward on the 1st of every month the sum of Rs. 2250 until the expiry of this farm. In consideration of these payments the following conditions and privileges are granted the said farmer. That all the Indian inhabitants of this island be forbid to bring or sell on it any sort of arrack commonly called parriar arrack (a native spirit) under penalty of Rs. 50 for every offence the fine to be divided between the Honourable Company and the farmer. Should they or any foreign merchants bring Goa arrack for sale and shall not be able to vend the same to the English inhabitants, the importer in such case shall be obliged to tender it to the farmer. Upon his refusing to buy it the importer may then be at liberty to sell it to any of the country people, the buyer paying the farmer one rupee a (man?) for such liberty. At the same time the buyer shall be obliged to sell not less than one-eighth part of a hogshead at one time on penalty of Rs. 50 for every offence to be divided as aforementioned. No Bhandari shall distil arrack of any kind without leave from the farmer. Upon his obtaining leave he shall be obliged to sell such arrack to the farmer at Rs. 2-3-0 the Bombay man of 50 sers as hath been customary. Neither shall the Bhandari buy or sell any arrack on penalty of Rs. 50 to be divided between the Honourable Company and the farmer. In case any of the caste of people called Parsis or others shall buy or distil for sale or distil for use any arrack or spirits, the person so offending shall be liable to the aforesaid penalty to be divided as aforementioned. The farmer may set up three shops for selling arrack at Bombay to the European soldiers and sailors, namely one at a convenient distance without each of the town gates, and, in like manner, one at Mahim, and one at Sion. He may set up other shops for selling arrack to the natives to such a number as he shall think proper, the Honourable Company allowing ground for that purpose as well as for the five shops permitted as aforesaid. All charges of building shall be on the farmer's account. The farmer shall not sell, or permit to be sold by those under his direction, any kind of arrack to the European soldiers or sailors at other shops or places than at the five shops mentioned in the foregoing article under the penalty of Rs. 50 for each offence to be paid to the Honourable Company. Nor shall he entertain any European soldiers or sailors after sunset, or suffer them to be drunk at his shops. In case any such soldiers or sailors will not depart or return to the barracks, then the farmer or his people shall give notice to the officers of the gates who will send a guard for them. But if the farmer or his servants shall neglect to acquaint the officers, the farmer shall be fined Rs. 50 and the servants punished as they may deserve. Should the selling country arrack to such persons be forbidden the farmer must pay a strict regard to all such orders or be liable to the fine already mentioned in this article for every such offence. The farmer shall sell his double distilled arrack at 7 pice the ser and single distilled at 4 pice the ser full measure, and without any mixture of water so that any person buying arrack shall see that it is good and full measure before he carries it from the shop. If it proves bad or short in measure the person so endeavouring to impose upon the buyer shall, if the buyer insists upon it, go with him and carry the arrack to the clerk of the market. If the complaint be found just the farmer or his servant shall be subject to the penalty of 16 laris for every offence to be paid to the clerk of the market as was formerly customary. No complaint shall be admitted after the arrack has been carried\n\n1 Pub. Diary 16 of 1743, 174 - 175.\nby the buyer from the shop. The fazand\u00e1rs of this island shall be obliged to let the Bhand\u00e1ris have three cocoanut trees in the 100 for drawing toddy at the price of six pice the month for each tree as hath been customary. Further as the fazand\u00e1rs have allowed the Bhand\u00e1ris a greater number of trees than the three per cent aforementioned at their own rate, they shall not take them away during the term of this lease, and the farmers of the Company's carts on this island shall allow the said farmer three trees out of every 100 at the customary rates. But the farmers of the carts may let the farmer of the arrack rent have in the whole to the amount of ... the thousand trees upon the terms they shall agree with. The Bhand\u00e1ris, who may have leave from the farmer to draw toddy and distil arrack, shall pay him monthly for each tree ten and twenty pice or 50 and 100 res that is they shall pay 10 pice or 50 res for the trees hired from the fazand\u00e1rs at their own rates and 20 pice or 100 res for the trees which he has as the three per cent on the said fazand\u00e1rs' estate. That should the farmer suspect or have notice of any persons distilling or selling arrack, he has liberty to make search with the proper officers as hath been customary. And in like manner he may examine any boats or vessels, and where any arrack, except such as by these articles is allowed to be imported, or utensils for distilling it are found, they shall be forfeited and the party offending be fined Rs. 50 to be divided between the Honourable Company and the farmer. That the muk\u00e1dam Esuji Naik, four chaughul\u00e1s and three p\u00e1tils of Bombay with five p\u00e1tils of Mahim shall be obliged to assist and serve the farmer receiving no more than is customary for such assistance. That is the muk\u00e1dam shall have two coits and each of the chaughul\u00e1s and p\u00e1tils one coit. From the two coits the muk\u00e1dam may as usual make arrack and sell it in his own house. He must not sell it elsewhere without being subject to the penalty aforementioned. And although the chaughul\u00e1s and p\u00e1tils may distil their coits, they must as hath been customary sell such arrack to the farmer or be liable to the fine aforementioned. In case the farmer shall receive damage in his farm by any unforeseen accident, such as war, dearth, famine, pestilence, or the like, the Company will make him such an abatement in his rent as may be judged reasonable by the Governor and Council or by any other chosen for that purpose. Should the farmer for the recovery of his debts and dues have occasion to put any of the Bhand\u00e1ris under charge of the guard the several officers at the gates, custom house, and out-posts will be directed to receive such person, and to give the farmer in all other respects such assistance as hath been usual heretofore. He shall also be allowed six sepoys for collecting his debts and every Bhand\u00e1ri that shall be delivered into the custody of the guard must pay no more than six pice at his release. In confirmation whereof the said President and Council have caused the common seal of the said Honourable Company to be affixed in Bombay Castle this first day of August 1743.

Notwithstanding the number of shops for selling arrack are settled, the said farmer is hereby further allowed to erect a shop within the town for selling arrack to the Natives. He is expressly forbid to sell any arrack at the said shop to European soldiers or seamen under such penalty as the President and Council shall think fit to inflict.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 Pub. Diary 16 of 1743, 342-347.\nOn the subject of the arrack farm, in a letter dated the 13th March 1743, the Court of Directors write: In case the new channel that the arrack farm was put into was not effectual to remedy all the abuses that for several years the Bhand\u00e1ris have laboured under from the muk\u00e1damas, you will do well to free that useful set of people from all hardships, by some other regulation of that concern, as far as you are able.\n\nA Consultation of the 30th August 1743 records: Messrs. Dudley Owen and Munro deliver their report of their enquiry into the dispute between the arrack and oat farmers and it is ordered to be entered after this Consultation. As the matters in contest are therein so fully set forth, as well as the way of remedying them in an equitable manner to all parties, this Board unanimously approve and confirm what is proposed in the said report which in future is to be esteemed as the act of the whole Council. It is to be observed that, in order to satisfy them, the arrack farmer, notwithstanding the price he is allowed to receive from the Bhand\u00e1ris for drawing toddy, promises they shall pay only 15 piec a month for each tree in the district of M\u00e1l\u00edm.\n\nThe text of Messrs. George Dudley, Edward Owen, and John Munro's report, dated Bombay 30th August 1743, is as follows: Pursuant to our Honourable President's orders, we have enquired into the disputes and differences that have happened between the farmers of the Honourable Company's oats and the arrack renter and the fazand\u00e1rs of M\u00e1l\u00edm. We have likewise enquired into the pretensions of the Bhand\u00e1ris and now lay before your Honour what appeared to us from our examination. By the tenour of the present arrack renter's lease, the farmers of the Honourable Company's oats and the fazand\u00e1rs of the island, are obliged to let Bhand\u00e1ris have three cocoanut trees in the hundred for drawing toddy at the price of 6\u00bd piec a month for each tree. The oat farmers and fazand\u00e1rs of M\u00e1l\u00edm refuse to give the said three per cent trees to the Bhand\u00e1ris for the following reasons. The oat farmers say there is no article in their lease which obliges them to give the three per cent trees to the Bhand\u00e1ris. But as it was usual for the President and Council to let the Bhand\u00e1ris have three thousand of the Honourable Company's trees at a less price than they gave the fazand\u00e1rs for trees hired of them by agreement, we judge this indulgence was granted in lieu of the three per cent trees and therefore think it but reasonable that the oat farmers should either let the Bhand\u00e1ris have a certain number of trees at an under-rate as the President and Council did, or give them part of the three per cent trees. This our opinion we signified to the oat farmers, who after some hesitation consented to give the Bhand\u00e1ris one tree and a half in every hundred, with which the arrack renter is contented. But the oat farmers seem to expect that they shall be entirely eased of this duty at the expiration of the present arrack farm and not be obliged to give the one and a half per cent trees to the succeeding arrack renter. They likewise hope your Honours will permit them to give those one and a half per cent trees out of the\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Dep. Court's Letters Vol. 3 of 1742-1751, 41.\nnumber of those which you obliged them to keep for bearing of fruit, and not from the three thousand trees assigned in their lease for drawing of toddy. By this concession of the oart farmers we compute they will suffer a yearly loss of about Rs. 418 which goes chiefly to the arrack renter. The fazand\u00e1rs of M\u00e1him by the arrack renter\u2019s lease are obliged to give the three per cent trees to the Bhand\u00e1ris; but the M\u00e1him fazand\u00e1rs object to this condition as uneustomary and desire they may be excused. They say the same has never been exacted from them in time past, and was taken heretofore from the fazand\u00e1rs of Bombay district only. On enquiry into the matter, it appears to us by an article in the former arrack rent leases, that the district of M\u00e1him was subject to allow the three per cent trees as well as the district of Bombay, and this the fazand\u00e1rs of Bombay and M\u00e1him jointly acknowledged in a petition delivered by them to President Cowan in 1732 when they desired liberty to import arrack from the other side for their feasts and christenings. The reason why the three per cent trees have not hitherto been demanded from the M\u00e1him fazand\u00e1rs seems to be because they before let the trees to the Bhand\u00e1ris at an under-rate. As they have been from year to year gradually raising the price of their trees, and this last year brought the Bhand\u00e1ris to accept of only six trees a month for a rupee instead of eight and ten and sometimes twelve given in former years, and moreover as the M\u00e1him trees pay less pension to the Honourable Company than the Bombay trees, it cannot but appear to us unreasonable and unequitable that the M\u00e1him fazand\u00e1rs should be exempted from this three per cent trees, while the Bombay fazand\u00e1rs are obliged to pay it. We do not find the Bhand\u00e1ris have any real and just cause of complaint, as the price given them by the farmers for their arrack of two and three quarters rupees a man yields them according to the best information we have been able to obtain a clear yearly profit of near Rs. 50,000, notwithstanding the present high price given by them for cocoanut trees to draw the toddy from. This sum we esteem more than sufficient to maintain them and their families, being near Rs. 6 a month for the labour of each man supposing their number to be seven hundred men. We submit the whole to the consideration and determination of your Honour.\n\nThe settlement proposed by the Committee seems to have failed to give satisfaction. Two years later, Consultation of the 1st March 1745, the Board were considering a petition from the Bhand\u00e1ris setting forth some hardships they allege they labour under from the farmers of the Honourable Company\u2019s oarts and fazand\u00e1rs of whom they hire trees for drawing toddy. On this a Committee was appointed and made a report which was approved. The portions of the Diary containing the report are torn.\n\nIn the following year (1746) the Bhand\u00e1ris made a fresh petition. A Consultation of 20th June 1746 records: Read a letter from sundry Bhand\u00e1ris setting forth in behalf of themselves and as representatives of their caste the great sufferers they have been by reason of the arrack\n\n---\n\n1 Pub.

In consideration of this they offer to give the Honourable Company the sum of Rs. 30,000 a year to be paid on the same terms on which the last farmer held. For security of the just and punctual payment thereof they proffer Manuel Barretto further offering to take whatever arrack may remain in the former farmer's hands at the rate he bought it, and likewise pay for the shops built for vending the arrack and the utensils belonging to the said farm at a valuation put upon them by indifferent persons appointed by us. This proposal being debated two objections occur why we should demur immediately accepting the same, one is because it is usual to let farms to the highest bidder at the public outcry; the other is because the time now desired exceeds the customary term of years the said farm has been leased. In reply to the first of these objections it is observed that the present offer is Rs. 3000 more than the arrack farm was let for last term, and, although it might possibly yield something more if disposed of at public auction, yet considering that by accepting this offer the frequent complaints the Bhand\u00e1ris made during the last three years will in all probability cease, the Board is of opinion that for these reasons the first objection will appear to be removed. In order to remove the objection to the excessive term of the farm the Bhand\u00e1ris and their security Manuel Barretto were called in. The President tells them that as the term the arrack farm has always been let for is only three years, the Board does not choose to alter the customary method by granting it to them for five. To this they replied that the sum they offered is greater than ever the arrack farm was let for and as the first year will be chiefly spent in preparations for carrying on the business they hope to be indulged with an additional two years or they shall be sufferers by advancing so considerably on this farm. All this being duly considered by the Board it is unanimously agreed that the arrack farm be let to D\u00e1dju Naik and all the Bhand\u00e1ris belonging to this island on the terms they propose, Manuel Barretto being security for them to the Honourable Company and they allowing the muk\u00e1dam two coits and the chaughul\u00e1s and p\u00e1t\u00eds one coit each as has heretofore been customary. Directed therefore that the Secretary prepare articles to be interchangeably passed between the Honourable Company and said renters on the 1st of August next being the time the present farmer's lease expires and a separate bond to be executed by Manuel Barretto as security for the punctual payment of the rent in the usual manner.\n\nThe following are the details of the articles of agreement made and entered into between the Honourable William Wake Esq. President and Governor of Bombay in Council on the part and on behalf of the Honourable United East India Company and D\u00e1dju\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 19 of 1746, 197-199.

The administration of this farm by the appointment of all the Bhand\u00e1ris to be with Manuel Barretto who is security for the due payment of the rent to the Honourable Company:\n\nThat the said President and Council do by these presents grant unto D\u00e1d\u00e1ji N\u00e1ik and all the Bhand\u00e1ris the arrack farm and aut sal\u00e1mi of this island Bombay, for five years at the yearly rate of Rs. 30,000 which sum the said D\u00e1d\u00e1ji N\u00e1ik and Manuel Barretto with the assistance of the muk\u00e1dam chaughul\u00e1s and p\u00e1tils are to divide amongst all the Bhand\u00e1ris and is to be made good and paid to the said President and Council or to their successors in manner following: that is to say three months from the date hereof or on the 1st day of November the sum of Rs. 2500 and so on successively on the first day of every month until the expiration of this farm when the full amount is to be paid. In consideration of this the following conditions and privileges are granted the said farmers: That all the Indian inhabitants of this island of what quality soever be forbid to bring sell or distil on it either for sale or for their own use any sort of arrack single, double, treble, or rice and j\u00e1gri (raw sugar) arrack without leave from the said D\u00e1d\u00e1ji N\u00e1ik and other farmers as has been customary on penalty of Rs. 50, one-half to the Honourable Company and the other to the said farmers. And when they or any foreign merchants shall bring Goa arrack for sale and shall not be able to vend the same among the English inhabitants the importer in such case shall be obliged to tender it to the farmers and upon their refusing to buy it may then be at liberty to sell it to any of the country people. At the same time the buyer shall be obliged to sell not less than a hogshead at one time on penalty of Rs. 50 for every offence appropriated as aforementioned. That the said farmers may set up four shops at Bombay, namely three to vend arrack to the European soldiers and sailors and no more, that is to say, one at a convenient distance without each of the town gates and in like manner one within the town wall to sell only to the natives, and two other shops namely one at Mahim and one at Sion. At the same time they may sell arrack at their own houses without the town to the natives or set up as many other shops as they shall think proper for that purpose the Honourable Company allowing them ground for the same as well as for the five shops, and all charges of building shall be on the farmers' account. That the farmers shall not sell, or permit to be sold by those under their direction, any kind of arrack to the European soldiers or sailors at their own houses or at other shops than those five mentioned in the foregoing article under the penalty of Rs. 50 for each offence to be paid to the Honourable Company, nor shall they entertain any European soldier or sailor after sunset or suffer them to be drunk at their shops. In case any such soldiers or sailors will not depart or return to the barracks then the said D\u00e1d\u00e1ji N\u00e1ik or his people shall give notice to the officers of the gates who will send a guard for them. But if the said D\u00e1d\u00e1ji N\u00e1ik or his people neglect to acquaint the officers, he shall be fined Rs. 50 and the servants or other Bhand\u00e1ris punished as they may deserve. That the farmers shall sell their\nChapter VIII.\nRevenue and Finance.\nArrack Farm Articles, 1746.\n\ndouble distilled arrack at 7 pice the ser and single distilled at 4 pice the ser full measure and without any mixture, so that any person buying arrack shall see that it is good and full measure before he carries it from the shop. If it proves bad or short in measure, the person so endeavouring to impose upon the buyer shall, if the buyer insists upon it, go with him and carry the arrack to the clerk of the market, and, if the complaint has been found just, the farmers or their servants shall be subject to the penalty of 16 larees for every offence, to be paid to the clerk of the market as customary. No complaint shall be admitted after the arrack has been carried by the buyer from the shop except in manner aforesaid. That, as has been customary except in the Honourable Company's carts, the fazandars of this island shall be obliged to let the Bhandaris have three coconut trees in every 100 for drawing toddy at the price of 6\u00bd pice a month for each tree. And as the fazandars have allotted to the Bhandaris a greater number of trees than the three per cent aforementioned at their own rate, the fazandars shall not take the trees away till the said Bhandaris are provided with others. In case any dispute should arise between any of the fazandars and Bhandaris concerning the goodness of the trees, the same is to be decided by a proper person appointed by the Collector for that purpose. The farmers of the Honourable Company's carts may let them have 3000 coconut trees as permitted by their lease and likewise furnish them with 2000 more upon the terms they shall agree upon if the cart-farmers think proper. That no Bhandaris shall release or give up their trees so occupied without first acquainting the said Dadaji Naik who will enquire into it and give leave if he thinks proper. In this case the said trees must be allotted to other Bhandaris. Should the farmers suspect or have notice of any persons distilling or selling arrack they have liberty to search with proper officers as has been customary and in like manner they may examine any boats or vessels. When any arrack except such as by these articles is allowed to be imported or utensils for distributing it are found, they shall be forfeited and the party offending fined Rs. 50, half to the Honourable Company and half to the farmers. The mukadam Esuji Naik, the chaughulias and patils of Bombay and Mahim shall be obliged to help the farm and give their assistance to the managers thereof receiving no more than is customary for such assistance. That is to say the mukadam shall have two coits (koits that is the number of palms one man or toddy-knife can tap) and each of the chaughulias and patils one coit. In case the farmers shall receive damage in their farm by any unforeseen accident such as war, dearth, famine, pestilence, or the like the Honourable Company will make them such an abatement in their rent as may be judged reasonable by the Governor and Council. Should the farmers for the recovery of their debts and dues have occasion to put any person under charge of the guard, the several officers at the gates custom-house and outposts will be directed to receive such persons and to give the farmers in all other respects such assistance as has been usual. They shall also be allowed ten sepoys for collecting their debts and every person that shall be delivered into the custody of the guard must pay no more than six pice at his release. In case any of the Bhandaris do not duly pay the cart-farmers or fazandars for their coconut trees used by the Bhandaris for drawing toddy, the Bhandaris must be\nimpeded by the said fazandars and oart-farmers by tying round the trees a green cocoanut leaf.\\footnote{The practice of preventing climbers by tying a green cocoanut leaf round the trunk of a cocoanut tree has now almost ceased. The sense seems to be that to step over the green leaf was an insult which the tree-spirit would not endure.} If that will not induce the Bhandaris to give satisfaction, application must be made to the Collector or the Chief of Mahim who will take the proper methods to oblige them. But the said oart-farmers or the said fazandars shall take no other methods to oppress them under pretence of recovering their debts. In confirmation whereof to that part of the agreement which remains with the said Dadaji Naik and the rest of the Bhandaris the said President and Council have caused the common seal of the said Honourable Company to be affixed and to the other part the said Dadaji Naik and the underwritten as representatives of all the Bhandaris have set their hands and seals this the first day of August 1746.

(6) All tobacco landed on the island of Bombay by any person whatever shall be lodged in a warehouse under the key of said farmers. In case the customer think it convenient to have another lock to the same he may do it; and any person whatever disputing or cavilling about these conditions and privileges, unless he be a party concerned, shall be subject to a fine of Rs. 300, half to the Honourable Company and half to the said farmers. (7) That the said farmers shall make just and full payment of the amount of said farm being in all Rs. 87,675 in thirty-six equal monthly payments of Rs. 2435-1-60\u00bd, the first instalment to be paid two months from the present date in silver or pice at the rate of eighty pice to the rupee, and the amount of the tobacco which the Honourable Company may supply them withal shall be made good in like manner.

This being explained to the merchants the farm was put up at Rs. 30,000 when Savaji Dharamset was the highest bidder at Rs. 44,000 a year, who immediately declared M\u00e1nekji Navroji and Dhanji Gop\u00e1l to be his partners in whose name it is directed a contract be drawn out on the 25th of next month when the present lease expires and entered in the diary under that date.\n\nto the tenour of these conditions against any persons presuming to run tobacco or snuff.

This question being put to the several members of the Board, they were unanimously of opinion that as Mr. Rawdon at present executes that trust in a due and faithful manner, it would be unjust to remove him merely to make room for one a little above him in standing at the Board. Besides the members notice that the authority on which Mr. Sedgwick founds his claim was countermanded by the Honourable Company in the 95th paragraph of their commands dated the 11th of March 1735, where they direct that the several members of the Board should have such employes assigned them as they may be judged most capable of discharging for the Company's interest, and that neither the customs nor any other post should be confined to the third or fourth of Council.\u00b9\n\nIn a letter dated 7th May 1746, the Court write: The considerable reduction of our charges, and increase of our revenues since Mr. Wake came to the chair afford us great satisfaction. These are solid proofs of a true attachment to our interest, and we rely on a continuance thereof, with respect to your place and every subordinate factory.\u00b2\n\nOn the 14th November 1747 the Bombay Government write to the Court: The mortality among your covenant servants obliges us to request your Honours will send us a suitable supply, being bare at present here as well as at the subordinate settlements. In another letter dated 15th March 1748, the Bombay Government repeat their request.\u00b3\n\nIn a letter dated the 15th March 1748 the Court of Directors order and appoint the undermentioned persons to be their Council at Bombay, namely William Wake Esquire, President, and Governor; Mr. Richard Bourchier, Second in Council and to succeed to the chair in case of the demise or absence of Mr. Wake; Major Goodyere on arrival to be and to remain Third; Mr. William Sedgwick, Fourth, and always to remain Fourth, Mr. Thomas Marsh, Fifth; Mr. Robert Rawdon, Sixth; Mr. Richard Sanders, Seventh; Mr. George Scott, Eighth; Mr. William West, Ninth; Mr. John Sewell, Tenth; Mr. Henry Savage, Eleventh; Mr. Thomas Dorrill, Twelfth; Mr. Thomas Lane, Thirteenth.\u2074\n\nIn a letter of the 15th March 1748 the Court write: In compliance with your repeated requests for a supply of covenant servants, we have entertained twelve writers on your establishment.\u2075\n\n\u00b9 Pub.

George Bourchier being at Bombay is to execute the enclosed covenants, which are to be returned to us. We have permitted David Lopez Fernandes, Samuel de Castro, and Norton Nicholls to reside in India as Free Merchants, the two first in the diamond and coral way. We have likewise permitted Francis Hodges and William Dogan to reside in India in the seafaring way, provided they behave in a satisfactory manner. James Wilson has our leave to go to any of our settlements in India and succeed as a Surgeon to any vacancy, wherever he is wanted and approved of.\n\nIn a letter of the 15th March 1748 the Court write: If it has not already been done, all the new Members of Council must be sworn to be true and faithful to the Company. We find several of our servants on the Bombay establishment are under no legal obligations for the faithful discharge of their duty to the Company. We hereby acquaint you that, in stations where security is always required, we will have no persons employed in our service who are not under covenants, and have not given, or are not ready to give, the usual security in England for the faithful discharge of their duty. That our orders on this head may be immediately complied with, we have enclosed a list of the names of the persons for whom security is required as well as the names of such as are to execute covenants. You must observe it as a Standing Rule that as soon as any of our junior servants come of age, they are to enter into fresh covenants, which you must get executed accordingly and transmit to us. It must likewise be a Standing Rule, that as our servants respectively advance in station, they write to their friends in England to give the usual security for such advanced station.\n\nOn the 5th November 1748 the Bombay Government write to the Court: The widow of the late Mr. Richard Sanders requesting a monthly allowance on account of her being left with two children in low circumstances, of the truth of which we being well assured and also in consideration of the husband\u2019s long and faithful services to your Honours, we were induced in a Consultation of the 19th August last to make her the same allowance that Mr. Morley\u2019s widow obtained. For the like reason we that day consented to grant the widow Aitkens her husband\u2019s half pay. Both these allowances were struck off upon receipt of your orders by Orford, expressing a dissatisfaction at such steps without your previous leave being first obtained.\n\nOn the 7th March 1749 the Court of Directors write to Bombay: It is with difficulty and uncertainty we can collect from your books the appointments of our several servants. You are therefore for our information hereby directed to cause a list to be drawn out of our covenant servants, and, from the Governor to the writer, to distinguish the yearly salary and allowances of each, as well as all allowances annexed by way of gratuity or otherwise to particular posts.

All which accounts drawn out in a concise and methodical manner are to be sent us by the first opportunity and continued annually.\n\nIn a letter of the 7th March 1749 the Court write: We have appointed the following writers upon the Bombay establishment, who take their passage on these ships. They are to take their standing as we have placed them, namely Anthony Chester, James Ryley, John Watson, John Grose, Robert Moffat, and Robert Erskine. As all are full sixteen years of age and have gone through a course of merchants' accounts we apprehend they will be immediately useful.\n\nA Consultation of the 8th April 1749 records: There being a want of hands to carry on the business in the Secretary's office and no covenant servants to spare from the other offices, it is agreed that Mr. Thomas Mostyn be entertained as a monthly writer on the usual terms of Rs. 30 a month.\n\nA Consultation of the 24th January 1749 records: As the Post of Custom Master and Land Pay Master of Bombay will become vacant on Mr. Sewell's departure, Mr. William West is appointed to receive charge of the Customs, and Mr. Hugh Symmons provisionally of the land pay office.\n\nA Consultation of the 9th May 1749 records: It is agreed that we admit Mr. Thomas Hodges our present Secretary to a seat at the Board and accordingly administer to him the usual oath of fidelity. Directed that he receive from Mr. William West the charge of the Bombay Custom House and deliver to Mr. John Spencer his post of clerk of the market. As Mr. Spencer is at present Accountant General, it is agreed that a letter be wrote to the Mayor's Court acquainting them that we esteem Mr. Peter Elwin Wrench a proper person to succeed to that office, and therefore recommend him accordingly with the usual salary for his trouble. Directed likewise that Mr. Hodges deliver to Mr. Obadiah Cummings the charge of the Secretary's office with all books and papers belonging thereto. Mr. Cummings is directed to receive the same, the oath of fidelity having been first administered to him.\n\nA Consultation of the 17th November 1749 records: The Bombay Custom Master representing that the measurage of grain and other articles in the Custom House had hitherto been committed to the care of a sepoy, who is a very improper person for that employ as he cannot perform it with the necessary exactness or keep any regular accounts. As further the merchants have frequently complained of the weighments, it is directed that in future a Purvoe be employed on this service at the wage of Rs. 5 a month, when it will be performed with exactness and to the satisfaction of the merchants.\n\n---\n\n1 Pub.

When any fine becomes really just and necessary, we insist that the same be moderate and paid into cash, noting the true cause for levying thereof. We strenuously recommend to you to have a watchful eye on the conduct of our servants in general that order and integrity may be completely established.\n\nOn the 7th March 1749 the Court continue: We think it necessary to direct you to observe it as a standing order for the future that no person be suffered to come to England until he has fully and satisfactorily adjusted all accounts depending between him and the Company.\n\nRegarding the Government of Bombay in 1750 Grose writes: The Government of this island is entirely English, subordinate to the Court of Directors of the United Companies of merchants of England trading to the East Indies, who appoint by commission a President to whom they join a Council consisting of nine persons. The whole number of them are rarely or rather never on the spot, being employed as Chiefs of the several factories subordinate to that Presidency. Those of the Council as are at Bombay are appointed to the posts of the greatest trust such as accountant warehouse-keeper land-paymaster marine paymaster and other offices for transacting the Company's affairs. They are generally such as have risen by degrees from the station of writers and take place, unless otherwise ordered from Home, according to the seniority of the service. As to the military and marine force, it is considered as more immediately under the direction of the President, who is entitled General and Commander-in-chief, though nothing material is supposed to be ordered concerning either without the concurrence of the Council.\n\nA Consultation of the 15th November 1750 records: The state of the President's, the Honourable William Wake's, ill-health requiring his removing to England, he now delivers over to Mr. Bourchier the balance of the running cash being Rs. 97,766-0-89, the balance of the Bank being Rs. 58,342-2-34, the balance remaining in the treasury being Rs. 3,00,156-3-5, also the balance of Foreign silver being 5813 pounds 4 ounces as per receipts following this Consultation. He intends taking his passage to England on the *Boscawen*.\n\nIn a letter dated the 6th March 1750 the Court write: We have appointed the four following persons writers upon your establishment,\n\n---\n\n1 Pub.

These four with the writers sent the two preceding seasons will, we apprehend, be a sufficient number to assist in the various branches of your business. Except Mr. Percival, whose friends have given us full satisfaction of his being qualified in both respects, the young gentlemen above mentioned, as well as those appointed last season, have all produced proper certificates of their being full sixteen years of age, and that they have gone through a regular course of arithmetic and merchants' accounts. We therefore make no doubt but that they will be immediately useful. As we have made it a standing resolution not to choose any writer unless he can produce certificates of his being full sixteen years of age, and having gone through a regular course of arithmetic and merchants' accounts, and as we are not acquainted whether Captain Mostyn's son is so qualified, we cannot comply with your recommendations for appointing him a writer, until we are informed by you whether he is qualified agreeable to our aforesaid resolution. You must encourage all our servants to learn the necessary country languages. We also recommend the shifting them from one employment to another, as the best means of obtaining a general knowledge of our affairs, and consequently of becoming useful servants.\n\nA Consultation of the 3rd May 1750 records: There being a want of hands to carry on the business in the Secretary's office, agreed that Mr. William Percival be entertained as a monthly writer at the usual allowance of Rs. 30 a month.\n\nIn a letter of the 6th March 1750 the Court write: Several of our servants have not yet complied with our orders with regard to their giving security. If they expect to continue in our service they must write to their friends to give security immediately. We have sent by the ships East Court and Prince George some blank covenants to be executed by such of our servants as have not done the same since they have come to the age of twenty-one years.\n\nOn the 10th May 1751 Bombay writes to the Court: We beg leave to acquaint your Honours that notwithstanding the supplies of servants you have been pleased to send out these two last years, yet, by the death of some and the removal of others to the assistance of subordinates from whence they still write for more, we are now so bare of servants here as not to have sufficient hands to keep up the current business in the public offices, but are obliged contrary to your orders to employ monthly writers. We must therefore desire your Honours' regard to this particular as also to our former request for a supply of proper men for subaltern officers.\n\nIn a letter dated the 22nd May 1751 the Court write: We are come to a resolution that all persons who for the future shall have our\n\n---\n\n1 Pub.

All persons who have leave to take servants with them to reside in India are to give bond in the like penalty for every servant, to indemnify the Company against any charges and disbursements they may be subject to for such servants.\n\nOn the 21st August 1751 the Court write to Bombay: An Act passed the last Sessions of Parliament for regulating the commencement of the year and for correcting the calendar now in use to which a particular attention must be had. In order to prevent any mistakes in our books, calculations, and accounts we have sent some copies of the said Act in this ship's packet.\n\nIn a letter dated the 4th March 1752 the Court order that the Bombay Council shall consist of thirteen persons only.\n\nIn a letter dated the 4th March 1752 the Court note the appointment of twelve, and in a letter of the 5th April 1754, of eight writers upon the Bombay establishment.\n\nIn a letter of the 4th March 1752 the Court write: Your books and papers in general are badly written, and in particular the Consultations are copied with such a loose hand, that they swell to an inconvenient size, as for the same reason do most of your other books and papers. For the future you must take care that our servants do their duty in this respect in a better manner.\n\nA Consultation of the 31st March 1752 records: The gentlemen in the several offices complaining that the sepoys allotted them, being on the military rolls, are frequently called off from their employ which is very inconvenient and a great hindrance to business, resolved that each gentleman deliver in a list of what sepoys are necessary to assist in their respective offices to be laid before the Board next Council day.\n\nOn the 3rd April 1752 the Board records: Agreeable to the resolution of last Council the gentlemen in the several offices deliver in a list of sepoys necessary to assist in their business. It is agreed that such offices as have monthly account currents with the Honourable Company shall have a certain number of sepoys allotted to them. These sepoys are to be struck off the military rolls and charged in the accounts of the office, as it is evident sepoys will be more immediately useful when entirely dependent on the several offices than while they continue on the present footing.

The Secretary is directed to acquaint the Mayor that the guard must be paid by the Court if it has sufficient capital. Accordingly on the 21st April 1752, after reading a letter from the Mayor's Court, the Board record: Read a letter from the Acting Mayor, representing that the Court's stock is so small that it is not able to maintain an officer and eight sepoys unless the Board will allow it part of the fines. Resolved as the Court's capital is so small, it is more eligible and advantageous for the Honourable Company to allow them an officer and eight sepoys out of their military than to admit of their receiving any part of the fines which may be considerable.\n\nIn a letter dated the 4th March 1752 the Court write: Although we find in general an increase in the revenues of the Bombay Presidency, yet they fall greatly short of the charges and expenses. We therefore most earnestly recommend it to you to think of and put in practice every method to encourage trade and increase the number of substantial inhabitants at Bombay, that we may at least have the satisfaction of finding the revenues adequate to the charges and expenses. At present it is with great concern we must acquaint you we are carrying on a very losing trade to your side of India.\n\nA Consultation of the 18th August 1753 records: The Honourable Company having been pleased to send a commission by the Stafford nominating the Honourable Richard Bourchier Esq. President and Governor, resolved that Tuesday next the 21st August be appointed for publishing the commission at the Fort Gate. The Secretary is directed to summon all the European inhabitants, Black merchants, and others.\n\nAccordingly on the 21st August the Secretary mounted on horseback read the President's commission at the Fort Gate, the covenant servants, European inhabitants, Black merchants, and others attending. The regiment being drawn up fired three volleys of small arms and the Fort twenty-one pieces of ordnance which was answered from all the ships in the road.\n\n---\n\n1 The details of the sepoys to be charged in the monthly accounts of the different offices are: Bombay Custom House and New M\u00e1ndvi, 2 officers and 16 sepoys, total 18; Old M\u00e1ndvi, 2 sepoys; New Bandar Marine Yard and Pier Head, 1 officer and 10 sepoys, total 11; Land Pay Office, 1 officer and 9 sepoys, total 10; Military Pay Office, 2 sepoys; Purser Marine's Office and Master Attendant, (a) at the Marine house 1 officer and 8 sepoys, (b) at the office 2 sepoys at the Marine Yard; 4 sepoys with the Master Attendant; Warehouse, 1 naik and 4 sepoys; Mahim Custom House, 3 for Mori chauki, 3 for the chauki between the M\u00e1ndvi and Fort, 2 for the M\u00e1ndvi, 2 attending the passage boat, 14 going the rounds carrying reports and other services; Collector of the rents and revenues, 2 sepoys recovering the Pension, 2 sepoys recovering Quit Rents, 1 attending Batty Grounds, 1 attending Mahim Batty Grounds, 1 sepoys attending salt pans, 2 sepoys attending cooeries, 2 sepoys at the Collector's chauki; Mint Master, 3 sepoys; General and Military Stores, 2 officers and 10 sepoys.\n\n2 Pub.

You may assure them we shall have a particular regard to such as shall so usefully qualify themselves in order to which their names must be transmitted to us from time to time. Some books in the Persic language are now sent out for the use of such as shall attempt that language, but you must take care they are always carefully preserved from being lost.\n\nIn 1753 the state of the finances seems less discouraging. In a letter dated the 14th March 1753 the Court write: We must do you the justice to acknowledge that there appears a proper care in you to increase the revenues. We hope your conduct in this branch of our affairs will continue to merit our approbation.\n\nThe improvement continued in the following year. In a letter of the 5th April 1754 the Court write: It gives us a sensible pleasure to observe improvements in our revenues. More particularly in that branch of revenue the customs, which have been gradually increasing, and according to your state of it in the year 1751 amounted to about Rs. 19,000 more than the customs ever before produced. We recommend your care for the improvements of the revenues in general, and we hope for a continuance of improvement, as we must repeat to you that our only dependance for any advantage from your Presidency is upon the profits of our export and the revenues.\n\nThe prosperity continued during the following year. On the 26th March 1755 the Court write: It gives us great pleasure to observe by your last set-off books that our rents and revenues are still increasing and that they exceed the amount of the preceding years by upwards of Rs. 60,000. It is a particular satisfaction to us to observe that near two-thirds of that increase arises from our customs. As you have convinced us of your attention to this material branch of our affairs, we are persuaded you will still continue it. In particular that you will give all fitting encouragement for the passing through the island, the goods for the Mokha and Basra markets and Bengal freight goods carried inland, which you inform us till lately went by the way of Surat.\n\nIn the same letter the Court continue: We cannot help observing that the manner of your keeping the accounts of our cash is not agreeable to our original orders and intention, and is different from the practice at our other Presidencies. It appears that almost all receipts and payments are brought to account in the running cash kept\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Dep. Court's Letters Vol. 4 of 1752-1756, 81.\n2 Pub. Dep.

We therefore think it is necessary to revive the standing order contained in our commands of the 2nd March 1738, and direct your punctual compliance therewith, excepting that part as to the Third in Council, in lieu of whom is to be substituted the Fourth, it being in the following words, namely: We direct that a Committee of Treasury be appointed as we have here, and that the same consist of the President and the Second and Third at Bombay for the time being, and that all our bullion rupees and other treasure be kept by them under three different locks, except a running cash of about one hundred thousand rupees, which must be in the President's possession. The balance of the same with what is in the bullion office must be monthly produced before the whole Council and the amounts entered upon Consultation.\n\nIn a letter dated the 5th April 1754 the Court write: We would discourage and as far as possible put a stop to the custom of employing black people in your writing business. You must take care that all our servants, and more particularly the younger sort, are constantly employed. If the present number is not sufficient for the various branches of your business, inform us how many more are wanting and you shall be fully supplied.\n\nOn the 21st February 1755, Bombay writes to the Court: We shall always have a watchful eye over the carriage and conduct of your servants in general and are glad we have an opportunity of assuring your Honours that their behaviour is so satisfactory in all respects that it became entirely unnecessary for us to enter into a quarterly inquiry thereinto.\n\nThe 1756 returns show a continued increase in customs. In a letter of the 31st March 1756, paragraph 91, the Court write: We must attribute the increase of Rs. 14,504-1-12 in our customs to the encouragement given to trade. We hope under your care to find the customs annually increasing.\n\nIn a letter dated the 4th of May 1757 the Court write: Our President's emoluments are large, and certain infinitely superior to those of Bengal and Madras. The appointment for his table and servants, Rs. 912 a month and Rs. 2400 a year for festivals, is a noble establishment. It ought to support our Governors without attempting to load us with the least additional expense. Whenever this allowance has been exceeded, as in the case of Mr. Horne, we have ordered a refund. It is true Governor Wake did most unwarrantably charge us with many articles, but he died before that was discovered or we should have demanded the difference. We are extremely sorry to see that in this respect Mr. Bouchier has gone much beyond his\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Dep. Court's Letters Vol. 4 of 1752-1756, 223.

We therefore do expect and order repayment of every such exceeding. Some of those as prepared by our auditor we shall here point out. These for want of time may still be very imperfect. But we shall depend upon your restoring the whole to its original establishment, as you value our service. The following are our President's exceedings for the year 1755:\n\n| President's Exceedings, 1755. |\n|--------------------------------|\n| Carrying the President's Things to and from Parel | Rs. q. r. |\n| Somerados for his servants | 369 2 48 |\n| Cooks Butlers and Bigaris assisting | 81 3 70 |\n| Provisions 3 mos. 10 ds. only for his Elephant | 385 8 90 |\n| Charges attending Poultry at Parel | 812 3 52 |\n| Do. the President's servants' provisions at Parel | 27 1 50 |\n| Do. do. do. do. at Butcher's Island | 177 1 90 |\n| Sundries supplied to the Fort House Cook Room | 22 2 16 |\n| Do. do. at Parel | 490 2 37 |\n| Carrying Sheep to Parel | 231 1 56 |\n| Sundries to the Fort House Dispense or Pantry | 6 2 40 |\n| Do. the artillery at Parel | 167 0 93 |\n| Women making bread for the President | 13 0 33 |\n| Wax cloth covering the President's Things | 75 5 50 |\n| Hire of billet wood and salt to the Fort House | 15 0 0 |\n| Bigaris looking after the cattle | 76 3 85 |\n| Do. do. do. at Parel | 91 1 0 |\n| Do. employed in the Fort House Dispense | 625 0 49 |\n| Oil | 626 1 41 |\n| Cocoanut Oil | 233 1 51 |\n| Fencing Mazzagon and Church Mango Trees | 303 1 11 |\n| Liveries for the President's servants, coolies, and gardeners only, formerly charged though not allowed Rs. 55, now Rs. 578; difference | 102 1 36 |\n| Total | 5418 2 8 |\n\nIf any of the above articles are improperly charged, as some without any explanation are lumped in the accounts before us, those you will deduct and mention them particularly. In future we agree that the sum of one hundred rupees a year be charged for servants' liveries and no more.\n\nIn reply on the 8th April 1758 the Bombay Government write to the Court: The President begs leave to tell your Honours how much he is concerned to find himself so particularly censured for what he hopes you will not think him so greatly blameable in when he informs you of some particulars which he desires to set in a true light. The President's present emoluments are so far short of what your Honours imagine that, by his endeavours to raise Bombay and to bring the trade from Surat, that once noble perquisite of consulage is now sunk under Rs. 7000 a year, and the mint is reduced to less than Rs. 3000. His allowance for the three festivals is no more than Rs. 600 instead of Rs. 2400 as your Honours suppose. Still whatever you please to order will be a law with him. He really thought his predecessor had been an example of frugality which had so much recommended his predecessor to your favour that it made him determine to keep as near his predecessor's standard as possible. But your late land-paymaster was not only a weak but an indolent man who permitted his purvoes\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Dep. Court's Letters Vol. 5 of 1757-1761, 38-40.\nto lump many things to save themselves trouble and very probably to hide impositions. In future nothing more shall be charged on the President's account than what has been always customary. Since the arrival of the ships your President has been too fully employed to make a thorough scrutiny into those accounts. This will be done after the ships' departure. At the same time your Honours will permit him to make a few remarks, namely that the elephant is called, but very improperly the President's, for he is your Honours' property and the greatest honour the Company had ever conferred on them at this island. And is what could not be refused nor can we well destroy it as its destruction would be deemed very scandalous. If your Honours think proper that the Governor shall not have any servants in livery, he will lay them aside in future, for Rs. 100, your Honours must well know, will not clothe two servants on Bombay. His last remark is that provisions are allowed by every body to be full three times the price they were when Mr. Law was here (1739-1742), which he hopes your Honours will take into consideration, as you likewise will the appointing a successor to the Presidency his age and infirmities requiring a recess from business. He relies on your Honours' wonted goodness to excuse him if he has said anything in these paragraphs regarding himself which he ought not.\n\nAs regards the censure passed upon them the Bombay Government continue: We are concerned that your Honours should have any cause to censure the conduct of the Committee of accounts appointed by us who desire to assure you that they will endeavour to the utmost of their abilities to answer the intention of their institution as well as those at your other two Presidencies. Had they thought what your Honours call irregularities and excesses really such they would have certainly remarked them to us before such accounts had passed. Many different expenses have been lumped under the head of stable charges, but, as your Honours order they shall stand at Rs. 8000 a year, it shall be a standing rule not to exceed that sum.\n\nIn reply, in a letter dated the 25th April 1759, the Court write: Our President seems to think we have been too severe, although we have treated him with the utmost tenderness. His predecessor was certainly an economist in every instance but his domestic department. There, as we have already told you, we had great reason to complain. But if Mr. Bourchier had looked back to Mr. Law's Government, he would have found that not a single article of the exceedings ever existed, whilst he held the chair. Yet so careful were we of suffering any charge not allowed, that you will find this very gentleman at Bombay repaid nearly four hundred rupees for table linen which he was sensible should not have been our expense. Therefore whatever shall appear on examination to be beyond the allowances to our Presidents, such amount we order and direct shall be repaid into our treasury. We did not know that the elephant was our\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Dep. Letters to the Court Vol. 5 of 1758, 112-113.\n2 Pub. Dep. Letters to the Court Vol. 5 of 1758, 111.\n3 Pub. Dep.

We direct that you take the first opportunity of easing us of this burthen. As our President has signified his desire to be relieved, we shall in the following part of this letter give the necessary directions for settling the Government of the Presidency accordingly. The established stipends and allowances respecting our President and all others are known to you and from the years 1739 to 1742 we had no cause to complain. The stable charges is an article you are not to meddle with. We have settled that ourselves and if the annual sum should exceed Rs. 8000, the difference shall be paid by our President. And now for the last time we call upon our Committee of accounts to do their duty. If they neglect to rectify abuses they shall feel the weight of our resentment. No branch is to escape their inspection. We require their particular attention to our several paymasters' accounts and the immense charges for fortifications.\n\nThe Court continue: It was not our intention to remove Mr. Bouchier as his conduct in general was to our satisfaction. But as it is his inclination and desire to quit the chair, we shall now proceed to regulate and fix your establishment. We accordingly direct and appoint Charles Crommelin Esqr. to be President and Governor of our island of Bombay, and that he take the chair on the last day of February 1760 or sooner if Governor Bouchier shall choose to resign. And in case of the death or absence of Mr. Crommelin, we appoint Thomas Hodges Esquire to be Governor of Bombay. And on the death or absence of Mr. Hodges it is our pleasure that those of Council next below Mr. Hodges succeed to the government in turn as we shall rank them. All those of Council standing above Mr. Hodges are barred from the succession. We do hereby appoint the following persons to be our Governor and Council for the management of our affairs under your Presidency: Charles Crommelin Esqr. President and Governor, to take the chair on the last day of February 1760, or sooner if Mr. Bouchier should resign. George Scott 2nd of Council, to rise no higher; Thomas Byfeld 3rd, Thomas Hodges 4th (to succeed as President and Governor in case of the death or absence of Mr. Crommelin), Alexander Douglas 5th, Brabazon Ellis 6th, William Hornby 7th, William Andrew Price 8th, John Spencer 9th, Samuel Hough 10th, Thomas Whitehill 11th, Charles Waters 12th. A commission agreeable to this appointment is sent in the packet by the ship Harcourt.\n\nIn the matter of the elephant, on the 27th February 1760, Bombay replies: We are glad to acquaint your Honours that a very fair opportunity presented for easing you of the charge incurred by the elephant given your Honours by N\u00e1na (B\u00e1l\u00e1ji Peshwa, 1740 - 1761), namely by sending it to Phar\u00e1s Kh\u00e1n at Surat as a mark of your favour, and in consideration of his services and assistance in procuring\n\n---\n\n1 Pub.

To Phar\u00e1s Khan\u2019s great disappointment the elephant unluckily died on the road. We intend to consider Phar\u00e1s Kh\u00e1n\u2019s services in some other as frugal a manner as we can and have ordered your servants to support his full authority as Naib.\n\nRegarding the Court\u2019s complaint of bad handwriting, on the 8th April 1758 Bombay writes: We are sensible that your Honours have had sufficient reason to complain of the Consultations being often ill transcribed. Our Secretary represents that Mr. William Hughes, Writer, copied the set transmitted two years ago and apprehends Mr. Hughes is chiefly meant as at that time the Secretary was under the necessity of complaining of his negligence to the President. We have reprimanded Mr. Hughes in such a manner as we hope may have the effect on the other assistants to prevent any more complaints.\n\nOn the 12th May 1758 the Court write to Bombay: It gives us much satisfaction to see your Consultations and some other particulars so much fairer, and in all respects better copied than usual. We find they are done by John Torlesse, one of our writers, who is to be acquainted with this notice we have taken. We recommend it to you to encourage as much as possible all our young servants to improve themselves in their writing business that they may transcribe whatever they are set about in as fair and legible a manner as the said Consultations.\n\nIn the same letter, 12th May 1758, the Court write to Bombay: We have received by the Portfield a copy of your book of Standing Orders. We are sorry to observe it is extremely defective especially for these ten or twelve years past, in which period there appears very little collected from our general letters. As we suppose you have no other book of Standing Orders, you must remain in ignorance of many material orders and rules of conduct very necessary for your information. We therefore insist upon your making a more satisfactory and complete collection as soon as possible. When it is finished, you are to send us a copy that we may judge in what manner it is executed.\n\nOn the 27th May 1759 the Bombay Government writes to the Court: A complete collection of the Standing Orders shall be made, and a copy transmitted to your Honours next season.\n\nIn a letter of the 25th April 1759 the Count write: We must remind you of our former orders that, when any of our covenant servants attain the age of twenty-one years, they are to execute fresh covenants. The fresh covenants are to be returned to us properly witnessed. For this purpose we have already sent and shall continue to supply you with blank covenants. As this is a standing and invariable rule we shall expect you will from time to time take care that it is strictly complied with. When a writer advances to the station of a Factor, we are also to remind you an additional security is\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Dep. Letters to the Court Vol. 7 of 1760, 89.\n2 Pub. Dep.

Further security is also to be given as he advances in station, of which every servant must be apprized from time to time that he may write to his friends in England to give such security accordingly. All this is a standing rule.\n\nOn the 27th March 1759, Bombay writes to the Court: The three writers your Honours sent us out this season have been stationed in the Secretary's and accountant's offices where they were much wanted. And as all the subordinates except Surat are likewise in want of assistants and we imagine there will now be occasion for more at that factory, we hope your Honours will furnish us with a suitable number by the next ships agreeable to our repeated requests.\n\nOn the subject of salutes, on the 27th March 1759, Bombay writes: Our firing of the morning and evening gun ceased from the receipt of your Honours' orders of the 5th July last (1757). We have to acquaint you on this occasion that since the beginning of the year 1758, we have made a material saving by returning all salutes from a battery of small guns made purposely between the Bandar and the Fort, instead of using the large guns on the Flag Staff Bastion, as was practised for many years before.\n\nThe same letter of the 27th March 1759 continues: Your Honours were by the last year's ships acquainted with the steps we had taken to render the assistants more careful in transcribing their business and we are glad that the Consultations and other particulars copied by Mr. John Torlesse have proved so much to your satisfaction. The encomium your Honours have bestowed on him has been transmitted to the subordinates as well as made known to himself and all our assistants here that they may be encouraged to acquit themselves properly of their duty. An indisposition has in some measure prevented Mr. Torlesse from bringing up the set of Consultations allotted to him to be forwarded your Honours, but we hope those now transmitted will prove agreeable.\n\nOn the 28th February 1760, about 11 A.M. the President attended by all the Council, except Mr. Waters (who was indisposed) came from the Honourable Company's New House (lately [1757] bought from Mr. Spencer, now the Old Secretariat) to the Marine House in the present Dockyard. At the Marine House the President was received by the rest of the covenant servants and other principal inhabitants and delivered the keys of the garrison to his successor Mr. Crommelin, the King's artillery and Company's infantry and artillery being drawn up on one side of the Green and sepoys on the other. From the Marine House the President proceeded to Vice-Admiral Pocock's barge, the Grenadier company being drawn up next the water side. On entering the barge the President was saluted from the fort with 19 guns and also on passing His Majesty's ship Elizabeth, to which the\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Dep.

After this a royal salute was fired from the Fort, and three volleys from the troops accompanied with three huzzas.\u00b2\n\nOn the following day, 4th March 1760, the Honourable Charles Crommelin Esq. takes his seat at the Board as the President, the oath of fidelity to the Honourable Company being previously administered to him. Mr. Thomas Byfeld, who takes his seat as Second in Council, is directed to receive from the President the charge of the Accompant's office, and Mr. John Spencer of the office of Bombay Custom Master. Lists of the books papers and other articles belonging to which offices are ordered to be taken and laid before the Board.\u00b3\n\nIn a letter dated the 25th April 1760 the Court write: Except those that may be wanted by our President, whom we indulge to the extent of his predecessors, we positively direct that it be a standing rule without deviation to distribute the writers to the Secretary's and accomptant's offices, and subordinates. That no writer be appointed a Deputy to any department upon the island or as a fixed or an occasional Resident, when there are senior servants equally capable and unexceptionable. But we do not debar from promotion those writers who at Cambay Basra and other out-settlements acquire by their experience a proper knowledge for a succession. All Deputies or assistants to the Land, Military, Marine, Customs, and the rest, shall be elected in Council. In such cases the heads of those offices are allowed to nominate, but the list of servants is to be laid before you. And if the person so recommended by his standing and abilities has an unexceptionable right to such favour, you are to confirm him. But if the majority disapprove, he is to be set aside and you are to appoint another.\u2074\n\nIn a letter of the 25th April 1760, the Court of Directors write: All chiefships and residencies, fixed or occasional, are to have our President's nomination, but to be determined by a majority. If the President's nomination be rejected, the most deserving persons in your judgment must be elected. If it happens that any of the members shall deem an appointment partial and detrimental to our interest, his reasons are to be assigned with modesty and decency for our observation.\n\n\u00b9 Pub.

Vol. 2 of 1759-1788, 205.\nNo person in Council shall hold more than one post, if there are senior servants unexceptionable and capable to hold them. We now fix the several branches for those of Council, as invariable: The Bombay custom master, warehousekeeper, marine and land paymaster, Collector of rents and revenues, Chief of Mahim, military paymaster, and military storekeeper. Whenever there are more upon the spot, the general storekeeper is to be added. Our Chiefships at Surat Tellicherry and Anjengo are to be always filled by the Council. We do not confine the posts to ranks. It is left to your prudence to dispose as persons may appear best qualified. The office of accountant is to be no longer annexed to the Second in Council for reasons that will be given under this head. We need not tell you that our President for the time being is always treasurer.\n\nIn 1760 the Court again draw attention to the President's cash. In a letter dated 25th April 1760 the Court write: Some years past, from a loss that happened in our treasury, we ordered that only Rs. 1,00,000 should be kept out from the inner treasury to be under the direction of our President, and that the rest of our specie should be kept by the three treasurers, each to have a key. Of late we observe this sum is brought into account and called the President's cash, and from a view of many months, it appears that the issues are so managed as seldom to leave less than Rs. 90,000 at any period. As this leads us to draw unfavourable conclusions we order that in future the Rs. 1,00,000 allowed to be kept out of the supplies of the current service be thus rectified: All requests for money from the several paymasters shall be made in writing to the President and undersigned by him to the other two treasurers. They are to pay the same and make the entry. The receipts are to be through the sub-treasurer, but inspected by one of the treasurers every 48 hours alternately. To render this duty the more easy we appoint the next of Council in standing as fourth treasurer for this part only, and the monthly account to be signed by the four treasurers. No money shall be carried into or brought out of the inner treasury, but in the presence of two of the treasurers together with the deputy, who are to certify such receipt or issue.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 19th January 1761 the Board records: Directed that our Honourable Masters' commands relative to the office of Accountant and his deputy be carried into execution by Mr. Benjamin Jervis, the present deputy succeeding thereto as also to that of clerk of the market, and Mr. Richard Church now first assistant to the Accountant to be his deputy and assistant to the managers of the Bank. Also that agreeable to the 117th paragraph Mr. Byfeld continue warehousekeeper, Mr. Hornby Land Pay Master and to receive charge of the office of General Storekeeper, Mr. Spencer to remain Marine Pay Master, Mr. Waters to be Military Storekeeper, Mr. Wrench Mahim Custom Master, Mr. Holford to continue Bombay Custom Master, and Mr. Court\n\n---\n\n1 Pub.

Court's Letters Vol. 5 of 1757-1761, 282-283.\nCollector of the Revenues and Military Pay Master. By this disposition, it may be observed, Messrs. Hornby and Court will each hold two places. This proceeds from there being no senior servants on the island without posts. We must conclude from the tenour of our Honourable Masters' commands, and particularly from their not annexing the office of new Fortification Pay Master to a Member of the Board, that they judged it would cease. But as from the present state of our works we imagine the post of paymaster cannot cease for some time, Mr. Charles Whitehill is appointed thereto, Mr. Rawson Hart Boddam to be Dock and Pier Pay Master, and Mr. George Norton recommended to the Mayor's Court to succeed to the post of Accountant General. It is agreed that all the foregoing appointments shall take place from the first of next month.\n\nOn the 27th February 1760 the Bombay Government write to the Court: Agreeable to your commands such of your servants as have attained the age of twenty-one years since their coming abroad have executed fresh covenants which are transmitted in the packet and your servants in general have been ordered to write their friends in England to give your Honours additional security agreeable to their advanced stations.\n\nIn the following years the increase in Bombay revenues was swamped by the outlay on fortifications due to the anticipated French attack on Bombay. In their letter of the 31st December 1760 the Court write: So much of our money has already been laid out in the fortifications and works at Bombay, and the expenses on this account are going on at so heavy a rate, that we cannot avoid taking notice by this early conveyance of our uneasiness. In our next general letter we shall give you our sentiments and directions on this head. In the meantime we would have you run us to no further expense than shall evidently appear to be absolutely necessary.\n\nThe Diary of the 20th July 1761 records: Resolved that his most Gracious Majesty George III. be proclaimed tomorrow morning till when the troops cannot be assembled nor the other necessary ceremonies prepared and all the European and native inhabitants must be ordered to attend accordingly. On the next day, Tuesday the 21st July 1761, the Secretary mounted on horseback proclaimed His Majesty George III. of Great Britain France and Ireland King Defender of the Faith in presence of the President and Council, the Admiral and Commanders of His Majesty's ships, the Commodore and Commanders of our Honourable Masters' cruisers now in port, the Mayor and Aldermen, and all the European and native inhabitants, the King's and Company's troops being drawn up fired three volleys, as did the fort and ships in the road twenty-one guns, and all the guns round the ramparts were discharged and every possible mark of zeal and fidelity shown on this important occasion.

We think they appear very well calculated for the purposes we recommended to you. At the same time we observe the Black Overseer has a great latitude by advances of money and influence over the workmen. It will require great attention to prevent his making a bad use of this power.\u00b2\n\nA Consultation of the 7th September 1762 records: The peons for the several offices not being procurable at the present monthly pay of rupees four, the paymaster is ordered to increase it to five.\u00b3\n\nAfter 1760 the financial outlook became somewhat less gloomy. In a letter of the 16th April 1762 the Court write: It is agreeable to find that the revenues of Bombay are increased Rs. 14,267 and the charges reduced Rs. 40,968.

We shall therefore depend upon your constant care and attention in employing in the several stations not only the writers but all other our covenant servants in such a manner that the Company may have the utmost benefit of their services. If any of them are negligent or in any respect misbehave, you are to rebuke and admonish them whenever you see necessary. If rebuke will make no good impression on them, such unprofitable and useless servants are then to be forthwith sent to England.\n\nIn a letter of the 12th March 1766 the Court write: Agreeable to our last orders under date the 25th April 1759 the Council was to consist of twelve members only; that the preceding appointments number thirteen is due to your admission of other members during the absence of Messrs. Draper and Moore. For the present we acquiesce in thirteen. But we direct that whenever by death or otherwise the number is reduced to twelve, you are not to admit any person into the Council until the number falls short of the total of twelve. Our meaning is that in future the Council is to consist of twelve members only.\n\nIn their letter of the 17th May 1766 the Court write: We have reason to believe that many of our servants have received presents or gratuities from the country powers in a collusive manner by way of exorbitant interest on moneys lent or said to be lent to them by our said servants. In order to put a stop to such extortions and exactions, for in that light we see them, we do hereby order and direct that if in future any one of our servants Civil or Military shall directly or\n\n---\n\n1 Pub.

In spite of these orders, without considering the circumstances and the proper means of doing it, you most unfairly laid hold of the expression that she was to be sent to Bengal in any event, well knowing you had a sufficient quantity of pepper on hand upon the coast to have given full loadings for Europe, both for the Talbot and Asia. We cannot ascertain what loss the Company may sustain by the keeping back such a considerable quantity of pepper at a time when the demand for it here was very great, or by having it flowing in upon us by the next ships probably in such quantity as will very much reduce the price. Be that as it may we are very sure considering all the circumstances that this measure will prove very detrimental to the Company's interest. Upon the whole we do hereby order and direct that Charles Crommelin Esquire President and Governor of Bombay, for disobeying the Company's orders with respect to altering the destination of the Talbot's voyage and other irregularities in the disposition of their shipping, do resign the Government on the 31st day of January 1767. Messrs. William Hornby, William Andrew Price, Charles Waters, Samuel Court, James Ryley, and Rawson Hart Boddam, Members of the Council, having concurred with the President in the above transactions, particularly with respect to the ship Talbot, we do hereby most severely reprimand them for their inattention to their duty and to the interest of the Company. This lenity of ours in not taking further notice of their conduct, will, we hope, produce a suitable return and a due obedience to our orders in future. We do further signify to our President and Council that if at any time you presume to determine upon any of the Company's affairs without meeting at a regular Consultation for the purpose, to which all the members on the spot are to be summoned, you will certainly incur our highest displeasure, and we shall resent it accordingly. Notwithstanding President Crommelin is directed as above to resign the Government on the 31st day of January 1767, we do hereby permit his remaining at Bombay in a private capacity until the departure of the ships of the season of 1768 for the adjustment of his own affairs. We further direct that during his residence on the island after his quitting the Chair, and on his embarking for Europe, all due respect be shewn him consistent with his late station. Having, as observed in the 113th paragraph of this letter, ordered and directed\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Dep. Court's Letters Vol. 7 of 1765-1768, 183-184.\nMr. Crommelin to resign the Government on the 31st day of January 1767 and Mr. John Spencer being appointed by our letters of the 1st of June 1764 and the 22nd of March 1765 to succeed thereto, he is accordingly on the said 31st day of January 1767 to take charge of the Government as President and Governor of Bombay. And we hope he will by his fidelity, diligence, strict observance of our orders, and constant application in the said station render himself worthy of this signal mark of our favour. We do hereby order and direct that our Council at Bombay do consist of the following persons: John Spencer Esquire President and Governor, Mr. Thomas Byfield Second, Mr. Thomas Hodges Third, Mr. William Hornby Fourth, Mr. William Andrew Price Fifth, Mr. Thomas Whitehill Sixth, Mr. Charles Waters Seventh, Mr. Peter Elwin Wrench Eighth, Mr. Samuel Court Ninth, Mr. Daniel Draper Tenth, Mr. James Ryley Eleventh, Mr. Henry Moore Twelfth, Mr. Rawson Hart Boddam Thirteenth.\n\nA Consultation of the 27th January 1767 records: About eleven o'clock in the forenoon the President, the Honourable Charles Crommelin, attended by all the Council then in Bombay, by the rest of the covenant servants, and by other principal European and native inhabitants, went from the Honourable Company's House to the Marine House and delivered the keys of the garrison to his successor Mr. Hodges, the infantry artillery and sepoys being drawn up on the Green from the President's House to the Marine House, whence, as no barge or other proper boat was available, the President proceeded to the Bandar Cutter prepared for his reception, the Grenadier Company being drawn up next the water side saluted him with three vollies, as the Castle likewise did with twenty-one guns on his putting off from shore. He was likewise saluted with twenty-one guns and three cheers by all the cruisers, by our Honourable Masters' ship Osterly, and by most of the country ships in the road, and with the same number upon his embarking on the Speaker, whither by Mr. Hodges' orders he was accompanied by Messrs. Jervis and Stackhouse, two members of the Board. On returning from the water side to the Marine House, Mr. Hodges was saluted as Governor with twenty-one guns from the Castle, and the like number from the cruisers and most other ships in the road, also with three vollies from the troops.\n\nThe diary of the Honourable Thomas Hodges runs: The Consultation and diary book of Thomas Hodges Esquire, President and Governor and the rest of the Council, their Proceedings, in the affairs of the United Company of merchants of England trading to the East Indies, in the Presidency of Bombay, Surat Persia Mokha and Coast of Malab\u00e1r, pursuant to the establishment made by the Honourable the Court of Directors in their commands dated the 17th May 1766, and afterwards confirmed in those of the 12th of September following per Fame snow from Bushire.\n\nChapter VIII.\nRevenue and Finance.\nRe-call of Governor Crommelin, 1766.\n\nDeparture of Mr. Crommelin, 1767.\n\nGovernor Hodges, 1767.\n\n---\n\n1 Pub.

Here the Honourable Mr. Thomas Hodges President and the Council being summoned were met by the rest of the Company's servants and by the European and native inhabitants. The President's commission received from the Honourable the Court of Directors by the Royal Captain, was read by the Secretary in the usual manner. After this a salute of twenty-one guns was fired from the Castle and the like from the field-pieces on the right and left of the line which fired also three volleys and gave three huzzas when the salute was taken up by the Honourable Company's Charter-party ships, their cruisers, and the several private merchant ships in the road.\n\nIn a letter dated the 18th of March 1768 the Court write: Having taken into consideration the state of the Company's servants upon the Bombay establishment, we are come to a resolution to allow them a reasonable encouragement to exert themselves with zeal and alacrity in the present extensive and important situation of the Company's affairs in India. This however they are to look upon as a free gift from the hand of their Employers offered to them annually so long as their behaviour shall continue to merit the same. In order to constitute a fund for this purpose, so long as the Company shall be possessed of the Diw\u00e1ni revenue, the President and Council at Bengal are to supply you annually with one lakh and one-third of Bengal current rupees and you are accordingly to draw on that Presidency for the same. We order and direct that the said sum shall be divided into one hundred parts or shares, and distributed among the Company's civil and military servants in the following proportions, namely: The Governor is to have twenty shares; the Second in Council six shares; the rest of the Council not having chiefships three shares each. It is our meaning and directions that the chiefs of Tellicherry Anjengo and Surat, and the agent at Basra are not to have any proportion of the said shares. You are to observe that the abovementioned shares allotted to the Governor are in addition to his present established salary and allowances. Except the chiefships as before excepted, the shares for the other civil servants are likewise to be in addition to their present appointments of salary and diet money respectively. Having also taken into consideration the present stated allowances to the Company's junior servants and finding them to be inadequate to their support and maintenance, we do hereby order and direct that the following additions be made thereto by way of gratuity to such of them as do not enjoy any posts of profit, namely: To a factor five pounds a year; and to a writer ten pounds a year. These last gratuities are to be paid out of the Company's cash and not out of the said fund of one lakh and one-third of rupees a year. All these allowances are to commence on receipt of these orders.\n\n1 Pub. Diary 51 of 1768, 609.\nAND ISLAND.\n\nBeing further satisfied how much our trade and possessions may be effected by the good services of the Company's military officers, the better to encourage them to exert their endeavours in the preservation of these great objects, we have thought proper to allow them also to partake of the said yearly fund of a lakh and one-third of rupees, by way of gratuity over and above their established pay and allowances and on the same conditions as our civil servants in the following proportions, namely: The Commander-in-Chief as such is to have twelve shares, the Lieutenant Colonels three shares each, the Majors one and a half share each. The ample provision here assigned to the Commander-in-Chief assures him of an honourable competency. We therefore expect Colonel Charles Pemble and his successors in the command will shew a constant and zealous attention to their duty by keeping up a regular discipline among the troops and by good economy preventing all frauds and abuses in the expenses of the army. After the beforementioned distributions to our Civil and Military servants there will remain a considerable sum of the said fund unappropriated. In order to encourage the rest of the Company's military officers, we direct that they also be granted by way of donation or gratuity over and above their usual pay and allowances, namely: A Captain three shillings a day, a Lieutenant two shillings a day, and Ensigns and Lieutenant Fireworkers one shilling a day each. In case it shall happen that the amount of the unappropriated shares should not be sufficient to answer the said last mentioned gratuities, we direct that the deficiency be made good out of the Company's cash. Similarly if there shall happen to be a surplus, until you shall receive further orders the same is to be carried to the Company's credit under the head of Unappropriated Fund. We must here observe to you and accordingly direct that no Colonel, Lieutenant-Colonel, or Major is to be allowed the three shillings a day as Captain of a company.\u00b9\n\nAt a Consultation of the 1st November, 1768 the Board read the following letter from the covenanted writers: We the underwritten, who have the honour to be employed as writers on this establishment to the Honourable East India Company, do humbly beg leave to prefer to your Honour a request which we assure ourselves will not be deemed unreasonable. The Honourable Company have been generously pleased to allow an ample increase of pay to their servants Military and Marine by which they are enabled decently to support themselves and, with their usual and known goodness, have at the same time unsolicited thought proper to grant us an addition of salary of \u00a310 a year for which our warmest acknowledgments are due. We therefore take this opportunity of expressing our liveliest sentiments of gratitude. Animated by a proper sense of their kind indulgence, we shall make due return by constant and punctual obedience to their orders and perseverance with steady and unremitting application to business. Fearful lest it might be construed into an abuse of our\n\n\u00b9 Pub. Dep. Court's Letters Vol. 7 of 1765-1768, 359-363. Comp. of Standing Ord. Vol. 2 of 1759-1788, 244-246.\nHonourable Masters' generosity, it is with peculiar reluctance we do at such a time take the liberty of assuring your Honour that their generous and free donation added to our former pittance managed with the strictest economy is not nearly adequate to the expenses we are necessarily and unavoidably subject to. In proof of this we think it necessary to remind your Honour of the dearness of every kind of provisions and necessaries and that their rates are daily enhancing as you cannot but be thoroughly sensible of the same. We are therefore under the necessity of troubling your Honour with this address most earnestly entreating you will be pleased to grant us such further provision as shall to your Honour seem meet. We cannot help observing that we deem it particularly hard that an ensign on this establishment shall receive sixty, nay many of them who have double posts Rs. 120 a month, while the generality of us writers have only Rs. 30. That a subaltern officer shall enjoy such an income as will enable him to live genteely while too many of us are obliged to run in debt merely to subsist, is strange to us seeing we flatter ourselves we are at least conscious of having endeavoured to render ourselves equally deserving of encouragement. We are therefore emboldened to trouble you with the above request relying on your Honour's conviction of the justness of it.\n\nAt the same Consultation after considering the above letter the Board observe: As we cannot but readily allow the truth of what the writers assert in respect to the dearness of every kind of provisions, it is agreed to recommend their request to our Honourable Masters' favourable notice.\n\nTouching this application Mr. Forbes writes: I am sorry to observe, that although the preceding letter was strongly recommended by the Governor and Council of Bombay to the Court of Directors, they took no notice of it at home, nor did we obtain any redress. At that time, I can safely affirm, I lived in the most sparing manner, a writer's income altogether not exceeding \u00a365 a year. I never drank wine at my own table, and often went supperless to bed when the day closed, because I could not afford either supper or candle; as the dinner hour was one o'clock, and a writer's age generally between sixteen and twenty-one, the abstinence was not occasioned by a want of appetite. During the bright moonlight evenings, I indulged myself in reading on the flat roof of the writer's apartments at the bandar (that is the present, 1894, Custom House), where, through the medium of a cloudless atmosphere, I could peruse the smallest edition of Shakespeare without inconvenience.\n\nA Consultation of the 20th September 1769 has the following entry: Reperused our Honourable Masters' commands of the 4th April last, wherein they have been pleased to mention it as their intention that, agreeable to their former directions, the Commanding Officer should have a seat at the Board on Military affairs only, Colonel\n\n---\n\n1 Pub.

We therefore hereby direct that from the receipt hereof, the said sum be divided into one hundred parts or shares and proportioned as follows:\n\nThe Governor 20 shares; the Second of Council 6 shares; the Six of Council next on the establishment of twelve including the Superintendent of the Marine and exclusive of the Chiefs of Tellicherry Anjengo and Surat and the Agent of Basra, three shares each; Brigadier General Wedderburn as Commander-in-Chief but not as a Member of Council twelve shares; Colonel Robert Gordon four shares; Lieutenant-Colonels nine shares to be equally divided amongst them; Majors six shares to be divided amongst them in equal proportions. By this appointment you will observe that neither the Chiefs of Tellicherry Anjengo or Surat, nor the Agent at Basra are allowed any share in the distribution of this fund. But as the Members of your Council, exceeding this establishment of twelve, may consider themselves as prejudiced should an immediate reduction take place, we hereby agree and direct that all the Members of your present Council, excepting the Chiefs before excepted, be allowed three shares each. At the same time you are to take notice that no vacancy in your present Board of Council is to be filled until the number be reduced below twelve civilians, it being our intention that, except when Major-General Coote as beforementioned shall be on the spot, the Council at your Presidency shall not in future exceed thirteen Members including the Commander-in-Chief and the Superintendent of Marine.\\footnote{Pub.

I wish not however now to point out\nparticulars to the injury of any person, as their failure may proceed from a want of proper knowledge of the attendance they ought to give. At the same time I am desirous that no blame may revert to me from their negligence or inattention. I therefore humbly beg leave to lay this address before you, requesting you will be pleased to take the business of the Secretary's office into consideration, and the attendance at present given to it, and thereupon establish such rules and orders for the guidance of the young gentlemen who assist therein as may to your Honours appear necessary that they may have the line of their duty drawn immediately by your commands. Rules and orders were established on a similar occasion in the year 1734 as will appear on reference to the diary for that time. Of these rules and orders the Honourable Company expressed their high approbation in their Commands dated 13th April 1735, and have often been pleased to direct the assistants be kept close to their business. I beg leave to submit to your Honours' considerations whether the regulations I have the honour to enclose you, will not answer the end intended, if you think proper to give your sanction to them. I further humbly beg leave to acquaint you, that as eight assistants have been removed out of the office within these seven months past, those at present allotted are not sufficient even if the annexed regulations are ordered to be established. This I also beg leave to submit to your consideration as your Honours must be sensible the business of the office is lately greatly increased and a despatch for Europe is approaching. I much wish that this material branch of the Honourable Company's business may be conducted to your satisfaction, which is the reason that induced me to lay this representation before you. I therefore humbly hope my doing so will meet with your approbation, which at all times is my earnest desire to obtain. I have therefore taken the liberty to enclose a list of the business of the office and the assistants in my opinion necessary to conduct it, as well as the current and despatch business with a list of the assistants at present belonging to the office and those within these seven months removed from it that your Honours may judge of the whole at once. The following are the rules: We the President and Council of and for all forces and affairs of the Honourable the United English East India Company having thought proper to establish the following rules and orders, we hereby require a punctual observance to be paid to them by all persons belonging to the Secretary's office from this date, also the Accountant's office and all the out-offices: (1) The assistants shall regularly attend in the office from the hours of eight in the morning to twelve at noon, and from three to five in the afternoon. During this time they shall give close attendance to the business allotted to them and not depart from the office without permission. (2) Should any of the business of the assistants be done in so careless a manner as not to be permitted to pass by the Secretary, or in his absence by the Deputy, he or they shall do the same over again after the established office hours and no business shall be done by any of the assistants out of the office on any pretence whatever. (3) None of the assistants shall\n\n---\n\n1 Pub.

(4) On the days on which Councils may be held, the Deputy Secretary, or in case of his sickness or absence the first assistant, shall attend the office until after the Council breaks up. And on the afternoon of a Council day, the Deputy and two assistants in turn shall attend after the office hours until the Secretary shall come to the office, that they may be ready to copy the orders of the Board and such other papers as shall be wanted. (5) The assistants shall attend such other hours as they may be required to do by the Secretary, and none of the young gentlemen shall live out of town, that they may be ready to attend the office when sent for. (6) The assistants shall come to the office immediately on being sent for, and by no means ill-use a sepoy sent by the Secretary or Deputy to call them to their duty. (7) None of the young gentlemen shall absent themselves on account of sickness without the necessity of it being certified to the Secretary under the hand of the Surgeon who attends them. No hair-dressing shall be allowed in the office, nor any improper behaviour whatever. (8) The young gentlemen shall punctually observe the foregoing rules, under the penalty of being severely reprimanded for the first offence by the President and Council; to be fined one month's diet money and forfeit the allowance if they enjoyed one for the second; and to be suspended from the Honourable Company's service for the third, agreeable to their commands. (9) The Honourable Company's indulgence of office allowance being intended as a reward to merit, shall be given to those who shall be found most deserving without regard to seniority. In order that the attention of each assistant to his business may be more precisely ascertained, the Deputy Secretary shall on every Monday evening deliver a report to the Secretary signed by himself of business done by each of the assistants in the office with the number of pages it will make from the Tuesday morning preceding until that time. This report the Secretary shall lay before the Board. (10) In the absence of the Secretary the Deputy Secretary, or in case of his absence the first assistant, shall take care that the foregoing rules are strictly adhered to, and any failure therein shall be reported to the Secretary. (11) The Deputy Secretary shall punctually attend the office during the hours abovementioned and such other hours as may be required of him and in general shall be subjected to the foregoing rules and regulations.

It is our positive order and direction that each of the above described persons so soon as convenient after the Shrewsbury's arrival, be required to sign one of the said covenants according to the rank and station he may be in. Should any person refuse a compliance with this our order, if he is in our service he must be dismissed therefrom and sent home, or, if under our protection, such protection is to be withdrawn and the person so refusing must be sent to England. These covenants, after being executed and witnessed by three persons, you will forward to us by the first conveyance after execution. On our receiving the same, and the security being given by two persons here, in the undermentioned sums set against the respective stations, we shall transmit a counterpart of each covenant with the Company's seal affixed thereto. This counterpart you must duly deliver to the parties concerned. Here it is needful to observe that you must enjoin each person to desire two responsible persons in England to enter into the above security bonds. The Bond for the Governor is to be in \u00a310,000, each Councillor 4000, each Senior Merchant 3000, each Junior Merchant 2000, each Factor 1000, each Writer 500, each Surgeon or Assistant Surgeon 1000, each Free Merchant 2000, each Free Mariner 500.\n\nIn the same letter (paragraph 102) the Court continue: A Persian Grammar lately published here being esteemed a very useful work for acquiring a true knowledge of that language, we send you a few copies by the ships now under despatch that such of our servants who are employed in that study may have all the assistance in our power to enable them to obtain an accomplishment which will particularly recommend them to our notice.\n\nIn a letter dated 1st April 1772 the Court write: In reply to the 109th paragraph of your letter dated the 31st (3rd) December 1770 respecting the propriety of the Members of the Board attending the President at Parel to hold Consultations at such times as he may be confined thereby indisposition, we are of opinion that such a measure would occasion great inconvenience in the execution of public business. You are therefore to observe it as a standing order that in all cases when the Governor shall be prevented by illness from presiding at the Council at Bombay, the next Member of the Board is to supply his place.\n\n1 Pub.

We have therefore come to the resolution that after this season no writer shall be allowed to have any wine sent out to him. At the same time he may be indulged with a box of necessaries not exceeding in measurement the sixth part of a ton. But that no wine be allowed to be sent to any persons in India except by their relations or attorneys. Such persons should produce a fresh order every year empowering them to make such request.\n\nAbout this time the excessive cost of Bombay caused the Directors serious anxiety. In a letter of the 12th April 1775 the Court write: The average of your extraordinary charges for some years past has been about Rs. 70,000 a year. We have no doubt but they may be reduced below a moiety of that sum. However allowing Rs. 40,000 for extra charges and supposing your annual losses to be Rs. 50,000, the whole expense of your settlement with due economy will not exceed 15 l\u00f3khs and 50 thousand or at most 16 l\u00f3khs of rupees. In the year 1767-68 after deducting our losses our net gains and revenues amounted to upwards of 9 l\u00f3khs of rupees. By the last returns the total amount of our revenues appear to be Rs. 9,41,209. As we have no reason to expect a diminution of those revenues, but hope they may be augmented, we cannot but conclude that the annual loss of our settlement at Bombay may be reduced below 7 l\u00f3khs of rupees or 87,500 pounds sterling. How great then must our concern be to find such loss for several years past, amount upon an average to nearly 300,000 pounds sterling a year.\n\nIn a letter of the 12th April 1775 the Court write: Having taken into our most serious consideration the annual loss sustained by the Company in providing for the defence of Bombay and in maintaining its dependencies and subordinates, and having also duly attended to all commercial advantages derived therefrom and to the importance of that island as it respects the safety of our other possessions in India and the prosperity of our affairs in general; and finding the advantages inadequate to the expense and the loss insupportable, we have therefore resolved upon a general reform of our civil and military establishments and that every superfluous charge incurred at your Presidency and subordinates shall be forthwith retrenched. Being well assured that if our Civil Servants are judiciously arranged and properly employed, the following number will be fully sufficient for transacting the Company's business at Bombay and its subordinate factories, we are determined to reduce our present establishment so soon as conveniently may be to about seventy persons who are to be stationed in the manner following: At the Presidency, the Governor and six Members of Council; one Secretary; one Deputy Secretary and six\n\n---\n\n1 Pub.

The posts of Accountant General, Storekeeper, Marine and Military Paymasters, Superintendent of the Marine, and Warehousekeeper will, we apprehend, be occupied by Members of the Board. The subordinate officers which we deem necessary are one Deputy Accountant and four Assistants; one Custom Master at Mahim; one Storekeeper to the new Fortifications; two Assistants to the Governor; two Assistants to the Marine Paymaster, and one Assistant each to the Superintendent, the new Fortification Paymaster, the Military Paymaster, the Warehousekeeper, the Custom Master, the Land Paymaster, the General Storekeeper, the Collector, the Dock and Pier Paymaster, the Military Storekeeper, and the Committee of Treasury and of the Powder House. We observe that the present number of our Civil Servants on the Bombay establishment is 111; consequently there will be upwards of 40 Supernumeraries after making the above arrangement. We apprehend that many of our Civil Servants at Bombay would be willing to remove to Bengal with some loss of rank. In order to accommodate such persons and to provide for them in the best manner we are able, we direct that of our said servants above the rank of writers, 25 be permitted at their request to proceed to Fort William and to rank on that establishment as writers of 1773, namely the senior Bombay servant who shall be removed as aforesaid shall be stationed next below Matthew Leslie and the rest immediately afterwards according to seniority. In December 1767 our Civil Servants at Bombay were 93, our Military, officers included, consisted of 1639 infantry 322 artillery and 2902 sepoys. We find your civil charges in 1767-68 were Rs. 4,70,617 and your military expenses including those of the Hospital Rs. 7,45,921, that is a total of Rs. 12,16,538.\n\nIn the same letter, paragraph 32, the Court continue: As our Chiefs and Councils will be withdrawn from Tellicherry and Anjengo and as our civil and military establishments will be reduced below those of 1767, we have a right to expect such reduction in civil and military charges as shall bring the whole of those articles within the sum of ten lakhs of rupees a year. The Marine charges of your Presidency in 1767-68 were Rs. 3,66,369 and we can by no means allow that you ought to exceed that amount.\n\nOn this letter after due consideration the Board observe at a Consultation of the 23rd January 1776: The Company's permission for twenty-five of the Civil Servants on this establishment being removed to Bengal must be made known to all the service. Such as are desirous of proceeding thither on the terms mentioned in the 22nd paragraph must be required to give in their names within the time therein specified. We must however remark that at this time only eighty-nine servants are upon our Civil List instead of one hundred and eleven as supposed by the Honourable Company, and there is a great want of younger servants for the public offices. The Company's indulgence must also be signified to Messrs. Freeman, James, Spencer, Bebb, and Chapman.\n\n1 Pub. Dep. Court's Letters Vol. 9 of 1772-1777, 215-220, 224.\n2 Pub.

If it shall at any time happen by the death removal or absence of any Members of the said Council that the Governor and Council shall be equally divided, then, and in every such case, the Governor and President, or in his absence the senior Councillor present and presiding shall have a casting voice, and his opinion shall be decisive. (2) That every question proposed in writing by any Members of Council be put by the Governor, or in his absence by the senior Member of Council acting as President for the time being. (3) That every question carried by a majority shall be deemed the act of the President and Council. (4) That all orders in consequence thereof be issued in the name of the Governor or President and Council, although such Governor or President may have dissented from the resolution of the Board. (5) That no meeting of Council be dissolved or adjourned but by the consent of the majority of members present at such meeting. (6) That the President shall call a Council at the request of any three or more of the Members of the Council signified in writing to the Secretary. (7) That if at any time the President shall neglect or refuse to call a Council at the request of three or more members, the Secretary shall summon the Council at the requisition of three or more Members of Council made in writing for that purpose. (8) That no meeting of the Members of Council though they may be a majority of the whole Board unless duly summoned as aforesaid shall be deemed a meeting of Council, nor shall any act of such members not duly assembled become an Act of the Council. (9) That no Company's servant or officer, Civil or Military, shall obey any order or command of the majority of the Members of Council unless such order shall have been issued in the name of the President and Council and be countersigned by the Secretary.\n\nIn a letter dated the 4th July 1777 the Court write: The Act of Parliament for establishing certain regulations for the better management of the affairs of the East India Company as well in India as in Europe must be strictly adhered to with respect to the servants of the Company not receiving presents. On pain of removal from our service the Company's servants must be positively ordered not to lend money to any of the natives concerned in the revenues, to Zamindars, to farmers, or to any of the Raj\u00e1s or Governors of Towns and Villages.\n\n---\n\n1 Pub.

We therefore direct that you henceforth meet so often as shall be necessary as a Board of Revenue, and that your proceedings as such be kept apart from your public and secret Consultations. In attending to this regulation you will take especial care that every branch of revenue be distinctly and fully stated, and particularly described on your first day's proceedings together with the customary expense attending the collection thereof, and also an explanation of every incumbrance with which the several articles are charged. Every estimate of receipts and disbursements must be entered at length on your Consultations in the Revenue Department. A copious index must be annexed to your revenue Consultations and also to every section or broken set which may from time to time be forwarded to us before the books of the year be completed. You will likewise address us regularly from the Revenue Department, and carefully advise us of all occurrences which happen concerning the revenues of the Company under your management. As the above regulations will only vary the mode of your proceedings we apprehend very little additional trouble can be occasioned thereby. However as an encouragement to your Secretary in the discharge of this important branch of his duty, we permit you to allow him on that account a gratuity of Rs. 600 a year, but you are not to appoint a separate or additional Secretary for this Department.\n\nIn accordance with these instructions from the Court, at a Consultation of the 28th October 1778, the Board order a Revenue Department to be started. The entry runs: As it will take time to frame the account which is to be entered on our first day's proceedings as a Revenue Department, resolved that orders be given to the Collector and the several subordinate settlements to send up correct statements of their revenues and charges of collection and that our proceedings as a Revenue Department be opened on the first of January next.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 21st October 1778 the Board record: Mr. Henry Moore begs leave to submit to the consideration of the Board the propriety of increasing the allowance of house rent to the Members of the Board from Rs. 80 to Rs. 150 a month, or else that the rent of the houses occupied by the several members be defrayed by the Honourable Company. Since October 1777, Colonel Egerton has been allowed the sum of Rs. 150 a month. All the other members receive no more than Rs. 80. This distinction Mr. Moore considers improper and injurious to the dignity and credit of every Member of the Council especially if long services can lay any claim to indulgence. The Board must be sensible that Rs. 80 a month is no way adequate to the house rent now paid by every member that is not furnished with a house belonging to the Honourable Company. Mr. Stackhouse desires to join in this motion and the question being accordingly put it is resolved not to take upon ourselves to increase the Honourable\n\n---\n\n1 Rev. Diary 1 of 1779, 1-3. Pub.

In reply to a Bombay letter of the 30th April 1779 the Court write on the 15th January 1783: We cannot by any means agree to the recommendation in your general letter of the 30th April 1779 as to an increase of house rent to the members of your Council. In the present state of the Company's affairs economy cannot be too rigidly adhered to. You must not therefore take any measures to multiply the expenses of an establishment which is already but too burdensome to the Company.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 8th July 1778 Mr. Carnac acquaints the Board that the President has represented to him the propriety of having a Civil Servant appointed to act as interpreter in transacting business with the country people and has recommended Mr. James Sibbald as a proper person for that office. The Board, knowing the necessity of such an appointment and satisfied that Mr. Sibbald is in every respect qualified for it, readily agree. They on this account likewise resolve to make him a monthly allowance of Rs. 300, which they think but adequate to the trouble he must necessarily have in executing his duty in this office. The Board also remark that as they think the employment of linguists in transacting business of importance with the country people is very improper an appointment of this kind is the more necessary. They hope that the encouragement now shown will induce the gentlemen in the service to exert themselves in endeavouring to attain a perfect knowledge of the country languages. The allowance given to Mr. Sibbald is to commence from the 6th April last the day he was appointed to act as interpreter to the Committee in their conferences with R\u00e1ghoba.\n\nIn a letter of the 5th July 1780 the Court expressed their disapproval of this appointment. They write: The appointment of Mr. James Sibbald to act as interpreter in transacting business with the country people at a salary of Rs. 300 a month does not meet with our approbation. Our affairs have hitherto been conducted without an officer of that denomination. Neither will we suffer such innovations. If you wish for our good opinion you must be studious rather to retrench than to increase our expenses which are already too burdensome.\n\nIn a letter of the 19th March 1778 the Court of Directors write: In forming your estimates of resources and disbursements we direct that every article of revenue be estimated at the amount actually received into your treasury for the preceding year and not at the nominal amount stated on your rent roll unless the same has been fully realised without loss or abatement.

You are also carefully to distinguish your stated fixed charges from all extraordinary disbursements which you may expect to make in the course of the year for which you form your estimates. By observing the above rules you will convey to us a general and adequate idea of the ordinary profit and loss of your settlement and its dependencies, and also to what amount and for what reasons an excess may be expected in your disbursements.\n\nIn a letter of the 27th May 1779 the Court write: We have now thought proper to repeal the Court's orders respecting persons not resident in India before the 1st of January 1774 and to extend those orders to all our settlements in India. We hereby declare it to be our firm resolution that no British subject shall henceforth reside in India, who is not authorised by law or licensed by the Court of Directors. It is our express command that you pay immediate and continual obedience to the standing order abovementioned relative to persons residing in India without license in the same manner as though the said order had been specially directed to you. In order to prevent abuses or to detect and punish imposition if such shall be or at any time has been practised by persons obtaining licenses to proceed to India, it is our pleasure and we likewise make it a standing order to be observed in all time to come that no British subject shall henceforth be permitted to trade to India who shall have proceeded thither on any pretence whatever except he shall also have been expressly licensed by the Company to trade in India. Nor shall any person so licensed be suffered to trade or remain in India beyond the period limited in his license unless his right so to do shall have been prolonged by the authority of the Court of Directors. We direct you forthwith to make these our orders as public as possible and to take especial care that they be not disobeyed or evaded on any pretence but immediately and faithfully carried into execution. We have been informed that Thomas Henry Davies who has petitioned the Court of Directors for leave to proceed to Bengal to practise as a Barrister in the Supreme Court has taken his passage for India without leave granted by the Court of Directors. It is therefore our order that if the said Mr. Davies shall appear at your settlement and shall not at your requisition produce the Company's authority for residing there that he be forthwith required to return home in the manner directed by law and if he shall refuse or neglect be compelled so to do.\n\nIn a letter of the 5th July 1780 the Court write: In addition to what we wrote in our letter of the 6th April 1770 we now direct that no person or persons whatever already sent or who may hereafter be sent to India in our service either as a writer cadet or otherwise be permitted to resign the same in order to adopt any other mode of employment or to engage in any line of business incompatible with the said service.

The artillery infantry and sepoys being drawn up on the Green from the Government House to the Dockyard saluted him as he passed as did the King's Marines who were drawn up in the Marine yard the drums at the same time beating the Grenadiers' March and the crews of the King's ships in dock giving three cheers. Mr. Hornby then embarked in the Admiral's barge attended by several captains of the Navy and Messrs. Torlesse and Church and proceeded to His Majesty's ship Eagle the present flagship. On his quitting the shore he was saluted with 21 guns from Hornby's battery and on getting on board the Eagle with 19 guns from that ship and three cheers from all the other ships of the squadron. The Company's ships and cruisers also saluted him and on leaving the Eagle about 9 o'clock he was again saluted from that ship which was returned from the fort. He proceeded on board the Honourable Company's ship Raymond from which he was lastly saluted with 21 guns. Mr. Boddam on returning from the Dockyard to the Government House was saluted as Governor with 21 guns from Hornby's battery the troops as he passed along also saluted, every mark of respect shown to his predecessor being paid him.\u00b3\n\nIn a letter dated the 9th December 1784 the Court write: As we are required within fourteen days after the commencement of every Session of Parliament to lay before the two Houses of Parliament a perfect list of all officers, pay and emoluments in the Civil and Military Establishments of the Company in the East Indies, with the salaries or pay and employments belonging thereto, we direct that lists conformable to the above be transmitted to us from our several settlements.\u2074\n\nAt a Consultation of the 19th February 1784 the Board requiring the attendance of Mr. John Syme, the Deputy Accountant, are inform-\n\n\u00b9 Pub.

That no deputies or assistants of any of the offices be permitted to reside without the Town Gates unless by permission of the Board. That exclusive of the punctual daily attendance in the public offices in ordinary hours, the deputies and assistants do regularly attend during the sitting of Council, and on no account quit till the Council shall break up.\n\nUnder date the 11th of April 1785, the Court forward the following despatch to Bombay: The Act of Parliament for regulating the Company's affairs in India directs that we shall take into immediate consideration the establishments in India in order to make every possible reduction therein. We are engaged in that business and shall without delay send out our final orders upon it. As the Council at Bombay will in future consist of a Governor, Commander-in-Chief, and two other members, the posts that are now held by Members of Council must be distributed among our senior servants at Bombay. We have determined that the salaries to our Governor and Council at Bombay shall be as follows: To the Governor Rs. 90,000 a year, whatever may arise in future from the mint and consulage being carried to the Company's credit, the same to be collected without further expense to the Company than what was incurred by the Governor when those emoluments were enjoyed by him. To the Commander-in-Chief as Second in Council Rs. 36,000, to the Third Member of Council Rs. 36,000, to the Fourth Rs. 32,000. In consideration of the preceding salaries which are to be in full for commission on the Bengal revenues and all other emoluments we direct that the Governor and Council be restricted from engaging in trade. They are however to be allowed a reasonable time to settle their outstanding concerns and we trust that twelve months will be sufficient for that purpose. The foregoing salary of Rs. 36,000 to the Commander-in-Chief is to be in full for every allowance in time of peace. But when he shall be directed to take the field with the army or be engaged in the actual defence of the settlement we permit him to draw a further allowance of Rs. 8000 a year in lieu of batta table and contingent expenses, and all other emoluments whatever.\n\nIn reply to this despatch, under date the 30th of November 1785, the Bombay Government write to the Court: Painful as it is to enter upon the subjects of our peculiar interests when you have so many more im-\n\n---\n\n1 Pub.

Court's Letters Vol. 11 of 1783 - 1786, 195 - 197.\nportant affairs to attend to, yet justice to ourselves and our successors in this government lays us under the necessity of calling your attention to a circumstance that materially affects us and we flatter ourselves will meet with a favourable hearing. We are perfectly sensible that in the salaries you have been pleased to appoint us, you have as far as circumstances would enable you to judge meant to adapt them to our situations; but we are truly concerned to observe that they are very inadequate to our present stations and we hope that what we shall urge on this occasion will not be deemed either disrespectful or improper. When you were pleased to advance us to our present situations, we did not conceive we should be placed in a worse condition in respect to income than we had enjoyed or had in prospect before our promotion. And though we did not look up to the salaries of the Governor General and Council of Bengal, yet we flattered ourselves that no distinction would be made between your servants at this Presidency and those at Madras, as we cannot acknowledge any superiority in them as to zeal and a strict attention to the interest of the Honourable Company. We will here beg leave to point out in what respect we conceive ourselves in a worse situation in income and in prospect than we were before our promotion. The President\u2019s income is greatly curtailed. His former fixed allowances from the Company were considerably more than half his present salary in addition to which he had the consulage, the privilege of trading, and several other allowed emoluments which he has now lost, although we hear the consulage has been continued to your President at Fort St. George. The General, although his allowances in garrison are not lessened, yet the additional one when he takes the field is so very small that he would in such case be inevitably exposed to a considerable expense, which he must defray from his own private fortune. He therefore hopes you will deem him entitled to the same salary and allowances as you have established for your Commander-in-Chief at Fort St. George. Messrs. Sparks and Church in like manner as the President have not only lost all advantages, which, in common with the other servants of the Company under this Presidency, they might have derived from trade, but have no longer in prospect the possibility of appointments to the Chiefships of Surat and Tellicherry or any other mode of improving their fortunes than by their savings from their established salaries. You will, we are persuaded, from this representation judge what were our feelings when we were favoured with your determination in respect to our salaries. We not only found ourselves limited to inadequate allowances but with the additional mortification of being placed on an inferior footing to the Members of Government at Madras which we cannot but consider as a severe hardship and a degradation of this Government in the eyes of all your servants in India. Though we could rest our cause on the principle of equality with that Government permit us further to observe that the high stations we now hold in your service oblige us to a certain style of living in our different ranks as necessarily occasions such expenses that the surplus of our income will be a very inadequate saving for near thirty years\u2019 service and upwards. In full confidence that you will see the propriety of what we have stated above, we hope you will be\npleased to reconsider the salaries you have appointed for us and trust the representation we have made will have its proper weight.\n\nIn reply on the 23rd March 1787, the Court write: Before we can take into our consideration the several representations contained in your general letter of the 30th November 1785 respecting the supposed inadequacy of the salaries and allowances to our civil and military servants under your Presidency we must first be furnished with your opinion of the establishments necessary to be kept up at Bombay which by our letter of the 21st September 1785, we ordered you to transmit to us agreeably to the Act of Parliament.\n\nThe letter of the 21st September 1785 to which the Court refer was in these terms: You will recollect that you are now employed in forming a standard establishment for conducting the business of each office. We are perfectly aware that confidential situations in general ought to be filled by European servants and accordingly a proper supply must always be kept up. At the same time from what we have observed and learned upon good information we are confident that considerable saving of expense in our establishments may be effectuated by employing Natives in copying papers and in other subordinate occupations, and we direct you to attend to this circumstance reporting to us your advice what we ought to adopt as our standard establishment.\n\nIn the same letter the Court continue: Instead of the various subdivisions of departments by which the business of our settlement is now conducted, it is our order that the whole detail should be carried under the following branches:\n\n1. The Board of Council.\n2. A Military Board.\n3. A Board of Revenue.\n4. A Board of Trade.\n\nOur President and Council will still continue to act in their double department of Public and Secret. As the duties respectively belonging to each seem to be accurately defined in a Minute of the Governor General and Council of the 23rd September 1783, we enclose a copy thereof for your guidance. The sole difference is that, in the definition of the business of the Public Department, it mentions matters which regard commerce and shipping, whereas our intention is that matters of that description shall belong to the Commercial Department. The Military Board will consist first of the Commander-in-chief, 2nd the Senior Officer at the Presidency, 3rd the Senior Officer of Artillery, 4th the Chief Engineer, 5th the Adjutant-General, 6th the Quarter-Master General, 7th the Commissary General. It is not our intention by the institution of this Board to erect any military authority in your settlement in any degree independent of the superior civil executive Government of the country as vested in the Board of Council. But we are of opinion that much benefit will be derived from this institution in the detail of such business as is immediately connected with the regularity, the economy, and the effective strength of our army.\n\n---\n\n1 Pub.

For conducting the business of the revenues appertaining to your Presidency, we direct that you assemble in a separate department to be styled the Board of Revenue to which shall belong the whole administration, settlement, collection; and receipt of every branch of our revenues, together with the control of the several officers concerned therein. But all issues of money are to be made by warrants from the Board of Council in whom this authority is to be exclusively vested. In like manner you will form yourselves into a Board of Trade for conducting the business of our shipping and investment and your whole proceeding will be transmitted to us in a separate packet under the head Commercial Department. As we take it for granted you will instantly carry into execution the arrangements for the conduct of our business which we have now enordered, it only remains for us upon this subject to inform you that all our subsequent despatches on that supposition will be addressed to you in your Public, Secret, Military, Revenue, and Commercial Departments.\n\nIn the same despatch the Court continue: We have regretted an abuse which is now become so prevalent and has gone to such an extent that we must be peremptory in taking the most effectual measures to put an end to it. We allude to the practice of our servants having access to and transmitting home to their private correspondents such part of our records as they think proper. Our orders, therefore, are that no person but the Members of the different Boards shall have access to their records except the Secretaries of such Boards and those entrusted by them; and that no private copies shall be given thereof except to the President of each Board if he shall desire it. To these persons so entrusted we shall look for responsibility, and if copies of any of our papers correspondence or records shall be discovered in the possession of any persons not warranted by the Government, either at home or abroad, we shall certainly take the most effectual measures in our power to discover by whose means the communication has been made and will dismiss from our service any person who shall be found guilty of disobeying these our orders. Another practice of a similar nature likewise calls for our animadversion. Many of our servants possessing our most confidential situations are accustomed to indulge themselves without reserve in corresponding by their private letters upon the public affairs of the Company. As this is attended with many inconveniences and is directly contrary to our repeated orders, we desire you will take the most effectual means to prevent it. If any of our servants presume to continue in a practice so contrary to our wishes and orders, we shall certainly mark disapprobation by the severest tokens of our displeasure.\n\n1 Pub. Dep.

Resolved that the same be complied with immediately. The Board of Council will comprehend the following departments, namely the Public, the Secret, and the Political. The other Boards will be the Military Board, the Board of Revenue, and the Board of Trade.

Resolved that these arrangements take place on the 1st of next month and that the subordinate settlements and heads of offices be advised thereof and directed to address us accordingly. Until the general arrangements of the army can be framed, the Military Board will consist of the following officers: the Commander-in-Chief, the Senior Officer of Infantry, the Senior Officer of Artillery, and the Chief Engineer. The members will be directed to assemble on Friday the 1st of September and the Secretary is directed to prepare a set of instructions to be laid before us for approval. As the Honourable Company have been pleased to direct that the whole detail of the business of this Presidency should be conducted under the four branches abovementioned, it is resolved that the mode of managing the Marine be considered on a future day.\n\nOn the 29th August the Secretary lays before the Board a set of instructions for the Military Board ordered by the Court of Directors in their commands of the 21st September last to be constituted at this Presidency. These being duly considered are approved and signed, and it is arranged the said Board will assemble on Friday next the 1st of September. Mr. Morris is appointed Secretary to this Board. Notice must be given to the gentlemen who compose the Board of Ordnance that the said Board is dissolved in consequence of the appointment of the Military Board. Orders must be sent to the Military and Storekeeper to furnish the Military Board with such papers and accounts as they may from time to time require relative to their offices. The appointment of the Military Board must be signified to the army in general orders.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 31st August 1786 the Board resume: After reading the Court\u2019s orders of the 21st September 1785 the Board find that the following will be a competent establishment for the several departments: At the Presidency (1) the Public Board; (a) Public Department, Secretary, deputy, and five assistants; (b) Secret and Political Department, Secretary, deputy, and three assistants. (2) Revenue Board, two assistants. (3) Commercial Board, two assistants. (4) Military Board, Secretary and one assistant. (5) Marine Department, Secretary and one assistant. (6) Accountant\u2019s Office, Accountant, deputy, and four assistants. (7) Treasury and\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 88 of 1786, 532-533.\n2 Pub. Diary 88 of 1786, 576.\nTransfer Office, assistant to the treasurers and transfer master, two assistants in the transfer office. (8) The Honourable the President's office, two assistants, Marine Paymaster and one assistant. Bombay Custom Master and two assistants. Warehouse-keeper and one assistant. Land Paymaster. Military Storekeeper and one assistant. Marine Storekeeper and one assistant. Military Paymaster and one assistant. Mahim Custom Master. Collector. General Storekeeper. New Fortification Paymaster. Assistant to the Powder-house Committee. Mr. James Beck, the present Secretary in the Secret and Political department, will continue in that station, and Mr. James Hatley is to act as Secretary to this Board in the Public, Revenue, and Commercial Departments with Mr. John Morris and Mr. Alexander Ramsay as their deputies. As the duties of the public offices must employ the whole time of the assistants therein, it is now made a regulation that in future no gentleman who may be employed as an assistant in a public office be appointed to any out-office assistantship; and as by the arrangements this day made the offices of General Storekeeper, Land Paymaster, Marine Storekeeper, and Collector are not to have assistants, the gentlemen who at present act as assistants will be disposed of in the following manner: Mr. James Paton will be in charge of the New Fortification pay office, and Mr. George Parry will be Assistant to the Warehouse-keeper in the room of Mr. Charles Watkins who is to continue in the Secretary's office. It appears by the above list that the number of civil servants required for this establishment is 86 persons, including the President and Council, and that the number of covenant servants at present in the service is 97. There will therefore be eleven supernumeraries, and it is observed that the assistants in the Transfer office will not be required when the bond debt is liquidated. In forming the arrangements we have been guided by local circumstances and the nature of the service on this side of India, being of opinion that adopting the mode recommended by the Company in its full extent of dividing the servants into four classes would be attended with considerable expense without any adequate advantage arising therefrom, and as the orders given to the Subordinates and also to the heads of offices at the Presidency employed in the Revenue and Commercial lines will, we think, fully answer the intentions of the Company on this subject; Ordered that the heads of offices at the Presidency and Subordinates be directed to send in a list of native assistants in their respective offices specifying their time of service, pay, and emoluments. And also to signify to us whether any can be reduced, as no more will be allowed than are absolutely necessary. When these papers are laid before us we shall take into further consideration that part of the 5th paragraph of the Company's separate letter respecting the employment of native assistants.\n\nReferring to this arrangement in a despatch dated the 21st November 1787 the Court write: We have perused your proceedings relative to the arrangements of the several departments and for fixing the number of servants for each and approve thereof. You must therefore consider\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 88 of 1786, 583-588. Comp. of Stand. Ord, Vol. 2 of 1759-1788, 310.\ntheir establishments as fixed and no addition must be made thereto without our previous consent and approbation.\\(^1\\)\n\nAbout a year before this in a despatch from the Court, dated 8th November 1786, the Bombay Government received the following requisition for a copy of the Standing Orders: As the book of standing orders relative to your Presidency would be highly useful to us in saving laborious research into the old records, we direct that a copy of the same be transmitted to us if possible by the first ship that returns after this advice reaches you. We formerly wrote for a book of this kind which was received. It goes as far as April 1759 but contains only the Standing Orders from home for the regulation of your conduct. We direct that it be continued from that period to the present time and that you incorporate therein the several orders and regulations which our respective Governors and Councils have from time to time seen necessary to adopt for the better management of our affairs committed to their charge. If the like could be done prior to the year 1759 it would be useful. But if it would be a work of great labour we would only have selected the orders of our Governors and Councils apart in a separate book as far as the year 1759 which with the book we already have would form a complete collection. We would have the orders inserted under the different heads in the order they occur, even although you may have afterwards deemed it necessary to repeal them.\\(^2\\)\n\nAt a Consultation dated the 13th December 1787 the President the Honourable Rawson Hart Boddam acquaints the Board that his private and family affairs require his presence in England. He requests that the Commander of the General Elliot may be directed to accommodate him with a passage in a suitable manner.\\(^3\\)\n\nAt 11 A.M. on the 9th January 1788, the Honourable the President Rawson Hart Boddam attended by the Council, the covenanted servants, and other principal European and native inhabitants went from the Government House to the Dockyard where he delivered the keys of the garrison to his successor Andrew Ramsay Esquire. The troops being drawn up from the Government House to the Dockyard saluted him as he passed, the drums beating the Grenadiers' March. He then proceeded on board the Company's ship General Elliot attended by Messrs. Carnegie and Green. On his quitting the shore he was saluted with 21 guns from Hornby's battery and on getting on board the Elliot he was complimented with the same number from that ship.\\(^4\\)\n\nAt a Consultation of the 10th January 1788 the following letter from the late President R. H. Boddam, dated Bombay Harbour 9th January 1788, is recorded: In consequence of what I had the honour of acquainting the Board on the 13th ultimo of my intentions of pro-\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Pub.

You have my sincerest wish for every honour and success to attend you as it will ever afford me the highest satisfaction to hear of the prosperity of the Government of Bombay and its inhabitants in general.\n\nUnder date the 8th of April 1789 the Court forwarded to Bombay the following despatch determining the strength and the duties of their civil establishment: Having taken into our consideration the directions contained in the Act of Parliament of the 24th year of the reign of his present Majesty respecting the formation of an establishment of civil officers, places, and employments at the several presidencies in India; And having likewise considered the letter from your Presidency of the 24th February 1787 referring us to your proceedings of the 31st August 1786 wherein are stated the number of civil servants which are deemed necessary to conduct the business of your Presidency and subordinates; We have come to a resolution pursuant to the directions contained in the latter part of the 40th clause of the Act beforementioned declaratory of the several offices places and employments, as mentioned in the statement or list herewith enclosed, under your Presidency with the pay salaries and emoluments annexed which\n\n---\n\n1 Pub.

In apportioning the servants of the different ranks to the several offices in the enclosed establishment we have in general followed the division that obtains at present. Still we do not mean to restrict them precisely to those ranks and no other. In case of a vacancy of an office directed to be given to a junior merchant should there be none of that rank unemployed a senior merchant may be appointed thereto and so of the other ranks and vice versa. This must of course be left to your own discretion subject to the limitations of the Act of the 26th of his present Majesty as to the disposal of offices to servants of a given standing in the service. In fixing the emoluments to the different offices we have been guided by the last accounts received from your Presidency, and, though many of the offices appear to have no emolument annexed to them, we have not fixed any salary thereto, conceiving this is probably owing to the same person filling more than one employment. Should you be of opinion that such stations deserve any allowances you will represent the same to us with your reasons for so doing.\n\nOn the 8th April 1789 the Court write: As we daily feel much convenience in the despatch of business by the arrangement we have made in the conduct of our correspondence with you, we think that arrangement may be further improved by the addition of a Political Department. By Political we mean all correspondence with or relative to other powers in India, whether Native or European. According therefore to this and our former orders each conveyance will bring to us your despatches under five separate heads and in five separate letters, namely Public, Political, Military, Revenue, and Commercial, besides what may be necessary for you to address to the Secret Committee in terms of the Act of Parliament.\n\nReferring to this at their Consultation of the 18th September 1789 the Bombay Government observe: We trust that our Honourable Masters will have noticed that, since receipt of their orders of the 21st November 1787, the records of this Government have been arranged agreeably to their wish under the heads of Public, Political, Military, and Revenue. Although the terms Secret and Political have been hitherto kept in use, the former word shall in future be discontinued in pursuance of their commands before us.\n\nThe Consultation continues: The Honourable Company having instituted the post of Private Secretary to the Governor's office, the President nominates Mr. Edward Galley thereto. It is agreed to recommend to the Company that a monthly salary of Rs. 500 be annexed, as also to request that they will assign it to him from 1st November 1787 since which period he has acted as private secretary to Governors Boddam and Ramsay although not under that appellation. The President also nominates Messrs. Brown and Pringle the two assistants in his office.\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Dep. Court's Letters Vol. 12 of 1787-1790, 182-184.\n2 Pub. Dep.

Carnegie and Green for house rent, after the liberal salary which by our letter of April 1785 was established for the members of your Council and which was declared to be in full for all emoluments whatever, we cannot consent to any allowance being made for house rent to any of the members in future. If even the late increase of salary had not been coupled with the declaration before mentioned, the giving Rs. 300 a month for house rent to Messrs. Carnegie and Green was directly contrary to the order contained in the 24th para of our general letter of the 16th (15th) January 1783. But as your acquiescence herein was expressly subject to our approbation we direct that you call upon those gentlemen to refund what they may have received in consequence of your resolution of the 2nd December 1786.\n\nOn the 14th December 1791 the Court write to Bombay: By the accompanying Resolutions on the 19th April and 9th November 1791 you will see that the sons of native Indians are not eligible to any station in the Company\u2019s service either in Civil Military or Marine or for sworn officers of the Company\u2019s ships employed between Europe and India.\n\nOn the 10th April 1793 the Court wrote to Bombay: As doubts have been entertained respecting the time when the salaries of our Governor General and Council of Bengal and of the Governors and Councils of other Presidencies shall cease in the cases of their quitting India without resigning the service, we have resolved and do hereby direct that upon any person in any of those stations quitting the Presidency to which he belongs and afterwards coming to Europe or elsewhere westward of the Cape of Good Hope, be it on account of health or for any other cause, and whether he shall or shall not have formally resigned the service, he shall be considered as having quitted and vacated his station from the time of his leaving such Presidency and his salary shall from thenceforth cease in like manner as if he had made a formal resignation of the service. This is not to prevent any of our Presidencies from giving a reasonable leave of absence to any member for recovery of health provided the person who quits the Presidency on such leave shall return to his station agreeable thereto without proceeding to this side the Cape of Good Hope. If he shall come from India to the westward of the Cape his salary shall cease from the time of his quitting the Presidency to which he belonged. We further direct that no salary be issued from the treasury on his account until his return to the Presidency. And if he shall proceed to Europe or to the westward of the Cape, no arrears of salary shall be paid to his attorneys beyond the day of his departure from the Presidency, but he is to be considered as having upon such departure actually resigned the service.

In pursuance of this plan and of His Lordship's instructions, all the eighteen civil servants of the Bombay establishment who off the 10th July last had not resided three years in India have been ordered round, besides two older servants and three officers of the military list who have availed themselves of His Lordship's expressed intention to admit gentlemen to the benefits of the institution without restriction as to their period of service.\n\nIn reply on the 2nd April 1802, the Court forwarded to Bombay a copy of the Court's orders to the Governor General in Council relative to the college founded at Calcutta.\n\nThe Bombay Courier of Sunday the 18th July 1802 has the following: On the 16th instant at 6 o'clock in the evening departed this life James Rivett Carnac Esq. second member of Council at this Presidency. Yesterday evening at the hour of five he was interred with every honour suited to his rank. At daybreak the garrison flag was hoisted at half-mast and the colours of His Majesty's ships in the harbour with those of the Honourable Company and others were displayed in a similar manner. At three o'clock the body was privately removed from his residence at the Breach into the house in town appropriated to the second in Council. At a quarter after four a party of 500 Europeans from the artillery corps and His Majesty's 80th 86th and 88th Regiments assembled, the whole under the command of Colonel Bellasis commanding the Honourable Company's Artillery.

Arnold Burrows the senior chaplain, and Doctor Moir the family surgeon; the Rev. Nicholas Wade the junior chaplain. The pall supported by Sir W. Syer the Recorder, Mr. Cherry 3rd Member of Council, General Nicholson commanding the forces, R. Anderson Esq. Superintendent of the Marine, Alexander Adamson Esq., Captain Rainier the senior officer of His Majesty's ships in the harbour. Robert Henshaw Esq., J. D. Inglis Esq., James Fisher Esq., and Ensign James Rivett Carnac, chief mourners, followed by the gentlemen who had assembled for the occasion. The procession moved whilst the band of His Majesty's 86th Regiment and the garrison band were playing the dead march and other appropriate solemn music with accompaniments towards the Government House and thence to the Apollo Street making a circuit by the Adjutant General's office and the Dock head-gate passed close by the main guard from which moving direct for the church the line halted at a convenient distance and formed a street through which the procession proceeded to the church. Upon entering it the funeral service was performed by the reverend chaplains and the body deposited next to the spot which had many years ago received that of his sister, the wife of the late Brigadier General John Carnac. Three volleys from the troops announced the conclusion of this sad and solemn ceremony. Immediately after which half-minute guns to the number of 43, being the age of the deceased, commenced firing. An immense concourse of Natives attended and accompanied the procession who observed throughout the utmost decorum.\n\nThree months later the Courier of the 9th October 1802 has the following notice of Sir William Syer: On Thursday morning the 7th instant departed this life Sir William Syer Knight Recorder of Bombay after a short though severe illness. His funeral which took place yesterday morning at half-past six was at his own desire private and attended from the court-house to the church where he was interred by the Honourable the Governor and the Members of Council J. H. Cherry and Thomas Lechmere Esquires together with Edward Atkins Esq. Mayor and the Aldermen of the corporation who were associates in his Court. The funeral was accompanied by a party consisting of 300 rank and file of His Majesty's 86th Regiment with their officers and 50 rank and file of the artillery the whole commanded by General Bellasis. Half-minute guns to the number of 40 were fired from the saluting battery when the funeral party moved from the court house.\n\nThe Bombay Courier of the 13th August 1811 preserves the following details of the death and funeral of the Governor, the Honourable Jonathan Duncan: With sentiments of the deepest regret the Government announces the death at an early hour this morning (11th August 1811) of the Honourable Jonathan Duncan Esquire, Governor of the Presidency of Bombay and of its dependencies, over which he had presided for nearly sixteen years. The Government, desirous of affording every public demonstration of respect for the memory of the deceased, has\n\n---\n\n1 Bombay Courier Vol. 4 of 1802.\n2 Bombay Courier Vol. 4 of 1802.\nresolved that his remains be interred in the Church of Bombay at the public expense at four o'clock tomorrow evening. A Committee composed of F. Warden Esquire Chief Secretary to Government, Colonel T. J. Backhouse Commandant of the Garrison of Bombay, and W. Newnham Esquire Secretary to Government, is appointed to arrange and to conduct the mournful ceremony. The officers of His Majesty's and the Honourable Company's Civil Military and Marine services and the other gentlemen of the settlement are invited to attend on the occasion at the Government House in town at the hour above mentioned. Under the same impressions it is the wish of the Government that a general mourning be observed for a period of six weeks from this date. The flag at the Castle to be hoisted half staff high at sunrise tomorrow morning and to continue so until sunset. A similar ceremony to be observed by the shipping in the harbour. Minute guns 57 in number corresponding with the age of the deceased to be fired from Hornby's Battery and from the Honourable Company's shipping in the harbour on the funeral procession moving from the Government House. Similar marks of respect with the solemnities suitable to the mournful occasion are to be paid to the memory of the late Governor at all the principal stations and posts dependent upon this Presidency.\n\nThe funeral procession was arranged in the following order: Two trumpeters on horseback.

They are likewise requested to attend at the\nGovernment House at 3 o'clock to admit of the procession moving off precisely at 4.\n\nThe account of the funeral continues: On Tuesday afternoon at 4 o'clock, the remains of the late Governor Jonathan Duncan Esquire were removed from the Government House for interment in the Church at Bombay. The funeral was originally intended to have taken place on the afternoon of Monday, but the weather proving very unfavourable it was postponed to the following day. The body lay in state during the evening of Monday. The procession began to move when the clock struck four; Hornby's Battery and the Honourable Company's ships in the harbour beginning at the same instant to fire minute guns. It proceeded down the street towards the Apollo gate, turned round at the house occupied by Colonel Wilson, and proceeded towards the Green which it crossed and entered the Church at the western gate. The funeral service was performed by the Reverend Mr. Baynes and the Reverend Mr. Canning. The body was deposited in a vault in the chancel on the north side of the Communion Table. At the conclusion of the ceremony the troops on duty fired three vollies.\u00b9\n\nAt a Consultation of the 11th August 1811 it was ordered that a proclamation announcing the succession of George Brown Esquire to the office of Governor of this Presidency, be read at the head of the troops in the garrison of Bombay under a salute of 19 guns and three vollies of small arms. Ordered further that the proclamation be also read at the head of the troops at all the military stations dependent on this Presidency under a salute of 19 guns.\u00b2\n\nAt a Consultation of the 13th October 1747 the Board received the following letter of the same date from Mr. Byfeld the Collector of Land Revenue: For want of a regular survey of such houses as are built upon the Honourable Company's ground, except by the additional houses built, little or no variation in the quit-rent has taken place since the Company's first establishment. And as there is great reason to apprehend that encroachments have been made, it will, I presume, be necessary to have the same measured that we may be at some certainty in respect to this branch of the revenues.\u00b3\n\nWith reference to this proposed survey a Consultation of the 8th January 1748 records: Notwithstanding the exact survey and admeasurement of land within the town walls noticed in Consultations of the 13th March 1730 and 11th September 1730, and the consequent regulation made in our Consultation of the 3rd December 1731 for ascertaining how much ground every inhabitant within the town walls possessed, it yet appears by the letter of the Collector of the revenues entered after our Consultation of the 13th October last that the collecting of the Honourable Company's quit-rent on this island is still on great uncertainty. This uncertainty is due partly to\n\n\u00b9 Bombay Courier 13 of 1811. Pub, Diary 324 of 1811, 5339-5354.\n\u00b2 Bombay Courier 13 of 1811. Pub, Diary 324 of 1811, 5354-5355.\n\u00b3 Pub, Diary 20 of 1747, 373.\nthe want of any general survey without the town and partly to the encroachments those living within the walls have made since the above-mentioned regulation. It is therefore directed that the clerk of the works be appointed to set about such a survey out of hand and deliver his report thereof to the Board. Proper orders will then be issued concerning this branch of the Honourable Company's revenues.\n\nA Consultation of the 24th May 1748 records: It being observed that the inhabitants neglect to register their deeds of sale in the Secretary's office, notwithstanding all permissions for the sales of estates signed by the Governor conformable to an ancient custom hitherto observed expressly require registration. And as this failure to conform to rules most probably proceeds from fraudulent motives, it is agreed that a publication be prepared requiring all persons to register their deeds of sale in the Secretary's office within the space of ten days from the date of the said publication. Otherwise the law with regard to fraudulent conveyances will be put in execution with the utmost rigour and severity.\n\nA Consultation held a month later (24th June 1748) continues: The publication concerning the registering of all deeds of conveyances in the Secretary's office is now read, approved, and ordered to be issued out in the usual manner.\n\nA Consultation of the 20th August 1751 records: There being great cause to suspect that many of the inhabitants of the island are possessed of lands belonging to the Honourable Company to which they are not justly entitled; directed that the Secretary issue an order to the Collector of the rents and revenues to make suitable inquiry into the merit of such persons' present possession keeping a proper register of the same.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 10th May 1757 the following letter from the Collector, dated 10th May 1757, is recorded: The term bigha is made use of to express a certain space equal to 65\u00bd Bombay burgas. According to the most moderate computation one bigha of the best rice land yields 39 phar\u00e1s, of the second sort 29, and of the third 16\u00bd. This gives a medium of 28 phar\u00e1s, half of which or 14 phar\u00e1s should come to the Company. The terms settled when the Honourable Company took possession of the island were that the Company should receive a certain sum annually from the proprietors of carts in general. This sum was estimated at a quarter of the value of their produce at that time. As the value is increased to upwards of three times what it was in those days, the present pension does not amount to more than one-sixteenth of the value of their produce for want of its having been stipulated to receive the Honourable Company's fourth part thereof in specie, that is in kind, which it is recommended may be done at Fort Victoria.\n\nThe terms on which ground has been let to the inhabitants of Bombay for planting cocoanut trees of late are as follows: For every vacant\n\n---\n\n1 Pub.

Diary 24 of 1751, 277.\nspace proper for a plant, the renter pays 53 res for the first ten years and forever after 1 qr. 7\u00bd res or about one-quarter of the value of their produce. No regard is to be had whether the spaces are filled with trees or not. A space of twenty feet is allowed between each plant on the borders of a spot of ground designed to form an cart for cocoanut trees and 23 feet 4 inches between every plant within. According to this rule a bigha of ground being equal to 12,840 hands of 20 inches each, is capable of containing about 83 cocoanut trees. This according to the above rate amounts a year for the first ten years to Rs. 11-0-61\u00bc, and for every year afterwards to Rs. 22-1-22\u00bd a bigha.\n\nThe terms of letting out all salt batty grounds to cultivate at Bombay are as follows: The best ground pays res 14 a burga, the second sort res 9, the third sort res 6. As 6\u00bd burgas is equal to one bigha; at that rate a bigha of the first sort of ground would yearly produce Rs. 2-1-17, of the second sort Rs. 1-1-89\u00bd, and of the third sort Rs. 0-3-93.\u00b9\n\nTwo months later at a Consultation of the 26th July 1757, on a letter from the Collector dated 20th July 1757, the Board record: Mr. Price says nothing in reply to the manner in which the Honourable Company\u2019s third of the produce of cocoanut trees was recommended to be received. As it is of consequence that this acknowledgment should be made good to them in specie (kind) or in money according to the value of the fruit from one year to another, it is strenuously recommended that one or other of these methods be settled and agreed on with the proprietors to prevent the evasions and disputes which may otherwise hereafter happen. It is plain how much the Honourable Company have already suffered by this point not having been properly attended to at their first taking possession of the island. It is evident that it was then meant the Company should receive exactly one-fourth part of the produce of the proprietors\u2019 carts. But as instead of settling that one-fourth of the produce should be paid them in kind, it was agreed the Company should receive for ever a sum at that time deemed equivalent to one-fourth part of the produce. As was noticed by the Collector in his address of the 10th May, that sum does not now amount to more than one-sixteenth part of the value of the produce.\u00b2\n\nThe Board continue: 28 phar\u00e1s and 8 adholis of batty is allowed to be the medium produce of three different sorts of batty ground at Bombay. The moiety of the Honourable Company is always one-half of the batty the ground produces.\u00b3\n\nThree years later, at a Consultation of the 15th July 1760, the Board record the following letter from the Collector, dated 15th July 1760: Conformable to an order received from your Secretary I have informed myself of the valuation of Jivanset Padamset\u2019s house which by an estimate made by Mr. Hugh Cameron and the vereadores on the 30th November 1755 appears to be Rs. 2521-1-55. The vereadores have\n\n\u00b9 Pub. Diary 30 of 1757, 151-153.\n\u00b2 Pub. Diary 30 of 1757, 287.\n\u00b3 Pub. Diary 30 of 1757, 286.\nalso surveyed the oarts belonging to the said Jivanset Padamset. Enclosed is their original report with an estimate amounting to Rs. 3483-1-50. His debt to the Honourable Company is Rs. 5351-3-0. But if these oarts are sold the circumstances of the man are such that he will have nothing to subsist on. Whereas if your Honour approve of the oarts being farmed out for the most they can fetch and the produce paid the Honourable Company, reserving only a small part for the man's subsistence, it may be the means of recovering his debt without distressing the family.\n\nThe following is a calculation made by the vereadores and *mh\u00e1t\u00e1v\u00e1s* or elders of the oarts Canawady, Pattacawady, Shacawady, and Sanvorbhott belonging to Jivanset Padamset silversmith, by order of Robert Holford Esq.

The above said four oarts amount to Rs. 3483-1-50 as by the above account. We declare the said oart Canawady should be worth more than what we value it at. But as it is cut down in the middle by the intended wall from Dongri, this is what we judge and the same we report you. You may do what you please.\n\nAfter reading the above letter together with the report from the vereadores the Board observe: Read a letter from the Collector acquainting us with a valuation of the house which has been pulled down, belonging to Jivanset and enclosing the vereadores' estimate of his oarts. The former amounts to Rs. 2521-1-55 and the latter to Rs. 3483-1-50. Ordered that the Collector receive from the new fortification paymaster one-fourth of the amount of the house towards discharging Jivanset's\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 34 of 1760, 538.\n2 Pub.

Also that the Collector inform himself for how much the said oarts will probably let in order to clear the remainder of his debt, ascertaining likewise what may be necessary in the meantime to allow Jivanset for his subsistence.\u00b9\n\nAt a Consultation of the 28th October 1766 the Board read a letter from the Collector of rents and revenues enclosing a report to him by the vereadores and mhd\u00e1t\u00e1ras of an encroachment on some of the Honourable Company's ground by one Jaon de Almeida and desiring our orders thereon. The same being now accordingly taken into consideration, we are of opinion that in order to prevent any one presuming to do the like in future the trees should be confiscated to our Honourable Masters. Agreed that they be sold at public outcry for what they will fetch and that the trees mentioned in the report as planted in the road be pulled up.\u00b2\n\nOf the result of the sale of the encroached land a Consultation of the 13th January 1767 records: The spot of ground on which Jaon de Almeida washerman made an encroachment as represented by the Collector, the 28th October last, was, agreeable to our Resolution of that day, put up and sold to Shaikh H\u00e1sam Musa for Rs. 504 and two months' credit.\u00b3\n\nSurvey Ordered, 1772.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 19th May 1772 the Board record: Esteeming it very necessary that an accurate survey should be made of the whole island that the situation of the farmed out villages, namely Malab\u00e1r, Sion, Parel, M\u00e1tunga, Dh\u00e1r\u00e1vi, N\u00e1gao\u00f1, Vad\u00e1la, M\u00f3him, and Bamancally, and of all the Honourable Company's oarts and grounds may be exactly laid down as well as those of all persons whatever. Resolved that a survey be accordingly made under the direction of the Collector of the revenues whom the acting engineer must furnish with the most skilful persons for doing it.\u2074\n\nThree months later at a Consultation of the 19th August 1772 the Board ordered Lieutenant Turner of the Artillery and Mr. Whitman a cadet to begin the survey of the island.\u2075\n\n\u00b9 Pub. Diary 34 of 1760, 529. \u00b2 Pub. Diary 47 of 1766, 693.\n\u00b3 Pub. Diary 48 of 1767, 41. \u2074 Pub. Diary 61 of 1772, 508.\n\u2075 Pub. Diary 61 of 1772, 766. The Collector's yearly accounts continue to show charges in connection with this survey till 1780. No record of the results of this survey has been traced. In their report of the 21st August 1787 (Bombay Town Materials, II. 493) the Committee of Buildings write: We have much reason to imagine that many individuals have encroached beyond the proper limits of their ground, and particularly those whose houses or compounds extend to lanes and alleys. To detect such abuses effectually it will be necessary to make a complete survey and measurement of the whole of the private property within the town. Sixteen years later, on the 13th May 1803, that is within three months after the great fire in February 1803, the Town Committee (Bombay Town Materials, II. 502) write: The present confused state of the bazar rendered it impossible to obtain any correct measurement of the town. The committee therefore have had recourse to the most authentic document which is now extant, namely a survey of the place by the late Major Spaeth. The fact that Major Spaeth was killed at the siege of Ahmedabad in 1780 (Pub. Diary 77 of 1780, 518; Pub. Dep. Letters to the Court Vol. 28 of 1781-82, 52), makes it probable that he continued and in part completed the survey begun in 1772.\nA Consultation of the 25th August 1772 records: The Collector lays before the Board a calculate of the expenses which will attend taking the survey of the island. This for eighteen months, the time supposed necessary to complete the survey, amounts to Rs. 3912 and includes the pay of one surveyor. At the same time the Collector informs the Board that Lieutenant Turner is desirous of undertaking the survey alone. On this the Board record: As we are of opinion Lieutenant Turner is a very fit and proper person for undertaking the survey alone, this is agreed to. Resolved also that the Collector cause such things as are necessary for the survey to be prepared, that the work may be begun as soon as the season will admit. As Lieutenant Turner is at present employed in the Laboratory, where his future services may be useful, it is resolved that as soon as the survey is completed he shall return to his station therein.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 7th March 1775, the Board record the following letter from the Mayor's Court, dated Bombay Town Hall 6th February 1775: The Honourable the Mayor's Court having long seen the absolute necessity of taking the conduct of the vereadores of Bombay and Mahim into their serious consideration as well from the numerous complaints from time to time preferred against them, as from their studied delays in rendering the accounts of their administrations, at length resolved to appoint a Committee, with full powers to examine carefully and strictly into the complaints against and accounts of the vereadores, which was accordingly done. The Committee having delivered in their report, after mature and deliberate consideration of every part of it, the whole was unanimously approved. In justice so large a body of the people as the Portuguese inhabitants, the Court unanimously resolved to address your Honourable Board in their behalf. And, in the warmest and strongest terms, to recommend their peculiar situation to your humane and serious attention that they may be effectually freed from the assumed jurisdiction of the vereadores, and the hardships they have so long laboured under from that body whose power has been so illegally and so unjustly exercised over them for so many years. The Court also request your Honour will recall those powers given them by Governor Cowan (1729-1734) respecting judicial matters, as the vereadores have, in consequence of the false construction of the meaning of the patent, so flagrantly and openly abused them. The report of the Committee, copy of which is now enclosed for the notice of your Honourable Board, so fully explains the unanimous opinion of this Court on the subject now laid before you that it is needless to recapitulate any part of it, or to say any more than to submit it to your serious attention, and to acquaint your Honours. The Register has orders to wait your commands, should you think any further information necessary, he having attended the Committee through the whole of their proceedings.\n\nAfter reading the above letter together with the report of the Committee the Board observe: Read a letter from the Mayor's Court,\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 61 of 1772, 797-798.\n2 Pub. Diary 67 of 1775, 241-242.\ncomplaining much of the bad conduct of the vereadores and of the abuses committed by them, which they represent was proved before a committee that they appointed to examine the same; a copy of whose report they now enclose with a copy of the patent granted by Government to the vereadores for their rule of conduct. As we must conclude that this representation of the Mayor's Court is exactly just, and as it thereby appears that the vereadores have abused and greatly exceeded the powers that they derive from their patent, and that they have endeavoured to keep the Portuguese inhabitants ignorant of the powers they are invested with, which they seem to have represented to the people as much greater than they really are, we are of opinion that the same requires reformation. After mature consideration of the whole, sundry regulations are now drawn up and approved which are to be made known to the inhabitants by proclamation and a copy of the patent is to be annexed to the proclamation that the Portuguese may no longer be ignorant of its contents. The particulars of the regulation are not inserted here, as it is ordered that the proclamation, which contains them, be entered on this diary on the day on which it may be issued. Accordingly on the 9th of March the following proclamation was published and affixed in the usual places and in the customary languages. Copy was also sent to the Mayor's Court and to the Chief of Mahim: By the Honourable William Hornby Esquire President and Governor in Council of and for all affairs of the United English East India Company on the Coast of India Persia and Arabia and of His Majesty's Castle and Island of Bombay. Whereas it hath been represented to the President and Council aforesaid, by the Mayor's Court of Bombay, that the vereadores of Mahim and Bombay have been guilty of very great abuses in their office; that they have much oppressed and injured many of the Portuguese families on the said island; and that in general they have exercised an authority over the Portuguese very detrimental to them, and which the said vereadores have usurped contrary to the true meaning and intention of the patent granted by the Honourable Governor Cowan, from which they derive their authority, as that patent has never yet been revoked. These abuses being thus made known to us, we esteem it highly necessary effectually to remedy the evils complained of, and therefore as the vereadores in the first place have hitherto endeavoured to keep the contents of the said patent from being known to the inhabitants, it is our order that the same be hereunto annexed, that all persons who are desirous of a copy may have an opportunity of procuring it.\n\nThe proclamation continues: In future the following orders are to be observed regarding the office of vereadores. That no person shall be elected into the office of vereadore, who may have served in that capacity before, till after the expiration of five years from the day of his former election. The Chief of Mahim and the Secretary to the Governor and Council, before whom the vereadores are elected, are to take care that this order is obeyed. No person shall be esteemed an\n\n1 Pub. Diary 67 of 1775, 228 - 229.\norphan by the vereadores, whose father or mother may be living, and the estate of any minor that may now be in their hands, whose father or mother may be living, shall be directly delivered up with true and just accounts of the same. All orphans are hereby declared to be capable of managing their own estates, as soon as they attain the age of 21 years, when their estates and effects shall be delivered to them, with just accounts by the vereadores. The vereadores shall never, on any pretence, presume to interfere with any estate or effects that may have been bequeathed by will, or where executors are appointed, or where guardians are nominated by the deceased to their child or children and estate or effects. The vereadores shall immediately acquaint the Mayor's Court upon their taking charge of an estate or effects that may properly fall under their charge and management. They shall then cause exact inventories to be taken, and at the expiration of twelve months shall render exact accounts to the Court of the estate. The Mayor's Court are requested to take care that the estates and their produce are appropriated in the manner that may be most advantageous to the heirs, and that all the moneys be placed at interest in secure hands for the benefit of the heirs. Any vereador acting contrary to these regulations and to their patent shall, on complaint being made to the Governor and Council aforesaid, be fined at their discretion, and, if they think proper, shall be discharged from that office never more to be elected to it.\n\nIn a letter of the 14th November 1747, paragraph 50, Bombay writes to the Court: One of the renters of the waste ground round the town wall being dead, the others were desirous of relinquishing their lease which we consented to in Consultation the 6th March and the same day re-let those grounds for the term of five years being the remainder of the lease at the rate of Rs. 650 a year which is Rs. 35 more than formerly paid.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 29th May 1750, Lieutenant Richard Hollomore requests of the Board the renewal of a lease of the island called Butcher's Island granted to one Richard Johnstone, the 10th May 1743, for the term of seven years which lease expired on the 9th instant. It is observed that the said Johnstone was, at the time of the said lease, the officer stationed upon duty on the said island and the same was granted him for the easy consideration of Rs. 20 a year in order to encourage him to cultivate and improve it and as a sort of gratuity for his being upon that station. And after the said Richard Johnstone left that station, the said Richard Hollomore, being the officer appointed to succeed him, enjoyed the reversion of said lease on the same terms. Agreed that the lease of the said island be renewed to the said Richard Hollomore for the term he may be upon that station without a power to make over the same to any person except to the officer who may be ordered to relieve him.\n\n---\n\n1 Pub.

Diary 23 of 1750, 188.\nAt a Consultation of the 4th January 1757, the Board read a petition from Gamb\u00e1ji Purvoe and Bayr\u00e1nji Homji P\u00e1rsi praying that we will let them a certain piece of waste ground in the district of Parel which they are desirous of trying to cultivate with greens, pulse, batty, and fruit trees, provided that in consideration of the expense they must incur, we will grant it them gratis for five years and to pay half of the Honourable Company's pension for ten years after. As we are desirous of embracing any opportunity to encourage the growth of vegetables on the island on account of the present scarcity thereof, we resolve that the Collector give the necessary orders for letting petitioners the said piece of ground, but that the petitioners be indulged with it for only five years gratis and five years at half pension, instead of ten at half pension. This we imagine will reimburse their charges.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 5th June 1764, the Board reperused the letter from the executors to the estate of R. Broughton deceased, desiring a renewal of the lease of Old Woman's island. This being considered they ordered that the Collector cause the island to be surveyed by the vereadores and mh\u00e1t\u00e1r\u00e1s, and that he report to us what improvements it is capable of, that we make the necessary stipulations in the next lease for our Honourable Masters' interest.\n\nAccordingly, on the 26th June 1764, the Collector reports: Agreeable to an order from this Board, dated 5th instant, to cause an exact survey to be made of Old Woman's island I now enclose a report of the same from the vereadores and mh\u00e1t\u00e1r\u00e1s. I have only to remark that from the strictest inquiry I do not find there is a vacant spot on the island fit to cultivate cocoanut trees on for want of sweet water during the whole year to obtain which several trials have formally been made in vain. Neither can any other useful trees flourish there, except date and brab trees, and those require thirty years before they arrive to perfection. The vereadores' valuation of the garden grounds and pasturage for cattle is agreeable to the two last years' produce, but before the French prisoners resided there and the Honourable Company's buffaloes were sent to graze both the gardens and pasturage produced near double that amount. As to the method proposed to the vereadores of letting out in parcels such parts of the island to those who choose to take the same on certain stipulated terms, there is no judging whether it will prove advantageous to the Company or not till trial is made. The surest way to go to work I think is publicly to put up to rent the whole island unless your Honour should please to indulge the old householder with a renewal of his lease conformable to his tenour of the last lease which specifies a liberty for his renewing it on such terms as the Board may think fit to grant it.\n\nThe following detailed report from the vereadores and mh\u00e1t\u00e1r\u00e1s, dated 22nd June 1764, accompanied the Collector's letter: In obedience to your order, we the vereadores and matt\u00e1r\u00e1s, along with\n\n---\n\n1 Pub.

The present produce is as follows:\n\nThe Oart Mov\u00e1n planted by Mr. Broughton contains 322 cocoanut trees, out of which 292 are let to the Bhand\u00e1ris to draw toddy at the rate of Re. \u00bd a month, amounting for one year to Rs. 666 0 0\n\nProduce of remaining 100 in cocoanuts Rs. 75 0 0\n\nTotal Rs. 741 0 0\n\nDeduct\u2014Annual expense of manure Rs. 100 0 0\n\nAll the brab trees annually produce Rs. 120 0 0\n\nDeduct\u2014Payment to arrack farmers Rs. 50 0 0\n\nTotal Rs. 641 0 0\n\nProduce of the Melon and Vine Gardens according to the accounts delivered by Mr. Jones of the two last years at a yearly medium of Rs. 204 0 0\n\nAccording to the said Jones\u2019 accounts the pasture for cattle appeared yielding during the two last years Rs. 210 2 0\n\nAdd\u2014Annual rent for a tank let out to grow greens Rs. 10 0 0\n\nTotal Rs. 424 2 0\n\nDeduct\u2014Servants\u2019 wages Rs. 165 0 0\n\nTotal Rs. 259 2 0\n\nThe ground bought by Jones containing 264 single yards and in case any difference may ever be found the same may be rectified agreeable to the accounts. The pension at 45 res a yard amounts to Rs. 29 3 12\n\nTotal Rs. 1000 1 12\n\nWe now give the probable future produce. Some of the cocoanut trees in the above said oart are ruined on account of the Bhand\u00e1ris drawing them a long time, wherefore the produce of the oart will be less in future. We have calculated the expense of the oart conformable to the Bombay carts, but as this is at a greater distance the expense will be greater. With regard to the brab trees farmed by one Manchar Jivan P\u00e1rsi for Rs. 30, the said Manchar has let out these trees to P\u00e1rsi Bhand\u00e1ris for Rs. 120 a year, he paying the arrack farmer\u2019s rent. But when the said brab trees are released other Bhand\u00e1ris will not be able to afford to pay so much for the future. The produce of the gardens and the pasture of the cattle may be either more or less for the future according to the management of the farmer. We found that one Cowttoo (Kutub) Moorman, servant to Mr. Jones, has planted forty young cocoanut trees on a spot of ground. Out of these forty three begin to bear fruit; still that oart is of no value at present though it may be in a few years. Having surveyed the whole ground of the said Old Woman\u2019s island we think there can be planted about 2000 more cocoanut trees, provided there can be found sufficient sweet water for watering them. But as the said\nisland is too distant, and also as the expense of digging the wells and building gutters will be considerable, we judge that it would be better to fix half the pension formerly paid at Bombay for oats of new establishment. For, in case there is no sufficient sweet water, it is impossible to grow cocoanut trees, but date and brab trees may be planted, which grow without watering or manuring. With regard to the above said ground we think that it may prove advantageous to the Honourable Company if public notice was given to all manner of persons who choose to contract for the said ground that they give in their proposals sealed up and agreeable thereto the contract may be made of the said ground. This is what we report to you and you may order as you think proper.\n\nOn the same day, 26th June 1764, after perusing the Collector's letter together with the report from the vereadores the Board observe: Read a letter from the Collector enclosing a report survey of Old Woman's island. These being considered and the letter delivered by the present farmers and read the 5th instant being referred to, it is agreed, in consideration of the losses the farmers have sustained by the French prisoners having been kept there, to comply with their request for a renewal of the lease. The term of the new lease be only fourteen years and the rent to be increased to Rs. 100 a year, exclusive of the oat which is now become the sole property of the Honourable Company. A clause must now likewise be inserted in the lease to entitle the farmers to half the amount valuation of any improvements they may make during the term of their lease at its expiration when the small oat of forty trees already planted and mentioned by the Collector must become the sole property of the Honourable Company without any consideration being paid for it, and the usual pension to be collected from the farmers for the ground they have purchased on the island from the day the present lease expires.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 3rd July 1764 the Board read a letter from the heirs to the estate of Mr. Richard Broughton deceased, wherein they return thanks for our consenting to renew the lease of the Old Woman's island for a term of fourteen years. At the same time promising to plant cocoanut trees provided we will extend the term of the lease to twenty-one years without which they will not reap any benefit from the improvements they may make as on that island cocoanuts do not produce fruit in less than thirteen or fourteen years. If this should not be agreeable they desire permission to plant as many cocoanut trees as possible on paying the half pension as usual for the first ten years and after the full pension the property of such oats to be wholly and solely theirs. But this, we do not think, will be at all for our Honourable Masters' interest. At the same time we are of opinion the farmers should be indulged with a longer term; they will otherwise reap but little benefit from any improvements they may make and consequently will not take any pains to cultivate it. Resolved that they be allowed to hold such spots as they may cultivate with cocoanut trees for a term of twenty-one years and the remainder\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 42 of 1764, 383-385.\n2 Pub. Diary 42 of 1764, 380-381.\nof the island for fourteen. Taking into consideration whether selling or renting the oart on this island will be most for our Honourable Masters' interest we are unanimously of opinion the preference ought to be given to selling. It is therefore agreed to sell the oart at public outcry for the most it will fetch on Tuesday the 31st instant. Of this public notice must be given as usual and a clause be inserted in the lease whereby at all times the purchasers may have free access thereto without any impediment on the part of the farmer of the island.\n\nAccordingly on the 31st July the Board went to the Bandar to make sale of the oart on Old Woman's island, which was put up, and, subject to the following conditions, sold to Sh\u00e1mji N\u00e1ranset for Rs. 7550 to be paid in three months' time at the old pension. The purchaser to have free access to the island whenever he may think proper without any impediment on the part of the farmer. Should the Honourable Company at any time have occasion to cut down any of the trees the purchaser to be indemnified for the same.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 6th February 1767, the Board record the following letter from the Collector, dated 5th February 1767: Having according to your Honour's orders examined into the merits of Vishvan\u00e1th and Mah\u00e1dev's petitions, together with the pretensions of Kh\u00e1n Garat, I cannot find that the Kh\u00e1n's people have the least right or title to the lands they claim, nor that they have ever paid any pension to the Honourable Company for the same. For many years past the ground has served the village of Girgaon as public comioning. And as waste ground is the Honourable Company's sole right and property, I request your Honour's orders whether the same shall be granted to the petitioners as requested by them. After consideration the Collector is ordered to let out the land as waste ground on the usual terms.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 24th March 1767 the Board read the following letter from the Collector, dated 23rd March 1767: In consequence of your Honour's order to me of the 6th February to grant unto Vishvan\u00e1th Purvoe and Mah\u00e1dev, two arnys or spots of waste ground which they had discovered and petitioned for on Malab\u00e1r Hill, ten other spots of the like nature have been discovered, as per particular account thereof enclosed. These plots for many years past have been possessed by the persons mentioned in the said account, without their having ever paid the Honourable Company any pension or other consideration for the same. As both the present possessors and several other persons have petitioned me for the said waste grounds to be granted them on the usual terms of pension, I request your Honour's orders whether the same shall be granted to the present holder or to other claimants or whether your Honour may judge it more proper that the same be disposed of by public outcry. Having in consequence of your Honour's orders enquired into the merits of Rang\u00e1ji Bhav\u00e1nji's petition:\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 42 of 1764, 394 - 395.\n2 Pub. Diary 43 of 1764, 440.\n3 Pub. Diary 48 of 1767, 102, 110.\nI find that in the year 1755 Bhav\u00e1nji had actually sold the spot of the cart mentioned in his petition to Sad\u00e1shiv Sinay Brama (Shenvi Brahman), and that this person did not die until the year 1762 or 1763 and had possessed the same during all that time. Rang\u00e1ji affirms and can prove Sad\u00e1shiv never paid him the purchase money for the same. For this reason he never gave Sad\u00e1shiv the title-deeds, notwithstanding which the plot was sold with the rest of the said Sad\u00e1shiv's estate towards payment of his debt to the Honourable Company. As the title-deeds of the said spot are still in Rang\u00e1ji's hands and as he never received from the said Sad\u00e1shiv any purchase money for the same, he requests your Honour will please to order the amount sale thereof to be refunded him.\n\nHaving also enquired into the petition of the proprietors of the ground occupied for a public road from Parel to Sion, I find they have never cultivated the land since it was taken up for a road, that they have never yet been paid for it or had any other ground delivered them in lieu thereof, as has been usual in the like cases.\u00b9\n\nOn this the Board order: That the Collector let the present holders keep the Malab\u00e1r Hill ground according to their petition except one spot included therein, which the Collector is to deliver to Vishvan\u00e1th Purvoe as a reward for his having been the person who first discovered the encroachments.\u00b2\n\nThree weeks later, at a Consultation of the 17th April 1767, the Board had another petition from the proprietors of the arnys or waste plots at Malab\u00e1r Hill, showing the proprietors were still dissatisfied with the orders given regarding the land. It was therefore agreed to prevent further altercation that, subject to the usual terms of pension, the lands be put up at public outcry and sold for the most they will fetch. One of the plots, a large dwelling house, belonged by law to the Honourable Company. This plot was therefore reserved, and ground rent ordered to be collected for the same.\u00b3\n\nAccording to the above on the 29th May 1767 the Board ordered that the arnys on Malab\u00e1r Hill be sold on Tuesday next the 3rd of June and that public notice be immediately given thereof.\u2074\n\nOn the 2nd June the Board put up to sale the arnys or waste grounds at Malab\u00e1r Hill for two months credit, which were accordingly sold to different persons for the sum of Rs. 4465. Ordered that shawls be given to Vishvan\u00e1th Purvoe, Madpore, and Manoel Murzello as a reward for discovering these waste grounds and in order to induce others to make further discoveries of the like nature.\u2075\n\nOn receipt of a report of these proceedings in a letter of the 31st March 1769, paragraph 67, the Court write: We approve the manner in which you let the arnys or waste grounds on Malab\u00e1r Hill and are pleased at the prices they fetched and hope they will be found capable of further improvement.\u2076\n\n\u00b9 Pub.

Court's Letters Vol. 8 of 1769-1771, 41.\nAt a Consultation of the 7th May 1771 the Board read a petition from John Watson with one from Andrew Nesbitt, each requesting a lease of a piece of ground on the same terms as Mr. Ramsay holds his lease and undertaking if their wish is granted they will build and make other improvements. As it appears to us that improvements of this kind must be of general benefit to the island, and consequently to our Employers, ordered therefore they be complied with, together with Mr. Cooper's petition to the same purpose, which was until now deferred.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 19th June 1772 the Board record the following letter of the same date from Gaspar Dagon: Having the honour to farm the villages from Parel to Sion, the Kunbis have represented to me the losses they suffer by large pits in their batty fields dug for limestones and left open. It is extremely hard the Kunbis should suffer thereby and be obliged not only to fill them up at their own expense but to lose the cultivation of the ground by which they are unable to pay the Honourable Company's toka. On this the Board observe: Read a letter from Major Dagon farmer of several of the Honourable Company's villages representing that the Kunbis complain that they suffer losses by chunam stones being dug in their batty fields and the holes left open and requesting the Board will make a suitable deduction in the rent or grant him other redress. Ordered that the Collector enquire into the custom heretofore practised in digging chunam stone and report the same.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 10th May 1773 the Board read a petition from Lieutenant James Jackson of the artillery requesting that a lease of a piece of waste ground situated near Byculla may be granted him as he is desirous of building and making other improvements on the same. With this it is agreed to comply on the usual terms. After the boundaries are ascertained in the customary manner, the Secretary is to execute a lease to Lieutenant Jackson accordingly.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 9th November 1773 the Board read a petition from Lieutenant Abraham Henny requesting a lease of a spot of waste ground near Byculla on the same terms as granted to Mr. Ramsay, as he proposes building and making other improvements thereon. This is granted, and the Collector is ordered to cause the boundaries to be ascertained by the vereadores when the Secretary will execute a lease for it.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 24th December 1773 the Board read a petition from Mr. Samuel Stedman, requesting a lease of a spot of ground, being part of the M\u00e1zgaon estate, on the usual terms and conditions. This is granted and after the Collector has ascertained the exact boundaries as customary, the Secretary is ordered to execute a lease.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 7th April 1774 the Collector presents to the Board an account of the measurement of the spot of waste ground.\n\n---\n\n1 Pub.

Agreed that the ground specified by this measurement be granted to Mr. Samuel Stedman on the usual terms and conditions and the Secretary is ordered to execute a lease accordingly.\n\nA Consultation of the 14th June 1774 records: Mr. Stephen Tirson having petitioned for a waste piece of Malab\u00e1r Hill in order to cultivate and improve the same, the Collector was ordered to cause it to be measured and the boundaries and annual toka to be fixed as usual. The Collector now presents to the Board a letter enclosing the particulars of the land. It is therefore ordered that the Secretary draw out and execute to Mr. Tirson a lease for the said ground for the term of 99 years on the usual conditions:\n\n### Village Farm Revenue, 1747-1772.\n\n| Village       | 1747 | 1751 | 1758 | 1765 | 1772 |\n|---------------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Malab\u00e1r      | 200  | 212  | 616  | 250  | 305  |\n| Parel        | 2405 | 8105 | 2900 | 8050 | 1430 |\n| Sion         | 1200 | 1430 | 1380 | 1430 | 1430 |\n| Dh\u00e1rs\u00edvi     | 373  | 321  | 326  | 326  | 326  |\n| M\u00e1tunga      | 1965 | 2335 | 1817 | 2105 | 2105 |\n| Vadala       | 1761 | 2250 | 1915 | 1900 | 1900 |\n| N\u00e1gaon       | 982  | 1225 | 1015 | 1110 | 1110 |\n| Bannoli and Coltem | 530 | 635 | 511 | 520 | 520 |\n| M\u00e1him and Warli | 144 | 400 | 137 | 110 | 110 |\n| **Total**    | **200** | **9772** | **12,223** | **10,225** | **10,870** |\n\nAt a Consultation of the 12th May 1779 the Board put up the following villages to farm for seven years beginning the 1st June 1779:\n\n### Village Farm Revenue, 1779-1786.\n\n| Village       | Annual Stock Rent in Batty | Brab Trees | Tributes of Fowls | Mango Trees | Small Rent for ground called Feros (Foras?) | Yearly Rent 1772 to 1779 | 1779 to 1786 |\n|---------------|----------------------------|------------|-------------------|-------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------|--------------|\n| Sion          | 54 16 0 0                  | 171        | 51                |             | Rs. q. r.                               | Rs.                    | Rs.          |\n| M\u00e1tunga       | 80 23 6 2                  | 76         | 114               |             | 4 2 80                                  | 2140                   | 2105         |\n| Dh\u00e1rs\u00edvi      | 9 4 8 3                    | 623        | 42                |             | 9 3 30                                  | 380                    | 440          |\n| Vadala        | 71 22 7 3                  | 1           |                   |             | 32 0 24                                 | 1340                   | 1300         |\n| N\u00e1gaon        | 42 15 1                    | 15         |                   |             | 13 1 18                                 | 1010                   | 1100         |\n| Bannoli and Coltem | 24 12 1 1 | ... | 20 | ... | 13 1 18 | 510 | 520 |\n| Parel         | 135 11 5 2                 | 53         |                   |             | 172 3 15                                | 3380                   | 8050         |\n| M\u00e1him and Warli | 3 24 2 2\u00bd | ... | 15 | ... | 172 3 15 | 120 | 110 |\n| **Total**     | **428** | **6 18 3\u00bd** | **829** | **227** | **15** | **278** | **3** | **10,840** | **10,555** |\n\nNote.\u2014Thirty fish ponds of the privators pay annually for Rs. 44-2-49.

Diary 65 of 1774, 413.\n3 Rev. Diary 1 of 1779, 65.\nAt a Consultation of the 17th May 1749, the Board record the following letter from Mr. Laurence Sullivan the Collector of Revenues, dated 4th March 1749: Great regularity appears in reducing the M\u00e1zgaon pension to what the estate now pays the Honourable Company. On the pension books the change is thus explained. In 1674, on the establishment of the total yearly payment of Xs. 20,000 Alvara Perez de Tavora lord of M\u00e1zgaon paid for that estate yearly Xs. 1304-2-29. From this total have been made the following just deductions:\n\n| Description                                                                 | Xs. lar. res. |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|\n| For Vezrey Hill now in possession of M\u00e1n\u00e9kj\u00ed\u2019s family and paid by them yearly | 32 1 0        |\n| For Bardeen Batty Grounds belonging now to N\u00e1uji Ratan, a Patxi ditto       | 30 0 60       |\n| For Puckerewall (P\u00e1kh\u00e1div\u00e1da) Oarts and Batty Grounds bequeathed the Honourable Company and the pension then struck off which was annually | 163 1 28      |\n\nThe amount the present possessors pay yearly... 226 0 8\n\nThis I think is demonstration that due care has ever been taken not to load the estate with a pension they should not pay. With respect to the salt pans, at the same settlement of 1674 of Xs. 20,000 when Tavora paid Xs. 1304-2-29 for his whole estate, Bhav\u00e1ns\u00e9t copper-smith is distinctly rated at Xs. 5 for his salt pans. This his family has paid without impediment to this day. I am not so clear with regard to the other salt grounds. Still there is the authority of Mr. Courtney then Collector for a separate payment. And as I hope in the course of this letter to show your Honour that all salt grounds are the Company\u2019s property, it will follow that Mr. Courtney only did the Company justice. In 1674 when during the Governorship of Gerald Aungier Esq. the people\u2019s rights and the Company\u2019s royalties were solemnly settled in a general assembly, at which Tavora the proprietor of M\u00e1zgaon was present, I find in that instrument, which was signed by both sides, these words: 13th Article. That there shall be reserved for the Honourable Company\u2019s service all grounds on the waterside within the compass of the island to be disposed of on necessary occasions for the public excepting such grounds whereon there are at present planted gardens of cocoanut trees or rice grounds as also churches houses and warehouses of stone. Whensover for the public good it shall be necessary to make use of any of the said places or properties the Governor and Council shall make satisfaction to the interested in a reasonable manner. But the people are to take notice that they receive in this a particular favour from the Honourable Company their Governor and Council, in regard that in all kingdoms of the world, the ground on the waterside from the distance of forty yards at least from high-water mark belongs as a sovereign right or privilege to the Kings or Princes thereof.\n\nThis article I apprehend indisputably proves the Honourable Company\u2019s prerogative to the shores of this island, a power they have never given up. In the leases of Old Woman\u2019s island and of Malab\u00e1r Hill the Company expressly farm to the renters all fish-pans decoys and weirs.\nAlthough, upon this very subject, the family of Tavora went to England, and (supported by an ambassador of Portugal) made application to our King, yet the Honourable Company preserved their power over the fishery and coolery of M\u00e1zgaon. I have inquired of many of the old inhabitants. All agree that where the salt water washes is the Company\u2019s; the sweeter grounds, as they term them, the subject\u2019s. Warli was formerly an estate of the same Tavora\u2019s, whose proprietors have equal power with those of M\u00e1zgaon. Yet in vain have they frequently applied for liberty to make advantage of their own grounds near the shore. So late as Mr. Byfield\u2019s Collectorship they attempted to erect a salt pan and on examination they could not obtain such permission. What will put this matter past dispute is the Honourable Company\u2019s uncontested power over the Bay of M\u00e1zgaon. The marine registers will show that M\u00e1zgaon was the place where formerly all the Company\u2019s vessels and small craft were hauled up in the monsoon. Docks have been built there and no merchant at this day can build or shelter even a boat without permission from the marine paymaster to whom a small perquisite has been confirmed by the Governor and Council. A proper distinction is also preserved in favour of the estate since any person building banksauls or sheds (literally plank-halls) on the land, has to take the leave of the proprietor and pay him a consideration. Upon inspection I hope that your Honour will find those points justly stated. At least I can assure you I have spared no pains to obtain a true knowledge of them. As the present renters have assumed the power to impede the Honourable Company\u2019s Kolis fishing round the shores of M\u00e1zgaon unless subject to their orders, I cannot as Collector admit such a right until I am authorized. Your Honour will please to settle it so that the people may reap the advantages from which they are at present debarred.\n\nThe Board also record a letter from the Collector Mr. Laurence Sullivan, dated 16th May 1749: Some weeks past I acquainted your Honour that the inhabitants of M\u00e1zgaon dependant on the Honourable Company begged redress against the renters who designed levying a double tax on their houses rating at a rupee those who formerly paid Re. \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\). As you were pleased to disallow of this, I told the people they were not to pay the extra tax. Yesterday and today the people have been with me complaining that the renters impeded them covering their houses until they pay this double tax and request speedy relief as the monsoon is so near. I am therefore again obliged to trouble your Honour for such order as you judge necessary.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 17th May 1749 the President laid the above two letters before the Board. After consideration the Board directed that Messrs. Thomas Lane and James Henry Lambe be appointed a committee to inquire into this complaint and make a report of their proceedings to this Board.\n\nThree days after (the 20th May 1749) Messrs. Lane and Lambe submit the following report: Your Honour having appointed us as\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 22 of 1749, 164-167.\n2 Pub. Diary 22 of 1749, 167.\n3 Pub. Diary 22 of 1749, 144.\na committee to inquire into the complaints given in by Mr. Laurence Sullivan as Collector against the present renters of M\u00e1zgaon farm of divers encroachments made by them upon the inhabitants of the said farm, we on examination found that the renters lay claim, 1stly to certain batty grounds and salt pans; 2ndly to a quarry of stone now in possession of M\u00e1zgaon church; 3rdly to raise the ground rent on houses belonging to the inhabitants; 4thly to a government over the fishermen that they shall not go to fish in shallow waters without their leave and paying them a small consideration for such license; 5thly to appropriate to their use certain weeds and brushwood that grows in the tide's way at present in possession of Es\u00e1ji N\u00e1ik.\n\nTo all these we now lay before your Honour the best information we could procure. In respect to the batty grounds and salt pans above contested it appears, partly by records partly by relation of the old inhabitants, that these grounds were originally recovered from the sea by throwing up enclosures of stone which we apprehend could never have been done but by a permission from the regal power of this island. This being premised we shall shew their titles to their grounds as presented to us. Es\u00e1ji N\u00e1ik purchased his batty grounds and salt pan of Vithalset coppersmith, who bought it off Rhodji P\u00e1t\u00edl on the 20th January 1701 and produced his deed of sale. Tavora the last lord of M\u00e1zgaon was alive at the time this purchase was made. During his life and unto this day the said Es\u00e1ji N\u00e1ik has held an indisputed possession. Further as Mr. Laurence Sullivan observes in his letter under the 4th March 1749 that when in the year 1674 the pension upon M\u00e1zgaon estate was settled at Rs. 1304-2-29, this ground was not included in the said pension. If it was, the diminution of the pension would appear, as it does in the cases of Vezreywall, Bardeen batty grounds, and Puckererwall (P\u00e1kh\u00e1div\u00e1da) the sale of which has reduced the M\u00e1zgaon pension to Rs. 1078-2-13. We are therefore of opinion as Tavora made no claim to this ground in his lifetime and paid no pension for it, it ought not to be esteemed as a part of or as belonging to the said estate. Dhanji Bhav\u00e1nset made appear that he inherited his ground from his father and that the same had been in his family uninterruptedly. As it appears on the records in the Collector's office that in the year 1674 when the people were laid under an annual tribute of Xs. 20,000 as an acknowledgment for their possession of the ground on this island on the division, it fell to the share of his predecessor to pay a pension of Xs. 5 for this very spot now contested, this being also distinct from the pension then taxed on M\u00e1zgaon estate. It follows that this ground could be no part of the M\u00e1zgaon estate. B\u00e1b\u00e1ji Th\u00e1kur, son of D\u00e1ji Th\u00e1kur, produced a petition of his father to Mr. Stephen Strutt then 2nd in Council, dated 1715, wherein he desires permission to throw up some stone banks by the river side to recover the land now contested. This petition was confirmed and the year following the vereadores and mh\u00e1t\u00e1r\u00e1s were appointed to measure the ground so recovered and settle the pension which they fixed at Xs. 4 a year. From the above we think that all these holders' titles are good. It remains to examine whether they have not made any inland encroachments and taken part of the M\u00e1zgaon estate. Of this the vereadores and\nmh\u00e1t\u00e1r\u00e1\u015b are the only judges. Secondly, as to the quarry of stone now in possession of the church of M\u00e1zgaon it is to be observed that when Tavora died he left, as mentioned by name in his will, certain batty grounds to the church which are supposed to produce 12 mud\u00e1s a year. It is nowhere mentioned in Tavora's will that the church is to have a revenue from digging of stone, neither is it known to us that the spot where the above quarry now is, was one of those individual pieces of ground left in Tavora's will to the church. The mh\u00e1t\u00e1r\u00e1\u015b alone can determine whether it is or no. Supposing it be, it ought to be let out to sow batty as batty not stone was left to the church, otherwise the will is not complied with. Thirdly, as to raising the ground-rents on the houses belonging to the inhabitants, the present renters as represented by Mr. Sullivan in his letter of the 16th May had actually raised their rent. We apprehend the increase was not exorbitant. That a ground rent on these houses was ever recovered is not disputed. The increase was left to the discretion of the owners of the estate to fix the rate, regard being had to the circumstances of the owners as well as to the dimensions of the houses. As this method is subject to oppression and dispute, we apprehend it would be much better to have a rate fixed in proportion to what they now pay. Fourthly, as regards the direction over the fishermen claimed by the renters, the Company have always supported their own dominion over the coolery and fishermen of M\u00e1zgaon. We think the Company's claim ought not in the least to be receded from. Whatever may have been practised by the former owners of this estate, we apprehend that the investment of such a power in the renters is wrong and injurious to the liberty of the subjects. As several of the fish decoys have been made at the expense of the owners of M\u00e1zgaon estate the present renters ought to have it in their power to permit those only that they please to fish in those decoys. The renters ought not to have power to hinder the villagers fishing in any other water. Fifthly, as to the weeds and brushwood which the renters claim as manure, we observe that they grow in the tide's way and therefore cannot be said to be the property of any man. Still they can more reasonably be allowed to the farmers than to Es\u00e1ji N\u00e1ik who claims them only under pretence that they are contiguous to his ground.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 30th May 1749, the Board pass the following orders on the Committee's report: Taking into consideration what the Committee set forth in their abovementioned report concerning the claim made by the renters on certain batty grounds and salt pans which now pay the Honourable Company a pension of Rs. 23 a year, it is observed that these lands lie intermixed with the other lands of the farm, and the renters apprehending that those grounds are only an encroachment made on the boundaries of M\u00e1zgaon estate and were enjoyed by the former owners as a part thereof, they think themselves entitled thereto. The renters claim that they have rented the whole aldea or estate with all the revenues and petty tributes belonging to it, excepting such batty\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 22 of 1749, 168-171.\ngrounds, the absolute property of the Honourable Company, as were made over to them by the original proprietor of the estate. The above being duly considered, the Board is of opinion that a proper survey and examination ought to be made and taken by the vereadores and mh\u00e1l\u00e1v\u00e1s of the grounds in dispute. If it shall be found that the plots in dispute were formerly a part of the estate and are only an encroachment on the boundaries thereof, in such case the renters are sufficiently entitled to them on paying the Honourable Company's pension as usual. In respect to the quarry of stone said to belong to M\u00e1zgaon Church, it does not appear by the Committee's report that the church has any title thereto. The quarry is therefore part of the estate and consequently the property of the renters. By the Collector's letter to the President of the 16th May, it appears as if the renters wanted to double the ground rent on all the houses on the estate. But by the Committee's report it does not appear that they have raised the ground rent on any of the houses exorbitantly, and from the renters' roll or list of the houses on the estate it appears that they have not raised the rent on much the greater number also, and that several of the poorer sort of people pay no ground rent at all. Nor can it be esteemed an hardship that the ground rents on stone-built and tile-roofed houses are raised from half a rupee, which the small caj\u00e1n houses pay, to rupee one. Doubtless according to the renters' lease they have the same authority as the former owners of the estate previous to the building of any houses to settle the ground rent at such rates as they shall judge proper. In regard to the fishery of M\u00e1zgaon, it nowhere appears that the renters have been any impediment to it otherwise than by preventing the Kolis fishing in the decoys upon the shore. By the Committee's report the renters have power over the decoys. Further on this point the renters allege they receive no consideration, but permit such poor people as they think proper to fish in them. As to the tideway weeds and brushwood mentioned in the Committee's report, they are of such little consideration as not to be worth contesting. The renters have as good a title to them as any one else. Upon the whole it does not appear to the Board that the renters of M\u00e1zgaon have usurped any undue authority over the inhabitants or Kolis belonging to that place or taken any measures that will be detrimental to the Honourable Company, though undoubtedly, as the Collector imagined that injury would be caused by the renters' proceedings, he did his duty by making a timely representation thereof. Directed that the Secretary acquaint the Collector of the Revenues of the Board's opinion concerning the complaint made through him by the inhabitants of M\u00e1zgaon against the present renters of that estate.\n\nA Consultation of the 31st January 1758 records: The lease of the M\u00e1zgaon estate, which was last let out by the Mayor's Court, is near expiring. An authentic copy of the original patent which the\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 22 of 1749, 158-160.\nPresident has procured shows that the first proprietor never had any right or authority to sell or alienate the estate.\\(^1\\) Our Honourable Masters besides have a very considerable mortgage on the estate. Moreover they are the Lords Proprietors; in consequence of the island being made over to them from the King of Portugal and our Royal Sovereign Charles II. In these circumstances Messrs. Crommelin Sedgwick and Byfeld are appointed a Committee for laying in a proper claim, in their behalf, by petition to the Mayor's Court.\\(^2\\)\n\nA fortnight later (14th February 1758) after considering the Committee's report, the Court observe: Messrs. Crommelin Sedgwick and Byfeld report that the Mayor's Court have issued a precept to put the Honourable Company in possession of the M\u00e1zgaon estate. The Collector is therefore ordered to receive charge of it in their name from Mr. Richard Nowland the present renter, as also a part of it sold by Martinio de Silva to Sancre Sinoy (Shankar Shenoi), Antonio de Silva, and Antonio de Lima in the year 1732, which it seems Mr. Nowland has never occupied on account of the Honourable Company's mortgage bonds. The letting out of the estate, with the salt and other farms, is deferred that we may gain a more certain knowledge of its produce. Mean-time, as ordered at our last meeting, the Collector must prepare for the auction and permit Mr. Nowland to hold it on the present terms.\\(^3\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The original patent runs: By the Patent signed at Goa, and dated the 16th January 1672, the village of M\u00e1zgaon is given to Leonel D'Souza forever he or his heirs paying every year (quarterly) 195 gold pardoes and three silver t\u00e2ngas of six and half double pice each. On the death of the said Leonel D'Souza, the village is to remain with Donna Anna, Pessoa Ray D'Souza, and Manoel D'Souza, his wife and sons, that is to say one-half of the income to the said two sons. But the management to be under the said Donna Anna who is to pay the pension, and half the rent of the said village, to the said two sons. After her death the said village is to remain forever to the said two sons, the eldest managing it. On his death the village is to remain to the youngest son, in case the eldest has no son, but if there is a son, he is to have the management. When no heirs descendants of those two sons are left, it is to remain to the heirs and successors of such as die last, as the real intent is for this estate to remain to the heirs and successors of the said Leonel D'Souza, whilst his generation continues. But if the said two sons die before Donna Anna, it is in such case to remain to the descendants of said Leonel D'Souza, whom he might nominate by his last will and testament, with all the appurtenances and sacred grounds. But the said village is not to be sold, charged, or alienated without the King of Portugal's license, or the license of his Viceroy and Governor of India. Nor is it to be divided, but managed only by one person, which the Governor of Bassein is fully to comply with on their parts, provided the said Leonel D'Souza, his heirs and successors, comply with the obligation aforesaid. By another Patent, dated 3rd June 1687, it appears the management of this village was made over to Ray D'Souza the 29th of July 1682, and therein declared that as the said Ray D'Souza had no other son but Bernardy D'Tavora, the King confirmed the said Bernardy D'Tavora in the possession thereof, provided he did not deprive the other heirs of the said Ray D'Souza in their right. Also provided he did not sell, give, or change the said village in any shape or manner whatever without license (as aforesaid). Nor was he to divide it as it was to go entirely under the management of one person only. Upon these conditions he was to possess and enjoy the same. To the copy of the Patent this note is added: M\u00e1nekji Navroji's Hill, the Oart Charney, and Warli are part of this estate. Pub. Diary 3 of 1758, 107-108. For details see Forrest's Home Series, II. 359-365.\n\n\\(^2\\) Pub. Diary 31 of 1758, 65.\n\n\\(^3\\) Pub. Diary 31 of 1758, 117-118.\nWhen on the 27th day of March 1668, the Honourable Company took possession of the island, they were made Lords Proprietors, preserving the inhabitants' allegiance in as ample a manner as granted by the King of Portugal. At that time Bernardina D'Zabra was proprietor of the M\u00e1zgaon estate, as heir to Leonel D'Souza, to whom the King of Portugal gave it by the aforesaid Patent. [To the Consultation is added the following note: In this Charter S\u00e1lsette, it is said, was particularly and expressly described a part of what was to be surrendered to King Charles.]\n\nAt a Consultation of the 5th May 1758 the Board received the following letter from the Collector, dated 2nd May 1758: Enclosed is an inventory of such part of the estate of M\u00e1zgaon as was lately farmed by Mr. Richard Nowland, as well as that which is said to appertain to the Church. I also enclose the best account I have been able to obtain of the produce of both. Your directions to me were to parcel it out in a proper manner for letting it to farm. But I am informed it will be more for the Honourable Company's interest to farm the whole to one person. The few remaining Kunbis declare they will not undertake to cultivate the ground belonging to the estate, on any other than the following conditions, namely that the grass growing on the batty grounds, which they respectively cultivate, and on certain spots contiguous thereto, well known they say from time immemorial to appertain to certain batty grounds, shall be their indisputable property for manure and such other uses as they may think proper to put it to. That the toka or farmer's share of batty shall be winnowed within two days after they bring it to the farmer's compound, and shall at the same time be received by the farmer, and measured according to the custom practised in the Honourable Company's villages, and not as heretofore. That the brab trees shall be drawn by them alone, that is to say the Kunbis of M\u00e1zgaon who are likewise Bhand\u00e1ris, on the same terms as have been usual hitherto.\n\nOn these conditions the p\u00e1t\u00edls and mh\u00e1t\u00e1r\u00e1s of the village tell me they hope soon to prevail with such Kunbis as from time to time have left the village to return. By this means instead of cultivating grounds producing 85 mud\u00e1s of batty, as it seems has hitherto been the case, it is probable the whole may be cultivated. Provided your Honour should determine to let the estate out to farm, I beg leave to offer it as my humble opinion, the farm should not at present be for a longer term than five years. By that time it is probable, through proper encouragement, a sufficient number of Kunbis may return to cultivate the whole batty grounds belonging to the estate. This would greatly increase the value of it, whereas the number now resident on the estate are barely sufficient to cultivate ground producing 85 mud\u00e1s toka, and that too on the terms of allowing the Kunbis ground capable, with proper care and a sufficient number of Kunbis, of producing 110 mud\u00e1s. I conclude Antonio D'Lima and P\u00e1ndu Sinay who call themselves the proprietors of this estate, have long since laid before your Honour such reasons as they told me they had to offer for refusing\nChapter VIII.\nRevenue and Finance.\n\nM\u00e1gaon Estate, 1758.\n\nto deliver into my charge such part of the estate as they say was bequeathed by one of the former proprietors, and has heretofore been reserved for the support of a Church built and still standing on the estate. I shall expect your further commands regarding this claim. I have directed the ground you were pleased to part with to Mr. Thomas Whitehill to be valued, and shall likewise, as you order, include the several parcels belonging to him under the name of Villa Nova. Antonio D'Lima and P\u00e1du Sinay, whose indigent circumstances may indeed justly claim your Honour's compassion, desire me to request on their behalf that the indulgence of full 15 mud\u00e1s of batty may be allowed them by the farmer, whoever he may be, to support themselves and their families. This allowance has always been granted, since the estate has been withheld from them on account of the several incumbrances on it. It was continued to them by a clause inserted in the Mayor's Court lease, to Mr. Nowland, though with this exception that they were to receive this batty, in proportion to the ground which might be cultivated. This change, they allege, reduced them to great extremities. They therefore hope your Honour will in future oblige the farmer to allow full fifteen mud\u00e1s between them.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 Pub.

At the same time Mr. Samuel Hough has built a country house and outhouses on a certain part of the estate whose annual produce is valued at Rs. 845-3-4.

That all persons may be informed what part of the estate we have agreed to lease to Mr. Hough, he engages to distinguish the same by setting up camp flags at the extreme bounds of it.

The most intelligent persons present likewise declaring that it will be best to let out the estate for the term of nine years instead of five, as it will not be worth a tenant\u2019s while to plant trees or make any valuable improvements for so short a lease as five years, this is agreed to and the bidders are informed.

It is further explained that the farmer must abide by the conditions, always specified by the vereadores in their leases, as to the manner of delivering up the estate and the allowance to be made for improvements. The abovementioned part of the estate being put up, it was again rented by Mr. Richard Nowland for Rs. 2200 a year. The Oart Charney being the remaining part of the estate, withheld in the name of the church and situated at Bombay, was then put up on the above terms and conditions, and let to M\u00e1nekji Limji, Mung\u00e1ji, B\u00e1buji Es\u00e1ji, and S\u00e1mji D\u00e1d\u00e1ji at Rs. 640 a year.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 23rd May 1758 the Board record: The old Mark House on M\u00e1zgaon Hill having been plundered of all the timber and plank while in the hands of the late supposed proprietors, who broke down great part of the walls to get thereat, is at present in a very ruinous condition. As Mr. Byfeld proposes to fit it up at his own expense for an habitation to live in, provided we will permit him to alter the building in such manner as he may think proper, and grant him a lease thereof and the hill on which it stands, for ninety-nine years renewable every twenty-one years, on paying a fine of fifty rupees. This is agreed to, on his engaging to whitewash the front of the said house annually in the usual manner, so as it may continue a mark to the shipping coming in or going out of this harbour. Directed therefore that an order be issued to the vereadores and mh\u00e1t\u00e1r\u00e1s of Bombay, requiring them to survey the said hill and report in writing what yearly rent ought to be paid by Mr. Byfeld. This amount will then be deducted out of the present farmer's rent, he having voluntarily consented to this assignment being made. And whereas at the bottom of said hill are some batty grounds called Burdu at present in possession of N\u00e1nji Ratanji P\u00e1rsi, said to be purchased by him of John D'Aubree and Fernandes Fenao, which there is great reason to imagine originally belonged to the M\u00e1zgaon estate, and has been sold by a false title, Mr. Byfeld requests that in case it is so proved, and they come into the Honourable Company's possession, he may hold the said premises by lease in manner aforesaid, upon the same terms and conditions as he agrees to pay N\u00e1nji Ratanji for the annual rent thereof. In this the Board concur, and a lease is ordered to be drawn out accordingly.\n\nOn the 31st May 1758 the vereadores report: In obedience to the order of the Honourable the President and Council, we the vereadores and mh\u00e1t\u00e1r\u00e1s have made a survey of the hill at the end of\n\n---\n\n1 Regarding this Ponkenny House on the 1st Aug. 1758 the Diary further records: Capt. C. Femble desiring a lease of the Ponkenny House and garden belonging to the M\u00e1zgaon estate for the term of 99 years at Rs. 273-3-0 per annum, and agreeing to pay a fine of Rs. 50 at the expiration of every 21 years during that term, the same is agreed to as Mr. Nowland has declined accepting it though rented to him on the 12th May last at Rs. 200 a year. Pub. Diary 31 of 1758, 390.\n\n2 Pub. Diary 31 of 1758, 275-276.\n\n3 Pub. Diary 31 of 1758, 287.\nwhich stands the old Mark House, situated in the village of M\u00e1zgaon, whereon are growing to the foot of another hill adjoining thereto, thirty-five brab trees bearing fruit, four without fruit, twelve young plants, and two khajuri trees. For all these we judge a yearly rent of twenty-three rupees should be paid. This is what we have to report. Agreeable to this report, on the 7th June 1758 the Board resolve Mr. Byfeld must be charged Rs. 23, and the amount deducted from Mr. Nowland's annual rent for that estate.\n\nOn these proceedings, after a lapse of nearly two years, in a letter of the 25th April 1760, paragraphs 99-100, the Court observe: The letting out large tracts of lands for houses and gardens of pleasure we disapprove. All spare ground should be reserved to accommodate useful inhabitants, who may desire to make Bombay their residence. The Mark House at M\u00e1zgaon must and shall be always in your power to destroy at an hour's warning. Nor can we be at other expense than the charge of levelling it. This precaution you ought to have taken. The leasing M\u00e1zgaon in one lot we judge contrary to our interest. Experience should have convinced you of this as the farming out our oats in small lots in 1752 produced us a duplicate profit. We therefore direct that in future you attend to this and branch into small parcels whatever will admit of it, for a large purchase will always bring on a combination. We also forbid the sale of our property by valuation. Let every thing belonging to us be always sold to the best bidder at public outcry and after a proper notification. The oat to Manchar Baman and others should have been disposed of in this manner and in divided lots if practicable. We shall always give our consent to any reasonable indulgence that may advantage our servants and benefit the island. Accordingly you are permitted to excuse President Bourchier the export customs on such goods as are manufactured by him at Bombay for foreign markets. This concession is to continue until and no longer than that branch of trade may equally with others bear an export duty.\n\nThe farmer's management of the M\u00e1zgaon estate seems to have caused disaffection. At a Consultation of the 8th January 1762, the Board read the following report, dated 5th January 1762, from the committee appointed to examine into the M\u00e1zgaon Kunbis' complaints: With regard to the first complaint in the petition we are fully convinced. It has been an ancient custom for the cultivators of batty grounds to be allowed the hay growing on banks and bhotes as also whatever else they may be productive of during the rainy season. The farmer taking away the hay or grass from the Kunbis being a direct breach of the third article of his lease, we demanded of him his reasons for so doing. He replied he knew nothing of the matter. If his people did cut hay or grass, it was without his orders, and he would take care to prevent the like in future. He added that the Kunbis were daily seen carrying the hay into Bombay for sale. Being asked why he did not, agreeable to the tenour of the 12th article of his lease, oblige\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 31 of 1758, 302, 305.\n2 Pub. Dep. Court's Letters Vol. 5 of 1757-1761, 270-271.\nthe Kunbis to preserve the hay to burn the batty grounds, he could give no satisfactory answer. The second complaint that the petitioners were refused to feed their cattle on a reserved part of the village ground is positively denied by the farmer. He alleges the petitioners have always had liberty to feed cattle thereon. At the same time he acknowledges that as many batty grounds do lay uncultivated for want of cultivators, he receives a consideration from the milk-sellers for permitting their cattle to feed therein. This appears to us from the best information we could get to be very detrimental to the estate for the following reasons. (1) By suffering the batty grounds to remain uncultivated they impoverish and will not produce so much batty as when constantly cultivated. (2) The cattle feeding therein break the banks, so that the water cannot lodge in the ground. The third article of his lease prohibits him feeding cattle on the Kunbis' hay. The third complaint proves to be founded on fact and is not denied by the farmer, except that the reason of his raising the rent of brab trees was not to obtain permission from the arrack farmer to sell M\u00e1zgaon toddy in Bombay, but that formerly when they paid only half a rupee each tree himself took their toddy for one pice the bandy (that is b\u00e1nda = two bottles or about \u2153rd of an imperial gallon) though at that time they could have got two pice the bandy for it elsewhere. Afterwards on his declining to take the toddy, the Bhand\u00e1ris themselves consented and agreed to pay him Rs. 0-3-60 the tree at which rate it has continued for some years past. But by the sixth article of his lease he is not to introduce any new customs to the prejudice of the people. The fourth complaint proves on a trial made before us between the former way of measuring the toka as was done by the old proprietors and what is practised by the farmer to involve a loss of about 6 per cent or one adh\u00f3li in every phara of batty to the cultivators. This the cultivators acknowledge to have been practised ever since Mr. Nowland has had the farm. They declare they frequently complained of it to the late De la Garde when he was Collector without obtaining any redress. This method of measuring the batty, namely by pouring it into the phara from baskets held up as high as a man can reach is contrary to what is done at the M\u00e1ndvi and everywhere else. With regard to the fifth complaint the old proprietors of M\u00e1zgaon estate assure us that it has always been the custom for the farmers to collect from the Kunbis' trees about one-third part of the fruit as toka. This we find Mr. Nowland continues, but does not as the complainants allege exact a half. At the same time it must be remarked that by the fourth article of his lease he is prohibited from taking any fruit from Kunbis' trees. The sixth complaint is not fully proved to be just. Only two people say that two or three years ago Mr. Nowland beat them. Concerning the seventh and last complaint of the petition the people in general declare themselves much dissatisfied with Mr. Nowland. They allege among other things that whenever they could not pay the balance of toka due to him in batty he charged them at the rate of Rs. 1\u00bd the phara till last year when he charged only Rs. 1-0-80. This is a great deal more than the medium price batty is sold for. They further complain that Mr. Nowland charges interest at nine per cent per annum till the balance is paid which was never practised but by him. One Bhau\nGaret complains that last year Mr. Nowland exacted from him the *toka* of two batty grounds although he cultivated only one which Mr. Nowland had changed for another. Another man, one Luckset, complains that two years ago Mr. Nowland upon a dispute with him turned him out of the village; and notwithstanding he did not cultivate the batty grounds the year after he was turned out of the village, Mr. Nowland demanded and received of him the usual *toka* amounting to upwards of Rs. 24 reckoning the interest thereon. Others complain that Mr. Nowland exacts more ground rent than is his due according to the measurement. An instance we experienced in a house which paid Rs. 5 and which being measured at 11 *res* a square yard turned out only Rs. 3\u00bd. A grievance in general complained of by the inhabitants is that Mr. Nowland will allow only one shop to be kept in the village for which he receives a consideration of Rs. 5 a month from the Baman who keeps the shop, on condition no other shops shall be kept there. By this means the poor inhabitants are obliged to pay more than double the value of the necessaries they have occasion to buy or must do without them. All these complaints were fully proved to us. We cannot but observe from what has been said that had Mr. Nowland paid any regard to the eighth article of his lease, whereby he is directed to use the old Kunbis well and continue them in the village, and likewise endeavour to get other Kunbis for the improvement of the premises, there would in all probability have been no batty grounds left uncultivated. Though this may be no loss to him, as he finds the grass produced therein turns to account, yet in the end it must prove very prejudicial to the estate for the reasons before alleged. The Collector also represents that, under pretence he has a right to cut down all dead trees, Mr. Nowland has taken upon him to cut down brab and other trees without previously advertising the Collector of the necessity thereof. Had Mr. Nowland considered the articles of his lease, he could have found that he is prohibited by the tenth article either from cutting trees for his use or suffering others to cut trees. This prohibition was certainly inserted purposely to prevent such bad and prejudicial practices. Otherwise a bad man might at the conclusion of his lease greatly prejudice the estate by cutting the good as well as the bad trees. The Collector also represents that notwithstanding the repeated orders that have been issued to all farmers to plant milkbush about their grounds which were in particular enforced to Mr. Nowland, yet there is not the least appearance of any milkbush on the estate. With regard to the demand of ground rent made by Mr. Nowland from several people whose vessels have been repaired in the Dock at M\u00e1zgaon he pleads that it is not on account the vessels being in the Dock but for sheds for Banksauls built on his grounds for which he thinks he has a just right to charge rent.\n\nAt a Consultation on the 8th January 1762, after considering this report the Board resolve that as it appears Mr. Richard Nowland farmer of the M\u00e1zgaon village has been guilty of some abuses and oppressions, copy of the report be sent him by the Secretary who is\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 38 of 1762, 13-15.\ndirected to acquaint him that unless the abuses are forthwith remedied and he abides strictly by the tenour of his lease the farm will be taken from him. Further that he must not upon any account impede any persons from keeping shops in the village or make any charge of ground rent for sheds erected to preserve the stores of such vessels as from time to time go into Dock. Nor may he cut any trees upon the estate without the Collector's permission first obtained.\n\nOn the 10th April 1762, the Bombay Government write to the Court: The Kunbis and other inhabitants of M\u00e1zgaon village having lodged a complaint against the farmer, we appointed Messrs. Holford and Court to enquire into the merits of the complaint. As, on the 5th January, they reported that the farmer had been guilty of certain abuses and oppressions, we directed the Secretary to acquaint him that unless the same were forthwith remedied and he strictly adhered to the tenour of his lease the farm would be taken from him. This, we hope, will prevent the like in future. Next year in reply in a letter of the 6th April 1763, paragraph 77, the Court write: We very much approve of what you did in consequence of a complaint from the Kunbis and other inhabitants of M\u00e1zgaon village. All abuses and oppressions of the farmer must ever be discouraged, and a speedy remedy applied to redress every real grievance of your inhabitants in general.\n\nA Consultation of the 27th March 1767 records: As the lease of M\u00e1zgaon estate expires on the 11th of May next, and as our Honourable Masters have recommended the letting it out in small lots, it is ordered that it be let out accordingly on Tuesday the 15th day of May in such lots as the Collector, after making a proper enquiry, may judge most to our Honourable Masters' interest.\n\nAccordingly on the 15th May the Board proceeded to let the estate of M\u00e1zgaon in different lots for fourteen years; these being put up on the usual terms of the Honourable Company's farms, were let out to the undermentioned persons:\n\n1st Lot Naugar including Ghodap Dev, let to Fr\u00e1mji Hirji Moody for Rs. 845 a year;\n2nd Lot Mallavady including Bhoyclem (Byculla), except the mango tree generally known by the name of the Governor's mango tree which is to remain as heretofore for his use, and the ground let to Mr. Andrew Ramsay, and one muda of batty ground to be allowed to the mh\u00e1t\u00e1ra for his pay, let to D\u00e1d\u00e1bh\u00e1i M\u00e1nekji Rustamji and Dhanji Punja for Rs. 410 a year;\n3rd Lot Culvodey (Koliv\u00e1da) Surji let to R\u00e1ghuset Goldsmith for Rs. 340 a year;\n4th Lot Bandarvadia let to M\u00e1nekji Limji and Bhimji R\u00e1mset for Rs. 500 a year;\n5th Lot M\u00e1zgaon Collowdy (Koliv\u00e1di) let to R\u00e1ghuset Madset for Rs. 640 a year. In case the Honourable Company should want ground for the Dock or the Powder Works, they are to have such ground on making a reasonable deduction in the rent;\n6th Lot Oart Charney let to Mung\u00e1ji Vis\u00e1ji for Rs. 715.\n\n---\n\n1 Pub.

Diary 48 of 1767, 329, 330.\nAt a Consultation of the 28th July 1779 the Board read a petition from sundry of the inhabitants of M\u00e1zgaon, and referred it to a committee consisting of Messrs. Moore, Stackhouse, and Ramsay the Collector, to inquire into and report on the merits thereof. On the 8th December 1779 the Board having considered the committee's report and the opinion of an attorney at law passed the following orders: The Committee appointed on the 28th July last to inquire into the merits of the petition from the inhabitants of M\u00e1zgaon now lay before us the opinion of an attorney at law on the rights of the farmer of M\u00e1zgaon village under his lease from the Company. On consideration of this opinion and the nature of the case itself we cannot have the shadow of a doubt that the farmer can have no further rights in the village than as a mere lease-holder, and that he has no other privilege beyond any other lease-holder under the Company. We cannot, therefore, admit and are resolved to oppose to the utmost, his exercising any rights as a proprietor or lord of the village which he assumes in his letter to the committee, but only to permit him to receive such benefits from the farm as he is entitled to by his lease. The lease is now attentively considered and according thereto it is resolved that the farmer be permitted to collect from the inhabitants the same ground rent only on the old grounds and houses as was paid when the lease was first put into his hands. On any new grants of ground or additional or new buildings he may be permitted to collect ground rent according to any new rate of which notice must be given to the inhabitants by publication. The inhabitants must also be acquainted that they will be supported therein by this Government which is bound to protect them from imposition. We further totally disallow any right in the farmer to grant exclusive licenses for the vending of any necessaries. It is therefore resolved to suppress the shops complained of by the inhabitants as licensed by the farmer for selling the necessaries of life and to give notice that all persons will have free liberty to open shops if they observe the usual forms of this Government. The several papers on this subject and the lease are entered after this Consultation and must be particularly noticed to the Honourable Company and their advice and the opinion of Counsel requested thereon.\n\nThat the outlay on the Hornby Vellard or Malab\u00e1r Breach between 1720 and 1740 resulted in the redemption of a large area of land appears by an entry in a Consultation of the 13th October 1747: The account produce of batty grounds for pension for 1746 amounted to Rs. 917-1-67; and the account produce of batty grounds out of Malab\u00e1r Breach within the district of M\u00e1lh\u00edm for 1746, amounted to Rs. 706-2-0.\n\nOn the same subject on the 13th October 1747 the Board received the following letter from Mr. Byfeld the Collector: The annual rent of batty grounds produced out of the Breach for 113,167 barg\u00e1s is at present only Rs. 1623-3-67; the fixed rent when the sluices were first made having been continued to this time without any valuation.

Diary 20 of 1747, 370.\nthe Honourable Company will be at the expense of two small sluices more, which indeed are greatly wanted to carry off the back water, the rental will increase annually near Rs. 1100, as that part of the batty grounds will then be of equal value to any adjacent thereto which lets out from res 6 to 8, whereas those now occupied pay only res 4 and 6 a barga. This difference in rent amounts to only Rs. 748-2-12 which with 22,824 bargas that will be gained by the waters being drained off and let out at 6 res a barga make the above increase.\n\nOn Mr. Byfeld\u2019s letter a Consultation of the 5th February 1748 records: As making two small sluices for carrying off the back water from the batty grounds recovered out of the Breach is represented by the Collector in his letter dated the 13th October 1747 to be much wanted, and as this will be a means of increasing the rent of those grounds near Rs. 1100 annually, resolved that the sluices be immediately set about the cost being computed at Rs. 3500.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 18th March 1748 the Collector of rents and revenues represents that the Kunbis of the village of Parel have for many years been 48 mud\u00e1s 5 phards 3 adholis 1 ser of batty behind with their toka or payment in kind. Their evasive excuses satisfy the Collector that rigorous means should be taken to recover the outstanding. The Board ordered that on Saturday next such parts of the Corunbis\u2019 (Kunbis\u2019) estates be sold at public outcry as will sufficiently discharge their respective debts. Of this the Secretary is directed to issue public notice.\n\nA Consultation of the 18th January 1751 records: Having great reason to believe that both the Honourable Company\u2019s batty grounds and salt pans will rent for more money than they annually produce, resolved to try what they will rent for at auction. If the auction produces more than the medium rents of the last fourteen years they should be let to the highest bidder. The unoccupied grounds saved out of the Breach and Malab\u00e1r hill, which last at present produces only about Rs. 160 a year, should also be put to auction. Of this the Secretary is directed to give proper notice.\n\nIn accordance with this decision a Consultation of the 15th February 1751 records: The Honourable Company\u2019s batty grounds in the district of Parel were put up for a term of seven years at Rs. 2000 a year. None bidding thereon so much as they produce the Honourable Company annually, the renting them out is deferred till the 26th instant. It is agreed to put them again to auction along with the passage boats of Mahim Sion and Bombay, and the unoccupied waste ground recovered from the Breach.\n\nAccordingly on the 26th February the batty grounds were put to auction on the following terms: (1) That the farm be let for seven years commencing from 1st June 1751 to the 31st May 1758; (2) That the farmer pays the rent in two equal instalments one in the end of\n\n---\n\n1 Pub.

Then the following batty grounds in the several districts were put up separately and farmed out as undermentioned, namely:\n\n| Battly Grounds | Rent per Year |\n|----------------|--------------|\n| Parel Batty Grounds rented by R\u00e1ms\u00e9et Gamb\u00e1s\u00e9t and Manoel Barett\u00f3 | 2605 |\n| Sion Battly Grounds rented by Captain James Sterling | 1300 |\n| Dh\u00e1rav\u00ed Battly Grounds rented by Joseph D'Souza | 273 |\n| M\u00e1tunga Battly Grounds with the Packaries of Foras and Gomarry rented by Bhiku Sinay Newrekar | 1965 |\n| Vad\u0101la Battly Grounds with the Hill Jurady rented by Manoel Barett\u00f3 | 1761 |\n| N\u00e1gao Battly Grounds rented by Am Tacour (Am Th\u00e1kur) and Ranga Dalvi | 982 |\n| Bomanculey and Coltem Battly Grounds rented by B\u00e9yr\u00e1mji Limji and Samji N\u00e1ik | 530 |\n| Mahim Kasba Battly Grounds with Warli rented by Vithal J\u00e1noji and J\u00e1noji Sivji | 144 |\n\nTotal | 9560\n\nIn a letter of the 4th March 1752, paragraph 81, the Court approve the method of letting out batty grounds on rent for a certain number of years. They write: We approve of your letting out on rent for a certain number of years the batty grounds and salt pans, as likewise the Bombay and Mahim Passage Boats, as we agree with you in opinion that it will be an advantage to our revenue.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 16th January 1753 the following petition from R\u00e1mji Parvu is read: Your petitioner, an old servant to the Honourable Company, with humble submission, represents to your Honour that there was a piece of ground by the Church Gate without the Town Wall producing no rent to the Honourable Company which your petitioner took on condition of paying them a certain pension.\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 24 of 1751, 57-59.\n2 Pub. Dep. Court's Letters Vol. 4 of 1752-1756, 14.\nThe converting of this waste into batty grounds cost him near Rs. 1200 besides his and son's labour. When the said rice grounds were brought to perfection they were so destroyed by making the Town Ditch, that to his great prejudice your petitioner entirely lost the use of them and likewise of the crop for that year which would have been good. The Kunbis that used to cultivate the same will testify what was the produce of those batty grounds and will declare it under their oaths if your Honour pleases to order the vereadores and mh\u00e1t\u00e1r\u00e1s of this place to enquire into the matter. Your petitioner most humbly begs your Honour will, out of your compassion to the petitioner and his family which consists of about twenty people, give in return for the said ground a piece of oart that is new planted situated in the Packary Valem which produces nothing to the Honourable Company who are at an annual expense as the cocoanut trees are very young and will not bear fruits for five years more. Your petitioner will by his labour and industry endeavour to make these trees produce something that may suffice to support himself and family. Your petitioner therefore hopes your Honour will be pleased to order the said vereadores and mh\u00e1t\u00e1r\u00e1s to make a valuation of the said plantation and likewise of the rent of the said rice grounds. In case the said rice grounds should be of more value than the said oart, then let them value the said rice grounds that are near the oart to make an equivalent. Similarly should the valuation be less your petitioner promises to make good the overplus. Your Honour's compliance with this request will be deemed a great favour. Therefore please to give orders to the vereadores and mh\u00e1t\u00e1r\u00e1s to this purpose.\n\nOn reading the above petition the Board at the same Consultation, the 16th January 1753, ordered the Collector to take a survey and report on the extent value and yearly produce of the said rice lands and the oart. The Collector thereupon enclosed the original order and survey of the lands ordered by the President Stephen Law in 1740. That report runs:\n\nOn the 9th September 1740 the Honourable Stephen Law President ordered the vereadores and mh\u00e1t\u00e1r\u00e1s of Bombay to make a valuation of the grounds and plantation mentioned in this petition and report the same. A week later (15th September 1740) the vereadores report: All the improvement your petitioner R\u00e1mji Parvu has made on the ground without the town wall from the Tarvary of Ap\u00e1ji N\u00e1ik to the houses where the Portuguese soldiers lived, we value at Rs. 525 reckoning the rent of the said ground at $3\\frac{1}{2}$ mud\u00e1s of batty. We also value the other ground that was annexed to the said grounds at Rs. 18\u00be amounting in all to Rs. 543\u00be. We likewise value the oart Valloury belonging to the Honourable Company situated in the jurisdiction of M\u00e1zaon in the Packary Vallem containing at present four cocoanut trees bearing fruit, six branched out, 13 not branched out, 89 pefora, 123 transplanted, 27 to be transplanted, 8 brab trees, and 56 vacant places for Rs. 235. The wheels of the said oart with their praparat\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 Apparently the Mar\u00e1thi rah\u00e1t Persian wheel and prap\u00e1 water distributors, that is the necklace of water pots and the wooden trough that carries the water into the cement gutters.\nvalued by Raghuji carpenter for Rs. 43 and the well with paving stones, gutter, and chunam valued by Kaluji bricklayer for Rs. 148, amounting in all to Rs. 426. We have also valued the batty grounds of the rent of 2 mud\u00e1s and 11 phar\u00e1s of batty that is near the said oart belonging to the Honourable Company for Rs. 307 which with the other amounts to Rs. 733. We made this valuation of the said oart on the condition we find it in at present except the difference between rice ground and oart. Your Honour please to order as your Honour shall seem meet.\n\nAfter consideration the Board resolved that the Collector be directed to order the vereadores to mark off such of the rice lands belonging to the Honourable Company situated near Manalla tank as may produce 3 mud\u00e1s 19 phar\u00e1s of rice valued at Rs. 541\u00bd being the outturn of the land taken from R\u00e1mji Parvu at the making of the Bombay ditch.\u00b9\n\nAt a Consultation, the 12th July 1757, the Board read the following representation from the native inhabitants of Bombay: That, as is well known to have often been the case in former years, the inhabitants of this island may not suffer the want of rice, they pray the Government to appoint proper warehouses for holding about 3000 or 4000 mud\u00e1s in order to supply them in the rain time when there is a great scarcity. By this means the people's wants will be relieved and the Honourable Company will not incur the charges that will arise on the said rice, and the rice agents or kacher\u00e1s will be compelled to dispose of it in petty sales for such a price as the Governor and Council shall think proper.\u00b2\n\nAt the same Consultation (the 12th July 1757) the Board read the following representation from the native inhabitants of Bombay: The salt farmers sell their salt to the merchants who carry it into shibars or large coasting vessels at Rs. 60 and Rs. 80 the r\u00e1s. By this the local consumer suffers a great deal, because the said farmer sells at one pice the adh\u00f3li which comes to about Rs. 208 the r\u00e1s. The subject not only suffers this loss, but also loses a day or two in getting the salt. When the consumer goes to get the salt, the farmer says it is not in the warehouse and when they go the next day, the assistant is not there. At length after a great deal of trouble they get supplied with salt mixed with earth. Furthermore the subject must pay the hire for carrying it to their houses, and, after getting it home, they find upon examination the quantity received to be less than that paid for. The Corunbis used formerly always to bring good salt which they carried from door to door and sold much cheaper. At the beginning of this present salt farm, the farmers began to sell their salt at one pice the adh\u00f3li. On this complaint was made to Mr. L. Sullivan then Collector who ordered them to sell it as usual. This order was continued whilst Mr. Sullivan was Collector, but now they do not show any obedience thereto. Wherefore the subject begs the said custom may again be renewed and observed.\u00b3\n\n\u00b9 Pub. Diary 26 of 1753, 36-44. \u00b2 Pub. Diary 30 of 1757, 271-272. \u00b3 Pub. Diary 30 of 1757, 271.\nAfter perusal of the above petition the Board observe: As we are thoroughly sensible that the subjects frequently experience great hardships from a sudden rise or scarcity of grain, because, notwithstanding our utmost care for obliging the kacher\u00e1s to have a proper supply always by them they neglect to provide a sufficiency when the price is moderate. Resolved that we appoint a committee in the month of September to concert the most proper measures for buying and constantly keeping a sufficient quantity of batty on our Masters' account for the relief and support of the inhabitants in general. Meanwhile that the warehouse-keeper inquire and report what warehouses may be rented for depositing the rice and how much the Honourable Company's rice warehouses and those already hired will contain.\n\nTwo weeks later at a Consultation, the 26th July 1757, the Board reperused the representation against the salt farmers delivered the 12th instant by the native inhabitants. On reference the Board observe: We find that all the particulars they complain of are not expressly provided against. We think the salt farmers have too great an indulgence in being allowed to sell salt for the most they can get, and resolve to remedy this inconvenience on renewing the lease in May next.\n\nAt a Consultation, the 2nd August 1757, the Board read the following report of batty warehouses from the warehouse-keeper dated 2nd August 1757: In compliance with an order from the Board, I am now to report the number of warehouses the Honourable Company have suited to receive batty. They are eight in all. Of these five of their own in the carpenters' yard contain mud\u00e1s 2000, one at the old M\u00e1ndvi within the walls mud\u00e1s 700, and two belonging to Ranchod K\u00e1m\u00e1ti within the walls which the Company rent at Rs. 17 a month, mud\u00e1s 1200.\n\nAfter reading the above report the Board observe: We are of opinion the above quantity of 3900 mud\u00e1s will be sufficient to lay in for supplying the inhabitants at least till we can rent or build other warehouses. As it is necessary at this juncture that all the grain upon the island should be lodged within the walls, ordered that the Bombay and M\u00e1him Custom Masters procure the most exact accounts possible of all grain within their respective districts and in what houses or with whom it is at present lodged and make their reports thereof to the Board.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 23rd August 1757, the Board read the following report of the same date from the Bombay Customs Master containing the following abstract of the report of grain within the districts of Bombay: Batty, mud\u00e1s 1601; Rice, khandis 802; D\u00e1l, khandis 280; Wheat, khandis 853; Mug, khandis 122; Gram, khandis 177; Udid, khandis 33; V\u00e1l, khandis 2; V\u00e1t\u00e1na, khandis 2; N\u00e1chni, khandis 1; and Math, khandis 21.\n\n---\n\n1 Pub.

The corresponding figures for Mahim, Sion, Suri, Warli, and the several villages within that circuit were: Batty, mudas 690; Rice, khandis 80; Nachni, mudas 8; Wheat, khandis 60; Gram, khandis 13; Dal, khandis 12.\n\nA Consultation of the 15th December 1780 records for the whole batty grounds a total outturn of 3411 mudas of which 1067 were in the district of Bombay and 2344 in Mahim. The following table gives the details:\n\n| Land          | District | Mud\u00e1s |\n|---------------|----------|-------|\n| Fazandars'    | Bombay   | 197   |\n|               | Mahim    | 300   |\n| Mazgaon       | Bombay   | 217   |\n| Mahim         | Mahim    | 814   |\n| Salt Batty, 14 res | Bombay | 360   |\n|               | Mahim    | 632   |\n| Do.           | Bombay   | 219   |\n|               | Mahim    | 250   |\n| Do.           | Bombay   | 74    |\n|               | Mahim    | 348   |\n| Total         | Bombay   | 1067  |\n|               | Mahim    | 2344  |\n| Grand Total   |          | 3411  |\n\nOn the 16th July 1745 the diary of the Court of Oyer and Terminer records: The Sheriff laying before the Bench his account current with the County, whereby it appearing that the county is in arrears, it is therefore granted that the inhabitants be assessed Rs. 2000 to pay off the debts and to defray the usual charges.\n\nIn their letter of the 25th February 1747, paragraph 59, the Court write: We do not think it reasonable the merchants should pay customs or duties on goods that are not landed, nor that they be any longer charged for the town ditch or wall as their engagements upon those heads are fully complied with.\n\nIn the same letter, paragraph 60, the Court further write: Obliging the merchants to pay their customs every month, may put some of them to difficulties, as they used to make their accounts up quarterly. You will do well to reconsider this affair, concerting the proper measures both to secure our duties and to ease the merchants, seeing to it at the same time that the Custom Master makes regular payments into our treasury, as the money comes into his hands.\n\n1 Pub.

Court's Letters Vol. 3 of 1742-1751, 141.\nIn reply the Bombay Government on the 5th November 1748 write: We shall comply with the orders for not charging customs on goods that are not landed. But we beg leave to observe that as the merchants who trade in shibars are seldom if ever owners of such shibars, they will often agree with merchants at Jambusar and other ports to the northward, more especially where your Honours have no factory for their cargoes, and by that means deprive you of the duties here which on account of affording them convoy occasionally from hence we judged they ought to pay. However your Honours' orders as above recited shall be obeyed. Further there was such great difficulty and trouble in getting the customs quarterly or even monthly that before the receipt of your orders by Orford we judged it both for the security of your duties and the ease of the merchants to order the customs to be collected as the goods were carried away, as small sums they easily pay; but when it came to any considerable amount they were always backward in payment. As long as any of us have sat at this Board the money received by the custom master has been regularly paid into your treasury.\n\nIn a letter of the 4th March 1752, paragraph 84, the Court order the levy of a special one per cent duty. They write: We accordingly order and direct that a duty of one per cent over and above all other duties be levied and paid to the Company on the value of all goods, wares, and merchandizes whatsoever (treasure excepted) imported and exported at Bombay and Surat in ships hired of the Company and in all country ships and vessels whatsoever that are entitled to our protection and wear English colours. But with this proviso that you do not levy the said duty on shibars galivats and boats that supply the island of Bombay with timber, wood, fruit, grain, cattle, or provisions of any kind from the adjacent rivers and countries.\n\nOn the 15th March 1756, Government write to the Court: Mr. Thomas Byfeld desiring our opinion whether any customs should be charged on arrack sugar and other articles imported on the Hardwicke store-ship from Batavia for His Majesty's service or on the prize goods found at Gheria, we judged customs should not be charged on the former as we understand your servants at Fort St. George have not done it, nor on the latter as they are become the property of the captors employed in His Majesty's and your Honours' service which we therefore hope will not be disapproved.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 3rd January 1758 the Board after taking into consideration the reimbursement of the charges on fortifications and other works passed the following orders: Our Masters having for some time been at a prodigious expense in increasing the fortifications and other works on this island for the security of the inhabitants in general, a contributing towards reimbursing the cost is taken into\n\n---\n\n1 Pub.

This being judged highly reasonable, resolved that the Bombay and Mahim Customs Masters levy an additional duty of one per cent on the imports and exports, and that the Collector of the rents and revenues likewise collect a tax on the produce of all the landed estates belonging to the inhabitants of this island at the rate of two shillings to the pound on the same account, to take place from the first instant and to be continued till further orders.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 21st February 1758 the Board read a representation from the fazandars of Bombay and Mahim making several idle objections to the complying with a notification issued under the 31st ultimo, requiring them to render the Collector an account of the annual produce of their lands, in order for his levying the tax laid on them, towards reimbursing our Honourable Masters the great expense that will be incurred by completing the intended additional fortifications of this island, conformable to our Resolution of the 3rd ultimo. Ordered therefore that the Collector signify to them if they do not show due obedience thereto, that we shall put a valuation on them.\n\nOn the 20th January 1759 the Collector reports: In obedience to your Honour's commands of the 3rd January 1758 for collecting a tax of ten per cent on all landed estates belonging to the inhabitants of this island, notice was immediately given for delivering into the Collector's office a particular account and exact estimate thereof. A few months afterwards the accounts Nos. 1 and 2 were received but as on inquiry the estates therein mentioned appeared to me to be considerably undervalued I directed the vereadores and some of the principal fazandars to inspect and consider these accounts carefully and to deliver me their opinions thereon which they accordingly did on the 19th and 22nd ultimo as per reports Nos. 3 and 4. Your Honour will please to observe the net amount of these estates is Rs. 77,098-1-53 instead of Rs. 58,263-1-40. On the former of these sums I propose with your Honour's approbation to collect the tax you were pleased to direct.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 6th February 1759 the Board resolved that the tax of ten per cent laid on the 3rd January 1758 be collected on all landed estates belonging to the inhabitants of this island according to the vereadores' reports Nos. 3 and 4, abstract of which follows this Consultation amounting to Rs. 77,098-1-53. And that the Collector require such persons as have not yet delivered a calculate of their lands to do it by a certain limited time and levy a suitable fine in case of their non-compliance by that term. Also observing that Ramset Gumbaset and some other substantial people pretend that the charges on their estates exceed the profits, we would have the Collector call on them to assign the reasons of it. The following is an abstract of the annual produce of the landed estates belonging to the inhabitants at Bombay and Mahim, 1759:\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 31 of 1758, 3.\n2 Pub.

They write: It is extremely pleasing to us that you have shewn such true attention to our interest in laying additional duties and taxes on the inhabitants, thereby relieving us in some degree of the burthen we cheerfully bear to put the island in a state of security. We applaud your conduct, and have pointed out this commendable example to our Presidency at Calcutta, who have never once considered the equitable right we have to such assistance.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 7th October 1760, the Board order: The Collector reports that in the vereadores' calculate of the tax laid on landed estates there appear some dwelling houses and oarts appropriated to charitable uses. That on petition of the proprietors of the said houses for relief setting forth that no others paid the tax on their dwelling houses, the vereadores were ordered by the Collector to re-examine the same. They reported that the said houses and oarts were included by mistake and that no tax ought to be levied on them according to the tenour of our orders of the 3rd January 1758. The same is now laid before us. The Collector is ordered not to charge the tax on the houses and oarts referred to.\n\nRegarding provision against evading the customs duties on the 19th February 1766 Government write to the Court: On the 16th July (1765) the Bombay customs master delivered us a letter setting forth a great loss which your Honours sustained by merchants purchasing cotton at Jambusar instead of Surat and afterwards landing it here for exportation so that they evaded paying the duties at Surat. In order to prevent the same we have determined that all goods coming from the northward, notwithstanding they may be landed for exportation, shall pay the usual duties unless they can produce a certificate of their having paid them at Surat and the duty on cotton to be levied agreeable to its valuation there. The custom master likewise complained of the southern traders proceeding directly to the northern ports without landing any part of their cargo here by which means they pay no customs although they enjoy the benefit of convoy and every other advantage in common with the merchants trading under your protection. In order effectually to prevent this we ordered him to oblige all merchants not under your protection bound from the\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Dep. Court's Letters Vol. 5 of 1757-1761, 188.\n2 Pub.

On this cargo the Collector is ordered to levy the duties valuing the same ten per cent under the market price. He is likewise ordered to observe the same rule with respect to all merchants under your protection who may proceed to the northward without landing their goods at Surat. But such as declare their intention of proceeding to Surat and landing their goods there, are exempted from this rule. All this we hope your Honours will approve and likewise our having made it a standing rule to levy customs on all goods imported and remaining unsold the 31st July every year at the market price the respective goods may then bear.\n\nIn reply on the 4th April 1767, paragraph 86, the Court write: The new regulations you made the 16th of July which appear on your Consultations seem calculated for our advantage in increasing the customs and we think cannot be deemed a hardship on the merchants who ought not to have the protection of convoys without our being benefited by it.\n\nTouching these regulations on the 18th April 1768 Government further intimate to the Court: In order as much as possible to make the regulations approved by your Honours in the 86th para of your commands of the 4th April last answer the proposed end of preventing your being deprived of customs on goods belonging to merchants trading under your protection, we have ordered them constantly to forward to Surat lists of all goods sent thither which do not pay customs here that the Chief and Council may recover the same there. And we directed them in the like manner to transmit us an account of any goods which come here under convoy from the bar whether the vessels on which they are laden are consigned here or not and have not been entered or paid customs at our Latty (that is custom house). This they have promised to comply with and have issued such orders in consequence as we flatter ourselves will more effectually prevent any goods whatever passing without paying customs either at Surat or this place.\n\nOn the 3rd December 1770 Bombay writes to the Court: Having the greatest reason to believe notwithstanding the regulations of the 28th August 1765 and 19th February 1768 that your Honours are considerably defrauded in your customs by goods from the northward ports not paying customs at Surat under pretence of their being intended for Bombay, we, in order to prevent the same in future, gave the Chief and Council of Surat orders to require the owners of all goods trading under your protection to render a true and faithful account to the Surat Latty Master of all such goods as were brought from the northern ports to the Surat bar and designed for this place or any port to the southward of Bombay. On all such goods except grain oil and ghi they were directed to collect full duties in Surat and\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Dep. Letters to the Court Vol. 13 of 1766, 86-87.\n2 Pub. Dep. Letters to the Court Vol. 7 of 1765-1768, 259.\n3 Pub. Dep. Letters to the Court Vol. 15 of 1768, 33.\nto grant the proprietors certificates thereof and to oblige them to conform to this regulation. We further ordered that all goods not so entered should be confiscated and strictly ordered the commanders of the cruisers, on pain of forfeiting the service, not to take any boats under convoy unless they produced a clearance signed by the Latty Master at Surat. In consequence of these resolutions we on the 28th September received a petition from the merchants trading to the northward setting forth the great hardship they were thereby subjected to and earnestly requesting we would remove the same. It was then observed that the merchants exaggerated in their petition by asserting they were obliged to land their goods at Surat which is by no means the case. Notwithstanding this, as the principal articles from the northward were cotton and piece-goods and the others grain oil and other necessaries the importation of which last should rather be encouraged here, we determined that the rule requiring a Surat customs certificate should extend only to boats laden with cotton and piece-goods and gave orders that the proprietors should be detained as little time as possible for their certificates. Even this concession did not satisfy the merchants. On the 22nd ultimo the custom master addressed us a letter enclosing another petition from the merchants repeating their complaints and earnestly entreating the regulation might be abolished. To this we thought it proper to agree. At the same time that your revenue might not suffer we ordered a duty of six per cent to be collected on all such goods from the northward as could not produce a certificate of their having paid full duties at Surat and the President's consulage of two per cent to be deducted therefrom. Upon this occasion we took into consideration whether it would not be a means of increasing the customs both here and at Surat that instead of collecting a consulage of two per cent only at Surat, one of one per cent should be established at both places, and the customs here made equal to those at Surat, namely six per cent of which five per cent to go to your Honours and one per cent to the Governor for the time being. By this means though your Honours will receive a half per cent less at this place than you do at present you will receive one per cent more at Surat. And being of opinion this regulation would not only increase your custom revenue but the general trade of the port and likewise satisfy the merchants, and the President, for these reasons and because the interest of his Employers and that of his own would in future be perfectly reciprocal which they were not before, acquiescing as far as it affected his emolument of consulage we agreed thereto and ordered it to be carried into execution until your pleasure would be signified to us regarding it. We therefore request to be favoured therewith and as a compensation to the merchants for the increase here, no duties are to be collected at one place that can produce certificates of their having paid customs at the other.\n\nIn reply, on the 12th June 1771 (paragraphs 41-42) the Court write: In respect to the alteration you made in the customs usually collected at Surat and Bombay we shall here observe that it by no means carries\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Dep. Letters to the Court Vol. 17 of 1770, 93-95.\nwith it that appearance of advantage which might justify the abolishing a mode which had continued for a great number of years and seemed thereby to acquire the right of prescription; for though this innovation may be calculated for the benefit of the Presidency we cannot but believe it will be proportionably detrimental to the revenue at Surat. We shall enter more fully on this subject when by the receipt of your Consultations we shall be enabled to investigate the causes of so material a change in our established customs. In the meantime we cannot avoid declaring that we are not only far from being convinced of the propriety of the measure itself but highly displeased at your having determined thereon without waiting for our decision in a point of this nature, and we must further observe that your referring to us a measure already adopted by you has more the appearance of a consciousness of the impropriety of your conduct than a deference to our authority.\n\nAt a Consultation the 8th January 1771 the Bombay Custom Master lays before the Board the account customs collected for the month of July together with the abstract of customs collected from the 1st August 1769 to the 31st July 1770. The Custom Master acquaints the Board these accounts would have been given in much sooner had he been able to collect the amount. Even now the sum of Rs. 8937-2-27 is still outstanding from two merchants lately failed, whose effects are now under attachment. After consideration it is resolved, in order most effectually to obviate the like delay in future, that both custom masters be peremptorily ordered to collect the full amount of customs which may be due once every three months from all Europeans as well as country merchants without distinction, and on no account to permit of longer time. Should any one fail to comply the Custom Master is to stop any goods such person may afterwards import, be him whosoever, until the amount he may owe is duly discharged.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 23rd April 1771 the Board took into consideration certain abuses in collecting the customs. They received the following letter from Mr. William Shaw: As soon as I had the honour to be appointed Custom Master, I made it my study narrowly to inquire into the cause of the late decrease in that branch of the Honourable Company\u2019s revenues. Understanding from the late Custom Master and others that the decrease in a great measure proceeded from an illicit practice of running goods from the vessels in the harbour to Thana and other adjacent ports, I proposed to the Board that a certain number of boats should be constantly employed to cruise within the harbour and among the shipping to prevent such practice. This was accordingly done and will, I hope, be productive of all the good effects intended. It is universally reported, and there is the greatest cause to believe that many valuable effects pass the Custom House under the denomination of escritories and trunks of wearing apparel and other necessaries. I propose that in future every thing of this kind without distinction be examined at the Custom House and\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Dep. Court's Letters Vol. 8 of 1769-1771, 297-298.\n2 Pub. Diary 57 of 1771, 26.\nthat a second assistant be nominated to attend at the New Bandar for this and other good purposes, and that proper inspectors of some reputation be also appointed under the custom master with some fees and allowances to encourage them to be very careful in the discharge of their duties. If the Board thinks proper likewise to direct that every vessel coming into port, should, as in Europe, be obliged immediately on arrival to give in a just and particular account or manifest of their cargoes to the Custom House under pain of confiscation it might have a very salutary and happy effect. On this the Board observe:\n\nWith respect to the first part of this letter the Board remark that employing guard boats in the manner Mr. Shaw mentions in his letter had frequently been in agitation and was one of the points recommended by the late President the Honourable Thomas Hodges (1767-1771) to the consideration of the rest of the members at the time the late President could not attend through indisposition. It was in consequence of that recommendation and not on Mr. Shaw\u2019s proposal that the same was ordered to be carried into execution. As the other points in Mr. Shaw\u2019s letter appear to us calculated for the benefit of that branch of our Employers\u2019 revenues, it is agreed they be carried into execution.\n\nAnd as the business of that office will be thereby increased, Mr. James Beck is appointed Second Assistant to the Custom Master, and the inspectors he recommends he must endeavour to procure. Three days later, 26th April 1771, the Diary records: A publication was affixed by beat of drum at the usual places to give notice of the regulations established in our last Consultation for collecting the customs.\n\nIn a letter of the 1st April 1772, paragraph 49, the Court resume: In a general letter dated 12th June 1771 we intimated our displeasure at the alteration you had made in the mode of collecting customs at Surat and Bombay. We are now more fully convinced of the impropriety of that innovation and well persuaded that it could not possibly operate to the advantage of the Company; that it must occasion much needless trouble to the merchants; and that it was calculated solely for the emolument of the Governor. We therefore direct that the Governor do on no account take one per cent consulage on goods imported at Bombay, but that such consulage be restricted to Surat where we permit him to receive two per cent as usual.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 30th June 1772 the Board received the following humble petition of the Gentus Muhammadans and P\u00e1rsis of Bombay: That your Honour\u2019s petitioners with the greatest respect and submission take the liberty to represent to your Honour that they are already paying several duties, that is to say, an additional and fortifying duty on all goods, and a tax of one per cent on the produce of all landed estates. Besides these cesses they are obliged to pay scavenger\u2019s fees and the charges of repairing the roads. Notwithstanding this they are ordered to give big\u00e1ris to clean the town ditch. This is very hard upon your petitioners. No big\u00e1ris are procurable except at an\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 57 of 1771, 337-338.\n2 Pub. Diary 57 of 1771, 332, 333.\n3 Pub.

Court\u2019s Letters Vol. 9 of 1772-1777, 37.\nextraordinary rate on account of several houses being pulled down by order of this Honourable Government and the owners rebuilding them. As your petitioners have met with many losses and inconveniences on account of several houses and cocoanut trees being pulled down as above said and other unforeseen accidents, they are rendered incapable to bear the expense of the big\u00e1ris to clean the town ditch. Your petitioners take the liberty further to represent to your Honour that when they were ordered in Governor Crommelin\u2019s time (1760-1767) to give some big\u00e1ris to clean the ditch they made him their request, and he was thereupon pleased to excuse them from that expense. Ever since that time they were never troubled with cleaning the ditch nor indeed in Governor Hodges\u2019 time. On the whole your petitioners most humbly pray that your Honour will be pleased to take the promises as well as their hard case into your serious consideration in order to make them free from the abovementioned expenses. After consideration the Board resolve that as we now find the method of caste big\u00e1ris will be attended with some delay, and as it is necessary on account of the advanced season that the ditch should be cleaned with all expedition, the land paymaster is directed to engage a sufficient number of persons to clean the ditch. He must keep a distinct account of the charge in order that it may be made good by an assessment on each caste excepting those merchants who have paid Rs. 100 annually by the Custom House books for customs as they therein pay one per cent towards the fortifications and also such persons who for any particular reason have been usually excepted.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 13th October 1772, the Board having at several previous meetings had under consideration the letter from the Bombay custom master with the regulations he proposed for the future collection of the Honourable Company\u2019s customs, the same is now again resumed when the letter and regulations as entered under the 19th of August are read and being maturely and deliberately discussed and considered, are unanimously approved, and ordered that they be in full force from the first of the next month. As we are of opinion it would be hard upon the fair trader to be obliged, as proposed, to pay the amount of his customs within fifteen days from the importation of his goods, resolved that three months\u2019 credit be allowed to all merchants whether black or white. These three months are to begin from the day the vessel entered the port. At the same time the bills are to be made out agreeable to the book of rates immediately on the last goods being landed, which bills must be then accepted by the importer payable at the above mentioned period. The custom master must constantly retain in the warehouses under his charge a sufficient quantity of goods to answer the full amount of the customs on each respective person\u2019s importation, be that person whomsoever he may be. The remainder is then to be permitted to pass after being carefully inspected, except those goods which are entered for exportation which are to be deposited in warehouses under his charge as heretofore directed.\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 61 of 1772, S31-S32.\n2 Pub. Diary 61 of 1772, 618.\n3 For these Regulations see Pub.

In this book he is also to insert the rates of hamalage waterage and wharfage together with the distribution of such seizures as may be made in consequence of these regulations that the same may be established on a proper footing. Whosoever may let their goods remain in the Custom House longer than one month must be charged with warehouse rent after the usual rate of the place by the custom master. But this is not to extend to such goods as are retained as security for the payment of the dues. The warehouse-keeper must put under the custom master's charge such of the Bandar warehouses as may be necessary for the purposes for which they are intended. The Secretary must issue a proclamation apprising all persons that sundry new regulations are established for the better collection of the customs in future, and that the particulars may be seen at the Bombay custom master's office.\n\nA Consultation of the 6th April 1773 records: From the present instance and from the very frequent and heavy complaints, but more especially from the very large sums of money amassed by the owners and people belonging to the boats that load and unload the ships in this harbour, we are fully convinced it is their constant practice to take every opportunity in their power of plundering goods while in the boats. A severe example ought in our opinion to be made as they are evidently guilty by their offering the sum of Rs. 4000 to compromise the present business. It is therefore agreed, as we have not proof capitally to convict any of them, that a fine of Rs. 20,000 be levied upon them, which, though large, they are very well able to pay. Out of this the amount of the coffee stolen must be made good to the owners of the Shrewsbury, and the remainder appropriated to the Honourable Company. It is also further resolved in hopes of its being a means of preventing such like bad consequences in future that no boats shall be permitted to ply in the harbour for the purpose of loading or unloading ships but such as are regularly numbered and registered in the custom master's office, and whose owners have given ample security to make good any deficiency that may happen in goods while on board their boats.\n\nAt a Consultation of 22nd January 1777 the Board order that no customs are in future to be collected upon horses or mules imported here for the service of the inhabitants.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 1st July 1746 the Board read a letter from the Collector of the revenues representing the necessity of having more wells in the Honourable Company's oarts with the advantages that will accrue thereby. The expense of digging and making these wells is calculated at about Rs. 970-3-10. Agreed that the said letter and calculate be entered hereafter but that consideration thereof be deferred till a proper season offers for setting about the work.\n\n---\n\n1 Pub.

I am now to acquaint you that the same appears properly repaired as agreed to by the oart farmers in March 1744. The only exception is that five of the wells want plastering at the top which the early rain and want of bricklayers prevented them from finishing, but they promised duly to perform the same early the ensuing season. By the 4th and 17th articles of the oart farmer's lease it is agreed that the Honourable Company shall be at the expense of digging and making new wells if wanted and of repairing all wells broken or destroyed by the falling down of trees or by other accidents. Wherefore they request your Honour will give the necessary orders; which, if you are pleased to agree to, the oarts will then be in so good repair as to want no additional expense for many years. In my humble opinion the profits will at the end of the lease sufficiently repay and answer the expense as the work already done fully demonstrates. The trees have received great benefit by the work, and, by this addition, double the number of trees may be planted in some of the oarts that has hitherto been practicable for want of water. The wells have been so shallow as not to give a supply even to trees now bearing fruit longer than January, whereas all the trees ought to be watered till the month of May.\u00b2\n\nIn a letter of the 13th October 1747 the Collector Mr. Byfeld reports: In my address dated the 24th June 1746, I represented to your Honour the necessity for making an addition of some stone-gutters and wells in\n\n\u00b9 Pub. Diary 19 of 1746, 223.\n\u00b2 Pub. Diary 19 of 1746, 214-217. The details of this estimate are: (1) Oart For-taliza Antq Gomes damaged by bad weather, namely For Wells: Chunam 17 khandis Rs. 21-1-0; ten stone-cutters Rs. 2-1-0; twenty-five bricklayers Rs. 6-1-0; two pieces teak Rs. 13-0-0; bigaris Rs. 17-0-0; baskets Rs. 4-0-0; total Rs. 63-3-0. (2) Oart Galwady Halya: Timber two pieces for stanchions Rs. 8-0-0; chunam bricklayers and bigaris Rs. 5-2-0; total Rs. 13-2-0. (3) Oart Colcad Jemmatra: Two pieces timber for stanchions Rs. 8-0-0; chunam bricklayers and bigaris Rs. 17-2-0; total Rs. 25-2-0. (4) Oart Pararvadi: Books stones 350 with stone-cutters' work Rs. 63-0-0; bigaris digging the well Rs. 25-0-0; teak timber for a frame Rs. 15-0-0; basket and coir Rs. 7-0-0; chunam for plastering with bricklayers' pay Rs. 15-0-0; total Rs. 125-0-0. (5) Oart Varao: To sink the well and make an addition of one new wheel for want of water to supply the trees, chunam twenty-five khandis with carriage Rs. 43-0-0; teak timber for a frame Rs. 20-0-0; sand stone and carriage Rs. 25-0-0; bricklayers and bigaris Rs. 21-0-0; bigaris, digging the well, with baskets, Rs. 16-0-0; total Rs. 125-0-0. That is the total for Wells comes to Rs. 352-3-0. Similar estimate for Stone Gutters amounted to Rs. 618-0-10, Total Rs. 970-3-10, Pub. Diary 19 of 1746, 215-216.\nthe oarts. These suggestions meeting with your approbation the sum of Rs. 970-3-10 was advanced the farmers for carrying on and completing the same by the last day of July. Notwithstanding I have frequently pressed the farmers to comply with this agreement still to this day they have made little progress. This they say is owing to the want of stone-cutters who were all employed last season at the Pier head as they are this year in cutting paving stones for the subordinate factories.\n\nA Consultation of the 20th March 1752 records: The lease of the Honourable Company's oarts and waste ground round the town wall expiring the 30th April next, directed the Secretary to affix the usual notifications that these lands will be put up at outcry the 17th of April and rented to the highest bidder. As we are persuaded that the letting these lands in small parcels will be a means of increasing their income, and will be attended with the advantage of their being better cultivated and taken care of when in the hands of many than in the possession of a few, it is resolved they be put up to auction in small lots.\n\nAgreeable to the above Resolution the Board met to let out to farm the Honourable Company's oarts and waste ground round the Town Ditch. The following conditions were explained to and approved by the merchants: First that the farmers, their heirs or executors, shall make full and just payments into the Honourable Company's treasury every six months, until the expiration of the farm at the end of seven years. If the farmer, his heirs or executors, during the said term of seven years shall make default in the payments or in other conditions herein contained, the said President and Council shall be at full liberty to take the said oarts from the said farmer, his heirs or executors, and lease them to such others as they shall think proper. And if any loss arises thereto, the farmer, his heirs or executors, shall be answerable, and obliged to make the loss good. Second, if during the said term of seven years by storm or other unforeseen accidents not proceeding from the neglect of the farmer, any damage shall accrue to the trees such allowance shall be made to the said farmer as the said President and Council shall think reasonable. Third that out of the trees which shall happen to be blown down, a sufficient number shall be allowed the farmer for repairing the wheels and waterways, and the remainder shall be taken for the use of the Company. Fourth that the said President and Council will repair and put into good order all the wheels and waterways belonging to the Honourable Company's oarts, and in case any new wells are by them and the farmer judged necessary, the said President and Council are to be at the expense of digging and making the same. Fifth if the farmer shall have just reason to suspect that the cocoanuts have been stolen, or are concealed, on his making application proper persons will be appointed to search for the same. If any person or persons are convicted of having bought or received stolen cocoanuts, they shall be\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 20 of 1747, 373.\n2 Pub. Diary 25 of 1752, 98-99.\npunished according to law. Sixth that no persons shall resist injure or impede the farmer or his servants, in what regards the occupying the said farm. Any one so offending shall be duly punished. Seventh that the Honourable Company's Collector of the revenues, and all other persons as the President and Council may appoint, shall be aiding and assisting to the said farmer in recovering his debts contracted on account of the farm, and in improving and manuring the said oarts. Eighth it being apparent that the taking kaj\u00e1ns from the renter for the Company is a general grievance, the farmers are at liberty to sell the leaves to whom and where they please. Ninth the overseer of the Honourable Company's oarts, or any others appointed by the President and Council, are at all times to be admitted to view and inspect the oarts and wells, with everything thereunto belonging. If it shall be found the farmer has not complied with the terms of his agreement, a report shall be made to the President and Council, that they may issue proper orders concerning the same. Tenth that kut and buckshaw that is fish manure shall not be used for manuring the trees. Pinack (that is pinaca or oil-cake) is permitted and if pinack is not procurable the farmer is at liberty to make use of any other manure except kut and buckshaw. When any manure, not above forbid, is brought to this island for sale, one-half shall, if requested by the farmer, be appropriated for the use of the oarts, the farmer paying the market price for the same. Ten trees more or less to be let to the Bhand\u00e1ris out of every hundred for drawing toddy. This is to commence at the expiry of their contract, but to continue on the present footing till that time. Eleventh that all persons who unhusk cocoanuts shall be obliged to serve the farmer at the same rates they have hitherto served the Honourable Company. In like manner also such persons as are proper and necessary for conducting and managing the said oarts, and for cultivating and improving the trees, shall serve the said farmer in the same manner as they have been accustomed to serve the Honourable Company, when the oarts were kept in their hands. Twelfth that the farmer shall receive to his own use ground rent for all such houses as are or shall be erected within the Company's oarts at M\u00e1him during the term of the farm, at the same rates that the Company has hitherto received. If it shall appear necessary to the said farmer to remove any of the houses already built, he shall first obtain the consent of the Collector or other person appointed by the President and Council. Thirteenth that the Honourable Company are at full liberty to cut down for their own use all trees, from which the farmer receives no benefit, the farmer being first acquainted thereof. Fourteenth this island not producing sufficient of any kind of manure, salt excepted, for the use of the oarts, manure must be imported from other parts. In case the importation of manure be prevented by war, or other unforeseen accident, the farmer is not subject or liable to pay any consideration for the damage the said oarts may sustain for want of manure. On the contrary the farmer shall have such allowance made him as the President and Council shall think just. Fifteenth if any of the wells or wheels be broken or destroyed by the falling of trees or other accidents, not occasioned by the neglect of the farmer\nthen the Company will and shall at their own expense make new ones in lieu thereof. But the farmer shall, at his own charge, repair all wells and wheels and deliver them in good order at the expiration of the farm. Sixteenth the farmer shall and will at his own expense during the term of this lease plant young trees in lieu of all such as shall be blown down, and in all vacant places in the said oarts, and shall water and manure them. In consideration whereof at the expiration of his farm he shall receive in money one half of their value. And for the security of the due and punctual performance of all the conditions above contained, on the part of the farmer the said farmer has by an instrument or bond under his hand and seal bearing date assigned and made over his whole estate real and personal to be answerable and liable for any default or breach of what is above stipulated.

Also a valuation of sundry useless trees (as he calls them) which if not cut down will prevent the growth of the young cocoanut trees. That the muk\u0101dam of the arrack farmers, having complained of a grievance they laboured under from the oart farmers at M\u0101him, and of S\u0101mji Parvu, belonging to the Collector's office, for being instrumental in reducing the number of willing trees from four to three for a rupee, he referred us for their reply to a letter he had received from the oart farmers, observing only that the offers they made, were rejected by the Bhand\u0101ris. He likewise encloses the depositions of two Bhand\u0101ris against S\u0101mji Parvu and his defence. On these papers the following orders are passed: That the farmers of the oarts at M\u0101him be allowed to repair them according to the vereadores' calculate. That the Collector enquire whether tapping the trees he mentions will not remedy the evil complained of without cutting them down. That S\u0101mji Parvu be suitably reprimanded by the Collector, and, as we are satisfied that any of the Parvus belonging to the Collector's office being concerned in any of the Company's farms (as there is reason to think S\u0101mji is) must be prejudicial to our Honourable Masters' interests, resolved that the same be forbid in future and all such Parvus be obliged to relinquish either their employ or their concern in any of the said farms.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 10th August 1762 the Board proceeded to the Bandar and let out the oart Dalowdy to Bhiku K\u0101m\u0101ti and B\u0101b\u0101ji K\u0101m\u0101ti for the remainder of the lease at Rs. 250 a year, being Rs. 21 a year less than what it formerly let for.\n\nThe 10th May 1768, being the day appointed for farming out the Honourable Company's oarts at Bombay and M\u0101him, the Board repaired below stairs and proposed renting them for five years. But the merchants and others assembled to bid for them set forth that they would be let out to greater advantage if the term of the respective leases was increased to seven years. This was accordingly agreed and they were let out on the same conditions as when last farmed in 1759, with this additional clause, in consequence of a representation from the Bhand\u0101ris, that the farmers shall permit the Bhand\u0101ris to draw three of the best trees at M\u0101him and 2\u00bd at Bombay for a rupee and so in proportion for those of an inferior kind.\n\nThree days later at a Consultation of the 13th May 1768 the Board observe: We cannot but express our satisfaction at this branch of our\n\n---\n\n1 Pub.

We find that upon the whole the oarts have been let out for Rs. 21,615 a year, which is Rs. 6333 more than what they were last farmed for though the present term is for two years less.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 21st January 1774 the Collector lays before the Board a petition from the renters of the Honourable Company's oarts at Mahim, representing that they are material sufferers annually by holding those farms owing as well to the want of a sufficient quantity of rain for some years past, as to the low price which cocoanuts have for some time borne. Therefore requesting an abatement in their rent. The Board remark: As we are satisfied that cocoanuts bear a low price to what they used to do owing to the large plantations of those trees about Bassein and other adjoining places on the continent, ordered that the Collector enquire into the merits of this petition and report the same to us. If it shall appear requisite to make any allowance that he state what abatement may be reasonable.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 18th February 1774, the Board ordered that the Collector prepare and deliver in an accurate list of the Honourable Company's oarts villages and batty grounds specifying the annual rent of each. Accordingly on the 25th February the Collector lays before the Board a list of the Honourable Company's oarts villages and batty grounds. The Board record: This is persused and after consideration of the very great distress we are in for money and to avoid paying a heavy interest, it is resolved, in case we do not shortly receive a considerable supply from Bengal, that these oarts be sold at public outcry, as landed property at this time in general bears a good price.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 8th February 1774 the Board read the following petition from the fazandars of Bombay: That your Honour's petitioners with all due respect and submission beg leave to represent to your Honour that they suffer much prejudice by the new tax levied on and upon them in the year 1758 by the then Governor the Honourable Richard Bourchier Esq. Your petitioners did then represent to him not only their poverty, but also the following well established reasons for not increasing the tax: (1) That the petitioners are not obliged to pay more pension than what they paid to the Crown of Portugal. (2) That your Honourable Government undertook they will not levy upon your petitioners any other new pension as will appear by the 13th paragraph of the marriage contract celebrated in the year 1665 (1661?) between the two sacred Majesties of England and Portugal on the delivery of this island. But as the said Governor signified to your petitioners the urgent necessity of money for maintaining the war with the French, and that when the said war should be over the petitioners should be released from the said tax, they, as loyal subjects to his Britannic Majesty under the care of the Honourable Company, notwithstanding\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 50 of 1768, 299. For details (by oart and purchaser) see pages 288, 297 and 298 of the same Volume.\n2 Pub. Diary 65 of 1774, 43.\n3 Pub. Diary 65 of 1774, 92.\n4 Pub. Diary 65 of 1774, 115.\nthe ancient privileges and exemptions which these petitioners for many years enjoyed, readily submitted to the said new tax depending entirely upon the assurances of the said Governor that the same would be relinquished at the end of the war aforesaid. At last peace and tranquillity have by God's grace happily been concluded between the two Crowns of England and France long ago. Yet your petitioners are compelled to pay the said tax which they have done to this present time. Now they verily declare to your Honour, they are not able to sustain the same for the manifest calamity of time which yearly grows on worse, because the trifle revenues are not sufficient to maintain them. They therefore became indebted and at last they are obliged to sell their properties as is observed by the continual sale of their carts. These petitioners further represent to your Honour that the want of rain for some years has caused the carts to give much less cocoanuts than before. At the same time the price of cocoanuts is abated, from upwards of Rs. 40 the thousand to Rs. 20. This fall in prices is due to the planting of many trees at S\u00e1lsette and Col\u00e1ba. Cocoanut dealers prefer making their purchases at those places, because they not only make their purchases cheaper, but have only duties of three per cent for exporting. These circumstances, may it please your Honour, have greatly abated the vend of this commodity here as the merchants of Bhiwndi, who formerly carried away upwards of ten lakhs of cocoanuts from this island, for some years past carry none from hence. This decline has so lessened your petitioners' revenues that they can scarce defray the expenses of their carts and pay the pension and tax. For the above reasons these petitioners most humbly entreat your Honour will be pleased to bring into remembrance the articles of agreement entered into between the subjects of this island and your Honourable Board in the year 1672 in the 7th paragraph wherein the Honourable Governor and Council promise to make a reasonable abatement in the pension in case of calamity at any time. Therefore your Honour's petitioners having as loyal subjects to this Honourable Government the honour of enjoying the privileges granted unto them and to live under their protection they most humbly pray your Honour to make such deduction as shall seem most meet and your petitioners most humbly as in duty bound shall ever pray.\n\nAfter reading the above petition the Board observe: The fazand\u00e1s or owners of the landed estates on this island present to the Board a petition requesting for the reasons therein set forth that a tax levied on them since the year 1758 may be abolished. Upon this reference is had to the records respecting this tax and the opinion of our Employers upon it as well as to the articles of agreement with the inhabitants in the year 1672 mentioned in the said letter. As it appears that the Honourable Court highly approved of the measure adopted by levying\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 65 of 1774, 64-66. The tax referred to in the text was ordered on the 3rd January 1758 of one per cent to be levied on all exports and imports and of two shillings in the pound on the produce of all the landed estates belonging to the inhabitants of this island to assist in defraying the expenses of the new fortifications.\nthis tax, it is agreed that this matter be fully explained in our general address and the Court's determination thereon desired.\\footnote{Pub. Diary 65 of 1774, 60.}\n\nWhile intimating the above to the Court the Bombay Government in their letter of 13th April 1774 add: This tax has annually amounted near Rs. 8000 exclusive of which it is necessary your Honours should be informed that the landholders have annually paid a tax for this great number of years past on the value of their estates under the name of pension which amounts to rather more than the tax of which they now complain.\\footnote{Pub. Dep. Letters to the Court Vol. 21 of 1774, 55.} In reply the Court, in a letter dated the 12th April 1775, write: As our fortifications at Bombay are far from being completed we cannot consent to relinquish the tax laid upon landed estates in 1758 which was designed as an aid to the Company in the erecting of those fortifications.\\footnote{Pub. Dep. Court's Letters Vol. 9 of 1772-1777, 227.}\n\nAt a Consultation of the 13th April 1774 the Board read a petition from the fazandars or owners of the landed estates on the island. Upon consideration of this petition it is observed that the tax of which they complain was levied in the year 1758, at the rate of two shillings in the pound upon the produce. It appears that since that time the said sum has been annually paid for each oart upon the supposition that the produce was nearly the same. If what the petitioners represent be true, not only that the produce is considerably less than it was formerly, but that the value thereof is also greatly diminished, it seems equitable that a proportional reduction should be made in the tax. In order to ascertain the justness of this representation,\\footnote{Pub. Diary 65 of 1774, 308.} the Collector is ordered to appoint proper persons for making a fresh examination into the produce of the oarts at Bombay and Mahim and to report to us whether they really produce less than formerly and in what proportion.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 18th October 1774 the Board read the following petition from the farmers of the Honourable Company's oarts at Mahim: The farmers of the oarts of the Honourable Company situated at Mahim, have represented to the Collector their great prejudices, and the impossibility of paying the yearly farm to the Honourable Company for the reason already signified to the said Collector. In consequence the said Collector ordered the vereadores mh\u00e1t\u00e1ras and inspectors, with four others appointed by the said Collector, to examine the said oarts and to report the same to him. These informants, the farmers of the said oarts, being in hopes of obtaining some redress, are now expressly compelled to pay the farm, without any attention to the prejudice which they have sustained and still sustain, owing to the bad season of rains for these four years together, in such a manner that most of the oarts remained without watering, and likewise on account of the general fall in the price of cocoanuts. Notwithstanding these circumstances, for fear of losing time the said farmers were\nobliged to make several other charges, such as of putting pinack (that is pinaca or oil-cake) and cowdung to the cocoanut trees and of transplanting young trees. To effect this they were obliged to run in debt, and all in hopes of obtaining some redress from your Honour who, your informants hope, will undoubtedly keep pitiful eyes on them, and will not permit that they should be ruined having reasons so clear and just as they have hereunto expressed. These informants most humbly beg your Honour will be pleased to take the premises of this information into your serious consideration and grant them a reasonable deduction, attending the great prejudice they have suffered from the 11th May 1773 to the 11th May last, and likewise in the present year which is still greater so that they find themselves totally ruined. Should your Honour judge that the deduction thus alleged is unjust or unreasonable, in such case your Honour's informants are ready and shall very willingly deliver unto the Honourable Company the farm of their oarts, desiring only a deduction for the year abovementioned. For this present year they are willing to render a proper account of the produce of the said oarts and of the amount laid out on the benefit of the said oarts in this present rain. Above all they most humbly and submissively leave the whole upon your Honour and beg your Honour to take the premises of this information into consideration and think of the great prejudice occasioned by time and other unforeseen accidents by which they are totally ruined and distressed. Flattering themselves that your Honour will admit their allegation to be just, and having compassion on them will order a reasonable deduction to be made, as otherwise they shall be ruined and without the least remedy of life.\n\nAfter reading the above petition the Board pass the following order: The farmers of the Honourable Company's oarts at M\u00e4him, whose leases expend on the 11th of May next, have frequently petitioned to be allowed an abatement in the rent, urging that, on the advanced terms on which they now hold and have held the farms for some years past, they are considerable sufferers by the same. They now present another petition to the same purport. Upon this the Collector is asked his opinion in respect to their assertion, who acquaints the Board that the last time the farms were leased out, they went considerably higher than they had ever done before and that he believes their assertions are true in respect to their losses, as they all seem very poor insomuch that it is with great difficulty he recovers the rent due from them. Even then it is generally paid a considerable time after it becomes due, owing in great measure as he observes (and which indeed we all know to be the case) to the price of cocoanuts being very considerably fallen of late years. As it clearly appeared that the petitioners' case requires some consideration, it is agreed to make them an abatement of one-quarter part of the last six months' rent which is now due from them which will amount to not quite Rs. 2000. The Collector is ordered to adjust their accounts accordingly.\n\nChapter VIII.\nRevenue and Finance.\nRemissions, 1774.\n\n1 Pub. Diary 66 of 1774, 720-721.\n2 Pub.

As to our certain knowledge the value of their carts are much decreased within these few years we really think their case merits your favourable consideration. We therefore beg leave to propose to you a reduction of one-fifth in the rate now collected being ten per cent as equitable between the Honourable Company and the landholders. Sensible of your readiness to afford all reasonable relief to your subjects, we have promised the fazand\u00e1rs that in case you consent to the measure we now propose the abatement shall take place from the time of their late application the 29th ultimo.\\(^2\\)\n\nAt a Consultation of the 12th August 1778 Mr. Ramsay the Chief of Mahim represents that several of the purchasers of the Honourable Company's carts situated at Mahim are building round their carts and thereby stopping up sundry footpaths and roads. As these have hitherto been free and open the inhabitants have complained to him thereof as a grievance. He ordered the vereadores to make the proper enquiries who accordingly delivered him a list of the carts and of the names of the owners complained of, which he now lays before us. Resolved that such a stoppage be not permitted and that the proprietors be compelled to keep open the footpaths and roads through their carts which are certified by the vereadores to have been hitherto accustomed and ordinary passages and that the list thereof be put on record after this Consultation.\\(^3\\)\n\nA Consultation of the 26th August 1778 records: The Collector now lays before us a petition from the ancient inhabitants of the carts lately belonging to the Honourable Company setting forth that their new landlords have raised the ground rent of their houses and requesting relief from us as they assert that it was declared at the time of sale that no alteration should be made in the ground rent of the houses then standing. This circumstance though not minuted being now recollected by some of the Members now at the Board and confirmed by the head Purvoe in the Collector's office now called and interrogated by the Collector and the conduct of the purchaser in this instance being contrary to what is just and right, it is resolved that no more than the ground rent heretofore collected by the Honourable Company shall be charged on those houses which were standing at the time the sale was made but not to interfere with respect to those that have been since or may in future be built.\\(^4\\)\n\nAt a Consultation of the 5th July 1780 M\u00e1nekji and Bamanji W\u00e1dia offering to purchase an cart named Roya for the sum it is valued at,\\(^5\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Pub.

He is continually troubled with the Bhand\u00e1ris' complaints and therefore proposes that this affair be put upon the old footing, namely of a muk\u00e1dam and four chaughul\u00e1s. This is agreed to, and the Secretary is directed to call in all the patents which were issued in consequence of the abovementioned innovation.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 11th July 1751 the Board rented the arrack farm for a term of three years. The entry runs: Es\u00e1ji Na\u00edk and other Bhand\u00e1ris petition the Board that they may be indulged with the arrack farm for which they offer the annual rent of Rs. 31,000 for a term of three years only. This proposal being taken into consideration, it is observed that although we have already given public notice that the farm would be put up at public outcry tomorrow, yet as these people offer Rs. 1000 more annually than the farm has ever let for, and as we are convinced that the farms falling into other hands would be a great hardship on the Bhand\u00e1ris, and considering the services they have on all occasions done for the Honourable Company in their military capacity, it is agreed that they be indulged with the farm upon their giving suitable security.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 23rd July 1751, B\u00e1b\u00e1ji Na\u00edk and other Bhand\u00e1ris produce their securities, Francisco Gomez and Antonio D\u2019Azavedo, who being men of substance and credit and being willing to enter into an engagement on behalf of the said Bhand\u00e1ris in the penal sum of Rs. 1,86,000, being double the rent of the farm at the rate of Rs. 31,000 for a term of three years, the Secretary is ordered to draw out a contract and bond of obligation accordingly.\n\nThe 23rd July 1754 being the day appointed for receiving proposals for the arrack farm, Erias de Gam and the late farmers delivered in their proposals sealed, which being opened, it appeared that Erias offered Rs. 33,200 a year and the late farmers Rs. 33,400 a year for a term of three years to commence from the 12th of August, the late farmers' offer being Rs. 200 more than Erias and Rs. 2400 more than when last rented out, an agreement was struck with them and the Secretary directed to draw out the contract. As we have reason to suspect that there was some collusive practice in regard to the last given security, it is agreed to accept of the Bhand\u00e1ris' own security by their assigning over to the Honourable Company all their estates, moveable and immoveable, for the due execution and performance of their agreement. The articles of agreement contained the following new stipulations:\n\nThat the P\u00e1rsis and others, who have the privilege of drawing toddy from date trees, shall first make a tender of what trees\n\n---\n\n1 Pub.

That the M\u00e1gaon Kunbis, who are permitted to draw toddy from the brab trees, may sell the same only at their own houses and may not carry it about the streets to the prejudice of a shop belonging to the Company's farm. Any Bhand\u00e1ri that draws toddy from M\u00e1gaon brab trees, except those Kunbis, shall be obliged to pay to the farm. Neither the said Kunbis nor any Bhand\u00e1ris are to draw toddy from M\u00e1gaon cocoanut trees unless they pay what is due to the farm.\n\nFor security of the payment of the aforesaid sum of Rs. 33,400 a year for the said term of three years in manner aforesaid, and for the due performance of the above articles, the said B\u00e1bu Es\u00e1ji N\u00e1ik and the underwritten, as representatives of all the Bhand\u00e1ris, do hereby make over for themselves their heirs executors and administrators, to the said Governor and Council and their successors, all their estates moveable and immoveable on this island Bombay, in witness whereof they have hereunto set their hands and seals in Bombay Castle this twelfth day of August, one thousand seven hundred and fifty-four, and to the counterpart hereof to remain with the said B\u00e1bu Es\u00e1ji N\u00e1ik and other Bhand\u00e1ris, the said President and Council have caused the common seal of the said Company to be affixed the day and year abovementioned.\u00b9\n\nAt a Consultation of the 12th July 1757 the Board read the following representation from the Native inhabitants of Bombay: The Government formerly ordered the arrack farmers and Bhand\u00e1ris to sell the best fulla arrack at 7 pice a measure called quartitho, arrack at 4 pice, and a banda or two quart bottles of toddy without mixture of water at 2 pice. To the great prejudice of the subject the Bhand\u00e1ris now disregard the said order and sell the fulla arrack much worse at 8 and 10 pice and the banda of toddy with the mixture of water at 2 pice. If they serve out the toddy they intended for distilling they charge 3 and 4 pice. The petitioners add: That after six o'clock at night the Bhand\u00e1ris and Frosts (that is Phard\u00e1shes or sweepers) should not be suffered to go into the carts. Also, as there is an order of the Government for that purpose which is quite forgot, that, without first discharging the debt, the Bhand\u00e1ris should not have liberty to cut off the leaves which are tied to the trees by the owners of the oarts when the Bhand\u00e1ris do not make good the monthly payments for drawing toddy.\u00b2\n\nAfter reading the above representation the Board defer its consideration till they can inspect the lease.

Diary 30 of 1757, 269, 282.}\n\nAt a Consultation the 26th July 1757 the Board received the following remonstrance and humble petition of the Bombay and Mahim Bhandaris:\n\nThat your petitioners have been always hitherto considered in the light of the Honourable Company's sepoys and have arms delivered them in order that they may be ready to serve on any emergency and are actually on all calls and do attend many services without receiving any monthly pay or consideration except being indulged with the arrack farm by which your petitioners subsist themselves and families. This farm has only twice been let out to others, namely once to Antonio de Lima and the second time to Savaji Dharamset during which time your petitioners laboured under so many hardships that many of them were obliged to leave this island and seek for subsistence elsewhere. Those farmers put a stop to your petitioners' selling arrack at their own houses and oppressed your petitioners in several other respects. To prevent this interference was the motive for your petitioners' agreeing to pay the very high rent they have hitherto done to the Honourable Company, and, in order that they might be entirely free from the oppression and impositions of others, they pay their rent duly without any trouble given your Honour, though they have suffered of late very considerable losses in the said farm by the trees cut down in October last by your Honour's orders. Out of these they lost no less than 541 cocoanut trees which obliged them to pay Rs. 150-2-45 more than before, and they also now draw 314 trees out of those within the town which they hear your Honour intends shortly to cut down. This will almost deprive them of the means of maintaining themselves and families. Nevertheless in hopes your Honour will be pleased to indulge them with a continuance of the farm, and in order that they may be entirely free from the oppressions and hardships they apprehend they might labour under from its falling into the hands of strangers, they hereby offer and humbly hope you will be pleased to accept from them Rs. 1000 more than heretofore paid for the said farm on the whole or such part of the annexed conditions as your Honour may think reasonable to allow them. In that case your petitioners shall continue as ready as heretofore to serve the Honourable Company with their lives and to attend the different services expected from them in consequence of this indulgence and as in duty bound shall ever pray.\\footnote{Pub. Diary 30 of 1757, 283-284.}\n\nThe following are the conditions humbly submitted to the Honourable the President and Council's consideration by the above petitioners the Bombay and Mahim Bhandaris who pray the same may be allowed them in a lease for renewing the arrack farm on the terms of paying the Honourable Company Rs. 1000 extraordinary a year for the said farm:\n\n1. That the fazandars who may be given trees in the Honourable Company's oarts in lieu of those cut down in October may be obliged to allow your petitioners to draw as many in the said oarts (or such\nChapter VIII.\n\nRevenue and Finance.\n\nArrack Farm, 1757.\n\nBOMBAY TOWN\n\na number of them as may not be deemed prejudicial to the trees) as your petitioners were allowed in their oarts cut down till the expiration of the lease.\n\n2. That no Bhand\u00e1ri may be permitted to draw the brab trees at M\u00e1gaon without paying as others do to the farm. It is very hard they should be exempt any more than those who draw the trees at Old Woman's island, Sion, Suri, Dh\u00e1r\u00edvi, M\u00e4him, and Bombay. They have hitherto greatly prejudiced the farm by vending toddy secretly about the streets by which your petitioners' shops at M\u00e1gaon and elsewhere have been greatly prejudiced. It is true they are forbid to do so but it would be too considerable an expense to your petitioners to keep such a number of sepoys in constant pay as would be requisite for detecting them, though we are all well assured they actually do vend considerable quantities to the great damage of your petitioners.\n\n3. That no person whatever besides your petitioners may be permitted to purchase the fruit called mahuda as that indulgence hitherto has been greatly abused and your petitioners much prejudiced by it. Not that your petitioners have the least objection to the continuance of the indulgence hitherto granted to certain P\u00e1rsis for distilling arrack from the same fruit called mahuda merely for the use of their families. But because that under this pretence P\u00e1rsis have purchased and distilled mahuda in their houses who are not allowed that liberty. And as they distil secretly in their compounds and houses, it is out of your petitioners' power to detect them. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that they themselves only may have the liberty of purchasing such mahuda as may be imported here, and that they shall be ready to allow the P\u00e1rsis to whom this indulgence is meant such a quantity of the said mahuda at prime cost as may by persons appointed by your Honour for that purpose be deemed sufficient for the use of their families. Lest it should be objected to this humble proposal that the Honourable Company's customs may hereby be diminished on that article, your petitioners are ready to agree to pay whatever sum may appear to be collected less on this article from year to year during the term of their lease as may appear on a medium of three years past to have been collected.\n\n4. That all the Goa arrack imported by Black merchants may be obliged to pay your petitioners Re. 1 a hogshead as was formerly allowed.\n\n5. The fazand\u00e1rs were many years past indulged with a liberty of drawing a number of trees for the use of their families without paying anything to the farm in consideration of letting the Bhand\u00e1ris have as many trees as they wanted at six and eight trees for a rupee; but of late the fazand\u00e1rs have refused the Bhand\u00e1ris trees at a quarter of a rupee each or even at any rate. This has greatly prejudiced your petitioners. As your petitioners have set forth the above indulgence was granted the fazand\u00e1rs entirely in consideration of letting them have trees to draw on reasonable terms and encourage them that the Honourable Company's farm might be increased. It is humbly prayed that this indulgence may be now withdrawn, and that they may not be permitted to draw any trees for their own use without paying to\nthe farm unless they will use your petitioners as formerly and let them have trees.\n\nThe Board then observe: The 26th July 1757 being the day appointed for letting out the arrack farm the present renters B\u00e1buji Es\u00e1ji N\u00e1ik and other Bhand\u00e1r\u00eds deliver in the above petition and proposals offering to increase the rent Rs. 1000 a year or to give Rs. 34,400 a year for the term of three years from the 12th of next month (August) on our complying with their proposals. These being taken into consideration we cannot but allow that the Bhand\u00e1r\u00eds have always been extremely ready and useful in serving the Honourable Company in a military capacity, and such Members of the Board as resided here when the farm was rented to Antonio de Lima and Shiv\u00e1ji Dharamset, well remember that many of them were obliged to leave the island on account of the hardships they then suffered by being deprived of the farm. We therefore think it would be very impolitic in us while engaged in a war with France to run any risk of losing the Bhand\u00e1r\u00eds' assistance even though any other persons made the same or rather better offers. But as the Bhand\u00e1r\u00eds have often raised the rent, we have good reason to believe what they now offer is as much as they can well afford for the farm. Besides we have no reason to object to the first and fifth articles. It is but just that the Bhand\u00e1r\u00eds should be allowed an equal number as before of the trees we have lately assigned the proprietors of those cut down round the Town Wall in October last; also that the rest of the fazand\u00e1rs should continue to indulge the Bhand\u00e1r\u00eds with as many trees as they have heretofore enjoyed at a reasonable rate. Otherwise the Bhand\u00e1r\u00eds will give up the privilege they have always granted the fazand\u00e1rs of drawing a certain number of trees for the use of their families without paying anything to the farm. The method the Bhand\u00e1r\u00eds propose in the third article of preventing any diminution in the Honourable Company's customs by giving them a privilege of buying all the mahuda that may be imported in order that they may not be imposed upon by such persons as have had a license for distilling that article for their particular use, is so reasonable that it is agreed to acquiesce therein. At the same time as the M\u00e1gaon estate was rented of the Mayor's Court on terms that were approved by this Board, we cannot think of altering the clause in favour of the Kunbis, nor of laying any additional duty on the Goa arrack imported by black merchants. The farmers' second and fourth proposals are, therefore, rejected. Resolved that we acquiesce in the rest for the reasons abovementioned. The farmers being accordingly acquainted therewith agree to renew the lease at Rs. 1000 a year more than they pay at present, agreeable to which the Secretary is directed to draw a contract.\n\nThe following additional articles were accordingly added in the articles of agreement of 1754: That such fazand\u00e1rs as have had oarts lately assigned them at M\u00e1him by the President and Council in lieu of those cut down round the town wall in October last shall be obliged to allow the said B\u00e1bu Es\u00e1ji N\u00e1ik and other farmers to draw as many trees in the above said oarts at M\u00e1him as they allowed the\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 30 of 1757, 284 - 285,\n2 Pub. Diary 30 of 1757, 280 - 281,\nsaid farmers out of those cut down round the Town Wall, or such a number of trees in the said oarts as may not be deemed prejudicial to them conformable to what is stipulated in the sixth article of the agreement. That from the date of these presents the said B\u00e1bu Es\u00e1ji N\u00e1ik and other farmers shall have the sole privilege of purchasing all the mahuda that may be imported to this island on condition that they allow certain P\u00e1rsis and others who have been hitherto indulged with a permission of distilling arrack for the use of themselves and families such a quantity of the said article at prime cost as they want or as may be deemed sufficient for their present use, namely, Fr\u00e1mji Rustamji, M\u00e1nekji Navroji, Mancharji Bamanji, Jijibhai Modi, M\u00e1nekji Limji, Baman Jiwa, Lavji W\u00e1dia, Pestan Macca Kamati, and M\u00e1nekji Manorah. And that the said farmers shall every year pay to the Bombay custom master whatever may be deficient on the customs of the said article during the term of this lease according to the medium of the customs which have been collected on mahuda for three years last past. That as the fazand\u00e1rs who have been indulged with the liberty of drawing a certain number of trees for the use of their families without paying anything to the farm in consideration of their letting the Bhand\u00e1ris have as many trees as they might want to draw on reasonable terms (being six and eight trees for a rupee) have lately refused to allow the Bhand\u00e1ris trees at any rate, the said indulgence to the fazand\u00e1rs shall be withdrawn from henceforward unless they will furnish the Bhand\u00e1ris as formerly.\n\nIn a letter of the 25th April 1759 the Court approve the step taken by the Board in granting the Bhand\u00e1ris the arrack farm. They write: Your indulgence to the Bhand\u00e1ris was a right measure. You did well in granting them the arrack farm. They certainly are a useful people, and as we judge the rent of this farm is carried to the highest pitch, we see no just reason it should be in other hands so long as their conduct is deserving your favour, and that you are satisfied there is no considerable increase in its value.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 31st July 1759, the Board read the following petition from the Bhand\u00e1ris of Bombay and M\u00e1him: That your poor petitioners humbly beg leave to represent to your Honour that, when the troops went on the late expedition to Surat, your petitioners were obliged to send a number of Bhand\u00e1ris every day as per account hereunto annexed on militia duty for above two months, the necessity for which your petitioners being sensible of, they executed the same with all diligence and alacrity as appears by Major Mace\u2019s certificate. But your petitioners having thereby suffered much in their occupation they humbly beg your Honour will order justice to be done as that duty prevented their taking the necessary care of the trees by which they were deprived of the toddy from 10,508 trees at Bombay and M\u00e1him. They likewise sustained another loss by your Honour\u2019s forbidding the sale of parriar arrack to any Europeans while his Majesty\u2019s squadron\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 30 of 1757, 314.\n2 Pub. Dep. Court\u2019s Letters Vol. 5 of 1757-1761, 187-188,\nwas at this place and had about 400 cocoanut trees cut down which were not replaced for about six months. All which losses have occasioned your petitioners owing a large balance to the Honourable Company and fazand\u00e1rs. In Governor Law's time your petitioners did militia duty. They were not only allowed provisions by the Government, but had tobacco also given them as your Honour may see by the accounts at that time. All this your petitioners submit to your consideration begging that proper allowances may be made your petitioners who always have been and still are ready to serve the Honourable Company as your Honour may please to direct.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 31st July 1759 the Board resolve that the consideration of the Bhand\u00e1ris' claim for damages be deferred.\n\nOn the 7th August 1759 the Board reperused the Bhand\u00e1ris' petition of the 31st July and appointed Messrs. Byfeld, Hornby, and Waters a committee for enquiring into its merit.\n\nSeven days later, on the 14th August 1759, the Board read a letter from Messrs. Byfeld Hornby and Waters with the enclosed report of the enquiry into the merits of the petition delivered by the Bhand\u00e1ris of Bombay and M\u00e1him. Agreeable to this they resolved that the Collector be ordered to deduct Rs. 600 from their rent for the arrack farm on account of the loss they sustained by our prohibiting the sale of parriar arrack and toddy to any Europeans from the 14th December last to 8th April agreeable to Vice-Admiral Pocock's desire. This prohibition at the time we laid it on, we were sensible would occasion a representation from the Bhand\u00e1ris, and as they represent that the fazand\u00e1rs do not allow them the stipulated number of three per cent trees conformable to their lease, the Collector must likewise be ordered to see that the fazand\u00e1rs comply therewith.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 2nd January 1760 the Board read the following petition from the Bhand\u00e1ris of Bombay: That your petitioners with the greatest respect beg leave to represent that they have suffered very much by cutting down of cocoanut trees. Regarding this they have before petitioned your Honour, but have not yet been able to get any restitution either for this loss or for the service they did the Honourable Company for two months in the militia. Your petitioners further represent that Mancharji Bamanji having got one of the Honourable Company's oars in exchange for his, has absolutely ordered the phar\u00e1sh\u00e9s or sweepers to take down the toddy pots from the trees to your petitioners' very great detriment though your Honour and Council were pleased on application made by our muk\u00e1dam to order him not to take them down. The other fazand\u00e1rs also intend the same, Jamsedji Fr\u00e1mji having taken away upwards of 100 trees from your\n\n---\n\n1 Major Mace's certificate dated 23rd April 1759 runs: There having been a necessity of calling the militia on this island to assist in the garrison duty of this place, these are to certify that the Bhand\u00e1ris of Bombay and M\u00e1him districts did militia duty from the 8th of February to 17th of April with all possible diligence and conformity to orders. I look upon them to be good and well affected men. Pub. Diary 33 of 1759, 459 - 460.\n2 Pub. Diary 33 of 1759, 453 - 454.\n3 Pub. Diary 33 of 1759, 465.\n4 Pub. Diary 33 of 1759, 487.\npetitioners. He would willingly have continued them if your petitioners would have paid him after the rate of three trees for a rupee which they absolutely refused as an exorbitant rate. If any strange Bhand\u00e1ris who came upon the island a few months ago, offer to pay the fazand\u00e1rs the like exorbitant rate it will lead to your petitioners' ruin. Your Honour will be pleased to order their muk\u00e1dam as administrator of the arrack farm not to suffer them to do it and to take him or them from out of the farm if they do. Formerly your petitioners were not obliged to give the men-of-war any toddy. Now in compliance to your order they give it though it is very prejudicial to them. Your petitioners are very ill used by the fazand\u00e1rs regarding the cocoanut trees, and the Collector to whom they have always complained being sick they cannot get any redress in their grievance. It therefore makes them request you will be pleased to order Mancharji Bamanji to continue his trees to them that the other fazand\u00e1rs may not be encouraged to force them from their trees.\n\nIn the time of Governor Phipps (1720-1728) a fazand\u00e1r having ordered some phar\u00e1shees to take down the toddy pots he ordered them to be punished and strictly reprimanded the fazand\u00e1rs. Your petitioners are always ready to serve the Honourable Company as sepoys, they having their own and the Company's arms for that purpose, and they beg you will be pleased to protect them and not suffer them to be so unjustly used by the fazand\u00e1rs with respect to the cocoanut trees.\u00b9\n\nSix months later, at a Consultation of the 15th July 1760, the Board read the following further petition from the Bombay and Mahim Bhand\u00e1ris: That as the time of the present arrack farm is almost out, your petitioners humbly beg leave to make their request that your Honour will be pleased to continue the said farm to them with proper conditions. During the present farm your petitioners have greatly suffered not only by the cutting down of a large number of cocoanut trees within and without the town but also by some of the fazand\u00e1rs having by force taken away a great many trees from your petitioners. In spite of these losses your petitioners as poor people quietly made good payment to the Honourable Company though to the great detriment of their families. Had not our managers of farm begged and desired of the fazand\u00e1rs to let out some trees, we should have been ruined by our present farm. The arrack farm has only twice been let to other people than Bhand\u00e1ris. During the time of those two farms your petitioners laboured under such hardships that many of them unable to maintain themselves were obliged to leave this island. For those farmers put an entire stop to your petitioners' selling arrack at their own houses and oppressed your petitioners in several other respects. The motive for your petitioners' agreeing to pay the very high rent they have hitherto paid to the Honourable Company was purely that they might be entirely free from the oppressions and impositions of any other farmers. But as your petitioners suffer very much for want of trees, they humbly beg you will please to order that proper method may be taken for your petitioners having a sufficient number of trees for the better carrying on the farm. Hitherto as your petitioners have been always considered\n\n\u00b9 Pub. Diary 34 of 1760, 13\u00b714\u00b7\nin the light of the Honourable Company's sepoys and have arms delivered them in order that they may be ready to serve on all proper occasions and are actually on all calls and do attend many services without any monthly pay or consideration except that they are indulged with the arrack farm by which only your petitioners maintain themselves and families. We now find that your Honour will not permit us to keep a shop in the town for selling j\u00e1gri or any arrack by which your petitioners think they will lose Rs. 175 a month or thereabouts. We therefore desire you will order the continuance of the shop as a very great number of natives live within the town and we bind ourselves not to sell any arrack to Europeans. All this your petitioners humbly submit to your Honour's consideration to grant them such aid and favour as you will think proper to indulge them with by continuing the farm as usual and with proper conditions about cocoanut trees.\n\nAt the same Consultation, 15th July 1760, the Board also read the following letter from B\u00e1buj\u00ed Es\u00e1ji N\u00e1ik: We will willingly give Rs. 1000 more a year. At the same time we must desire your Honour will be pleased to order 2000 cocoanut trees and a limitation to the P\u00e1rsis to distil j\u00e1gri arrack, because these articles will greatly help us to pay the Honourable Company's money. Otherwise for want of trees we shall be greatly hurt as at present we are obliged to push ourselves to pay one piec and two piec more a tree together with the money to pay the Honourable Company which is very hard and we cannot bear it. We therefore say if we have about 2000 cocoanut trees we can be able to maintain ourselves and pay the Honourable Company this money with great pleasure.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 29th July 1760, after reading these letters the Board pass the following orders: B\u00e1buj\u00ed Es\u00e1ji N\u00e1ik the principal of the Bhand\u00e1ris, being called on to know what they offer for renting the arrack farm, leaves the same to our determination after declaring that he will furnish 600 Bhand\u00e1ris to act as sepoys whenever required by us without any pay or allowances but those for provisions and tobacco for the time they may be employed. This he agrees to be inserted as an article of the lease. He is told that no arrack shop will be permitted to be kept within the gates. The other proposal being taken into consideration together with the 105th paragraph of our Honourable Masters' commands of 25th April 1759, wherein they approved of our giving the last contract to the Bhand\u00e1ris, and the reasons set forth in our Consultation of the 26th July 1757 still subsisting both with respect to the French war and to the hardships we are sensible the Bhand\u00e1ris must be exposed to by any other person renting the farm, it is resolved, notwithstanding Pil\u00e1ji Keshavji's offer, that we grant the lease to the Bhand\u00e1ris provided they will give Rs. 38,000 for the term of five years. As the Bhand\u00e1ris agree the Secretary is ordered to prepare a lease accordingly.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 5th August 1760 the Board take into consideration that Ignatio de Gama has offered Rs. 3000 for the privi-\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 34 of 1760, 534-536.\n2 Pub. Diary 34 of 1760, 536.\n3 Pub. Diary 35 of 1760, 566-567.\nlegislative of keeping the licensed punch houses. Being of opinion that discounting the excise on liquors expended in those houses would be answered by farming them out without collecting any excise, besides saving a monthly allowance thereby, the Board resolved that a notification be affixed in the usual places giving notice that on this day seven night we shall put up to public outcry the privilege of keeping four punch houses clear of excise.\n\nA week later the Diary records: The 12th August 1760, being the day appointed for farming out the privilege of keeping four punch houses free of excise, the rules and regulations by which the punch house-keepers are now restrained are read and approved in part of the conditions with the new farmer. Considering on the other conditions which it will be necessary to declare to the bidders, it is agreed that the lease commence on the 1st November next and that the excise cease the same date. This will enable the present punch house-keepers to dispose of their stock. That the lease be given for three years and the rent paid quarterly to the Bombay custom master instead of the revenue of excise. Also that the farmer be obliged to give security to the amount of two years' rents for the punctual observance of his contract. The Board having therefore repaired to the Bandar and published the conditions concerning the punch houses as will be entered in the book of contracts, the privilege of keeping four, clear of any excise, was let to Pil\u00e1ji Keshavji the highest bidder at Rs. 7300 a year. The Court, in a letter of the 16th April 1762, paragraph 90, approve of this settlement. They write: The license for four punch houses which you have let to Pil\u00e1ji for Rs. 7300 a year, we so far approve, not doubting but you will take due care that good order be observed being so essentially necessary for the preservation of the health of our people and the good government of the place. We do not propose to raise a revenue from any particular branch that may be destructive to the inhabitants or to the soldiers and marine people we so much depend upon.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 24th October 1763 the Board having repaired to the tent, previous to the sale of copper, put up the farm of the four punch houses for the term of three years and on the former conditions. This farm was let to Hirji Navroji for Rs. 12,000 a year, that is Rs. 4700 a year more than the last contract. On hearing this result, in a letter dated 22nd March 1765, paragraph 121, the Court write: The great increase of the punch house farm, being Rs. 4700 the last year, appears to be something extraordinary. We hope this increase is not owing to your giving any greater indulgences than formerly that may be prejudicial to the inhabitants and particularly to the military and marine. If that is the case we had rather the farms were let for less.\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 35 of 1760, 593.\n2 Pub. Diary 35 of 1760, 628-629.\n3 Pub. Diary 41 of 1763, 654.\n4 Pub. Dep. Court's Letters Vol. 6 of 1762-1764, 44.\n5 Pub. Dep. Court's Letters Vol. 7 of 1766-1768, 39.\nAt a Consultation of the 30th July 1765 the Board read the following representation from the fazand\u00e1rs of Bombay and M\u00e1him: Your petitioners humbly represent to your Honour that the oarts and estates they possess, they enjoy only for their credit as from the great expense of keeping them, manure and everything else being so much dearer than formerly, they hardly get three per cent on their amount. Your petitioners pay the annual pension for their said estates to which they have not the least objection. They are obliged to do militia duty and to be ready on any occasion for defending this island as they did in former times and which they are still obliged to do whenever called upon. They pay a tax of ten per cent but, as they found it hard, they requested your Honour would take the same into consideration, hoping you would have granted them relief therein. They are obliged according to former agreements in every hundred to give three cocoonut trees, known as order trees, to the Bhand\u00e1ris to draw toddy. For these three per cent order trees the Bhand\u00e1ris pay them a very small price, namely 3 qrs. 75 res a year. Whereas for each one of the willing trees that is trees hired from the fazand\u00e1rs, the Bhand\u00e1ris pay Rs. 4. That is on each order tree the fazand\u00e1rs lose Rs. 3-0-25, so that on the 2000 trees to which the three per cent order rule applies the fazand\u00e1rs' loss amounts to a good sum of money. This the fazand\u00e1rs lose without any benefit to the Company, but only to the Bhand\u00e1ris who grow rich while the fazand\u00e1rs become poor. As everything else gets daily dearer the prices of trees have become dear. Therefore they humbly beg your Honour will be pleased to take these premises into consideration and order the Bhand\u00e1ris to pay for the order trees the same price as they pay for the willing or market rate trees. Your petitioners will oblige themselves to keep and preserve the same to the Bhand\u00e1ris without the least objection for the benefit of said farm and the service of the Honourable Company, but the price ought to be the same as the other trees called willing trees or trees of will. On this the Board direct the Collector to enquire into the nature of the hardship the fazand\u00e1rs complain of and report the same.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 6th August 1765 the Board read the following petition of Purshotam B\u00e1buji N\u00e1k Muk\u00e1dam and B\u00e1v\u00e1ji D\u00e1d\u00e1ji N\u00e1k, head chaughul\u00e1s of the Bhand\u00e1ris: That with the greatest respect and submission your petitioners humbly beg leave to represent to your Honour that as you were pleased to ask us what we would give for the arrack farm we thereupon assembled all the Bombay and M\u00e1him Bhand\u00e1ris to take their opinion about the farm. They all agreed to give us a power (now enclosed herein) to take the farm for such a price as they can afford. But five or six, who are against our family, came and made several objections saying they could not give a higher price. And so they are persuading the others. We take the liberty to represent to your Honour that we took this farm for Rs. 38,000. At that time the Honourable Company's works were going on with great expedition and a large number of big\u00e1ris\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 45 of 1765, 477, 482-483.\nwere employed. The fazand\u00e1rs of M\u00e1him then let out their trees to draw toddy at the rate of six trees a rupee and those at Bombay at four trees the rupee. About two years ago the fazand\u00e1rs have altered the price of their trees to 4 for a rupee at M\u00e1him and to 2, 2\u00bd, and 3 trees a rupee at Bombay. This though greatly to our prejudice and loss we were obliged to accept, because as we had then taken the farm we must one way or other finish it. We are informed that the fazand\u00e1rs intend requesting a greater price for their cocoanut trees of order against the old and observed rule of the farm. As the advantages of the farm chiefly depend upon the cheapness of the order trees, if the fazand\u00e1rs are allowed to charge market rates for order trees your petitioners will be ruined. The Honourable Company's works are also lessened and on this account so great a number of big\u00e1ris are gone off the island that the tobacco and other farms have greatly fallen. By the decrease in the sale of arrack we are great sufferers. Still we take the liberty to offer Rs. 1000 more and most humbly pray that the conditions noted above may be granted and added to our lease which will be some help to us. We formerly have and still are ready to serve the Company with great zeal and fidelity on any occasion that offers. We therefore most humbly hope your Honour in your great charity will be pleased to favour us by granting us this farm. If it is given to another farmer we shall be ruined, because he will find many means to hurt us. All this we most humbly take the liberty to lay at your Honour's feet to consider in our behalf, you being a father to the poor and helpless.\n\nA Consultation of the 6th August 1765 records: This being the day appointed for letting out the arrack farm the Board repair to the Bandar to put up the same. A petition was there delivered from the Bhand\u00e1ris wherein they offer Rs. 1000 more than they gave for the last lease provided we will insert some new conditions proposed by them. But as the fazand\u00e1rs' petition for raising the price of the order trees has not yet been determined on; and as our complying with the fazand\u00e1rs' prayer will make some differences in the advantages accruing from the farm; and as some other matters relative thereto likewise require consideration, it is agreed to defer coming to any determination on this subject till next Monday. In the interim we shall have recourse to the records and establish such regulations, as well with respect to the order trees as to some other parts of the farm, as may appear to us equitable and consistent with our Honourable Masters' interest.\n\nA Consultation a week later (12th August 1765) continues: Agreeable to our resolution last Tuesday the Board met to take into consideration the preliminaries necessary to be stipulated in respect to the arrack farm, as well as to consider the petition from the fazand\u00e1rs of Bombay and M\u00e1him laid before us the 23rd (30th) ultimo. The first point the fazand\u00e1rs press is that the trees of order may be put upon the same footing as the trees of will. On this it is observed that the\n\n---\n\n1 Pub.

At the same time we do not think that the rates for order trees should be so high as those for willing trees. It is therefore resolved that in the next farm the rate for the three per cent trees of order, be increased from Rs. 0-3-75 to Rs. 2 instead of to Rs. 4 which the fazandars request especially as in only 2000 of the 10,000 trees does the rule of a three per cent of order trees apply. The Bhandaris' proposals for having their lease renewed with the new conditions they desire being referred to, together with the report of the committee appointed to adjust some dispute between the Bhandaris and their mukadam, also entered on our Diary under the 28th February 1764, the following resolutions are now taken and ordered to be explained to the Bhandaris that they may duly consider the same and acquaint us what they can really afford to give for the farm upon those terms. We shall then come to a determination as to the expediency of letting the Bhandaris have the farm again or of putting it up to auction. The new terms are: No person is to be suffered to make use of the vara (that is 'in turn') trees except the fazandars; nor are the fazandars upon any pretence to take more trees than what they may really want for the use of their own family on pain of being fined Rs. 20 for every tree they may be found to have above that number. The mukadam to be allowed two kovitas (that is as many trees as two knives can dress) and each chaughula and patil one coit (kovita) each and no more upon any pretence whatever. Except the families who have been heretofore indulged in this respect, no person to be suffered to distil mahuda into arrack on pain of being fined Rs. 10 for the first offence, Rs. 20 for the second, and Rs. 50 for the third, with such further punishment as may be inflicted on them. The above families who have this indulgence are not to import mahuda themselves. They must apply for what they may want to the Bhandaris who are to supply them with the same at prime cost, the families first giving an account to the Collector what quantity of arrack they really want for the immediate use of their families. More than this the Bhandaris must not make on any pretence whatever. No persons whatever, except those heretofore indulged with this privilege, are to import nip, country, or parriar arrack from the other side of the harbour without the consent both of the Bhandaris and of the Collector. Ordered that a publication issue by beat of drum requiring all the inhabitants of this island to pay implicit obedience to the preceding regulations.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 16th August 1765 the Board read the following petition from the Bhandaris: That your petitioners with great respect beg leave to represent to your Honour that last Monday your Honour was pleased to send for and tell them that the Council had determined that they should pay the fazandars Rs. 2 for every tree of order a year and to give them permission to bring over such arrack as they\n\n---\n\n1 The produce of vara or in turn trees was used day about by the owner and the tapper.\n2 Pub.

That the Honourable Council would not give them the arrack farm for Rs. 39,000 the price they had offered and directed that they should assemble and consult how much more they would give for it. In consequence of this your petitioners gathered all the Bhand\u00e1ris together and acquainted them of the Board's resolution, to which, excepting those who are against your petitioners, the Bhand\u00e1ris answered that the rate of the order trees was formerly established and had never been altered. Still since your Honour ordered them they must acquiesce though the change tends to their great prejudice, for they by this means must pay the fazand\u00e1rs Rs. 2149-1-75 a year more than formerly. If the Honourable Company would themselves take this sum the Bhand\u00e1ris would not be sorry for they would get restitution on some other occasion. But they cannot expect any return from the fazand\u00e1rs. Your Honour was also pleased to order your petitioners to give the fazand\u00e1rs perpetual liberty of bringing arrack from the other side for their feasts beside v\u00e1ra trees all which terms in favour of the fazand\u00e1rs will exempt them from being under any obligation to the Bhand\u00e1ris and then they will use the Bhand\u00e1ris as hard as they please with respect to their trees. All this obliges your petitioners to lay their heads at your Honour's feet. They humbly implore your Honour will be pleased to order the fazand\u00e1rs to continue and preserve the number of trees at the present rate without any alteration and not to take away from them any tree during this farm of five years and to leave the v\u00e1ra trees in your petitioners' power and disposal. Also to continue your petitioners the permission of bringing your petitioners' arrack for the fazand\u00e1rs' feasts to induce them thereby not to use your petitioners hard. Otherwise the Bhand\u00e1ris will be subjected to the fazand\u00e1rs and consequently obliged to yield to their demands however arbitrary. On your Honour's taking pity on the poverty of the Bhand\u00e1ris and granting them these three articles to wit v\u00e1ra trees, permission of bringing your petitioners' arrack, and to preserve the same number of order trees at the present price, your Honour's petitioners will give Rs. 39,500. Some of them are not content to do this. Still by consent of their majority they do offer and will punctually pay this increase to the Honourable Company. They humbly desire your Honour to observe that, if this is accepted, they will every year be obliged to pay Rs. 1500 more to the Company as well as Rs. 2149-1-75 to the fazand\u00e1rs if your Honour's rule that order trees should pay one-half market rate is enforced. They further desire your Honour will be pleased to order the fazand\u00e1rs to give such trees of order as the Bhand\u00e1ris may choose and to be allowed to cut steps in the trees for the Vrita Bhand\u00e1ris who cannot climb without steps. Your Honour's petitioners being poor helpless distressed persons humbly submit the whole to your Honour's consideration.\n\nThe same day, 16th August 1765, after reading the above petition the Board pass the following orders: The new clauses intended to be inserted in the lease of the arrack farm having been properly explained to the Bhand\u00e1ris, they now deliver in proposals wherein they offer\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 45 of 1765, 529-531.\nRs. 39,500 a year or Rs. 1500 more than the last farm. This being now taken into consideration, the muk\u00e1dam is called before us and the question put whether they really can afford to give any more. The muk\u00e1dam declares that the advance of Rs. 2000 upon the order trees and the increase in the rent offered in the proposals now before us renders it impossible for them to give more than Rs. 40,000 a year for the farm. He being directed to withdraw it is observed that as none else has made any proposals for renting the farm and as the fazand\u00e1rs offered to take it on the terms of the last lease only on condition of our increasing the price of order trees to the full rate given for the others, there is little reason to imagine we shall get more by putting the farm to auction. For this reason and as our Honourable Masters have also been pleased to approve of the preference we gave the Bhand\u00e1r\u00eds in the last farm it is agreed to accept their offer of Rs. 40,000 a year for a term of five years. A lease is accordingly ordered to be drawn out with all the former conditions and the necessary additions in consequence of our resolution of the 12th instant. In order as much as possible to prevent the disputes which happened during the late farm and to have the business carried on in the best manner for the benefit of the Bhand\u00e1r\u00eds in general, which from the weakness of his understanding we do not think the present muk\u00e1dam capable of performing, resolved that a manager be appointed in the same manner as was practised formerly and with an allowance of Rs. 30 a month. Manuel Barretto being judged a proper person to execute this trust is appointed accordingly. Also resolved that a set of regulations be prepared and laid before us for our approbation for Manuel\u2019s best guidance in carrying on the business of the farm.\n\nA Consultation of the 27th October 1767 records: This being the day appointed for letting out the punch houses the Major and Superintendent now present, set forth that the licensed punch houses have proved extremely prejudicial to the health of the soldiers and seamen who have at all times free access to them, and very detrimental to the service and to the good order of the place. The Honourable Company\u2019s orders on the establishment of these houses are therefore now referred to, whereby it appears they no further approve of these houses than as they may be useful to the inhabitants and not prejudicial to the health of their soldiers and seamen. Resolved therefore, in order to remedy this evil, and not entirely abolish the revenue, that only two houses be allowed to be kept in every respect upon the same footing as those now permitted. Except that no soldier or seaman be suffered to enter them upon any pretence whatever, nor be furnished with any liquor from them on pain of the farmer being fined Rs. 25 for the first offence, Rs. 50 for the second, Rs. 100 for the third, and for a fourth that he be turned out of the house after being duly convicted thereof before one of his Majesty\u2019s Justices of the Peace. Ordered that public notice be given of these our Resolutions, and that the houses be put up on\n\n---\n\n1 Pub.

The terms and conditions on which they were to be let being published and explained to the several persons attending, they were put up separately and one let to M\u00e1n\u00e9lkji Dor\u00e1bji for Rs. 2620 a year, and the other to Samuel Barber for Rs. 3020 for the same term to commence from this day.\\(^2\\) On receipt of this information, in a letter of the 31st March 1769, paragraph 69, the Court observe: The Major and Superintendent having represented that the punch houses were very prejudicial to the good order and discipline of the island by the soldiers and sailors having free access to them, we approve your reducing their number and regulating them so as to prevent such evils in future, although they did not let for so much as before, and we expect you will be careful to see your regulations are strictly complied with.\\(^3\\)\n\nAt a Consultation of the 19th January 1770 the Board read two petitions from W. Chambers and David Ecklin (Thomas Ackling?) Europeans desiring they may be permitted to keep houses of entertainment for strangers which we, the Board say, are sensible would under proper restrictions be of general utility. Ordered therefore that Messrs. Jervis and Fletcher take the same into consideration and draw up such regulations as they may think eligible to be laid before us for our approbation.\\(^4\\)\n\nAt a Consultation of the 1st March 1770 the Board received the following report from this Committee, dated 29th January 1770: Having in consequence of your Honour's orders of the 23rd instant taken into consideration the proposals for keeping two licensed taverns within the town walls, we now enclose sundry regulations and rates respecting the same. If these rules are duly attended to, we hope the taverns will answer the purposes proposed thereby.\\(^5\\) The following are the rules and orders to be observed in the two houses licensed for taverns: The keepers are on no account either to entertain in their houses any private seamen or soldiers or to sell any liquor to be carried therefrom for the use of any such persons. If a tavern keeper is accused of any such offence, upon being duly convicted thereof before any one of His Majesty's Justices of the Peace, he will be fined for the first offence Rs. 300, and for a second offence he will be fined the same amount, and will also be disabled from holding any license in future. The keeper must take great care that no riots or disorders are committed in his house. Upon a proof of any disorder not only the keepers but the parties will be punished as the law directs and their license taken away. The keepers must take particular notice that they do not offend against the following extracts from the Acts of Parlia-\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Pub. Diary 49 of 1767, 595-596.\n\n\\(^2\\) Pub.

By the 7th Jac. Cap. 10 and 21st Jac. Cap. 7 and 8th Car. Cap. 4th, it is enacted that if any ale-housekeeper shall be convicted of tippling, or being drunk, he shall be disabled for the space of three years from keeping any such ale-house. By the 1st Jac. Cap. 9th, it is enacted that if any ale-housekeeper suffer any person to remain tippling in his house at an unseasonable hour, he shall on conviction for every offence forfeit ten shillings. By the laws of England the tavern-keeper may detain the person of a guest who eats, or the horse which eats, till payment is made for what they have had. But should the keeper detain any such horse, the law does not allow the tavern-keeper to make use thereof.\n\nThe tavern-keepers are allowed to charge the following rates. And, unless they are properly authorized for so doing, if the keepers exact any more they will be severely punished:\n\nFor breakfast, tea coffee with bread and butter; for dinner and supper, butcher's meat, fish, poultry, and greens, one beaker of punch and as much country beer as they can drink, each meal, for each person, Rs. 2. For a dinner and one beaker of punch, Re. 1. For a roast or boiled fowl either cold or hot, Re. \u00bd. For a plate of ham or tongue, Re. \u00be. For a plate of cold beef or mutton, Re. \u00bc. For a plate of hot (beef or mutton) with greens, Re. \u00bd. For coffee tea or chocolate including bread butter and sugar, Re. \u00bc. The prices of wine are, per bottle: Claret Rs. 3, Hock Rs. 2\u00bd, Madeira Rs. 1\u00bd, Port Rs. 1\u00bd, Lisbon Re. 1, Cider Re. 1, Bottled Beer Re. 1, Cask Beer Re. \u00bd, Brandy Rs. 3, Rum Rs. 3, and Gin Rs. 2\u00bd, the three last per quart. A pint of good punch either of Goa or Batavia arrack Re. \u00bc. For a bed each night Re. \u00bc.\n\nIf any gentleman orders at dinner or supper, turkeys hams geese or made dishes, they must pay as agreed on for those dishes at a reasonable rate. Those who agree to diet in the houses must pay at the rate of Rs. 2 a day whether they eat or not. An Ordinary every day consisting of beef, mutton, fowls, ducks, fish, and greens in season at Re. 1. Each person to be allowed one beaker of punch and as much country beer as they can drink. But what liquor they want after the cloth is removed they must pay for it at the above rates. Persons who have dined at the Ordinary may, if they choose, partake of what is cold in the house for supper at Re. \u00bd each, but must pay for any liquor they call for. All persons whatever entertained in the houses are to pay ready money. The tavern-keepers are to pay the following rates of excise and the houses are liable to be inspected at any time by an officer appointed for that purpose:\n\nBatavia arrack Rs. 70 and Goa arrack Rs. 15 the hogshead. Wine Brandy and Rum at Re. 1 and Beer and Cider at Rs. \u00bd the dozen bottles.\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 55 of 1770, 152-153. Comp. of Standing Ord. Vol. 2 of 1759-1788, 284-285.\n2 Pub. Diary 55 of 1770, 153-154.\nThe Board approve these regulations and resolve that William Chambers and Thomas Ackling (David Ecklin?) who petitioned to keep the houses are to have permission accordingly, with the express condition that they are not to be concerned with each other either directly or indirectly. Also an exciseman is to be appointed as formerly.\n\nThirteen days later at a Consultation of the 14th March 1770 the Board read a petition from Robert Barnet requesting permission to keep a house for retailing liquor, and setting forth that, if a license is granted him, he will engage to prevent any one from selling liquor but himself. The Board observe: Barnet also undertakes to give proper security to abide by such regulations and restrictions and to pay such duties as we may think proper. Ordered that the same be referred to the consideration of Messrs. Jervis and Stackhouse to whom the particulars of Barnet's scheme and the security he proposes to give for complying with his engagements are referred for report to the Board.\n\nOn the 21st March the Committee submit the following report: In consequence of your order under the 15th instant relative to a petition of Robert Barnet praying a license for retailing liquor, we have examined him respecting the same and now enclose your worship sundry articles agreed to by him for carrying the same into execution. We beg leave to observe that such a house appears to us to be much wanted, and that, provided the articles enclosed are duly attended to, it will, we hope, prevent the too frequent riots that happen owing to the pernicious country liquors which are still privately obtained notwithstanding the many fines which have been inflicted.\n\nThe following are the rules agreed to by Robert Barnet for keeping a punch-house: (1) That he shall be permitted to open the house at sunrise every morning and that he shall be obliged to shut the same at sunsetting every day and not suffer any persons to remain any longer in his house after that time; (2) That he shall pay the same rates of excise as the public taverns of this town do at present pay or such other new rates as may be enforced; (3) That whenever required he shall let the officer of excise examine into all parts of the premises where the said punch house is kept; (4) That he shall keep open only one house for retailing liquor; (5) That he shall on no account suffer any gaming in his house; (6) That he shall pay into the Custom House for the use of the Honourable Company Rs. 500 a year in half-yearly payments, the first payment on the day of opening the house, the second at the expiration of six months; (7) That he is not to suffer any riot or disturbance in the house; (8) That on conviction of being guilty of a breach of any of these articles for the first offence he shall pay a fine of Rs. 300 and for the second the license shall be forfeited; (9) That all liquors are to be sold agreeable to the rates allowed the former punch-houses as specified in the license; (10) For a faithful abiding by and conformity with the above rules, and such others as may be given him extracted from the laws of England, he shall enter into a security bond for the sum of Rs. 10,000, namely\n\n---\n\n1 Pub.

The fazand\u00e1rs were made acquainted with the Bhand\u00e1ris\u2019 complaint in regard to the trees of will. In answer they said that nothing was settled by the Governor and Council when the farm was last put up. On reference to the register we found this to be true and that only the trees of order were fixed having been raised from Re. 0-3-75 to Rs. 2 a year. We then recommended to the Bhand\u00e1ris to settle with the fazand\u00e1rs some price for the different sorts of trees of will. This they declined to do and only referred us to their petition telling us that they could take the farm on no other conditions than what were therein set forth. This being the case we thought it unnecessary to inquire into any further particulars and are therefore of opinion that it will be for the Company\u2019s interest that the arrack farm be put up at public outcry especially as in the course of our enquiry, we found there would likely be many bidders and have reason to believe that it will fetch from Rs. 45,000 to Rs. 50,000 a year exclusive of the conditions of not selling arrack to the soldiers.\n\nAt the same Consultation, the 13th July 1770, the Board read the following petition from the Bhand\u00e1ris of Bombay and M\u00e1him, dated the 29th June 1770: That your petitioners, being apprized of your Honour\u2019s intention of leasing out the arrack farm on the 12th of next month, beg leave to represent that they have been the lessees of that farm ever since the time when Mr. Horne was Governor (1734-1739); that they have been punctual in their discharge of their stated payments and have duly performed all the other conditions required of them by the Honourable the President and Council. They can assure your Honour that if any other persons should take the said farm it would certainly ruin them, which consideration they hope will have sufficient weight to induce you to grant them a new lease which they request may be drawn out in the following terms: (1) That all the former conditions be continued, (2) That the fazand\u00e1rs shall not take a greater price for their cocoanut trees than was settled by the Honourable the President and Council nor be permitted to deprive your petitioners of the trees they draw toddy from, for when at the request of the fazand\u00e1rs the price of the trees of order was doubled, they were at the same\n\n---\n\n1 Pub.

Forrest\u2019s Home Series, II. 162.\ntime ordered not to increase the price of the trees of will which was Rs. 4 a tree the year. This they strictly adhered to for some time, but have lately infringed by charging Rs. 6 a tree; and still pressing your petitioner to pay more. (3) That no person shall be permitted to carry any liquor of any kind without the town walls, except by permission of their manager. (4) That they shall not be obliged to take a fazand\u00e1r for their manager who to favour the people of his own caste will always act to the prejudice of the farm, of which Manuel Barretto the present manager is an instance. Your petitioners most humbly repeat their request for a lease of the farm on the above conditions and beg leave to observe that to insert a clause against selling liquor to Europeans will be a great diminution of their profits as formerly on account of that privilege alone the rent of the farm was raised from Rs. 12,000 to Rs. 15,000.\n\nAfter reading the above the Board observe: After considering these papers and referring to our Honourable Masters\u2019 commands and our records on this subject for many years past, it appears evident the Company are inclined to give the Bhand\u00e1ris the preference in this farm. At the same time we have some reason to believe the farm, if put up, will fetch considerably more than the Bhand\u00e1ris now offer for it. Resolved, therefore, that it be put up agreeable to what the Committee recommend in order to ascertain what it can really fetch, but to give the Bhand\u00e1ris a preference in the farm at whatever may be bid for it. The doors being then opened, and the merchants Bhand\u00e1ris and others attending, the Bhand\u00e1ris request the value of the trees of will may be ascertained by the Board who accordingly called upon the fazand\u00e1rs to make the necessary inquiry regarding it. These last readily agree to let the Bhand\u00e1ris have the trees of will at the same prices they now give for the trees in the different carts being from two to three trees the rupee a month, provided the trees of order are continued on the same terms as those of last farm, namely Rs. 2 a year. The proprietors of the several oarts further agree to allow the Bhand\u00e1ris the same number of trees they now draw toddy from at the above rate. Both parties being satisfied with these conditions, the farm was put up on the former terms except that the farmers are not allowed to sell arrack to European soldiers or sailors but have liberty to supply them with sweet toddy at the rate of 30 res the banda of two Bombay sers and this to be brought into the town only at the Church Gate. Notwithstanding we kept it up 1\u00bd hours, not more than Rs. 42,000 was bid for the farm. We therefore called upon the Bhand\u00e1ris to declare the utmost they would give for it. After much difficulty they consent to pay Rs. 45,000 a year, that is Rs. 5000 more than it let for the last term, notwithstanding the prohibition to sell to soldiers and sailors. This offer is accepted provided the Bhand\u00e1ris will engage to furnish 800 men instead of 600 when the service requires it. In this they acquiesce if it is in their power to raise so many.\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 55 of 1770, 407-409. Forrest\u2019s Home Series, II. 162-163.\n2 Pub. Diary 55 of 1770, 404-405. The bandy, bande, and bunda met with in the records is the bunda of two bottles of about 26 ozs. each that is together about \u00bcrd of an imperial gallon.\nAt a Consultation of the 13th August 1771 the Board read a petition from the Bhand\u00e1ris desiring some cocoanut trees may be allotted them to drain toddy from, in lieu of those cut and now cutting down to make the necessary Esplanade round the town. Ordered that the Collector make due enquiry and report the number of trees which have been cut down since the date of the Bhand\u00e1ris\u2019 present lease for the arrack farm, and the number of those trees which were allotted to the Bhand\u00e1ris for draining toddy.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 20th August 1771 the Board read the following letter from the Collector: With regard to the petition of the Bhand\u00e1ris it appears that 5335 cocoanut trees have been cut down since the date of their lease, of which 1679 were allotted to the Bhand\u00e1ris to draw toddy from. It rests therefore with your Honour whether you will direct the fazand\u00e1rs to allot them an equal number of trees from other oarts in view of those that have been taken from them, or from such of their oarts as are most contiguous to the town of Bombay.\n\nAfter reading the above the Board direct: The Collector must cause a number of cocoanut trees to be allotted to the Bhand\u00e1ris for drawing toddy in the Bombay woods equivalent to those cut down and at the same prices.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 12th October 1771 the Board resolved that a publication be issued strictly prohibiting the sale of any country arrack within the town wall or within one mile thereof on pain of being fined at the discretion of the sitting Magistrate.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 3rd of February 1775 the Board read a petition from the manager of the arrack farm, representing that many Bhand\u00e1ris are enlisting as sepoys in the two new battalions now raising. This if continued would be the means of preventing the payment of the monthly rent. Ordered that directions be given for preventing the same, as it is not only a prejudice to the farm, but in case of any emergency such enlistment would deprive the Company of the Bhand\u00e1ris\u2019 services as a militia, in which capacity by their lease they are to serve when required.\n\nA Consultation of the 28th July 1775 records: Read a petition from the Bhand\u00e1ris who are the arrack farmers, and who have done militia duty since a short time after our forces attacked S\u00e1lsette, requesting to be allowed for that service, provisions and tobacco money. This is agreed to, as, by an article of their lease, they are entitled to this allowance. But the allowance must extend to those only who by muster really did duty, and not to the whole number which by lease they are on emergency obliged to furnish.\n\nThe same Consultation, 28th July 1775, continues: The arrack farm was next put to lease and no more was offered than Rs. 25,100\n\n---\n\n1 Pub.

Having reason to suppose that in a few days there may be other bidders, and the sum now offered being much less than what we believe the farm is really worth, it is agreed to defer the sale until Tuesday next of which the people assembled are now acquainted, and the Secretary is ordered to give notice accordingly.\u00b9\n\nA Consultation of the 1st August continues: The Board then adjourned to the Hall below to make sale of the arrack farm. The inhabitants being assembled the farm was put up on the usual terms and conditions and for five years as customary. It was at length knocked down to Bayr\u00e1nji Homji for Rs. 41,000 a year, he being the highest bidder. This is only Rs. 4000 less than it before let for, and is considerably more than we had reason to expect.\u00b2\n\nAt a Consultation of 15th March 1774 the Board received the following petition from Mr. Ogilvie Geddies: That for want of a good regulated punch house without the town walls, the European soldiers and seamen purchase from the Bhand\u00e1ris and others strong inflammatory liquors that are highly prejudicial to their health and frequently cause riots and disorders. Your petitioner therefore most humbly prays that your Honour will please to grant him a license for establishing a punch house without the gates for the sale of Batavia and Goa arrack. Such a license, exclusive of the benefit arising to the Honourable Company by greatly increasing their excise, will he hopes be productive of many other public advantages, under such regulations as your Honour may be pleased to establish. That many poor men's lives may be saved by getting more wholesome liquors than they get at present. Your petitioner proposes maintaining at his own expense, a constable to keep the peace in the house; to leave it open only from morning till sunset; and to keep a daily register of all soldiers and seamen who come to the house to be sent every evening to such officer as your Honour may please to direct.\u00b3\n\nAfter consideration the Board observe: As a grant of this petition will not interfere with the lease of the country arrack farm let to the Bhand\u00e1ris, and as we are of opinion many good effects may be experienced therefrom, it is agreed to comply with this petition. The Secretary is accordingly ordered to draw out a set of regulations to be observed by this house and to lay the same before us at our next meeting for our approbation.\u2074\n\nAt a Consultation of the 24th June 1778 the Board read a petition from the Bhand\u00e1ris of Bombay and M\u00e1him setting forth that they were employed on militia duty in Bombay and on S\u00e1lsette from the 10th December 1774 to the 11th of August 1775 by which their\n\n\u00b9 Pub.

In spite of Mr. Geddie's plea for wholesome liquor the adulteration of spirits seems to have continued a serious evil. In July 1788 Mr. Hov\u00e9 (Travels, 142) writes: Mahud\u00fa is a wholesome spirit if not adulterated with the seeds of dh\u00e1ura by which the natives as well as the Europeans are destroyed. If the Company inspected the common liquors more minutely they would not lose half the troops they commonly lose on this side of India.\nfarms suffered considerably and they have become indebted on account of the arrack farm near Rs. 10,000. They also set forth that the allowance for provisions offered to them is not adequate to the time they did duty as it only allowed for the day they mounted guard whereas they were seldom relieved till the evening of the following day whereby they were taken two days from their work. They therefore request that provisions may be allowed for both days. On consideration of this petition resolved that the Bhand\u00e1ris be allowed provision for the day they mounted guard which they are entitled to by their lease and amounts by an account now laid before us to Rs. 3698-1-40. Further as the Bhand\u00e1ris are a useful body of people and deserve encouragement it is agreed to make them an abatement equal to the above sum in lieu of their losses whilst employed on the above service. This we judge a better method of satisfying them than allowing provisions for the day they were on guard and the day they were relieved which would be making a bad precedent. Ordered that the black adjutant of the militia be called upon to account for the money collected from the Bhand\u00e1ris for fines.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 5th January 1780 the Board read the following petition from the Bhand\u00e1ris of Bombay and M\u00e1l\u00edm, to the President and Council: That your Honour's petitioners with the utmost respect humbly beg leave to lay their case before your Honour with a firm hope of meeting with redress. That ever since this island has been under the jurisdiction of the East India Company the Bhand\u00e1ris have proved themselves faithful and good subjects; that they have been instrumental to the increase of the inhabitants of this place and it is notorious that when (1690) the Sid\u00eds invaded Bombay, their forefathers did distinguish themselves in the defence thereof for which they have received repeated marks of favour and countenance from this Government. That so late as when General Wedderburn commanded the forces of this Presidency he upon a knowledge of their services assembled them together and having fixed upon a proper number of the caste for officers he formed a battalion of 800 men who were always ready for service on the shortest notice and were likewise ordered to do duty in different chaukis without the gates for keeping the peace of this island. This service your petitioners always executed to the satisfaction of General Wedderburn, and had he lived to this time, they assure themselves they should have had no reason to have troubled your Honourable Board with this petition. The matter your petitioners have to complain of is their being deprived of the benefits arising from the arrack farm which from time immemorial has always been given to them as a reward for their fidelity to the Honourable Company and for their services as the militia of this island. The present arrack farmer Bayr\u00e1nji Homji, ever since he obtained his lease from your Honour, has injured your petitioners to so excessive a degree that unless your Honourable Board interfere your petitioners must be obliged to quit the jurisdiction of this Government. It was with no little trouble that the Bhand\u00e1ris were induced to come and reside on this island, and\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 74 of 1778, 496 - 498.\nyour petitioners are entirely ignorant of their having deserved the ill treatment they now suffer. The farmer has contracted with your Honour to supply 800 men upon the shortest notice. In this matter your petitioners are manifestly injured as they are by this become the immediate dependants of a Parsi instead of your Honour to whom they have ever looked for protection and for whose service they are always ready whether they are paid for their trouble or not. If it is insisted that your petitioners must attend whenever the Parsi summons, they desire that they may be paid at the rate of Rs. 3\u00bd a month for a private man, a proportionable addition for havaldars and naiks and double that allowance for their superior officers. On these terms and on these terms alone are your petitioners willing to serve under the Parsi. And as he objects to make them this allowance they must request your Honourable Board either to permit of their being relieved from this attendance under him or else oblige him to pay the same during the remainder of his lease. Another matter of complaint that your petitioners have to represent to your Honour is the unjust proceeding of the farmer in having for these four days past stopped them from drawing toddy or selling liquor. By this they are suffering a considerable loss and without a speedy relief must starve. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that these grievances may be taken into your immediate consideration and that when employed the farmer may be obliged to make good the above allowances to them. If your Honour do not think proper to grant them these requests they humbly pray that you will grant them permission to depart from the island as it is impossible for them to maintain their families under such grievances. After reading the above petition the Board deferred its consideration.\n\nA Consultation of the 26th January 1780 records: Reperused the petition from the Bhandaris read last Council day and an answer from the arrack farmer. On consideration of these it is resolved that as the present lease will expire in the month of July next no alteration be made till then. In July we shall consider how far it may be proper to give the Bhandaris a preference in the farm. In the meantime they must continue on the present footing. If any of them should be dissatisfied they will have permission to leave the island.\n\nDuring the thirty years ending 1778 the tobacco revenue rose from Rs. 45,700 in 1748 to Rs. 88,600 in 1773 and then declined to Rs. 61,400 in 1778. The details are:\n\n| Year | Rent |\n|------|------|\n| 1748 | Rs. 45,700 |\n| 1751 | Rs. 46,700 |\n| 1754 | Rs. 48,200 |\n| 1757 | Rs. 56,001 |\n| 1760 | Rs. 67,800 |\n| 1763 | Rs. 75,200 |\n| 1767 | Rs. 65,000 |\n| 1770 | Rs. 80,000 |\n| 1773 | Rs. 88,600 |\n| 1775 | Rs. 52,100 |\n| 1778 | Rs. 61,400 |\n\nAt a Consultation of the 12th July 1757 the Board read the following representation from the native inhabitants at Bombay:\n\n1 Pub. Diary 77 of 1780, 12-14.\n2 Pub. Diary 77 of 1780, 23.\nThe tobacco farmers, vending the very worst tobacco to the prejudice of the subject and the advantage of themselves, serve out the same to sundry shopkeepers to sell at the same rate as it is sold or delivered to them. Though the said shopkeepers have no wages nor any allowance for the rent of their shop or the expense of oil, they are nevertheless paying those charges and maintaining themselves and their families by which it appears they must sell less in weight and consequently give the subject occasion to complain of their exorbitancy. Therefore notice thereof should be taken for the prevention of such abuses and furthermore the three quarters which the farmers receive on each pound of Portugal snuff is a new imposition to the prejudice of the subject, as the small quantity of snuff brought from the other side sells very dear and those who want the said snuff not only buy it very dear but are obliged to pay the said 3 qrs. on each pound. On this the Board pass the following order: Read representation from the native inhabitants requesting some regulations in the tobacco farm. The consideration of this is deferred till we can inspect the leases. Fourteen days later they remark: Reperused the representation from the native inhabitants. On the lease being referred to it appears that all the particulars they complain of are expressly provided against in the lease.\n\nA Consultation of the 19th September 1769 records: The Collector reporting to the Board that he has detected fifteen tindals and lascars selling tobacco in the Marine yard, to the great detriment of the farmer, ordered that the usual fine be levied upon them, and such of them as are unable to pay it be flogged from Gate to Gate.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 7th September 1773, the Board observe: A letter from the Chief at M\u00e1bim is laid before the Board, setting forth that sundry of the principal inhabitants of that district have delivered a petition which he encloses representing that the tobacco brought to market by the present farmer is of a very bad quality and requesting that proper orders may be given to prevent such an abuse. Upon this it is observed that as this is the day fixed for putting up to sale the lease of the tobacco farm, the present lease expiring on the 24th instant, it had been determined to consider what conditions were necessary to be added to the usual articles of the lease for the ease of the people and to prevent any impositions upon them on the part of the farmers. After mature deliberation it is resolved that the following articles shall be added to the lease, as well for the benefit of the people in general, as to secure the Company from any loss by the farmers: That all the tobacco imported by the farmers, shall, after being deposited in their warehouses, be subject to examination by one or more of the European assistants of the Custom Master, with two other principal persons whom the Custom Master may appoint, and if the tobacco shall be found to be rotten or to be mixed with dirt or rubbish, it shall be exported, or in failure therein it shall be burnt. All the shops where the tobacco is retailed shall be subject on complaint being made to the inspection of such persons as the Collector.\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 30 of 1757, 271.\n2 Pub. Diary 30 of 1757, 269, 272.\n3 Pub. Diary 54 of 1769, 673.\nor Custom Master of Bombay or Mahim may appoint. All matters relative to the farm, except complaints from the farmers or from the people against them, shall be decided by the gentlemen who hold those offices. If the tobacco found in the shops of the retailers shall not be equal in goodness to what they received from the farmers, or shall be mixed with dirt or rubbish it shall be burnt, and the retailer not the farmer shall sustain the loss. The farmers shall make good to the retailers the allowance hitherto usual. No abatement will at any time be made to the farmers in the sum for which the farm may be leased under pretence that part of the forces have been sent off the island on service, or because the whole or any part of the sepoys or labourers may be disbanded or discharged. No security for less than Rupees 20,000 will be accepted. In case the persons to whom it may be farmed shall at any time omit, neglect, or plead inability to make good the sum due for the rent of one month till after the rent of another month becomes due, so that two whole monthly payments shall be due at one and the same time, then the farm shall be again put up to sale at public outcry and sold to the highest bidder for the remainder of the term of the lease. And the person who may next take the farm shall make good to the Company, for the term above-mentioned, whatever it may then let for, less than the sum at which it may now be sold. The Board then adjourned to the Court Hall where the merchants and principal people with many others were assembled. The foregoing articles were then explained to them, and they were told that they would be added to the lease with those hitherto usual. The farm was then put up for three years as customary, and after due time it was knocked down at Rs. 90,000 a year, and Ranchhodji Posji was declared the bidder. The Board unanimously deemed Ranchhodji a very improper person to hold the farm, not only because he is considerably indebted to the Company as one of the last farmers and is beside well known to be in very bad circumstances, but also because of the very evil transaction he was guilty of while he was first Purvoe in the Land Pay Office, which was discovered about eighteen months ago as minuted under . . . . . . 1772. The person who had bid last was therefore asked if he was willing to take the farm at the sum he then offered. This he declined. The farm was therefore again put up at Rs. 88,000 a year, and was at length knocked down to Viramset Shivaji, Rangaji Ramset, Vithalset Shivajiset, and Shankarset Babulset at Rs. 88,600 a year being Rs. 8600 a year more than it was last let for. The farmers requesting that our directions for preventing the clandestine importation of tobacco on board cruisers may be renewed, ordered that the Superintendent give strict directions to all the commanders, and to the officers in the marine in command, positively to prevent the importation of tobacco here by any of our vessels under pain, if a commission officer of being absolutely dismissed from the service, if a non-commission officer of being reduced to private, and if a private of such corporal punishment as the Governor, the Second, or the Superintendent may think proper.\n\n1 Pub. Diary 64 of 1773, 625 - 626.\nAt a Consultation of the 28th July 1775, the Board read a petition from the inhabitants of Bombay and Mahim complaining of the badness of the tobacco sold by the present farmer. Upon this it is resolved, in order to prevent the same in future, that in the lease of the farm which is this day going to be put up, it be expressly stipulated that in case any tobacco which may be imported by the farmer shall not be good or saleable that it shall be absolutely burnt by the Bombay or Mahim Custom Master. Also, as the price is stipulated in the lease, if any shopkeepers or retailers in the least exceed the stipulated price they shall on complaint be punished.\n\nThe following statement shows the land revenue at Bombay during the thirty-seven years ending 1781:\n\n| Heads                  | 1744-45 | 1745-46 | 1746-47 | 1747-48 | 1748-49 | 1749-50 | 1750-51 | 1751-52 |\n|------------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Ground and Quit Rent   | Rs.     | Rs.     | Rs.     | Rs.     | Rs.     | Rs.     | Rs.     | Rs.     |\n| Within Wall            | 3430    | 3498    | 3574    | 4086    | 4173    | 4174    | 4211    | 4263    |\n| Without Wall           | 3787    | 3759    | 3623    | 4035    | 4175    | 4236    | 4230    | 4267    |\n| Pension                |         |         |         |         |         |         |         |         |\n| Bombay                 | 4281    | 4281    | 4281    | 4558    | 4308    | 4394    | 4394    | 4390    |\n| Mahim                  | 3255    | 3255    | 3255    | 3255    | 3255    | 3255    | 3255    | 3255    |\n| Coolery                |         |         |         |         |         |         |         |         |\n| Bombay                 | 2045    | 2039    | 2016    | 2016    | 2117    | 2104    | 2085    | 2242    |\n| Mazgaon                | 858     | 860     | 835     | 833     | 838     | 815     | 811     | 809     |\n| Mahim                  |         |         |         |         |         |         |         |         |\n| Salt                   | 4768    | 4796    | 13,552  | 3966    | 14,807  | 10,041  | 1887    | 3181    |\n| Batty Grounds          |         |         |         |         |         |         |         |         |\n| Existing               | 7314    | 6836    | 7763    | 8022    | 7821    | 8894    | 2163    |         |\n| Recovered out of Malabar Breach: |         |         |         |         |         |         |         |         |\n| Within Bombay          | 915     | 917     | 917     | 917     | 1302    | 1361    | 1362    | 1376    |\n| Within Mahim           | 525     | 706     | 706     | 706     | 1204    | 1261    | 1261    | 1281    |\n| Old Woman's Island     | 200     | 200     | 200     | 200     | 200     | 200     | 200     |         |\n| Butcher's Island       | 20      | 20      | 20      | 20      | 20      | 20      | 20      |         |\n| Malabar Hill           |         |         |         |         |         |         |         |         |\n| Tax on the Landed Estate |         |         |         |         |         |         |         |         |\n| Bombay                 |         |         |         |         |         |         |         |         |\n| Mahim                  |         |         |         |         |         |         |         |         |\n| Coconut Oats           |         |         |         |         |         |         |         |         |\n| Miscellaneous          | 2857    | 2851    | 2850    | 2011    | 2215    | 2105    | 2146    | 2798    |\n| Total                  | 34,255  | 33,848  | 43,782  | 35,651  | 47,980  | 44,436  | 29,304  | 29,422  |\n\n1 Pub.

Dr. Da Cunha notices the parallel case of Mrs. Hough's (A.D. 1866) mango tree in Colaba which fruited twice a year, at Christmas and in May. In both cases a severe injury, when the tree was young, is believed to have been the cause of the double flowering and fruiting.\n\nA Government order of the 16th August 1695 to Serjeant Swan runs: I am informed that the goats grazing amongst the young trees that are planted at Sion eat the bark of them and spoil them. Give such orders therefore to the owners of the goats as may prevent the like for the future.\n\nA letter from the Court to Bombay, dated the 20th April 1708, paragraph 66, has the following: The Company's garden to be planted with roots and green trade.\n\nAt a Consultation on the 18th August 1741 the President mentions to the Board that on a representation being made to him that some vacant spaces of ground contiguous to Sion were capable of bearing brab trees, the planting of which would be attended with little expense and in time would produce a revenue to our Honourable Masters, he had given orders for prosecuting such a design which is entirely approved of.\n\nA Consultation of the 3rd April 1741 records: The President on his arrival having given orders that, as milkbush is much required in the composition of gunpowder, the several persons possessed of oarts should fence the same with milkbush. In consequence of some default, he now orders proper persons to inspect and report who had neglected that they may be compelled to a compliance.\n\nA Consultation of the 8th May 1741 continues: The minute of Council of the 3rd April on the President's order for ascertaining the proper places for planting milkbush being reported, it is now (8th May 1741) considered who ought to be at the charge, whether our Honour-\n\n---\n\n1 Dr. G.

As milkbush is so material a part of the composition of gunpowder and is solely designed for that use, we think our Honourable Masters justly should bear the expense. We therefore order that the overseer do immediately proceed to plant the several places both in the districts of M\u0101him and Bombay, and that he keep a separate account of the disbursements thereupon to remain a head on the general books for being cleared as the milkbush is gathered. When the storekeeper receives the milkbush he must value the same and account for it.\n\nA Consultation of the 2nd October 1741 records: The Board read a letter from Mr. John Lambton, General Storekeeper, representing the want of milkbush for carrying on the composition of gunpowder and the impediments he meets with in procuring any from the other side. To remedy this he proposes furnishing a quantity from the northward. The Board adds: In the present conjuncture we are but too well convinced of the indispensable occasion we have for gunpowder as well for supplying the subordinate settlements as for keeping the magazines here sufficiently stocked. As, notwithstanding the utmost care to procure and promote the cultivation of the milkbush, we so far find our efforts ineffectual, to avoid a disappointment it is agreed to signify to Mr. Lambton that we are willing to provide as far as six boat loads from the north in the manner he proposes but that he previously specify the sum that will be required for our final determination.\n\nOn the 29th May 1759 the Board received the following letter from the Collector to the President, dated the 29th May 1759: Enclosed is an order of the Board of so early a standing as the year 1741 regarding the planting of milkbush to which so little regard seems to have been paid that if I may judge from the experience our necessity has this season furnished me with, there is now scarce a month\u2019s provision of that article for making gunpowder growing on the whole island. I request therefore if your Honour judge proper, that the said order may be repeated with a penalty annexed to be incurred by the person who fails paying due obedience to it. And that your Honour will authorize me to employ proper persons to see that the same is punctually carried into execution as well as to plant milkbush round the Company\u2019s oarts and such other waste spots of ground as may be judged fittest for the purpose on the setting in of the expected rains.\n\nOn the above letter on the 29th May 1759 the Board order: The growth of milkbush must be enforced and encouraged by issuing a publication informing all persons that the Collector will be obliged to receive whatever quantities are tendered him fit for the Honourable Company\u2019s service at the current price it may bear; and inflicting a penalty of Rs. 10 on the proprietor of every oart who any longer neglects fencing them therewith; and planting it in all vacant spaces on this island conformable to the resolution of Council under the 8th May 1741. The Collector must appoint proper people to see that\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 14 of 1740-41, 176 - 177.\n2 Pub. Diary 14 of 1740-41, 392.\n3 Pub.

He is also ordered to plant milkbush round all the Honourable Company's oarts and such other waste spots of ground as may be judged fittest for it on the setting in of the expected rains.\n\nIn 1750 Mr. Grose writes of Bombay crops: The land is chiefly employed in cocoanut groves or oarts, rice fields, and onion grounds. Of these the most considerable property are the oarts. Many together form groves with shaded roads and pathways thick set with houses but wanting in air. An owner of 200 trees is reckoned to have a competency. Not a spot remains untilled. There are also here and there interspersed a few brab trees or rather wild palm trees that bear an insipid kind of fruit about the bigness of a common pear, but the chief profit from them is the toddy or liquor drawn from them by incisions at the top, of which the arrack that is made is reckoned better than that from the cocoanut trees. They are generally near the sea-side as they delight most in a sandy soil. It is on this tree that the toddy-birds make their exquisitely curious nests.\n\nA Consultation of the 26th June 1764 has the following entry: Bhendi (Hibiscus populnea) wood being extremely useful and now become very scarce upon the island, it is ordered that all owners of oarts be required to plant five bhendi trees for every 100 cocoanut trees they are possessed of.\n\nOn the 21st February 1777 the Court write to Bombay: The society established here for the encouragement of arts manufactures and commerce having transmitted to us a paper setting forth their desire to promote the important cultivation of the bread fruit tree and describing the places where the same is to be found in the East Indies, we enclose you a few copies of that paper and particularly recommend it to you on your own part and by every communication to make the laudable intentions of the society as diffusively known as possible that the introduction of so valuable an article into this kingdom may be speedily effected.\n\nThe following are among the few references to animals that have been noted in the records:\n\nOn the 11th November 1677 Bombay writes to Surat: The Carmania goats are all dead. Some of the spotted deer we shall send home by the Europe ships if they touch here.\n\nThe Court on the 20th July 1683 write: We know not what to think of Stowe horses in regard you have so good ones so near as Persia.

As we are assured we can have a sufficient supply of cattle from the Sidis' country and that this tax will be an annual emolument to the Right Honourable Company, it is ordered that the Secretary prepare a proclamation forbidding all persons to kill any cows belonging to the Gentus and directing the heads of each caste to collect Rs. 4 a head a year on all cattle belonging to them and pay the same to the Collector of the revenues.

The President informing us that about 200 head have been purchased at Scindy by his directions, the Success and Defence ketches are appointed to go for them, and the Chief and Factors at Surat must be directed in our next to enquire of the Resident at Cambay whether cattle cannot be provided there; and that in case of his having any prospect of succeeding, we shall send conveyances to bring them directly hither.\\(^2\\)\n\nOn the 16th April 1762, paragraph 88, the Court write: Notwithstanding our former orders with regard to Fort Victoria, yet from your representation that you are certain of getting such large supplies of live cattle from thence, so essentially necessary both for the men-of-war and for our people, we must leave it to you either to keep or exchange it as you may judge best for our interest. If any advantage can be made by the sale of salt and supplying the island with billet-wood, it will be more useful than we have hitherto had reason to imagine it would have been.\\(^3\\)\n\nAt a Consultation on the 16th July 1765 the Board read a letter from the Resident at Fort Victoria desiring to know what number of cattle he should provide in the ensuing season. The Board remark: The consumption of our marine being between 500 and 600 head of cattle in a season the Resident must be ordered to provide that number. He must take particular care to have them good as complaints have been made of those provided last season turning out very deficient in weight.\\(^4\\)\n\nA Consultation of the 10th November 1772 records: The factors at Scindy must send hither as many head of cattle as they can procure or the Speaker can take on board.

As this practice is beneficial to the natives, and not so offensive to the people as to prejudice their healths, we think it may continue till his Honour the President (Mr. Aungier) this season, upon better information or his own experience, find to the contrary.\\(^1\\)\n\nAbout the same time, 1673, Dr. Fryer while speaking of the climate of Bombay writes: The climate is extremely unhealthy, at first thought to be caused by bubsho (buckshaw), rotten fish; but though that be prohibited, yet it continues as mortal.\\(^2\\)\n\nIn a letter of the 20th April 1708 the Court write to the Bombay Government: The buckshawing or dunging the toddy trees with fish, occasions in a great measure the unwholesomeness of the Bombay air. Of this the venomous and putrid buckshaw fly which swarm in such abundance as to be very nauseous to the inhabitants is a plain proof. If the trees were not buckshawed, the loss of their fruitfulness would be repaid by the general benefit of rendering the place healthy. Or if the buckshaw was laid at a sufficient depth under the earth to prevent its corruption and infecting the air and breeding that fly, the air would not suffer. Another cause of the unhealthy air is the thickness of the toddy trees at Warli and Mahim woods which hinders the land breeze that sets in every morning from cleansing the air and cooling the ground. If those woods were thinned, the remaining trees would bear the better. For the sake of their health the people are contented their rents be diminished by cutting some trees down and prohibiting the buckshawing the rest. By this means the health of the inhabitants will be promoted.\\(^3\\)\n\nAt a Consultation the 1st May 1724 the Board read a petition from the inhabitants whose estates are situated between the Company\u2019s garden and the town wall setting forth that, since the prohibition of fish, they have manured their grounds and palmeiras with several sorts of dung. None affords them any benefit, rather the contrary. Since the disuse of fish some of their trees decay away suddenly in their full strength. And as no offensive smell or prejudice to the air or water has been found during the two years since the use of coot that is kuta or fish manure has been again allowed, they humbly request that they may be allowed to use kuta to all palm trees outside of the town wall. On this the Board observe: This being debated and considered of, and what they affirm appearing to most of us to be fact, it is agreed for the present to tolerate the use of dried fish, so far as the Portuguese church in\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Surat Fact.

Directed that public notice be given thereof accordingly. On the 8th of May the vereadores attending without doors, are at their request called in when they return the Board their humble thanks for the further liberty of manuring the trees with kuta to the limit of the Portuguese church, assuring us that without the use of kuta their trees must have totally decayed.\n\nAt a Consultation on the 16th February 1733 the President lays before the Board a petition from sundry Kulambis that cultivate the Honourable Company's batty ground and work in the salt-pans. The petitioners a few days since deserted their habitations and fled to the island of Salsette. They set forth that through the prohibition of manuring their lands with kuta or dried fish and for want of straw or hay to burn their grounds before seed time, the land did not produce so much as when they were permitted to make use of the said manure; and that for want of the same, they are entirely prevented from raising of melons cucumbers and other green trade, which, they pretend, will not grow without making use of kuta. They likewise desire that in lieu of the usual toka or estimate, we would accept of one half of what the lands do actually produce, according to the survey and calculate made by the vereadores. Taking the same into consideration, it is observed that this stratagem of absenting themselves has been a common practice of the Kulambis of this island as well as of those in the Portuguese territories, whenever they have attempted to obtain any favour or abatement. As we think it is no ways convenient to give way to such practices, it is resolved that the President in answer to the said petition, do signify to them that when they apply in a proper place and manner, they shall be heard what they have to plead in support of their request; but that we cannot allow them any such hearing while they continue in a foreign jurisdiction.\n\nOn the 3rd December 1736 the Board received the following petition from the fazandars of oarts and batty grounds, inhabitants of Bombay and Mahim: That for above four years past, the manure of kuta or small dry fish for the said oarts and batty grounds has been prohibited, and that the trees cannot produce fruit, or thrive grow or benefit by any other sort of manure. As their produce daily decreases so as to have arrived at the last extremity of ruin to the great loss of your petitioners who have made sundry humble representations and now again presume to lay before your Honour with all submission and humility their same deplorable case and ruin. In this ruin the interest of the Honourable Company is much concerned by the great loss they suffer in their oart lands. To demonstrate the good inclination these petitioners ever had to serve and advance the Honourable Company's interest from their own free goodwill and of their own accord, they take liberty to offer\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 2 of 1724, 57-58. Forrest's Home Series, II. 36.\n2 Pub. Diary 2 of 1724, 61.\n3 Pub. Diary 5 of 1732, 33, 47-48. Forrest's Home Series, II. 49-50.\nRs. 1000 yearly above the pension they now pay, in such a proportion respectively as it may be convenient to have the same collected; and entreat of your Honour to accept of this voluntary offer of your petitioners of such an addition to the Honourable Company's revenue on condition of being permitted the use of kuta for the manure of the oarts and batty grounds belonging to your petitioners. Wherefore your petitioners humbly beseech of your Honour to take into consideration the premises and in your great goodness to grant them remedy therein.\n\nOn the same day, 3rd December 1736, the President acquaints the Board that the fazandars had frequently requested of him permission to use kuta, and in order to obtain his consent had promised to make him a voluntary gift of Rs.8000. This he always declined. But now he declares that if, upon considering the premises, the Board shall adjudge it proper to allow the use of the said manure, he will pay the money into the Company's treasury and wait their orders for the disposal of it. The affair being now taken into consideration and recourse being had to our Honourable Masters' orders as well as to what has been written home from hence relating thereto, it is observed that though in their letter of the 12th March 1730, paragraph 72, our Honourable Masters seemed inclinable to permit the continuance of the use of this manure, yet in their letter of the 7th March 1733, in answer to our letters of the 12th September 1731 and the 22nd January 1732, they would not consent to grant a license to make use of kuta forever; because it was thought it infected the air and occasioned distempers amongst the inhabitants. At the same time in their last commands they are pleased to leave this matter entirely to us saying 'they would by no means press the cultivating the grounds by an unwholesome manure, kuta having been frequently represented as prejudicial in that respect by some, and as often set in a more favourable light by others who are perfect judges of the matter.' We believe that for want of this manure the produce of the several oarts and batty grounds upon the island is considerably decreased. At the same time it is observed that since the prohibition of the manure, the island has been healthier than heretofore. It is the general opinion of the English and other inhabitants who are not interested in oarts and batty grounds that the use of fish manure is prejudicial to the health of the inhabitants. Indeed it seems reasonable to believe that the surface of the earth being covered with fish, when it comes to rot, it must occasion a very nauseous and unwholesome smell and taint the water which partly runs into wells without sinking into the earth. On the whole as our Honourable Masters have been pleased to express an unwillingness to press the use of any unwholesome manure, and as we cannot but be of opinion that kuta falls under that denomination, we doubt not but they will prefer the healths of the inhabitants of the island to the profit themselves and other proprietors of lands might make by the use of kuta. Therefore it is agreed that for the present the prohibition thereof now in force be confirmed; but the case be represented to our Honourable Masters for their final determination.\n\n1 Pub. Diary 9 of 1736, 474-475. 2 Pub. Diary 9 of 1736, 472-473.\nOn the 17th June 1737, the Board received the following petition of sundry inhabitants of Bombay and Mahim, proprietors of carts and lands in the district of Mahim: That your petitioners humbly hope their importunity in presuming to trouble your Honours afresh on the matter of this petition, will be tenderly considered and excused in regard to the extreme necessity and imminent loss and ruin of your petitioners' estates and families. The grievance and cause of all this complaint your petitioners humbly represent to be the total prohibition and suppression of the kuta manure. Your petitioners, as the same affected them so nearly, naturally acquainted themselves with the reasons of this order which they find to be an apprehension that the said manure affects both the air and water, and consequently must be detrimental to the health of the inhabitants of Bombay particularly the English; for as to the natives your petitioners never understood they were affected thereby, as the bills of mortality regularly kept in every parish will easily demonstrate. The justice and prevalence of this reason and motive of the prohibition, your petitioners dutifully acquiesce in. Nor do they offer here any argument in competition with the health of the English gentlemen and inhabitants which is so justly the concern of the Government. The end and intent of your petitioners in this present address is to represent humbly to this Honourable Board how your petitioners can, as they apprehend, be relieved in this great distress with little or no risk absolutely to the public in the article of health, which your petitioners esteem the sole and only obstacle to this their humble request. This benefit then sued for, may and will be obtained by your Honours confining the prohibition of this manure only to Bombay and places more immediately in the neighbourhood of any considerable number of English inhabitants; and permitting the same to be used with discretion or under the strictest regulation in the district of Mahim, where the ground is much poorer and more in want of the assistance of manure than at Bombay; and with the waters of which your petitioners believe it will not be disputed that no kuta or manure whatever applied to the trees or lands at Mahim can have any intercourse or in the least affect them. Neither can the air at such a distance have any influence or at least any considerable influence on the residents of Bombay. Neither can permission given to use the kuta at Mahim be of any encouragement to those concerned in the lands at Bombay to move for and solicit the same indulgence for that district, since the consideration of the health of the English inhabitants will be forever a bar to that manure, when the health of the English cannot be so much as mentioned in opposition to the request of the toleration of fish manure at Mahim. Your petitioners likewise represent humbly to this Honourable Board that the trees are already so impoverished and daily diminished in their bearing that without a speedy remedy they will be too far gone in decay to be recovered by any means. And without this remedy which can be obtained only from the tender consideration of the Government of this their deplorable case, all the labourers, the fazandars, the Hartalons (Oartmen), Bhandaris, Fishermen, Corunbees (Kunbis), and Phrases (Faras or Sweepers) employed or concerned in the culture of their land, must see their property and their chiefest\nif not only means of sustenance decay away to nothing, and that without the comfort of knowing any one valuable reason for their sufferings and entire ruin. If, when your petitioners shall represent to this Honourable Board that for want of this manure their oarts are fallen almost two-thirds of their value, it shall be said that the loss and damage are aggravated, an abstract drawn from the Honourable Company's own actual share in the public sufferings will clearly demonstrate its truth. By this calculation it will appear that exclusive of charges the Company's estate, two-thirds whereof are in the district of Mahim, does not now yield two per cent clear, which is a notable diminution of their usual profit. Further the securities to the Bank by mortgage for money taken up upon the landed estates at a value far higher than the amount of the respective loans, are actually fallen short to the loss and damage of the Bank, which had been seemingly so well secured. Your petitioners then humbly hope your Honours will accept favourably this their supplication, in the success of which the welfare of such a number of inhabitants is so nearly concerned. They humbly apprehend that the greater barrenness and sterility of the soil at Mahim and its distance from the residence of any number of English inhabitants may give some weight to this their suit; in the granting of which likewise this Government will indisputably confer a great and universal benefit, encourage the poorer inhabitants, and give the strongest proofs of the care and protection of its subjects without at the same time incurring the hazard of one single inconvenience or damage to the public in their healths or otherwise; all which is humbly submitted to the wisdom and prudence of this Honourable Board. And your petitioners as in duty bound shall ever pray.\n\nThe petition contains the following abstract of the produce of the, Honourable Company's oarts at Bombay and Mahim from 1727 to 1736 inclusive:\n\nBombay and Mahim Oarts produced cocoanuts in 1727, 599,000; 1728, 643,900; 1729, 718,400; 1730, 787,200; 1731, 797,200. This shows they increased annually and that the difference in the produce between 1727 and 1731 is 198,600 nuts.\n\nBombay and Mahim Oarts produced cocoanuts in 1732, 656,900; 1733, 568,900; 1734, 583,500; 1735, 472,900; 1736, 453,100. This shows how gradually they have decreased since the year 1731 and that the produce of 1736 was 344,500 nuts less than in 1731. Increase from 1727 to 1731 is 198,600; decrease from 1731 to 1736 is 344,500; decrease from 1727 to 1736 is 145,900.\n\nOn the same day, the 17th June 1737, the Board record: As we have already represented this affair so fully to our Honourable Masters for their final determination, we can now do nothing more than refer the merits of the petition to them. At the same time we are inclined to believe that though the use of kuta in the parts about Mahim would not affect the water at Bombay, yet that it would so far infect the air as to create a nauseous scent that would be prejudicial to the healths of the inhabitants, the English in particular, which our Honourable Masters have been pleased not to put to hazard.\n\n1 Pub. Diary 10 of 1736-37, 137-139.\nfor the sake of the advantage that might accrue to them by the difference of the produce of their oarts.\n\nAt a Consultation on the 27th January 1739 the President produces a Portuguese petition from the principal inhabitants, landowners of Bombay and Mahim, setting forth the inevitable ruin of themselves and families by the entire prohibition of kuta manure, and praying consideration and relief of their grievance in this article. The Board observing that this application has been often repeated, the matter of which deserves the greatest caution and deliberation as it concerns the lives and health of the inhabitants and especially of the Europeans, and nothing new pressing for the present to conclude for or against in this affair, agreed that the petition lie upon the table and the consideration of it be deferred till the arrival of the next ship from Great Britain, when it may be effectually resumed, and the petitioners be made acquainted with our final determination thereon.\n\nAt a Consultation on the 30th May 1739 the Board read a petition from the fazandars and proprietors of the landed estates at Mahim, praying the Government's repeal of their prohibition of the use of kuta for manure. As this request contains matter wherein the lives and healths of the inhabitants are supposed to be concerned, agreed that we take time to consider duly of the same before we come to a determination; and that in the meantime the petition be ordered to lie on the table.\n\nAt a Consultation on the 2nd October 1739 the President acquaints the Board that the landowners on this island have made pressing applications to him for relief on their petitions for restoring kuta manure. After a full discussion of the merits of the petition the Board record the opinion that any peremptory resolution in the negative, would greatly discontent and discourage the numbers that are concerned and particularly the poorer sort of inhabitants, whom it is their interest to maintain and cherish whilst their neighbours, the Marathas, are endeavouring to seduce them to the other side in order to people their new conquests. They therefore agree the petition lie on the table, and assurance be given of taking it into consideration at a proper opportunity.\n\nOn the 22nd February 1742 the Board read a petition in the Portuguese language from the fazandars or owners of cocoanut trees on this island, setting forth the great loss they sustain in their estates and how much they are impoverished since the prohibition of manuring with kuta, and offering a sum of Rs. 10,000 to our Honourable Masters provided the prohibition may be taken off. The consideration of this petition is deferred till another time.\n\nThe petitioners seem to have gained little by the delay. In 1750 Mr. Grose writes: Formerly there obtained a practice, esteemed very pernicious to the health of the inhabitants, of employing a\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 10 of 1736-37, 135-136.\n2 Pub.

It was undoubtedly of great service both to augment and meliorate their produce; but, through its quantity being superficially laid in trenches round the root and consequently the easier to be exhaled, it diffused, as it putrefied, a very unwholesome vapour.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 28th August 1765 the Board read a petition from the Kunbis requesting permission to make use of dry buckshaw for the manure of their batty grounds which they cannot cultivate without. As this sort of buckshaw seems not prejudicial to the health of the inhabitants, it is agreed, notwithstanding the publication against it, to permit of the Kunbis using dry buckshaw for manure, but not wet upon any account. The proprietors of dry fish must accordingly be permitted to sell it to the inhabitants for that purpose.\n\nA Consultation of the 28th October 1766 records: As it appears a bad use has been made of the indulgence granted to the inhabitants in August 1765 of manuring their grounds with buckshaw, resolved that a publication be issued prohibiting in the most peremptory terms the use of this manure whether wet or dry; and that none be made on the island but on the places expressly allotted for that purpose.\n\nA Consultation of the 2nd June 1767 has the following entry: Read a petition from the Kunbis desiring to be allowed to make use of buckshaw for manuring their batty grounds or to give the Honourable Company half the produce of said grounds in batty instead of paying a stated toka. This last, being conformable to the practice of proprietors of private grounds, is agreed to for the ensuing year, as we can by no means consent to their making use of buckshaw for manure.\n\nOn the 26th June 1767 the Board read a petition from the village farmers representing that if we continue in our resolution of collecting half the produce of batty from the Kunbis instead of the usual toka as stipulated in their respective leases, they will sustain a very great loss. They therefore request we will either revoke said order or accept of their leases back. This being taken into consideration and their leases referred to, there appears an express article therein that the usual toka shall be collected from the Kunbis. We therefore cannot refuse to comply with the request of the farmers for revoking our order of the 2nd instant in favour of the Kunbis, though we shall hereafter take into consideration their claim for redress on account of the prohibition of the use of kuta, when we are able to judge with certainty of the present year\u2019s crop of batty. At the same time we cannot but remark the same prohibition was in force when the villages were let out and had always before been so.\n\n---\n\n1 Grose's Voyage to the East Indies, I. 31.\n2 Pub.

Diary 49 of 1767, 399-400.\nA Consultation of the 14th September 1770 records: Notwithstanding the strictest prohibition against using kuta or buckshaw, whether wet or dry, as manure, information has lately been given to the President of six persons who have been detected guilty of this very pernicious practice. Reference is therefore had to the last publication on this subject by which we find the penalty to be forfeiture of the grounds so manured. As on consultation forfeiture of land appears to be too severe, it is agreed to levy a fine of Rs. 50 for the first offence and Rs. 100 for every other\u2014half to the Honourable Company and half to the informers. A publication to this effect is to be issued accordingly.\n\nIn spite of this penalty the practice did not cease. In August 1787 the Polish traveller Dr. Hov\u00e9 says: Dr. Scott informed me the people of M\u00e1him often manure their plantations with putrefied fish which renders the air unwholesome to those that live in it. Not an instance is known of a European recovering of a fever if he has contracted it in these woods.\n\nOn the 28th June 1728 the Board observe: A petition from the mh\u00e1t\u00e1ras and Kunbis of Parel and other villages within that district being presented to the Board, praying we would relieve them by letting them have a loan of batty for transplanting during this time of scarcity, agreed that the warehouse-keeper advance them twelve mud\u00e1s provided the Portuguese receiver will oblige himself to see the same recovered at the gathering in the ensuing crop.\n\nOn the 4th October the Board observe: The scarcity of grain from all appearance being likely to continue in these parts, agreed that we give directions to our Resident at Onor to purchase 5000 bales of Champa rice at Mangalor; and that by the first opportunity of our cruisers, we send them Rs. 10,000 to pay for the same.\n\nA Consultation of the 10th December 1731 records: An estimate of the produce of the Honourable Company\u2019s batty grounds in possession of the Kunbis as well as of those under the direction of the overseer of the Company\u2019s oats made by the vereadores and mh\u00e1t\u00e1ras of Bombay, is brought in by the under-receiver of the rents and revenues. From this estimate it appears that through want of rain last season the whole produce of the said batty grounds did amount to no more than 361 mud\u00e1s 12 phar\u00e1s and 9 adholis, which fall short of the usual toka or estimate paid by the Kunbis by 71 mud\u00e1s 8 phar\u00e1s and 17 adholis. The Kunbis plead that they have nothing to support themselves and families save the produce of those grounds by them manured and cultivated. They therefore request that we would grant them the same indulgence that has been always customary on such occasions when through want of rain the grounds have not produced the toka or quantity they are valued in. This indulgence we find on examination has been to accept of the moiety of the real produce of the lands granting the other half to the Kunbis for their labour.\n\n---\n\n1 Pub.

The vereadores having examined thereinto report it to be as follows:\n\n| Batty Grounds | Mud\u00e1s | ph. | ad. |\n|---------------|-------|-----|-----|\n| Parel         | ...   | 46  | 3   |\n| Vadala        | ...   | 14  | 18  |\n| N\u00e1gaon        | ...   | 13  | 21  |\n| Suri          | ...   | 4   | 11  |\n| Bombay        | ...   | 10  | 6   |\n\nTotal .. 89 11 17\n\nAs it has always been customary in a bad year for the Honourable Company to make an abatement of the toka, it is agreed that half the above loss mud\u00e1s 44-18-8\u00bd be on the Company's account. And it is ordered that, to that amount, the receivers of the several districts deduct from the usual toka.\n\nA Consultation of the 10th April 1736 records: The Kunbis representing that the batty grounds last year (1735) produced considerably less than the usual toka and humbly requesting that the Honourable Company may bear their proportion of the loss, and the vereadores having examined into the same, it appears by their report that the said batty grounds fell short of their usual produce by mud\u00e1s 139 adholis 14 and sers 13 as follows:\n\n| Mud\u00e1s | ph. | ad. |\n|-------|-----|-----|\n| Parel | ... | 59  | 12  |\n| Vadala| ... | 18  | 2   |\n| Suri  | ... | 4   | 6   |\n| N\u00e1gaon| ... | 27  | 18  |\n| Colte | ... | 17  | 15  |\n| M\u00e1tunga| ... | 4   | 18  |\n| Bombay| ... | 7   | 16  |\n\nTotal .. 139 14 13\n\nAs it has been always customary for the Honourable Company to bear their proportion of such loss, it is agreed that this indulgence be allowed the Kunbis, and the receiver is accordingly directed to deduct it out of the usual annual toka.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 12th February 1737 the Board record: The vereadores and mhat\u00e1r\u00e1s of Bombay and Mahim having enquired into the produce of the Honourable Company's batty grounds for the last year (1736) and made their report that the same falls 427 mud\u00e1s 19 ph.\n\n---\n\n1 Pub.

As both these causes of loss are notoriously known to be true, and as it has ever been customary to relieve the Kunbis on these occasions, it is agreed that the Honourable Company bear half the loss. It is accordingly directed that the receiver deduct one-half in his accounts when he gathers in the toka from the Kunbis.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 18th January 1738 the President acquaints the Board that having ordered the vereadores and mhat\u00e1ras to make enquiry into the produce of the Honourable Company's batty ground in the sundry villages in the district of Mahim the last year (1737) they delivered him a report thereof which he now lays before the Board. By this it appears that instead of the usual toka of 450 mud\u00e1s 1 ph. 19\u00bd ad., which is esteemed half the produce of the said grounds in a good season, their real half produce the last year is no more than 74 mud\u00e1s 15 ph. 2 ad. We are very sensible that the whole crop was entirely burnt up for want of rain and that the Kunbis are near ruined by the great loss they will sustain. It has ever been customary to relieve the Kunbis in a bad season by accepting half the real produce of the grounds in lieu of the toka, and it would fall particularly hard on them should we insist on their paying more now. It is therefore agreed that we accept half the real produce of the grounds, and directed the proper order be issued to the receiver.\n\nA Consultation of the 2nd January 1742 records: As it has been always customary, when they fall short of their usual produce, to relieve the Kunbis who cultivate the Honourable Company's batty grounds by receiving such part of the toka only as the vereadores and mhat\u00e1ras esteem reasonable; and as, by an estimation now (2nd January 1742) before us, the share appears to be no more than 49 ph. and 10 sers, it is agreed that the said account be sent to the Collector with an order to pay a due regard thereto.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 11th February 1743 the Board observe: According to a custom that has hitherto been allowed of making an abatement in the toka or ordinary half produce of the batty grounds in case of a bad season, a signed account by the vereadores as usual on such occasions is presented in respect to certain parcels of ground lying in Bombay, the half produce or toka of which has been rated at mud\u00e1s 13-23-14\u00bd. But the last (1742) season being unkind, the said toka amounted to no more than mud\u00e1s 4-7-14; whence the Kunbis who cultivated those grounds are, according to custom, answerable for that quantity only. As allowances of this nature appear frequently on the registers the Board must accept the loss. At the same time, as it may not be proper to rely solely on the vereadores, it is directed that in future the Collector of the revenues, with such persons as he shall call to his assistance, accompany the\n\n---\n\n1 Pub.

The toka or half produce which ought to be received in a good season is fixed at mud\u00e1s 450-1-17-2-1; but by this account it will be no more than . . . . . . So large a deficiency had occasioned the President to enquire of such as were esteemed proper judges and who were possessors of batty grounds, what they thought reasonable; among whom one alleged half the established toka ought to be received and the rest in general agreed it ought to be three-fifths. As the vereadores are annually chosen by the inhabitants and sworn into office, it would seem harsh to reject their report delivered under the solemnness of an oath; therefore for the present it is admitted as hitherto. At the same time as, from the continuance of such a method, our Honourable Masters\u2019 property can never be on any certainty, it is directed that the Collector of the revenues acquaint the Kunbis who now cultivate the Company\u2019s batty grounds, that unless they engage to deliver in future the whole of the established toka, the said grounds will be rented to others which probably may be found preferable to the condition they are now let upon.\u00b2\n\nA Consultation of the 16th January 1747 has the following entry: The account, \u2018Warehouse Remains,\u2019 shows that the greatest part of the goods which were disposed of at the last sale are still uncleared. This failure to clear the goods is occasioned partly by the excessive dearness of grain all over the country partly by the want of forage on the road for the cattle that carry goods up-country which we hear was the sole obstacle to Niz\u00e1m-ul-mulk\u2019s army going this year towards Surat. It is agreed that the sale of the Honourable Company\u2019s goods noticed in the Consultation of the 23rd ultimo be deferred till the 23rd March next.\u00b3\n\nOn the 13th October 1747 the Board received the following letter from the Collector Mr. Byfeld: For want of the latter rain towards the end of last season (1746) the deficiency in the crop of batty was so great as to render it impracticable for me to recover that old outstanding debt. As the present season (1747) has hitherto been very favourable with a prospect of a fine harvest, I have great hopes of reducing this debt considerably, having obliged the Kunbis to pass an obligation for the clearance of it, in which they have mortgaged their houses and grounds for the due performance of the same. As the receiving money for what they were deficient of their last year\u2019s toka prevented them getting further in debt, I humbly presume the same methods may be taken with them this season should they not be able to clear the same in species. All which is humbly submitted to your Honour.\u2074\n\nAt a Consultation of the 9th March 1749 the Board order: Accounts delivered by the Collector of the rents and revenues show that the\n\n\u00b9 Pub.

On which account the Kunbis request an abatement in their toka, which, as is usual on such occasions, having been examined into by proper people, is agreed to and directed that the Collector have an order to receive from the Kunbis only 211 mud\u00e1s 3 ph. instead of mud\u00e1s 434-1-4-1\u00bd their stipulated toka in favourable seasons.\n\nIn 1750 Mr. Grose writes: The bulk of the land proprietors were Roman Catholic Mestizos and Canarins. The first are a mixed breed of the natives and Portuguese; the other purely aborigines of the country, converted to what the Portuguese call the faith. The other landowners were Moors Gentus and P\u00e1rsis; but these last are of moderner date, having since purchased on the island. The land is chiefly employed in cocoanut-groves or carts, rice-fields, and onion-grounds, which are reckoned of an excellent sort on this island. The cocoanut-groves or carts make the most considerable part of the landed property, being planted wherever the situation and soil are favourable to them. When a number of these groves lie contiguous to each other, they form what is called The Woods, through which there is a due space left for roads and pathways. They are also thick-set with houses and huts. They are, however, reckoned unwholesome for want of a free ventilation. The cultivation of the cocoanut-tree is extremely easy, by means of channels conveying water to the roots, and by a manure laid round them. An owner of two hundred of these trees is reckoned to have a competency to subsist on.\n\nOn the 28th October 1755 the Board read a petition from the farmers of the Honourable Company's villages, with one from the Kunbis setting forth their loss occasioned by the unusual drought, and praying relief. As any clause of this kind was purposely omitted in their several contracts at the time the villages were farmed to them, and as they were particularly acquainted that our Honourable Masters should not be subject to any such application, but that the farmers must reap the advantage or suffer the inconvenience resulting therefrom, and as on this account the farms were let out for the term of seven years, it is resolved that their petitions be rejected.\n\nAbout 1766 Mr. Forbes writes regarding Bombay supplies: From being situated only a few miles from the Mar\u00e1tha shores or still nearer the fertile island of S\u00e1lsette the markets are daily supplied from thence with all the necessaries of life; for so circumscribed, so rocky, and so unequal is the surface of Bombay itself that in one year it produces a sufficiency of grain to supply its population for six weeks only. Yet each spot that will admit of cultivation and is not occupied by houses is sown with rice or planted with cocoanut trees which in extensive woods lend their friendly shade to thousands of neat cottages and form delightful rides, impervious to a tropical sun.\n\n---\n\n1 Pub.

As this was never our intention, the Chief and factors must suffer him only to take the same consideration that was allowed by the inhabitants to the Maratha government (if any such there was) and the most public notice must be given of this order in the Bandra district, that the Korumbis (Kunbis) may as formerly be encouraged to cultivate vegetables so essentially necessary to the inhabitants of this island.\n\nOf the great famine of 1803 Mr. Forbes writes in his Oriental Memoirs: What infinite advantage, what incalculable benefits must accrue from a wise and liberal administration over those extensive realms which now form a part of the British Empire, is not for me to discuss. What immense good was done by the wise policy of the Bombay Government alone during a late famine we learn from the address of Sir James Mackintosh to the Grand Jury of that island in 1804. No other language than his own can be adopted on this interesting subject. It indirectly points out the object I have often mentioned: The amelioration of the natives of India by the introduction of religion laws art science and civilization in their best and most comprehensive sense. This upright and able Magistrate, after descanting upon famine in general, enters into the particulars of that in the Konkan occasioned by a partial failure of the periodical rains in 1802 and from a more complete failure in 1803, from whence, he says: A famine has arisen in the adjoining provinces of India, especially in the Maratha territories, which I shall not attempt to describe and which I believe no man can truly represent to the European public without the hazard of being charged with extravagant and incredible fiction. Some of you have seen its ravages. All of you have heard accounts of them from accurate observers. I have only seen the fugitives who have fled before it and have found an asylum in this island. But even I have seen enough to be convinced that it is difficult to overcharge a picture of Indian desolation. I shall now state from authentic documents what has been done to save these territories from the miserable condition of the neighbouring country. From the 1st of September 1803 to the present time, October 1804, there have been imported or purchased by Government 414,000 bags of rice and there remain 180,000 bags contracted for which are yet to arrive; forming an aggregate of nearly 600,000 bags and amounting to the value of 50 lakhs of rupees or \u00a3600,000 sterling. During the same time there have been imported by private merchants 480,000 bags of rice, making in all an importation of a million of bags and amounting in value to one million pounds sterling. The effects of this importation on the population of our territories it is not very difficult to estimate. The population of Bombay, Salsette, Karanja, and of the City of Surat I designedly underestimate at 400,000. I am entitled to presume that if they had continued subject to native governments they would have shared the\n\n1 Pub. Diary 68 of 1775, 914-915.\nfate of the neighbouring provinces which still are so subject. I shall not be suspected of any tendency towards exaggeration by any man who is acquainted with the state of the opposite continent when I say that in such a case an eighth of that population must have perished. 50,000 human beings have therefore been saved from death in its most miserable form by the existence of a British Government in this island. I conceive myself entitled to take credit for the whole benefits of the importation for that which was imported by private merchants as well as for that which was directly imported by the Government, seeing that, except for the British Government, the commercial capital and credit would not have existed by which the private importation was effected.\n\nThe next particular which I have to state relates to those unhappy refugees who have found their way into our territory. From the month of March to the present month of October, such of them as could labour have been employed in useful public works and have been fed by Government. The monthly average of these persons since March is 9125 in Bombay, 3162 in Salsette, and in Surat a considerable number though from that city I have seen no exact returns. But many of these miserable beings are, on their arrival here, wholly unable to earn their subsistence by any the most moderate labour. They expire on the road before they can be discovered by the agents of our charity. They expire in the very act of being carried to the place where they are to receive relief. To obviate or at least to mitigate these dreadful evils a Humane Hospital was established by Government for the relief of those immigrants who were unable to labour. The monthly average of those who have been received since March into this hospital is 1030 in Bombay, about 100 in Salsette, and probably 300 at Surat. I myself visited this hospital in company with my excellent friend Dr. Scott, and I witnessed a scene of which the impression will never be effaced from my mind. The average monthly mortality of the establishment is dreadful; it amounts to 480. At first sight this would seem to argue some monstrous defects in the plan or management of the institution. And if there were great defects in so new an establishment, hastily provided against so unexampled an evil, those who are accustomed to make due allowance for human frailty would find more to lament than to blame in such defects. But when it is considered that almost all these deaths occur in the first four or five days after admission and that scarcely any disease has been observed among the patients but the direct effects of famine, we shall probably view the mortality as a proof of the deplorable state of the patients rather than of any defects in the hospital, and instead of making the hospital answerable for the deaths we shall deem it entitled to credit the life of every single survivor. Those who know me will need no assurances that I have not made these observations from a motive so unworthy of my station and my character as that of paying court to any Government. I am actuated by far other motives. I believe that knowledge on subjects so important cannot be too widely promulgated. I believe if every Government on earth were bound to give an annual account before an audience whom they respected and who knew the facts, of what they had done during the year for improving the condition of their subjects, that this single and apparently slight circumstance would better the situation of all mankind. And I am desirous if\nany British Government in India should ever in similar calamitous circumstances forget its most important and sacred duties, that this example should be recorded for their reproach and disgrace. Upon the whole I am sure that I considerably understate the fact in saying that the British Government in this island has saved the lives of 100,000 persons, and what is more important that it has prevented the greater part of the misery through which they must have passed before they found refuge in death; besides the misery of all those who loved them or who depended upon their care.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 Forbes' Oriental Memoirs, IV. 290-295.\nSection III.\u2014Population.\n\nIn 1661 the total population of Bombay was estimated at 10,000 and in 1715 at about 16,000.

They replied that the least which ought to be reckoned for the district of Bombay was 100,000. The Mahim return of 13,726 they imagined to be pretty just.

Of their settlement on the island Mr. Anderson writes: From one part of the Portuguese illiberal system, the Government of Bombay reaped considerable benefit. Br\u00e1hmans whose services were of much value, lived at B\u00e1ndra in constant fear that when they died their\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov.

Of those who remained in B\u00e1ndra, some built houses in Bombay where they left their wives and children as in places of security.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 24th January 1785 the President acquaints the Board that sundry disputes have of late subsisted in the caste of Purvoes originating in a complaint formerly made against Trimbak R\u00e1ghoji Purvoe at M\u00e1lh\u00edm. This complaint was referred to the examination of the caste; and a report being made in the usual manner, was confirmed by him as Governor the 2nd of last month. Notwithstanding his decision, a party of the said caste, who are supported principally by one Bh\u00e1skar Purshotam and Nilo D\u00e1d\u00e1ji, have in defiance of his authority endeavoured to disturb the peace. In order to put a stop to their disputes the President recommends that some steps be taken to convince these people how much we disapprove of their conduct. The Board in consequence resolve that, as Nilo D\u00e1d\u00e1ji and Bh\u00e1skar Purshotam are men of bad character and very troublesome amongst the caste, they be turned off this island and never suffered to return hither again. Also that B\u00e1bu Gamb\u00e1ji and B\u00e1la Bin\u00e1ji who have been very forward in these disputes be fined the sum of Rs. 100 each; and that 104 other Purvoes who joined in signing a paper purporting to Trimbak's expulsion from the caste, be fined the sum of Rs. 50 each. These sums when collected to be appropriated to defray the expense of repairing the roads and paid into the proper office for that purpose. The Secretary is directed to have a proper warrant drawn out to be signed by us authorizing the Sheriff to carry these orders into execution. Resolved, in order to prevent disputes of this nature in future, that no Purvoe do make a wedding from this time on this island without he previously invites the whole caste according to ancient custom, which must be made known by publication.\n\nOn the 13th April 1687 the Deputy Governor Sir J. Wyborne and Council at Bombay write to His Excellency and Council at Surat: Since our last there has happened a business of ill consequence. The Portuguese Padre of Bombay by name Frea John de Gloria did in his own parish church christen or receive into the society of the Romish religion one Nathannel Thorpe, son to Lieutenant Thorpe deceased. The Padre of his own accord came to the Deputy Governor to beg his pardon for making a Roman Catholic Christian. But withal confessed that the said Thorpe did come to him to be made a Christian several times before he did it. Upon hearing the same the said Thorpe when apprehended by the Deputy Governor and brought to examination, confessed that the said Padre did tell him it was much better for the good of his soul to live in the Roman Catholic religion than to live in the English Church, with many other circumstances and arguments to draw him from his natural obedience to his King and religion.\n\n---\n\n1 Anderson's English in Western India, 86.\n2 Pub.

Vol. 2 of 1759-1788, 182.\nThis by several statutes is made high treason, namely: The 23rd year of Elizabeth and the first chapter; The 3rd of James and chapter the 4th largely treats of the same, and many more lay down the heinousness of the crime; By all it is judged high treason for any one to persuade or withdraw any subjects from their obedience to their King or to reconcile them to the Pope or to draw them to the Romish religion for that intent, or move them to promise obedience to any other state, or to procure council or aid them that do it, is treason. Now may it please your Excellency, this being a weighty thing to be considered and much more to be suffered, we have legally apprehended the said Padre who is now in safe custody until your Excellency further orders about him. We presume your Excellency will have the matter stated according to the canons of the Church by our Padres here, and remit the same by this conveyance. The Padre was committed prisoner to the county jail in the baz\u00e1r by Judge Vaux on 11th instant (April 1687) and laid in the room where Thorborn was. And yesterday by the earnest intercession of the Padre of Mahim and a strange Padre, the Deputy Governor Mr. Stanley and Mr. Jessop ordered him to be removed from the common jail to his own parish church where he is confined with a guard over him to see that he do not escape nor act in the church until your Excellency's pleasure be known what shall be done in this matter.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 19th January 1733 the President received the following memorial of Peter of Alcantara, Bishop of Areopolis in Asia Minor and Apostolical Vicar of the Moghal empire of the kingdoms of Idalchan (Bijapur) and Golconda, and the island of Bombay: The underwritten Peter of Alcantara humbly represents that whereas the Honourable Company did in the year 1718 for certain reasons and motives invite and admit to the spiritual government of the four Roman Catholic churches of this island of Bombay, the Right Reverend Maurice of Santa Theresa, Apostolical Vicar of the Moghal empire, the kingdoms of Goleonda and Idalchan, and the island of Bombay, Bishop of Anastasia of the Carmelite order, now with God, at the same time giving and granting him permission to ordain depute and appoint parochial missionaries of his order subordinate to his jurisdiction, for the administration of the said churches and the spiritual care of the Christian souls committed to their charge, confirming to him a free undisturbed public exercise of his religion, as theretofore with liberty to erect and build within the city an episcopal house and chapel which he did. In return the said Lord Bishop and Apostolical Vicar, together with the missionaries to him subordinate, in the name of themselves and successors did take a formal and solemn oath of\n\n---\n\n1 Sec.

In this connection in a Despatch of the 21st February the Court had written to Bombay that to prevent the Portuguese priests having too great influence in Bombay, ecclesiastics of different orders should be encouraged and rewarded.

This oath, which was taken subject to the maintenance of the liberties and immunities of their religion as stipulated for by and between the crowns of Great Britain and Portugal on the cession of this island by the Portuguese to the British, inculcated and enforced on the Roman Catholic subjects an exact and unalterable obedience to your Honour's Government. In consideration of this agreement the Honourable Company did approve and admit of the establishment of the said Bishop; and towards the support of his dignity and character, otherwise slenderly provided for by the church revenues, and to enable him in the prosecution and discharge of his episcopal function, was pleased to confer on him a monthly stipend or exhibition of Rs. 40. This stipend was regularly paid him during his lifetime until the 14th May 1726, when he died. Upon the demise of the Right Reverend Maurice, his seat becoming vacant, this Peter of Alcantara of the said Carmelite order was nominated by a Bull express from Rome to succeed him here. By virtue of this Bull this Peter was consecrated by the title of Bishop of Areopolis and as such had the happiness to be admitted and recognized by your Honour under the same obligation of fidelity and guaranteeship for his parishioners and the whole body of Roman Catholics on this island. The said Peter of Alcantara therefore represents to your Honour that, in consideration of the church funds being through poverty incapable of affording a contribution equal to the maintenance of his dignity and office, he hopes, through their favour and goodness, the Honourable Company will be pleased to allow him from the day of his admission (the 18th January 1733, N. S.) the said monthly stipend and appointment of Rs. 40 which his predecessor formerly enjoyed. This stipend will enable him in some measure to establish and support himself on this island on the same footing as his predecessor and in a station where it will be his constant endeavour to exert and approve himself as well a faithful subject as a vigilant guardian and guarantee of the loyalty and allegiance of all the Roman Catholics of this island to the crown of Great Britain and inclusively to the Honourable Company whom God preserve and have in his holy guard and protection. After consideration the Board agree that the memorial of the Reverend Peter de Alcantara be presented to our Honourable Masters in our advices now preparing to be sent home.\n\nA Consultation of the 11th June 1745 records: The small stock raised for the church by appropriating the balance of the half per cent customs duty after the hospital was finished, on the close of our books in July 1733, and the continuance of the duty during the year following, was such that the interest thereof defrayed the ordinary church repairs and charges. At a vestry held on the 12th June 1738, as he was hitherto not provided with any decent or suitable lodging, it was thought proper, at the minister's request, to purchase a small house adjoining\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 5 of 1732-33, 18, 21-23.\nthe church for his use. This sum and what has since been laid out by another vestry in building a steeple have not only consumed the capital, but so exceeded the calculate that the church is now indebted in the sum of Rs. 1307-2-54 to the estate of Mr. Morley then land paymaster and warden. The ordinary charges and necessary repairs that the fabric may require admitting of no delay it is agreed that for the present the same be undertaken on the Honourable Company's account under strict orders that all possible frugality be used and be liable to our own management. We doubt not to bring the whole charges within the compass of Rs. 50 a month, though it has hitherto exceeded double the sum exclusive of the purchase and the (steeple?) above mentioned. The Board esteem this method better than again appropriating the half per cent duty, which may again by a future vestry be mismanaged, and bring us into the same dilemma. It is therefore hoped an expense of this kind will not be disapproved by the Honourable Company.\n\nA Consultation of 4th October 1748 has the following entry: There being some reason to apprehend that there is a Romish priest at Tellicherry who wants to come hither to take up his residence on this island in quality of a Bishop, it is agreed that the Chief and Factors be ordered peremptorily to refuse him a passage on any of our ships till they have orders from us to the contrary. In case at any time any Romish priest should want to touch here for proceeding elsewhere they are to permit thereof if they think proper.\n\nIn a letter of the 6th March 1750 the Court appointed the Reverend Mr. Richard Dixie to be their Chaplain at Bombay, on the usual terms and appointments.\n\nThe Bombay Diary of the 27th January 1751 has the following: The Chief and Factors at Tellicherry have sent Ensign John Roloffistas to Anjengo to relieve Ensign Edgerton, because Ensign Edgerton and his Captain-Lieutenant are both staunch Roman Catholics, and therefore not fit to be trusted with an out-fort. They therefore thought it best to separate them which, they hope, will be approved.\n\nThe next day, the 28th of January, the Board approves of the action taken by Tellicherry. They add: As we have at present but very few subaltern officers, agreed that we repeat our request to the Honourable Company for a further supply by the first opportunity.\n\nIn their letter of the 5th April 1754 the Court write: The interest of the Company depends so much upon the integrity frugality and decent behaviour of our servants in general, that it is incumbent upon us not only to intimate the same to you, but also to enforce it by our commands. This we now do as we have done to our other Presidencies by directing that, unless prevented by sickness or some other reasonable cause, the Governor and Council and the rest of our servants both civil and military do constantly and regularly attend divine worship at church every Sunday, and that all the common soldiers likewise who\n\n---\n\n1 Pub.

That the Governor and Council do carefully attend to the morals and manner of life of all our servants in general, and reprove and admonish them when and wherever reproof shall be found necessary. That, so far as their several stations will allow of it, all our superior servants do avoid an expensive manner of living and consider that as the representatives of a body of merchants a decent frugality will be much more in character. That you take particular care that our younger servants do not launch into expenses beyond their incomes especially upon their first arrival. We lay it down as a standing and positive command that, during the term of his writership, no writer be allowed to keep a palanquin horse or chaise. We are sensible that although this last prohibition is necessary at all our settlements, we have little occasion to blame any of our servants for such a piece of extravagance at your Presidency. That you set apart one day in every quarter of a year, and oftener if you find it necessary, to enquire into the general conduct and behaviour of all our servants below the Council, and enter the result thereof in your diary for our observation. We do not think it necessary to give such a direction with regard to our servants in Council, because we are and always can be well acquainted with their characters without a formal enquiry.\n\nA Consultation of the 29th July 1760 records: The Portuguese church being considerably within 400 yards of the town wall and some of the walls being four feet thick and built of chunam and stone, we are sensible it would prove of the utmost ill consequence to the defence of this place if attacked by a European enemy. The principal Engineer is therefore directed as soon as possible to give the Padres belonging to the church, notice of our intention to have it pulled down. It is further agreed that the principal Engineer set about pulling down the said church and pitching on a proper place to which the materials may be removed and the church rebuilt. On our orders being carried into execution, the new fortification paymaster is ordered to pay to the proprietors the valuation of the church, as made by Captain Hugh Cameron clerk of the works in 1755.\n\nA week later, 5th August 1760, the Board read a petition from the three Padres belonging to the Portuguese church setting forth that they are ready to comply with our orders for pulling it down, but are in want of workmen and of a proper place for rebuilding the church. The President acquaints us that, as there are no other people to spare, he has ordered the Padres to get the Christian militia. This order the Secretary is directed to repeat and order Major Fraser to set the militia about the work, and the Collector together with the principal Engineer are appointed to pitch on a fit spot for rebuilding the church.\n\nThree days later, on the 8th August (1760), the Board read a report from the Collector and principal Engineer in reply to our orders for pitching on a proper spot for rebuilding the Portuguese church and\n\n---\n\n1 Court to Bombay 5th April 1754 paras 119-125, Pub.

Agreed in consequence of their proposal about the former that the President enquire of the owner of the Umarkh\u00e1di house on what terms he is willing to dispose of it. And in case Abraham B\u00e1va proprietor of the cart Kolbh\u00e1t does not choose to permit of houses being built therein for the inhabitants on the proposed terms, the Collector is directed to give one of the Honourable Company\u2019s carts in exchange for Kolbh\u00e1t. The Secretary is directed likewise to issue orders to the proprietors of the above mentioned cart and the cart Dasaudi requiring them to permit of the principal Engineer lining them out for rebuilding as many houses for the inhabitants as they will contain.\n\nTwo weeks later, on the 22nd August 1760, the Board read a letter from the Portuguese Padres requesting that the valuation of the church at Bombay may be paid them to enable them to defray the charge of pulling it down and building it on a spot of ground they have now secured. Ordered, 22nd August 1760, that the new fortification paymaster advance them from time to time as far as Rs. 4000 on account of the valuation.\n\nAt a Consultation on the 2nd September 1760, the President informs us that having lately ordered a valuation of the Portuguese church, it has been estimated at Rs. 18,675-3-95 or Rs. 7565-3-75 less than was computed by Captain Hugh Cameron in 1755, the decrease is chiefly owing to Captain Cameron having allowed for the church wall according to its present thickness of four feet, whereas 2\u00bd feet are sufficient for the new church. This is approved.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 25th November 1760 the Board read a petition from Manoel Baretto setting forth that his cart which is appropriated for rebuilding the Portuguese church has been valued by the vereadores of Bombay at Rs. 1019 and that the Honourable Company\u2019s M\u00e1him carts Beliauri and Bomb\u00e1lia have been valued by the vereadores at Rs. 988. He therefore prays that the said Beliauri and Bomb\u00e1lia carts may be delivered in exchange for his. With this the Collector is ordered to comply and to charge the proprietors of the church the intrinsic value of the said carts belonging to the Honourable Company.\n\nThree days later, 28th November, the following entry is recorded: The Romish priests requesting a further advance on account of the valuation of their church, the new fortification paymaster is directed to advance them Rs. 4000.\n\nA Consultation of the 5th December 1760 records: Resolved that the proprietors of the Portuguese church lately pulled down be charged for the carts assigned Manoel Baretto in lieu for his appropriated for rebuilding the church on, the sum at which Manoel Baretto\u2019s cart has been valued by the vereadores.\n\n---\n\n1 Pub.

This number is not to be exceeded without our leave. It is our pleasure that, unless on very urgent cases and extraordinary recommendations, when vacancies happen we are to be informed thereof in order for our filling them ourselves with gentlemen to be sent from hence.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 12th August 1768 the Board record: It being absolutely necessary to enlarge the pews in the church on account of the greater number of military and marine officers now in the service, the land paymaster is ordered to cause the same to be put in execution in such manner as the chaplain with the approbation of the President may think proper. When completed the pews are to be allotted for the accommodation of the different gentlemen in the manner undermentioned in which a consistent regard is paid to the original plan observed in allotting them in . . . . . and to which a strict obedience must be enjoined. None but members of the Board, the superintendent (as such), and the commanding officer for the time being if a field officer, to sit in the pew allotted for the Council. All the Company\u2019s covenant servants under Council, except such as are members of the Mayor\u2019s Court who are to occupy the pew allotted for the Court, with the principal surgeons of the hospital are to sit in the pew adjoining to that of the members of the Board. The pew hitherto occupied by the infantry and artillery officers is still to be for their use together with the two pews heretofore occupied by the writers and immediately below the last mentioned pew. The two pews opposite to that of the Company\u2019s servants are to be made into one and are to be occupied by Captains of the Honourable Company\u2019s cruisers, and of Europe and country ships, free merchants, supra cargoes and others not in the Honourable Company\u2019s service. The two immediately behind these are intended for the officers and surgeons of cruisers and Europe and country ships. The pew hitherto occupied by the Mayor\u2019s Court to be still reserved for their sole use and all other pews not here mentioned, must remain as heretofore. Directed therefore that an order be sent to the Chaplain accordingly.\n\nOn the 8th March 1769 the Board observe: Mr. Boddam as church warder makes a tender of Rs. 13,130-3-19 belonging to the church-stock to be lodged at interest in the treasury. Ordered that the same be received accordingly and a bond passed for the amount payable in twelve months.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 3rd July 1770 the Board read a petition from Padre Francisco Xavier complaining of his having been superseded in the Vicarage General of this island at the instigation of the President. The President thereupon observes to the Board that ever since the appointment of the said Padre Xavier to the post of Vicar General on this island which happened some months ago, he has been almost con-\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Dep. Court\u2019s Letters Vol. 5 of 1757-1761, 394.\n2 Pub. Diary 51 of 1763, 443-444.\n3 Pub. Diary 53 of 1769, 372.\ntinually pestered with complaints from Padre Pedro Vicar of Bombay or Padre Regnaldo Vicar of Mahim or their respective parishioners. These complaints the President understanding to have proceeded as well from the said Francisco Xavier being a young man, and in their church standing several years below the Vicars of Bombay and Mahim, also because of undue practices made use of by him in conjunction with one Padre Clement to their prejudice, by which the patent was unjustly obtained from the Bishop, the President took the opportunity of the said Bishop's calling here on his way to Surat in the month of November last to desire and entreat him to make a strict and impartial inquiry into the merits of their several allegations. As the aforesaid Padres Pedro and Regnaldo had further represented the said Padre Clement to be a man of a bad character and one who interfered in concerns with which he as an ecclesiastic had no business, and which the President having heard in general from Mr. Wrench and other gentlemen as well as Padres who had resided at Basra or Beshire, Mr. Jervis only excepted who always spoke well of him, induced the President further to desire the Bishop to remove the said Clement especially as he was said not to be of this mission. This last the Bishop acknowledged and gave the President hopes he would comply with. Shortly after the Bishop proceeded on examination as above desired; and having acquainted the President that both Padres Pedro and Regnaldo had been most reputably acquitted, he had given them certificates under his hand accordingly. Afterwards when the President saw these certificates, looking upon it but as a piece of common justice due to the injured Padres, he proposed, provided the Bishop had no material objection, the Bishop should grant the power and authority of Vicar General to Pedro the oldest of them, who always appeared to the President a very quiet man and against whom he had never received any complaint which is more than he could say of Regnaldo or Francisco. In reply the Bishop having assured the President that, on his offering him the Vicarship, Pedro had declined it, and proposing Padre Jacento then at Surat for the post of Vicar General as the best expedient for settling these disputes he being the oldest of their order, the President acquiesced. Afterwards the Bishop having appointed one Padre Angelo to relieve the said Jacento at Surat, requested the President to furnish the said Padre with a letter to the Chief of Surat, which he complied with as per copy now read. From this explanation, together with the President's most solemn assurance that the nomination of Padre Jacento for Vicar General was a voluntary thought and proposal of the Bishop, the Board decided that the President used no compulsive means whatever with the Bishop in favour of the appointment of Padre Jacento and resolved that Padre Francisco Xavier's complaint of the injustice he has received be referred to the Bishop. And that a letter be wrote by us to the Bishop assuring him he always has been and will continue to be at full liberty to appoint whom he shall judge most proper for the office of Vicar General.\n\n1 Pub. Diary 55 of 1770, 361-362.\nAt a Consultation of the 10th March 1772 the Board received the following petition of the Bombay and Mahim vereadores for and in behalf of all the Roman Catholic subjects of this island: That betwixt the petitioners and their Vicars have arisen a great disconcord and differences on account of the following ambitious exorbitance of the said Vicars: (1) That they intend reimbursing all the effects of the churches and oppressing the poor people on account of money. (2) That they have said that by the authority granted them by your Government, they were constituted absolute arbitrators of the popular liberty. (3) One of them, namely Juy Angelino, publicly stated that the said authority is a key which they have in their power; and that this Government had their hands locked by it regarding them the Padres. (4) That under this system they the said Padres unanimously do threaten the poor people to pay a ready and entire obedience to their commands subjecting them to a slavery without remission as the Jesuits did and do practise in the new Portuguese and Spanish colonies. As the said Padres are so insolent against the poor people, your petitioners humbly beg your Honour will be pleased to suspend the complaint of the said Padres until the next meeting of this Honourable Board, these petitioners having their just and needful reasons to represent to your Honour.\n\nAt the same time Mr. Shaw lays before the Board copy of a publication which he acquaints us the Padres have presumed to affix on their church, enforcing sundry bulls of the Popes, and, under pain of excommunication, enjoining their flock to observe the regulations therein mentioned. This Mr. Shaw esteems an high contempt of Government and therefore desires the Padres may be cited before the Board to answer it, more particularly as there are in the records of the Board the strictest orders that no publication be issued but by its directions. Mr. Shaw further begs leave to move that the voice of the people may be heard. On due consideration of these petitions it is resolved that the Padres and their parishioners attend before the Board after the departure of the Hampshire when inquiry will be made into their complaints. In the meantime the Secretary is to cause the publications to be pulled down and to secure that, without the authority of Government, none in future be permitted to be affixed.\n\nIn 1719 a sum of Rs. 6610 or \u00a3826\u00bd was subscribed towards a charity school for educating poor children in the Christian religion according to the use of the Church of England. These subscriptions were collected provided the Honourable Company would contribute thereto as they had to a similar school at Fort St. George, and also provided in two years' time the subscriptions amount to Rs. 8000.\n\nIn a letter of the 4th March 1752 the Court write: As it will be greatly for the interest of the Company to have as many of the soldiery and other our dependants in the Presidency of Bombay instructed in the principles of the Protestant religion, we have thought proper to add two more Chaplains to your establishment, who are\n\n---\n\n1 Pub.

Also that we may have the advantage of a rising generation instructed in the same principles, we recommend it to you to form a plan for the setting up and establishing Protestant charity schools wherein the children of our soldiers mariners topasses and others may be educated as well at the subordinates as at Bombay. When you can reduce your plan to practice, you may depend upon our giving an assistance becoming the Company. And we most earnestly recommend it to every one of our servants and others who are in good circumstances, to contribute freely to an undertaking of such great utility to the Presidency in general. The salaries allowances and appointments of the said two Chaplains are to be the same as our Chaplain at Bombay receives from the Company. When, in consequence of this recommendation, schools are erected our Chaplains are frequently to visit them, to see what improvement the children make, and to give their utmost assistance in instructing and confirming them in the principles and profession of the Protestant religion. We have fixed upon the Reverend Mr. Robert Palk, at present at the Presidency of Fort St. George, to be one of our said Chaplains, who is in rank next to the Reverend Mr. Dixie our Chaplain at Bombay, and to succeed him in case of death or otherwise. We have chosen the Reverend Mr. John Howell for our third Chaplain, who takes his passage from England on one of these ships, and is to succeed in turn in case of a vacancy by the death or otherwise of either of the other two gentlemen. We have lent Mr. Howell \u00a350 on his bond to be repaid out of his growing salary, and have enclosed the said bond in the packet of that ship on which he takes his passage. You are to send notice to the Reverend Mr. Palk to make the best of his way to the station we have appointed him to. At the same time you are to acquaint him that if at the time of his receiving such notice there shall happen to be a vacancy at the Presidency of Fort St. George by the death or otherwise of the Reverend Mr. Stavely or Mr. Colefax, or, at Bengal, by the death or otherwise of the Reverend Mr. Bellamy or Mr. Mapletoft, he is to have the option of succeeding to such vacancy. We have also sent on the ship Uodington some large Bibles to be made use of by our Chaplains in performing public worship.\n\nTwo years later, 5th April 1754, the Court write: We have chosen the Reverend Mr. Thomas Coxeter to be one of our Chaplains upon the Bombay establishment at the same salary and allowances and appointments as the other two and to succeed the Reverend Mr. Howell and Mr. Pugh in turn as vacancies may happen by the death or other ways of those gentlemen. Mr. Coxeter is entertained on condition that over and above his duty as a Chaplain he be employed in educating the youth at such settlements whereat he shall be appointed to reside agreeable to the plan mentioned in our general letter of the 4th March 1752. You are therefore to station him at Tellicherry,\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Dep. Court's Letters Vol. 4 of 1752-1756, 17-19.\nAnjengo, or wherever else you shall think he may be most useful.\n\nOn the 26th March 1755 the Court again write: In our commands of the 4th March 1752, the forming a plan for the setting up and establishing charity schools for the education of the children of our soldiers mariners topasses and others, as well at the subordinates as at Bombay, was earnestly recommended to your consideration. To our great surprise you have not given us the least intimation whether you have or have not had this matter in your thoughts. We expect your reasons for not answering that part of our letter and we further expect that you will use your best endeavours for carrying our said recommendations into execution, and send us an account of the progress you make therein.\n\nOn the 7th December 1754 the Bombay Government write to the Court of Directors: In compliance with the recommendation contained in your Honours\u2019 letter of the 4th March 1752, we have established a Protestant Charity School upon Bombay, a plan of which together with the rules and regulations for its conduct we have taken the liberty to send home. We send this plan as well that your Honours may see what progress and proficiency we have made in this pious and useful establishment as to submit our rules with all due deference to your Honours\u2019 correction or approbation. Sensible of the great civil advantages which must undoubtedly accrue to your Honours\u2019 interest from such an undertaking, as well as the religious ones which must redound to those who may be admitted to the benefits of it when pursued with proper vigour and encouragement, we had before begun to collect subscriptions for this purpose. This scheme the gentlemen of all ranks and degrees who have the honour to serve you here entered into with a readiness which speaks justly their praise and with a generosity and largeness of heart suitable to the greatness of the end and the importance of the occasion, a temper which, according to the best of their abilities, they will always be ready to testify. The fund raised by this means though, if considered in regard to the number and circumstances of those from whose benevolence it grew, is certainly great, still is small in respect to the noble and praiseworthy end it is intended to answer. Last May was twelve months we opened the school and had about a dozen lads, who being catechised in Church the Lent following acquitted themselves with credit to their master and commendation to themselves, who, but for the opportunity this school gave them, had not perhaps known a letter. Last Christmas, enabled by a happy increase of contributions, we hired a house, the cheapest and most convenient consistent with the circumstances of our finances we could get, and some time after took in six boys upon that foundation, all of whom were the poor and destitute orphans of such as breathed their last in your Honours\u2019 service and some of them in fighting your battles. To render our design effectually successful we thought it a necessary step to take the children from their parents and place them entirely under our own directions. By this means it is true our scheme becomes more\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Dep. Court\u2019s Letters Vol. 4 of 1752-1756, 171-172.\n2 Pub. Dep. Court\u2019s Letters Vol. 4 of 1752-1756, 232-233.\nexpensive. Still, had we admitted a free intercourse between the children and their mothers, they, instigated by their priests who are very jealous of our undertaking, had been sure to exert their utmost influence and had hardly failed defeating our pious purposes. We would willingly extend our compassion to the orphans of either sex both at Bombay and the subordinates and make our establishment become a refuge to all such as may be so unhappy as to be left destitute in a place where no legal parochial provision is made for their wants. This, could we but accomplish it, would, we are persuaded, be a means of rescuing numbers of little innocents from the most miserable beggary, the grossest superstition, and the vilest idolatry. Further, by admitting and training up female orphans, we should provide a supply of Protestant wives for our military and marine, and so lay a foundation for a succession of Protestants to future generations. Nor could an institution so extensive be without its civil and political advantages, for an assurance that proper care will be taken of the orphan will, we apprehend, induce and encourage the father to meet danger with more boldness and intrepidity and adventure his life with greater alacrity. To make our institution thus extensively useful is what we can never hope to do with our present stock augmented only by casual subscriptions of such well disposed persons as either chance or business brings among us. For it would require a house to be built which should afford different apartments to a master and mistress and contain distinct wards for the boys and girls. A great additional expense must ensue from clothing and sustaining the girls and retaining for a mistress a woman of sober character and prudent behaviour, such an one as we rather hope to see come out than have reason to think we may find among us willing to undertake the charge. But however unable we may be to accomplish our wishes by our own strength yet with your Honours' benevolent encouragement patronage and protection we do not doubt to bring these great and worthy purposes through the blessing of God perfectly to effect. A proper regard to their duty will, we do not doubt, always prevail with the chaplains to superintend and visit the charity school with due care and attention, conscious that, nowhere with greater success, can they make religious impressions than upon tender minds not blasted with vice or (warped?) with prejudice.\n\nIn a letter of the 31st March 1756 the Court write: We are fully sensible that your Charity School will be a great good to the community. The rules and methods laid down are very judicious, and, if strictly kept up to, may answer many excellent purposes. The principal things we observe to be wanting are teachers, accommodations, and an increase to your fund. From the good character he bears we are not to doubt, the Reverend Mr. Howell will continue his pious endeavours to train up and instruct the boys. Next year he shall have an assistant Chaplain to aid him in this good work and in all other religious duties. For, as your island is now grown very populous, we deem it right that you have two clergymen. Therefore any honest sober man will serve\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Dep. Letters to the Court Vol. 3 of 1754-55, 62-65.\nfor schoolmaster, while he has such proper directors. The girls must have a mistress, and surely among such numbers of women of all degrees as are now at Bombay, it will not be a difficult matter to meet with one willing and able to be mistress. If any of our buildings on the island are proper and can be spared, we give you leave to appropriate such for a school, and the necessary alterations or additions, if it requires but a small sum, may be at our expense. For we are under a necessity of exercising the greatest economy, the prodigious war charges at Madras and your subordinates having obliged us to lower our dividend. However willing we are to forward this laudable design, we must deal our bounty with a sparing hand. We therefore can permit you to pay to this charity school only Rs. 3000 with a promise the school shall have such further encouragement and assistance as we can prudently give. In general we much approve your methods. The few that seem to want amendment we shall now point out. The Diary should have opened with the names of all the original subscribers and the several sums subscribed. This answers two purposes. It satisfies the public that the whole is justly brought to account, and it enables you and us to call upon such as have omitted their payments. We therefore recommend a table of subscribers to be framed from the commencement of this charity, and continued; and this to be hung up in the most conspicuous part of the school. The offices of trustees we observe are confined to certain persons, whereas all subscribers in the corporation have an equal right to be chosen. As this is a great growing charity the number of trustees seems too few. We therefore offer it to your consideration to make the number twelve; the Governor and Second for the time being to be always President and Vice-President, and with the Chaplain the only constant trustees. The rest to be annually chosen on Easter Monday by ballot and from this body annually to elect the officers. This fund commenced and has continued growing from the year 1749. Yet to this time the trustees have not rendered their constituents one stated account. The accounts are all suppositions which, we must remark, is a great irregularity. Therefore if you expect our countenance and protection to this useful charity, you must never depart from exactness in so fundamental a point. The treasurer should adjust his account current every year with interest, the comptroller should examine and countersign it, and this should be laid before the body of trustees every Easter Monday and entered on the diary. The office of comptroller should be to check and examine accounts. We therefore propose to you the appointing an under-treasurer. All applications and orders for payment of wages and providing necessaries to be issued by the comptroller to the under-treasurer, who is to render his account with the several vouchers to the comptroller monthly, and he then to check and pass it. In your 19th regulation it is said that in the admittance of children preference be always given to such as have lost both father and mother; then such whose parents are poor and indigent. So far we think this rule is just. But we observe that of the six children taken on the foundation, two of them are bastards and from slaves on one side. Here we think you are somewhat deficient; for surely these are not the most proper objects. We do not mean entirely to exclude these unhappy\ninnocents. Still for example\u2019s sake we hope the preference will always be given to those who are descended from honest parents. Teaching of slaves at the school is a right measure. But will the children of free people mix with slaves in any degree of harmony? If you should find it gives disgust, we recommend it to your consideration, if the teaching them apart will not better answer every good purpose.\n\nOn the 31st January 1756, the Bombay Government write to the Court: We have fully represented to your Honours the state of the charity school here and now forward the trustees\u2019 books. From this your Honours will be informed what has since been contributed, and, as they have requested us to desire you would be pleased to appoint some person to receive the sums subscribed by Mr. Richard Peisly, Captains Philip, J. Oddrell, and Benjamin Braund, we are induced from your Honours\u2019 favourable attention thereof to beg your compliance and that you will credit the Presidency for the amount. We can assure your Honours all possible endeavours are used to execute the plan agreeable to your commands. Our stock is yet too small to think of erecting a building for this use. But as your Honours assured us that you would not be wanting in contributing so charitable a work when set on foot, it now being established, we shall be glad of your Honours\u2019 commands on this occasion.\n\nOn the 15th December 1756 they again write: The subscribers to the charity school desire to return their hearty thanks for your Honours\u2019 generous bounty and offers of assistance for carrying it on and are pleased that their rules in general have met your Honours\u2019 approbation. We have paid the trustees the sum ordered by your Honours, but all your buildings being occupied we cannot spare them any for a school. Nevertheless they deem themselves greatly obliged for your Honours\u2019 kind intention and beg leave to assure you they will forward the design as far as lays in their power agreeable to your Honours\u2019 plan and are glad that they last year sent their books and a list of subscribers which will be regularly continued for your Honours\u2019 information.\n\nNext year, 4th May 1757, the Court write: By the directions we gave last year with respect to your charity school your request for our contribution is anticipated. You are to continue to give us an account of this charity that we may, agreeable to our promise, give such further encouragement and assistance as we can with prudence under the present circumstances of the Company.\n\nOn the 8th April 1758 the Bombay Government write to the Court: The trustees of the charity school forward their books for last year. We have the pleasure to acquaint your Honours that the stock would now admit of entertaining twelve children instead of ten if proper objects offered and your Honours may rely on our assiduity to increase it.\n\n---\n\n1 Pub.

And this being taken into consideration it is observed that they may hereafter be very useful to our Honourable Masters, particularly in the out-offices. It is therefore agreed to entertain them as apprentices to the Honourable Company for the term of seven years to be clothed by the land paymaster and victualled at the school at the Honourable Company\u2019s expense. The first is accordingly ordered to attend the Secretary\u2019s office, the second the Collector\u2019s, and the third to be put under the direction of the Superintendent to be employed by the master-builder.\n\nIn reply in a letter of 6th April 1763, the Court observe: We have no objections to your entertaining as apprentices to us for seven years the orphans recommended by the trustees of the charity school, nor to your employing them in the out-offices or as seamen or carpenters caulkers or artificers of any kind, where they may be useful to us under you, or at any other of our settlements in India. But as we never intend they shall ever become covenanted servants to us under the denomination of Factors or Writers, we positively direct that they be not employed in your Secretary\u2019s or Accountant\u2019s offices, nor be initiated into such branches of our business, which is proper only for our covenanted servants alone to know. You are therefore to remove from under the Secretary the person appointed to assist him. The two others under the Collector and Superintendent may be continued and employed as they shall direct, consistent with this plan of our intentions. We approve of your victualling and clothing them at our expense during their apprenticeship to us.\n\nA Consultation of the 12th August 1766 records: The surgeons of the hospital having represented that two of the boys from the charity school might be brought there, and being of opinion they may become very useful by being employed in this manner, it is agreed that William Tullie and William Beard be bound to the Honourable Company for seven years and that during that term they be employed in the hospital and clothed and victualled at the Company\u2019s expense.\n\nIn a letter of the 25th April 1771 the Court write: We have been informed that our Chaplain the Revd. Mr. Howell has taken a great deal of trouble for some years past in instructing the children in the charity school and that several boys have been apprenticed from thence, for which additional trouble he has no particular allowance from us. We now direct that Mr. Howell be presented with Rs. 1000 as a gratuity, and we hope he will continue to give his assistance in so charitable an undertaking.\n\n---\n\n1 Pub.

I rather impute it to the situation which causes an infecundity in the earth and a putridness in the air, what being produced seldom coming to maturity, whereby what is eaten is undigested; whence follows fluxes, dropsy, scurvy, barbiers, gout, stone, malignant and putrid fevers, which are endemic diseases. Among the worst of these, phul arrack (brandy made of blubber or carvil) and foul women may be reckoned.\u00b9\n\nOn the 18th December 1675 the Surat Government write to Bombay: We heartily lament the frequent mortality of our countrymen and do with you impute it to their gross and scandalous irregularities in their sickness. This we judge would have been much prevented if we had an hospital. Wherefore we have determined God willing to erect so necessary a building with all speed without attending further order from England and we do hereby desire you to prepare materials without further delay on the Honourable Company\u2019s charge or if you want we will supply you from here. We have considered of the two models which in the main we like well of, but it seems to us that they are too narrow and not so much yard room left as there ought to be, nor is there room enough for the chirurgeon and his family and own attendants as there ought to be. Wherefore we have ordered here another model to be drawn out more large and airy and consequently more healthy for the sick people, according to which we would have you govern yourselves. But first of all we would have you advise the place where it is to be built for we are not much inclined to that place formerly designed by Colonel Bake fearing that the air is not so good there and it is too near the sea. Therefore do you choose out another place more convenient having all regard to the line of the fortification and also to the line designed for the Christian town. When you have pitched upon a convenient place and appointed a place for a garden adjoining thereunto advise us thereof. Let the foundation be of good stone and lime and let the ground be raised three or four feet high. The walls may be built of sandstone and lime and raised to a convenient height. Other matters we refer unto you as also the disposal of the chirurgeons and of their chests of medicines, desiring you to avoid and prevent all occasions of just complaint either from the chirurgeons or their patients.\u00b2\n\nThree weeks later, on the 11th January 1676, the Surat Government again write: The situation of the place whereon to erect the hospital we leave totally to your judgments to act therein as you shall think most convenient.

We shall be mindful on all occasions to supply you with large quantities of chunam, being sensible of your great expenses thereof, and we only want boats to carry it down.\n\nA week later, on the 17th January 1676, Surat again writes: We herewith send you a draught of the hospital which will accommodate about 70 persons. We design the building at as little charge as may be and hope it will not exceed Rs. 4000. The use of this will be to prevent by God's blessing the too frequent mortality among your people by keeping them to a stricter regimen in diet and abstinence from debauchery which now in their own houses they cannot be kept from, though never so sick, to the destruction of their bodies and souls. The yearly maintenance thereof may amount to about Rs. 1000 and is to be governed by the chief chirurgeon and his mates who are to reside there. The lamentable loss of your men doth call on us for a speedy erecting of the fabric. We doubt not but you will approve thereof.\n\nOn the 19th July 1676 the Surat Government write to Bombay: We like well your proposition of making the present Court of Judicature an hospital and the Deputy Governor's and Mr. Petit's house the Court of Judicature. At the same time we would be further satisfied how the Deputy Governor and Mr. Petit mean by sparing their house to the Company whether they design renting it annually to them or selling it outright; if the first, then what rent they demand, for we would not put the Company to too great a charge. If they wish to sell, then how will they oblige themselves to the Company for the money they have received on account of their arrears of salary, for at present we look upon the house as sufficient security which is also agreeable to the Company's order. But let the house be valued by any indifferent persons and the valuation thereof sent us and then we shall be able to give a more definitive answer.\n\nOn the 21st August 1676 they write to Bombay: We are glad to read that the Honourable Company have sent out so able a physician as Doctor Wilson is reported to be who we hope will prove a great benefit and happiness to the island in regard that the Deputy Governor is so desperately ill and hath our license to come up by ships. We do also give leave to said Doctor Wilson to accompany him whom we hope, through the blessing of God, will be very instrumental to the restoring the Deputy Governor to his former health. The Doctor shall be very welcome to us here and we would have you also send up Colonel Bake to us by the ships.\n\n---\n\n1 Surat Fact. Out. L. B. 2 of 1675-76, 21-22.

But he himself knows and is sensible as well as we that there is no other and therefore we cannot hold him excused but do confirm our orders in placing him Second and accountant on Bombay where we know he is very well able to do the Company acceptable service. We hope his will and zeal to serve the Honourable Company will be equal to his ability, and that an ill grounded fancy or unmanly fear of sickness will not prevail with him to be singular in contradicting our directions or refusing to serve where the Company\u2019s affairs do require. We do again desire that Mr. Child and his family do land at Bombay and that he apply himself seriously to the examining and rectifying the Honourable Company\u2019s accounts of the island. These are in some disorder caused by want of a right understanding of some entries. This he may do in his time. None but he can adjust the accounts and it concerns him for his own honour\u2019s sake so to do.\n\nOn the 10th April 1677 the Surat Council write to Bombay: The President (Mr. Aungier) continuing in a sickly and weakly condition and your island at present being in a very good estate as to health, he desires you to send up Doctor Wilson, to pass the time of the rain here, by whose means through the blessing of God he hopes to recover his perfect health. Therefore fail not to send him up by sea or land.\n\nOn the 24th January 1677 the Bombay Government write to the Court: We find your Honours to be at a very great and unnecessary charge yearly in unprofitable medicines sent out, many of which and those of great price, lie here and rot, and many we can here procure at a sixth part of the price. The physician and chirurgeon have therefore herewith sent lists of what simple medicines and plasters cannot here be procured or made which will amount to a very small matter and yet we shall be better furnished than ever we were yet.\n\nOn the 24th October 1696 the Bombay Government write to Surat: Last night the Josia frigate anchored off this island, whose master came on shore this morning and delivered the drugs you sent for the use of the hospital with the rice and d\u00e1l.\n\nOf the ravages of the plague between 1690 and 1698 which made two monsoons the age of a man and of the horror of the Bombay climate which in 1707 wrung from President Waite the piteous words \u2018We are six including your Council; it is morally impossible to continue longer from going under ground,\u2019 details are given in Vol. I. pages 142-143.\n\n---\n\n1 Surat Fact.

Forasmuch as by the death of Doctor Skinner, the island of Bombay is destitute of a physician and the island very sickly, and a great many poor people and soldiers laying in danger of perishing for want of the help and advice of a Doctor, we resolved to entertain Mr. Bartlett in the said station, allowing him \u00a34 a month to be paid in Xs. at 20d. to the Xeraphin according to the custom of the island together with the same allowance for his diet as Doctor Skinner was allowed, and the usual assistance belonging to the hospital. We left it to his own choice whether his time should commence here or at his arrival at Bombay, with this proviso, that if it commences here, then he is to bear his own charges down. If not, till he is arrived upon the island, then his charges should be borne by the Company. But he, being destitute of money and friends, we agreed to lend him Rs. 80 to supply himself with necessaries, which money we order the Deputy Governor to deduct out of his wages. And the island being in great necessity we gave him orders to prepare himself to go overland with all speed. There being a great mortality upon the island, amongst the English as well as the Natives, we were willing to encourage all people that offered their service to us; and entertained Henry Chritchlow as Boatswain of the Bandar at Bombay at the usual pay that others have had before.\n\nIn a letter of the 20th April 1708 the Court write: We are very desirous to do what in us lies to contribute to the health of Bombay. Were the island once healthy we should hope it would soon people, if they were sure of protection and encouragement. By the best information we can get we have reason to believe that the unwholesomeness of the air, water, and provisions might be in a good measure remedied.\n\nAs to the air, the buckshawing or dunging toddy trees with fish, occasions in a great measure its unwholesomeness, the buckshaw fly being a plain proof thereof, which, venomous and putrid, swarms in such abundance as to be very nauseous to the inhabitants. If the trees were not buckshawed at all the loss of their fruitfulness would be repaired by the general benefit of rendering the place healthy. Or if the buckshaw was laid at a sufficient depth under the earth it would prevent its corruption and infecting the air and breeding the fly. Another cause is the thickness of the toddy trees in Warli and Mahim woods, which hinders the land breeze that sets in every morning from cleansing the air and cooling the ground. Whereas if those woods were thinned, the remaining trees would bear the better. A second means of purifying the air is to stop the breaches. This may be done as at Karwar without much charge with a sand bank made with a layer of straw or cajans and covered with sand, and then new straw or cajans and sand on that, and so on to make a bank in the nature of a breach or shore,\n\n---\n\n1 Surat Fact.

The cold nitrous quality of the drinking water may be remedied by putting chalk in the Company's well. As regards food cattle sufficient may be kept on Old Woman's and Butcher's islands if a proper person had the charge of looking after them. And vegetables may be obtained by planting the Company's garden with roots and green trade. As the foregoing particulars are conducive to the health of the people, they are to be put in execution, unless good reason exists to the contrary. The Company are contented their rents be diminished by cutting some trees down, and prohibiting the buckshawing the rest so the end of health to the inhabitants be thereby promoted.\n\nIn their letter of the 21st February 1717 the Court write that the Commanders of Europe ships pay the expense of any of their people while in the hospital for the recovery of their health.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 21st September 1720 the Board read the following letter of the previous day from Messrs. B. Midford and O. Phillipps appointed to consider means to lessen the hospital charge: We humbly propose to your Honour, as the quantity of arrack used in drawing cinnamon water and spirit of wine amounts to a considerable sum, that for the future a stock of it for the whole year be laid in by the paymaster at the best hand. That the drugs likewise be bought in by him which must reduce the price when purchased in quantities to a great deal less than what they have been bought at by retail. The victualling the sick, we suppose may be done cheaper by the barrack master, as he is obliged to have a stock of provisions by him for the barracks, than it can be by the physicians who buy it in as it is wanted.\n\nAfter reading the above report the Board order that the land paymaster provide a quantity of drugs and arrack for making spirits sufficient for a year's expense, and that for the future the barrack master victual the sick people in the hospital as formerly.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 5th August 1737 a petition is presented to the Board by Mr. Moreton Peachy surgeon, setting forth that he has been employed in the way of his profession on extraordinary occasions for several years, being sent to Thana on the first troubles there and afterwards to Underi, and is now at Mahim taking care of the sick and wounded belonging to Bandra. Though this employment has occasioned him much trouble and expense he has never had any other consideration or allowance than his pay of Rs. 24 a month. He now humbly submits his case to our consideration. After considering this petition the Board agree it is certain Dr. Peachy has been employed in the manner he\n\n---\n\n1 Comp. of Standing Ord.

Also the commanding officers where he has been have spoken very favourably of his performances. Still were we on this occasion to increase his pay, which we are sensible is a very bare maintenance, the other surgeons of the vessels might make an handle of it to expect the same. For this reason the gratifying him for his past services in general is esteemed more eligible. It is therefore agreed that we give him Rs. 400 which we think he has deserved, and by a computation it does not amount to Rs. 8 a month for the time he has been so employed.\\(^1\\)\n\nAt a Consultation of the 30th June 1738 the Board read a letter from Charles Whitehill and others, dated Bombay 21st June 1738, contrasting the existing staff and pay and the staff and pay the surgeons recommend as suitable. The details are:\\(^2\\)\n\n| Existing: | Rs. |\n|-----------|-----|\n| One Apothecary | 10 |\n| One Purvoe | 10 |\n| One Black Assistant | 6 |\n| Two Servitors | 10 |\n| One Victualman | 5 |\n| Five Halalkhors | 20 |\n| One Washerman | 4 |\n| Candles for the Hospital | 6 |\n| One black Doctor to the Regiment | 12 |\n| Ditto at Mshim | 6 |\n| **Total** | **89** |\n\n| Proposed: | Rs. |\n|-----------|-----|\n| One Apothecary | 10 |\n| One Mate | 10 |\n| Two Purvoes | 15 |\n| Four Assistants | 22 |\n| One Victualman | 5 |\n| Fourteen Servants | 56 |\n| One Washerman | 4 |\n| Four Halalkhors | 16 |\n| Two Assistants for going abroad | 12 |\n| Candles to the Hospital | 6 |\n| **Total** | **156** |\n\nWe are of opinion it will greatly contribute to the people being well taken care of, as well as to the ease of the surgeons, to have the patients divided between them, those entered in one week being assigned to the first surgeon and those of the next week to the other. The allotment to be continued so week and week about. The surgeons advising with each other in every case of importance and particularly when salivations may be thought necessary. Further if both the military and marine officers were frequently to visit the hospital it would be a great encouragement and satisfaction to the sick to find there was so much notice taken of them.\\(^3\\)\n\nOn this letter the Board pass the following orders: It is observed that the recruits our Honourable Masters send hither from England stand them in a very great expense. We therefore think it incumbent on us, though at some additional expense, to do what in us lies and is necessary for the recruits' preservation. And the gentlemen in their said report being of opinion that the servants and assistants at present allowed are not sufficient and that some other small necessaries are wanting for the sick, the Board being desirous that all possible care be taken of the sick people doth agree that the following regulations\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Pub.

But that both constantly visit the hospital and consult with each other in cases of danger. That each surgeon have a key of the medicines. That we positively enjoin the surgeons to preserve a good harmony and agreement with each other as the most likely method to contribute to the relief of the sick. That the officers of the military and marine duly visit the hospital as an encouragement to the sick and observe whether proper care be taken of them and report what they think may be amiss.\n\nA month later, on the 2nd August 1738, Government communicate their decision to Messrs. John Neilson and Michael Weston, Surgeons, in the following letter: Some irregularities in the hospital having been complained of and sundry conveniences being represented to be wanting for the better care of the sick, the President and Council have taken the same into consideration and have thereupon made the following regulations and orders which I am directed to signify to you for your observance: (1) It being represented that the number of servants and attendants at present allowed are not sufficient to take due care of the sick, the President and Council have thought proper to allow the following to be added:\n\n| Position                  | Number | Rs. |\n|---------------------------|--------|-----|\n| One Purvoe Book-keeper    |        | 5   |\n| One Hospital Assistant    |        | 6   |\n| Seven Ward Servants       |        | 28  |\n| One Out-door Assistant    |        | 8   |\n| One Bedding Servant       |        | 5   |\n\nTotal ... 52\n\n(2) The President and Council have given orders to the paymaster for completing the ceilings of two of the rooms in the hospital already begun and to make two dozen screens to keep the sick from the sight of each other. (3) The paymaster is also to purchase 100 bannian shirts, as many drawers and caps, fifty beds, fifty quilts, 100 pillows with sheets and pillow biers for them for the use of the sick. That this number may be always kept up, and if possible without farther charge to the Company, half a month's pay is ordered to be stopped from every soldier or sailor that shall go into the hospital with the venereal distemper to be applied for that purpose. And when any such soldiers or sailors are discharged you are to sign it to the land or marine paymaster respectively that their pay may be stopped accordingly. (4) To prevent the ill effects of people going out of\n\n---\n\n1 Pub.

(5) It is ordered that as they go into the hospital the sick be entered under the care of each surgeon, each surgeon taking one week, but that you both constantly visit the hospital and consult with each other in all cases of danger. (6) That each surgeon have a key of the medicines. (7) As nothing can contribute more to the relief of your patients than preserving a good harmony between you, the same is positively enjoined. (8) The officers of the military and marine are ordered daily to visit the hospital as an encouragement to the sick, and are to observe whether proper care be taken of the sick and report what they find amiss. (9) The Moody's account of hospital charges having pretty much increased of late, you are to take particular care that nothing be charged therein but what is actually used for the hospital.\n\nTwo years later at a Consultation of the 6th June 1740, the President remarked to the Board that although sundry good regulations had been made by this Government from time to time for the well administering the hospital, complaints were still received both from the Military and Marine, insomuch that the people who were sick or distempered seemed averse to repair to the hospital, choosing rather to continue out of it at the hazard of their healths. He continued: As this state of affairs is well worth the consideration of the Board, the following measures are resolved upon, which it is hoped will effectually remedy any disorder or complaint of the like kind in future. It is ordered and appointed as a standing rule that the land paymaster for the time being, the marine paymaster for the time being, and the Captain Commandant do weekly together and in company visit the hospital, enquire into the condition thereof, taking especial notice if the sick are duly attended and provided with proper nourishment, bedding, clothes, and all necessaries, and likewise hear if any complaints are made of any grievance whatever that the same may be forthwith examined into and redress follow. And of this weekly visit or inspection, report to be weekly made in writing to the President signed by the said inspectors, containing their opinion likewise of what necessaries may be wanting or further regulations may be conducive to the good government of the hospital and the accommodation of the sick. The eldest Company's servant is to appoint and notify to the two others the time of meeting and attendance on this visit.\n\nIn obedience to these orders, on the 12th June 1740, the hospital inspectors submit the following report: The hospital cook-room distillery and several of the wards are exceedingly wet and damp. This, as the floors are doubly tiled, we chiefly impute to a large quantity of undrained water lying on the Green at the back part of the cook-room and compound wall. This damp must of consequence make those\n\n---\n\n1 Sec. Out. L. B. 8 of 1738-1741, 9-11.\n2 Pub. Diary 13 of 1739-40, 241-242.\nplaces very unwholesome to the sick. The cook-room and distillery are in so very ruinous a condition as to absolutely require being soon rebuilt. At or before these repairs if a proper stone and chunam drain was made for carrying this water through the hospital or near it, into the sea, the change would in our opinion greatly contribute to the keeping those places dry. It would at the same time render the neighbouring wards of greater use for lodging the sick in than at present they seem to us to be. The back part of the compound next the sea which was very dirty, we have ordered to be daily cleaned. We think if that part of the compound wall was somewhat raised, it would greatly prevent pernicious liquors being brought into the hospital which we are afraid is too often practised, to the great prejudice and endangering the lives of the people. To make the hospital more convenient and wholesome the inspectors made detailed proposals representing a total cost of Rs. 5414.\n\nAfter considering the Hospital Inspectors' report, the Board agree, 20th June 1740, that the beds, banian shirts, drawers, presses for keeping them, and kitchen utensils and screens be instantly provided and laid in at the best hand. The President undertakes to digest and prepare due regulations for their safest keeping and distribution, as well as for the copperware used in the kitchen; all which have hitherto as it appears been under no regular management or control, but remained almost without account. Also for securing the more frequent attendance of the Doctors on the sick; and whatever else may be wanting to the good economy and administration of that place. As to the drain which is mentioned to be necessary, with the other repairs, they are deferred to further consideration, both as the season does not now admit of setting about them, as likewise to gain a clear knowledge of the premises, in order to limit the expense as much as possible.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 27th October 1740, the Board, after considering two reports from the weekly Inspectors of the Hospital, agree in the necessity of raising the several works, and that ceiling the wards, together with the other conveniences recommended for the more commodiously accommodating the sick, may be a means of preserving the lives of such unfortunate people as are obliged to have recourse there, it is agreed that the works be set about. At the same time that we recommend the greatest care be taken the charges do not exceed the calculate annexed to our Consultation of the 20th June last. And that,\n\n---\n\n1 Pub.

This is agreed to and for Mor\u00e1r's encouragement his allowance is increased from Rs. 12 to Rs. 16 a month.\\(^2\\)\n\nOn the 13th March 1743 the Court write: We have resolved to send medicines annually to a certain value for the use of our settlements, be the indents more or less, and not to supply the surgeons with any for their own separate account, as was formerly proposed. If any can be spared and the country ships are supplied with them, or any be made use of by the surgeons in their private practice, they must give an account of the same, and pay the value of all such as are disposed or made use of, with an advance of twenty per cent upon invoice, into our cash. The storekeeper must see that this order is duly complied with.\\(^3\\)\n\nOn the 20th March 1744 the Court again write: As the medicines expended by the surgeons in venereal cases, on the soldiers and seamen, amounted to no more in eight months than eighteen rupees, we acquiesce in your repaying that sum. You add upon this occasion that stoppages create murmurs, so that the men are to be cured in future with our medicines. To this we agree.\\(^4\\)\n\nAt a Consultation of the 30th December 1745 the Board observe: Doctor Trotter, who was sent to Poona in September last at (B\u00e1l\u00e1ji) B\u00e1jirao's particular request to attend him in his illness, being lately returned, presents an account amounting to Rs. 681-2-40 disbursed extraordinarily by him. The said account appearing very reasonable, directed that the land paymaster discharge the same.\\(^5\\)\n\nOn the 14th March 1746 the Board read the following letter from Thomas Marsh and others: Agreeable to an order of this Board we have visited the hospital and shall here lay before your Honour such observations as we judge worthy your notice. We find the hours at present observed by the surgeons in visiting the sick are six or seven in the morning. This appears to us an improper time for the following reasons: Because as they visit but once a day and then order what physic is to be given on the following, at the early hours abovementioned, they cannot so well know whether it will operate or not. Neither can the patients judge of their own state or any alterations the night may have produced on their being just awaked from sleep so well as they might.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Pub.

By that time the surgeons can be informed if what was ordered the day preceding has had the desired effect; and the patients will be better able to give an account of themselves in all other respects necessary to be known before new prescriptions are entered upon. As the afternoon is generally the time for taking in patients one of the surgeons should attend and order what medicines may be proper for them that night as well as to observe what alterations there may be among the rest of the patients since the morning visit. Whether it might not be well to divide the patients between the two surgeons we propose to your consideration. As most of the profession differ something in their practice, if the same patient is prescribed to indifferently by either, it may probably on some critical occasion turn to his prejudice. In dangerous cases the surgeons should advise with each other for the common benefit of the sick under their respective care. Taking notice to the surgeons of the large quantity of port-wine used in the hospital and enquiring whether there might not be cordials given to patients when on recovery that would be equally serviceable and be had on much easier terms, and finding that a cordial may be made of Batavia arrack with spices far preferable in many cases and much cheaper than port it induced us to recommend to the surgeons the practice of it in all such cases, in order to cause some saving in the article of wine. This they promised us to do. On examining the hospital abstract and computing the necessary services we judge three men may be spared and accordingly recommend the striking them off. Here we esteem it our duty to take notice that only two of these are real, the other nominal, whose pay of Rs. 5 a month the head surgeon informs us was an indulgence of Mr. Morley's to him. When these are struck off the allotment will stand thus:\n\n| Appointment                          | Number |\n|--------------------------------------|--------|\n| In the surgery 1 mate and 2 assistants | 3      |\n| A Purvoe to take account of medicines and linen | 1      |\n| Ward Servitors, two to each ward     | 12     |\n| Victualman                           | 1      |\n| Washerman                            | 1      |\n| Barber                               | 1      |\n| Hal\u00e1khors                            | 5      |\n| Black Doctors, one at M\u00e1lh\u00edm and one at Bombay | 2      |\n\nThe above appointments we judge very sufficient for affording the sick due attendance and administering to them in all other necessary respects as well the patients within doors as without. The bedding and some part of the linen appears decent and what is sufficient for the present service as there are but few patients at this season of the year. The cots are rather too short which the land paymaster will see remedied when any new ones are made, and before the rains set in an addition will be wanted to the other articles on the increase of patients usual at that season. Separate cells for lunatics we think would be necessary at a little distance as the noise of people thus afflicted must greatly disturb others labouring under different disorders. Near the\nback gate of the hospital is a place that may be fitted up at a small expense the better to secure these unhappy and sometimes disorderly patients. We think likewise it would be very useful if the hospital servants could be induced to move all within the gates for their better giving attendance in the night time as occasion may require. If your Honour approve, the land paymaster may be ordered to allot them ground for their dwellings, and, if a month or two's pay was advanced them on this account, we judge it would not be ill bestowed and the power of reimbursing the Honourable Company is in your own hands either by stoppages or by causing their said houses to be made over to you, though this we recommend only in case it cannot be afforded without such an advance is made them.\n\nAt the same day's Consultation these suggestions of the Hospital Inspectors were approved and forwarded to the surgeons as standing orders.\u00b9\n\nIn 1750 Mr. Grose writes: Bombay had long borne an infamous character for unhealthfulness. It was commonly called the burying-ground of the English; but this was only until an experience, bought at the expense of a number of lives, had rendered the causes of such a mortality more known, and consequently more guarded against. Among others the principal causes doubtless were, first, the nature of the climate and the precautions and management required by it not being so sufficiently known as they now are. Formerly, too, there obtained a practice esteemed very pernicious to the health of the inhabitants, employing a manure for the cocoanut trees that grow in abundance on the island, consisting of the small fry of fish, and called by the country name buckshaw; which was undoubtedly of great service, both to augment and meliorate their produce; but through its quantity being superficially laid in trenches round the root, and consequently the easier to be exhaled, as it putrefied it diffused a very unwholesome vapour. There are some however who deny this and insist on the ill consequences of this manure to be purely imaginary, or at least greatly exaggerated. But all are agreed that the habitations in the woods or cocoanut groves are unwholesome from the air wanting a free current through them, and from the trees themselves diffusing a kind of vaporous moisture unfavourable to lungs, a complaint common to all close-wooded countries. There has also been another reason assigned for the island having grown healthier from the lessening of the waters by a breach of the sea being banked off. This, however, does not seem to me a satisfactory reason. There is still subsisting a great body of salt water on the inside of the breach, the communication of which with the sea being less free than before the breach was built, must be in proportion more apt to stagnate and breed noxious vapours. The improvement is due therefore more to the different diet and manner of living of the Europeans; and also to the place being provided with more skilful physicians than formerly when there was less niceness in the choice of them. Surgeons and surgeons' mates of ships, and those\n\n\u00b9 Pub.

The same negligence was also observed with respect to the gallies and other armed vessels of the Company in those parts. The pay was too slender to invite into such service any capable persons. Mr. Phipps, one of the former Governors, on examining the marine establishment of Bombay, wherein he proposed making retrenchments by way of currying favour with his Masters at home by the falsest and most ruinous economy, observed the Surgeon's pay rated at Rs. 42 (that is five guineas). Mr. Phipps said the figures are by some mistake transposed, and curtailed the pay to Rs. 24.\n\nWhatever may be the reason the point is certain that the climate is no longer so fatal to the English inhabitants as it used to be, and is incomparably more healthy than that of many other of our settlements in India. The most common disorders are fever, bloody fluxes, cutaneous eruptions, and a sort of tetter called ringworms. The barbeers, a violent disorder that generally ended in rendering all the limbs paralytic, and the mordechin, which is a fit of violent vomiting and purging that often proved fatal, are distempers hardly now known on the island. In short, this place, the name of which used to carry terror with it in respect to its unhealthiness, is now no longer to be dreaded on that account, provided any common measure of temperance be observed without which the tenure of health in any climate must be hazardous.\n\nDistemper, 1757.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 7th June 1757, the new fortification pay-master lays before the Board an account of Rs. 380-3-0 of country medicines supplied since March last to such of the workmen procured from the adjacent countries as have been seized with the present distemper which rages among the natives. As the country doctor who attends the workmen has met with great success, agreed that he be allowed Rs. 20 a month during the time the distemper continues.\n\nSurgeons' House, 1758.\n\nAt a Consultation on the 29th December 1758, the Board received the following letter from the Surgeons of the King's (Seamen's) hospital (on Old Woman's island) through their Admiral Pocock, dated 24th December 1758: The want of a house near the hospital prevents our giving the attendance to the sick we could wish. It also gives the people many opportunities of committing disorders which they would not have if under our nearer inspection. It further affords the servants an opportunity of absenting themselves from attending the sick with many other inconveniences in provisions. We beg leave to mention a Company's house near the Hospital where Mr. Ives lived and is now in possession of a single woman who has made frequent complaints of inconveniences from the people.\n\nOn the same day (29th December) the Board pass the following orders: Agreed we acquaint the Admiral that as we are very willing, as far as lies in our power, to remove the want of those conveniences complained of by the Surgeons, we shall desire Mr. W.

Silvanus and Timothy Bevan ... Six-tenths.\nMessrs. Alexander Johnston and Co. ... Three-tenths.\nThe Company of Apothecaries ... One-tenth.\n\nThe medicines and drugs consigned to you will, therefore, be distinguished accordingly on purpose that, for our future government in the provision of them, we may be informed of the goodness and quality of those respectively furnished by the said parties. You are therefore to cause the most exact enquiry to be made as to their goodness and quality and send us an impartial report of the result by the first opportunity.\\(^2\\)\n\nA Consultation of the 11th February 1768 records: Notwithstanding the latitude our Honourable Masters are pleased to give us for removing the hospital, it is agreed for the present to defer coming to any resolution regarding it. At the same time, as it has often been represented and as we are thoroughly satisfied, the present hospital is much too small, and as the Surgeons have frequently expressed the opinion to the President that if the hospital built some years ago on Old Woman's island for the King's seamen was converted into a convalescent hospital that inconvenience would be effectually remedied and the sick recover much faster the air being remarkably good. It is therefore agreed to fit up the Old Woman's island hospital properly and appropriate it to the use of a convalescent hospital.\\(^3\\)\n\nOn the 6th April after considering the estimate the Board observe: The estimate of the expense which will be incurred by repairing the hospital at Old Woman's island, running a wall round the whole, and dividing the two buildings in order to render them more convenient for a convalescent hospital, amounting altogether to Rs. 1591-3-4, is to be carried into execution.\\(^4\\)\n\nA few months later the question of hospital accommodation was again before Government. In a Consultation of the 18th October 1768 the Principal Engineers Colonels Campbell and Keating were required to survey the present hospital and report whether in their opinion it is a proper one in point of situation size and accommodations for the sick. If not, how its defects can best be remedied.\\(^5\\)\n\nIn a letter of the 18th March 1768, the Court write: Victualling the sick in the hospital is a matter of great importance for the preser-\n\n---\n\n1 Pub.

We think it necessary that a proper person should be appointed as steward to the hospital who is to supply all provisions that may be thought proper. The surgeons who attend will have an opportunity of seeing whether the steward furnishes such provisions as are wholesome. The military officers must also send surgeons belonging to that corps to see their own people and make their report every day to the commanding officer, which will be very proper checks.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 3rd January 1769 the Board read the following letter from the surgeons of the hospital, dated 3rd January 1769: We, having laboured under many difficulties in our situation, beg leave to relate them to your Honour requesting you will represent them to our Honourable Masters. We are sorry to find, when every department of the Honourable Company's service is enjoying the good effects of the Honourable Company's bounty, ours alone is not taken notice of. The station which as gentlemen we are obliged to support, to procure us some degree of respect, our income falls very short of doing. The whole of our allowance is about Rs. 900 a year and every gentleman of this Honourable Board is sensible how short this goes to support a family. The bad health we often incur by following this troublesome fatiguing and dangerous profession, should, we think, entitle us to some little satisfaction. But from the smallness of our income, and the example of our deceased predecessors we have but little hopes, and never expect to get to England to spend the remainder of our days in quiet. As we then give up this hope we humbly presume to think we ought to have some indulgences here. On account of a number of our patients at times living out of town, we are under the necessity of keeping a conveyance to visit them. For this we have no allowance. This is a great hardship on us, for without we have a carriage of our own, we often can neither hire nor borrow one. If we apply to merchants to support us, it is said we neglect our business. Our advantages by private practice are trifling as we are paid or not as is agreeable to the Honourable Company's civil or military servants, they looking on us as obliged to attend them by reason of our station. The surgeons at Bengal upon a representation to the President and Council, were redressed and a tolerable allowance given them. We think we ought to have an equal allowance, or more, as we have more business and of course can less apply to any other way to support us, there being six surgeons of the hospital at Calcutta and only three here, and the troops are mostly in cantonments by which the doctors' trouble is less. We hope that these considerations will induce your Honour either to represent this our case to the Honourable Company to give us the same allowance as the surgeons of the hospital at Calcutta enjoy, or any other allowance that is agreeable to them, or yourselves, to improve this our situation as we really have not money to support our station without following some other employment.\n\n1 Pub.

As we are sensible of the justice and goodness of our Honourable Masters, we do engage to bind ourselves and heirs, provided your Honour will give us the Rs. 310 a month allowed to the surgeons at Calcutta, to return the money with interest if our Honourable Masters disapprove of the concession. On the surgeons' letter the Board observe: We have already by the Greenwich set forth their case to the Honourable Company, and it is now again agreed to enforce the same in our address by the Calcutta. And, as we are fully sensible of the justice of what the surgeons represent, strongly to recommend their request to the Honourable Company's consideration.\n\nThe estimate of Rs. 1591-3-4 sanctioned on the 6th April 1768 for the conversion of the naval hospital on Old Woman's island into a convalescent hospital proved insufficient. At a Consultation of the 7th February 1769, the land paymaster showed that one part of the building must be converted into quarters for a Resident Surgeon. The amended estimate amounting to Rs. 9324-0-16, was sanctioned and the work ordered to be carried into immediate execution.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 28th February 1769 the commanding officer having represented to the President the necessity of having an hospital for the sepoys, as great inconveniences have been found to arise to the service from such of them as are sick being dispersed about the island, ordered that the land paymaster prepare and lay before the Board an estimate of the expense that will be incurred by building a shed to be used for the above purpose.\n\nA Consultation of the 30th July 1769 has the following entry: As many irregularities and neglects of the sick in their quarters have been found to arise from the surgeons of the several battalions acting in their practice independent of any one of their profession. It is therefore agreed to appoint a surgeon-major to the garrison, to whom the surgeons must be accountable for their proceedings and who must also have inspection of the sepoy hospital when finished. The surgeon-major will receive the ten shillings a day as allowed at the other Presidencies.\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 53 of 1769, 5, 8-10.\n2 Pub. Diary 53 of 1769, 210.\n3 Pub.

Mr. Samuel Richardson being esteemed a proper person for the office is accordingly appointed.\\footnote{Pub. Diary 54 of 1769, 525.}\n\nIn answer to Bombay Government letter of the 18th April 1768, the Court in their letter dated 31st March 1769 write: It being of very great consequence to the healths of our civil and military servants that our surgeons should be men of abilities and eminence in their profession; And as you represent the present allowances are by no means adequate to the trouble and expense they are necessarily obliged to incur and are not a sufficient encouragement for men eminent, or even for those of but a moderate share of knowledge, in physic and surgery to go to the East Indies, as our civil and military lines have of late years been considerably enlarged, we have determined to increase the allowances to our surgeons at the Presidency in the following manner: To the two head surgeons \u00a3150 and to the third and fourth \u00a3125 a year each, exclusive of house rent in order to encourage them to persevere in exerting their utmost skill and abilities in their profession.\\footnote{Pub. Dep. Court's Letters Vol. 8 of 1769 - 1771, 50 - 51.}\n\nIn another letter of the 6th April 1770, the Court continue: By our general letter 31st March 1769, paragraph 97, you were informed of such an additional allowance made to surgeons at your Presidency as will, we hope, render the situation of those who are there agreeable, and be a sufficient inducement for men of abilities to embrace our service; when it becomes necessary to entertain others therein.\\footnote{Pub. Dep. Court's Letters Vol. 8 of 1769 - 1771, 154 - 155.}\n\nIn the same letter (paragraph 160) the Court write: From a remarkable account of a cure being effected in the disorder of the liver, communicated to us by a gentleman of rank in our military service at Bombay, by the means of castor oil, which we are told in the East Indies is known by the name of erandi oil, we have taken the opinion of a physician of great eminence upon the case as stated. And we herewith send you for the information of the surgeons and other persons at your settlement who are skilled in physic, extracts of the letters upon the occasion both from the physician and the gentlemen who received the cure. Should you at any time be made acquainted with any extraordinary cases, and any new method of cure which has been attended with success you will do well to send us a circumstantial detail of such cases properly attested, to enable us, for the public good, to communicate such cases to the learned among the faculty, and to take their advice and opinion thereupon.\\footnote{Pub. Dep. Court's Letters Vol. 8 of 1769 - 1771, 200 - 201.}\n\nAt a Consultation of the 29th January 1771, the Board read the following letter from the surgeons of the hospital, dated 15th January 1771: We have likewise duly attended the Honourable Court's commands in the 160th paragraph of their letter of the 6th April relative to the use of castor oil in disorders of the liver. We are\nsorry that the extracts of the letters from the physician and gentlemen therein mentioned are not come to hand. We have to observe that, in some particular cases and stages of the disorder called the liver, castor oil will bring on a copious discharge of the obstructed bilious humours, when mercurials, emetics, and other drastic medicines, also those of the lenient and anti-phlogystic kind with tepid bathing, will have no effect. From the conveniency of having it fresh we find castor oil a very useful medicine in many complaints particularly those of the biliary kind. In the same letter the surgeons return thanks for the additional salary granted them by their Honourable Masters, and make their remarks on the medicines received by the ships hitherto arrived. Ordered that this letter follow this Consultation, and that copies of the letters relative to the virtues of castor oil which have just been received in the True Briton's packet be transmitted to the surgeons for their notice and observation.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 28th December 1770 the Board read the following report from the Hospital Committee dated 26th November 1770: Having lately visited the hospital as a committee we lay before your Honour such observations as occurred to us in the course of our examination. The stated allowance of provisions appears to us to be very proper and perfectly sufficient. But as the men on recovery, under pretence of sending into the baz\u00e1r for tea and sugar, get supplied with many other articles improper for them, we would propose that tea and sugar be allowed at the Company's expense under the head of country medicines to be given by the doctors to those patients they judge it proper for. As we are of opinion that the soldiers and sailors who have venereal complaints are frequently deterred from discovering them, and sometimes remain so long out that they become almost incurable, owing to their being charged for it out of their pay, we would propose that this expense be paid by the Honourable Company and some other equivalent be made the surgeons in lieu thereof. As the hospital at Old Woman's island consists of three long ranges of buildings, we would propose that in agreement with the surgeons' advice each be divided into three wards and that all the patients who have fevers fluxes and such like complaints be kept at that hospital and only such as have venereal complaints, wounds, and other casualties be continued in the hospital in town. That the Battalion Surgeons be ordered to attend at Old Woman's island in turn one every month to assist the surgeons of the convalescent hospital who are both to act under the directions of the general hospital surgeons who are also to act in turn and to visit once or twice every day the hospital at Old Woman's island. We judge it necessary that for this purpose a conveyance should be allowed them and it will be also necessary that one or two boats be kept in constant pay to carry over the servants' provisions and necessaries.\n\nOn this report the Board resolve that, agreeable to the committee's recommendation, the surgeons must supply such patients with tea and sugar as they may judge requisite, charging the expense\n\n---\n\n1 Pub, Diary 57 of 1771, 73, 74.  \n2 Pub, Diary 56 of 1770, 816 - 817.\nthereof in their bill for country medicines. The Board reject the committee's suggested compensation to the surgeons for relinquishing their claim to the usual charge for the cure of venereal complaints holding it contrary to the practice of all hospitals. At the same time as the surgeons' daily provision allowance of 15 res is inadequate the Board agree to increase this allowance 5 res a day and that the surgeons do not in future charge anything to their patients for venereal complaints. The Board further resolved that the Hospital at Old Woman's island be fitted for the reception of such patients as the committee mentions, and the several other alterations recommended by them be carried into execution with all convenient speed concerning which the necessary orders must be given to the proper officers.\n\nIn a letter of the 25th April 1771 the Court of Directors write: We have received very extraordinary accounts of the efficacy of a medicine for the cure of dysentery and all inward bleedings. As these accounts are supported by the testimony of several persons of consequence who have experienced its salutary effects in the West Indies and other parts of the world, we could not hesitate about giving this medicine a trial, in hopes of its preventing the loss of many persons in India, where such numbers are carried off by that dreadful disorder. With this view we send in the Godfrey packet some bottles of this medicine with directions enclosed in a box. It is particularly recommended that the surgeons of your Presidency be strictly enjoined to give this medicine a fair trial and to report the result.\n\nA Consultation of 1st October 1771 records: As the convalescent hospital at Old Woman's island is reported to be fitted up and ready for the reception of the sick as their general hospital, ordered that the surgeons remove them from the hospital in town conformable to our intention expressed in our minute of the 28th December last regarding it. The land paymaster is also ordered to erect a proper room at that place for the hospital guard room.\n\nA Consultation of 14th April 1772 records: A stoppage of Rs. 7 a month is to be made from the pay of each soldier in the hospital, and Rs. 8 a month from the pay of each sailor, to commence from the 1st of next month. This will cause a considerable reduction in the hospital charges and we hope be a means of preventing those people going to the hospital and continuing there without cause.\n\nA Consultation of 17th December 1773 records: We have reason to believe that with proper regulations such as we now propose to establish the business and expense of the hospital may be conducted more to the advantage of the Honourable Company when the expense of the hospital is immediately defrayed by them than when it is contracted for. As the contract entered into last year is now\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 56 of 1770, 812-813.\n2 Pub. Dep. Court's Letters Vol. 8 of 1769-1771, 274.\n3 Pub. Diary 58 of 1771, 966.\n4 Pub.

The following, we are of opinion, will fully answer the above purpose, which we subject to your Honours' consideration:\n\n| Moro Shiv\u00e1j\u00ed Purvoe per month | Rs. 28 |\n|-------------------------------|--------|\n| Do.

The details are:\n\n| Assistants | Rs. |\n|------------|-----|\n| Mr. March  | Rs. 76 |\n| Mr. Crozier| Rs. 76 |\n| Mr. Fleeming| Rs. 66 |\n| Mr. King   | Rs. 40 |\n| Mr. Tomkins| Rs. 30 |\n| Mr. Diderot| Rs. 40 |\n| Joseph Mathews| Rs. 30 |\n| Joseph Cabral| Rs. 30 |\n\nFrom the representation of the surgeons we find that Messrs. King Tomkins and Diderot are of very little use to the hospital as they cannot be relied upon either for compounding or dispensing of medicines. Consequently they are an incumbrance upon the hospital and incur unnecessary expense. We have reduced the pay of Moroji head Purvoe to what it formerly was, Rs. 28 a month. But in consideration of his long services, and from the strong recommendations of the surgeons in his favour, we have been induced to allow him a monthly gratuity of Rs. 12, which we hope will meet your Honour's approbation.\n\nOn this letter the Board observe: The Committee of the hospital report to the Board by letter now read pursuant to order, the wages proper to be given and the number of servants necessary in the hospital which is approved. It is ordered, as two of the assistant surgeons, mentioned in the report to be an incumbrance only, came\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 64 of 1773, 855. Comp. of Standing Ord.

In the convalescent hospital during the same month (January 1774) of 2372 sick, 434 had intermitting fever, 1160 fluxes, 180 liver, 34 piles, 174 rheumatism, 13 inflammation of the scalp, 14 jaundice, 31 ophthalmia, 131 uretic cases, 31 enlarged testis, 31 epilepsy, 31 worms, 70 asthma, and 38 consumption.\n\nDuring the twelve months from the 1st May 1775 to the 30th April 1776 the European Hospitals had an average monthly attendance of 148, each costing on an average Rs. 40-2-14 a month. Of a total expenditure of Rs. 82,444, Rs. 10,522 were recovered on account of stoppages, leaving a net outlay of Rs. 71,922. In the sepoy hospital an average monthly attendance of 195 at an average monthly cost of Rs. 12-2-13 represented a total outlay of Rs. 34,884 and after deductions (Rs. 5554) for stoppages a net outlay of Rs. 29,330. Besides the expenditure on the two hospitals, Rs. 18,271 were spent on a private dispensary, Rs. 15,107 on medicines sent to subordinate stations, Rs. 4940 on medicines for the marine service, and Rs. 530 on medicines for the Madras Battalion. To this total (less stoppages) of Rs. 140,100 is to be added Rs. 9248, the value of medicines and utensils received from England, and Rs. 14,000 the yearly pay and allowances of the hospital surgeons, that is, during the year under report a total net outlay on health of Rs. 163,348.\n\nOn the 24th April 1781, Rear Admiral Sir Edward Hughes in writing to Government regarding the docks says: The extent of the marine yard as it is at this time, is much too small to give room for the necessary quantities of timber and workmen. I earnestly recommend that you will extend it so as to comprehend the two surgeons' homes and the hospital on that side. On this letter at a Consultation of the 13th June 1781, Government resolve: The surgeons must be directed to report to us what place may be most suitable and convenient to remove the hospital to. Agreeably to the above order the Surgeons report on the 19th June 1781: We have been honoured with a letter from your Secretary of the 13th instant directing us to report to your Honour what place would be most suitable and convenient to remove the general hospital to. In obedience thereto and after mature consideration on the qualities so highly requisite to be attended to in the\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 64 of 1773, 892-894, 903-904.\n2 Pub.

Diary 78 of 1781, 311.\nchoice of places for hospitals in this climate, on which the speedy recovery of the sick so materially depends, and in some degree the health and strength of the garrison, we do recommend the house the Admiral lately occupied, that is Mr. William Hornby\u2019s house, as the most convenient and suitable for a general hospital. The situation is high, dry, healthy, and convenient; the apartments are very spacious, lofty, dry, and airy; indeed they are so well adapted as to admit of a free circulation of air through the whole of them in every season of the year, a circumstance of the greatest importance in an hospital. The out-offices are also convenient with the command of good water. The space is sufficient to accommodate 400 sick Europeans, allowing from 42 to 64 square feet to each man. We are of opinion that there is not in or near this garrison any place or building equally convenient, healthy, and commodious for the purpose of a hospital.\n\nOn receipt of the Surgeons\u2019 letter on the 20th June 1781 Government resolve: Before we consider this subject, a plan should be prepared and laid before us for our approbation of a suitable hospital for this garrison constructed with bomb-proof apartments for the reception of the sick in case of a siege.\n\nAgreeably to the above order a plan and estimate for a new hospital were submitted to Government, on receipt of which, the 26th September 1781, the Board record: Read a letter from the Principal Engineer accompanied with a plan and estimate of a bomb-proof hospital for this garrison. From this it appears that the expense thereof is computed at the large sum of Rs. 5,15,025-0-27. The expense of this undertaking, even allowing it should not exceed the estimate, is too great for us to think of incurring in our present circumstances. At the same time that we may be judges of the whole expense and the plan be digested and prepared in all its parts, in case at any time hereafter it should be judged proper to carry it into execution, the Engineer must be directed to give in an estimate of the expense of removing the houses necessary to make room for this building. The Surgeons must also give in their opinion on the situation and construction of the proposed hospital with respect to healthiness and convenience.\n\nIn his Oriental Memoirs (Vol. I. 152) Mr. Forbes says: When I left Bombay (1781) there were three large hospitals, one within the gates for Europeans, another on the esplanade for the sepoys or native troops in the Company\u2019s service, and a third on an adjacent island (Old Woman\u2019s island) for convalescents.\n\nThe earliest reference that has been traced to vaccination is in the Tours of Dr. Hov\u00e9 the Polish savant, who, when in Bombay in December 1788, wrote: Mr. Farmer has inoculated about 1300 old and young out of which he did not lose more than two. This has remarkably abated the small-pox.\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 78 of 1781, 332.\n2 Pub. Diary 78 of 1781, 326.\n3 Pub. Diary 78 of 1781, 453 - 454.\n4 Tours in Bom, Gov., Sel. XVI. 194. Dr. Hov\u00e9 says (same page): Small-pox has appeared in Bombay since the possession and commerce of Europeans. Small-pox, like measles, seems to have been known in India and China several centuries before the rise of Islam.\nOn the 14th August 1801, the Bombay Government write to the Court: We have the honour to enclose No. 7 in the packet copy of a letter from the Medical Board relative to the vaccine small-pox on which we have earnestly to solicit your Honourable Court's assistance for the secure transmission of the matter to this country either in the manner suggested by them or in any other that may appear to your Honourable Court still more efficacious and likely to succeed. Our President has written on the same subject to the Earl of Elgin, and the Residents at Basra and Bagdad have also been instructed by our Secretary to further the Medical Board's recommendations.\n\nOn the 4th February 1803, the Court reply: We shall endeavour to comply with your request in the matter of the vaccine small-pox.\n\nOn the 7th April 1803, the Bombay Government write to the Court: By the present opportunity we have the honour to forward to your Honourable Court twenty copies of a pamphlet recently published at this Presidency by Doctor George Keir of your medical establishment containing an account of the introduction of the cow-pox into India. At the same time we deem it no more than justice to that gentleman to notice that his zealous exertions have proved a principal means of securing the blessing of the discovery to this island and of its diffusion hence to every part of India.\n\n(Nidana, 191-193) and to have spread from Asia to Europe. Still Dr. Hove's information may be so far correct that with the Portuguese a fresh or a fiercer form of smallpox may have been brought into Western India. If, to this extent, Dr. Hove's statement is correct, it explains how the small-pox Mother is Sita the Cold, and how she cannot be pacified till she is made cool. Also the fact that many images of Sita are of a woman carrying a child in her arm not on her hip; and finally why the begging devotees of Sita call themselves Padres or European priests and are perhaps the only religious Hindu beggars who as of right ask alms of Europeans.\n\n1 Pub.

This bungalow then known as No. 2, the Commodore\u2019s Bangalow, was purchased by Government in 1860 for Rs. 14,877.\\(^1\\)\n\nIn 1864 the Secretary of State directed (Bombay Government Resolution No. 233 dated 4th April 1864) the Bombay Government to provide a house for the Admiral, who, instead of a Commodore, was then about to be appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Naval forces. The Admiral was to be given Rs. 12,000 a year special allowances and to be provided with servants to the extent of Rs. 100 a month. These allowances were to be paid with strictness. In accordance with this despatch the bungalow in the Marine Lines was allotted and furnished and the Admiral took possession of it on the 22nd of November 1864. His Secretary writing on the 1st December 1864 heads his letter Admiralty Bangalow.\n\nThe earliest known reference to an Admiralty House is in 1754. Dr. Ives (Voyage from England to India, 1754, page 34) notices as the place where the Admiral stays Tank House so called from the neighbouring tank. He adds: The Admiral had a chaise and pair of oxen, for Indian horses were scarce and of little value, and used to drive to Malab\u00e1r hill, the end of Old Woman\u2019s island, Marmulla (that is M\u00e1l\u00e1 M\u00e1l\u00e1 the cocopalm orchard perhaps the spot in M\u00e1him still known as Man Mala but more probably a general term for the M\u00e1him palm-woods), and other places. This Tank House seems to have been built as a Government House by Sir J. Wybourne (Deputy Governor, 1686-1690). A deed of 1715 (Collector\u2019s Deed File, Record No. 35) describes the boundaries of Sir J. Wybourne\u2019s house as east the road to the shipping; west the Green, north the new Smiths\u2019 shops, south the Honourable Company\u2019s Bandar. This is the same house which was bought from a Mr. John Hill for the Company in February 1715 for Rs. 3000 and sold to the same Mr. John Hill in December 1719 (1715?).\n\n\\(^1\\) Return of Public Military Buildings (Bombay Defences Division) corrected up to 31st March 1881. This sum of Rs. 14,877 includes the cost of new servants\u2019 quarters erected in 1866.\nfor Rs. 180 (Warden's Landed Tenures, Bombay Government Selection LXIV. 83).\n\nThat the tank from which Tank House took its name was close to if not on the site of the circular tank to the north of the Town Hall, is shown by entries in the Bombay Diary of the 3rd and 27th August 1742 (Bombay Town Materials, I. 252) regarding the necessity of building a wall from the pay office to the Tank House to prevent the large tank near the foot barracks and fronting the fort from being fouled by bathers and cattle. Nine years later (1751) in his map of Bombay (Voyage to the East Indies, I. 29) Grose shows Tank House on this same site. When no Admiral was stationed in Bombay, Tank House was at this time still used as Government House. About 11 o'clock on the 17th November 1750 (Public Diary 23 of 1750, 412) the Governor, the Honourable William Wake, attended by the Honourable Company's covenanted servants and the leading inhabitants of the place went from the Tank House to the waterside. At his going off Mr. Wake was saluted with three volleys of small arms from part of the Regiment posted there and twenty-one guns from the Fort which was answered from the Boscowen who immediately set sail being met at the mouth of the harbour by His Majesty's ship Tartar which sailed with her to a proper distance to the westward. So in 1757 and 1758 Government support their application to buy Mr. John Spencer's house, the present Old Secretariat, as a Government House for Rs. 15,161-0-91, by explaining that the Tank House (Bombay Town Materials, I. 315-316 and Letters to the Court Vol. 5 of 1758, 75) is occasionally wanted to accommodate the Admirals on their coming to Bombay. The Diary of the 20th May 1761 (Volume 36 of 1761, 409-410 and Public Department Letters to the Court Volume 8 of 1761, 122) contains the following reference to Tank House as Admiralty House: About 9 o'clock this morning departed this life of a sort of apoplexy Charles Steevens Esq. Rear Admiral of the Red Squadron of His Majesty's ships and the East India Company's armed vessels employed in the East Indies. The colours of the Fort and of all the ships in the road were immediately struck half staff and the necessary orders issued for solemnizing his funeral in a manner suitable to his rank. Accordingly about six o'clock in the evening the President and Council and other European inhabitants with Admiral Cornish all the captains and most of the officers of His Majesty's ships met at the Tank House where the corpse lay, the garrison under arms lining the street from thence to the church. At about half-past six the procession began and marched in the following order: First a Brigade of artillery consisting of four pieces with a proper number of gunners to serve them. Next a detachment of 200 men commanded by a field officer with their arms reversed, the drums and fifes playing a dead march, then the boys of the charity school, and after them the corpse, the pall being supported by six of the senior captains of the squadron. The Governor and Admiral Cornish followed as chief mourners, and after them the rest of the captains of His Majesty's ships, the Members of Council and other principal inhabitants and officers of the Squadron walking two and two. On the\ncorpse leaving the house the Norfolk, on which the Admiral hoisted his flag, by a signal from the Fort began to fire half-minute guns which was continued till every ship in the road had fired each twenty. Again when the body was laid in the ground the detachment of 200 men fired three volleys and the Fort fifty-six (the age of the deceased) half-minute guns. The ships ceased firing about 10 o'clock at night. The whole was conducted with the most solemn pomp and regularity and all the honours possible to the deceased.\n\nA month later Admiral Steevens' successor, Admiral Samuel Cornish (Pub. Diary 37 of 1761, 566), wrote from Tank House to Government: I am sorry to be under the necessity of acquainting you that I find the situation of the house at present appointed for me extremely disagreeable. It affects my health and being near the Tank is so full of vermin as to render it hardly habitable. I desire that a house may be procured more favourable to my position as a commanding officer. I am informed Mr. Charles Whitehill's house is untenanted. As, from its connection with the Dockyard and the view it affords of the harbour, its situation is very well calculated for a commanding officer's residence, I shall be much obliged if you will please to appoint that house for my residence.\u00b9 When Admiral Cornish wrote, Mr. Whitehill was absent at Mokha. On his return in August Mr. Whitehill agreed (Letter to Government dated 13th August 1761, Pub. Diary 37 of 1761, 566 - 567) to let his house to the Company for two or three years. He pointed out that the warehouses on the ground floor gave a monthly rent of Rs. 205. He offered to let the house at any rent the Government might fix provided they kept it in repair and furnished him with another house to live in. Government suggested Rs. 350 a month and Mr. Whitehill agreed. In their letter of the 10th April 1762 (Bombay Town Materials, II, 467), in informing the Court of Directors of this transaction, Government contended the rent was moderate considering how much of the amount could be recovered from letting the warehouses. In their reply, dated the 6th April 1763, the Court did not accept the Bombay view of the transaction. The Court could not but think Mr. Whitehill's house pretty dear at Rs. 350 a month especially when they had to keep it in repair and also to provide another house for Mr. Whitehill. The question arises where was Mr. Whitehill's house. It was near the Dockyard and commanded a view of the harbour. Another statement (Pub. Diary 37 of 1761, 566 - 567) notes that two of the warehouses under it were close to the Church and another was close to Mr. Hornby's house. It seems probable that this should be Mr. Hunter's house. In spite of these somewhat perplexing details there seems no reason to doubt that this Admiralty House was on the site of the north-west corner of Elphinstone Circle, now occupied partly by Kemp's Buildings partly by the building at present used as offices by the B. B. & C. I. Railway Company.\n\n\u00b9Mr. Whitehill seems to have recently completed this house. In his Landed Tenures of Bombay (Bom. Gov. Sel. LXIV. 47, MS. Sel. 54, 81) Mr. Warden writes on the 20th August 1814 paragraph 121: It is within the recollection of some of the inhabitants now living that previous to the year 1764 this site was a tank which was filled by Mr. Whitehill and the house built.\nBefore the three years were over, on the 13th May 1764 (Pub. Diary 40 of 1763, 324 and 42 of 1764, 292), the Admiral and Mr. Richard Collins the Commander in His Majesty's Weymouth and other ships left Bombay for the Malabar Coast and Madras. Soon after, in October 1764, this and a neighbouring house belonging to Mr. John Hunter were (Bombay Town Materials, II. 469 - 470) bought for the Secretary's and other public offices. These buildings were still used as public offices at the time of the 1813 survey whose details settle their position at the north-west corner of Elphinstone Circle. (Compare below Secretariat.) After the transfer, in 1829, of the Secretariat offices from this site to the present Old Secretariat, the buildings to the north of the Cathedral were used by the Military Department and were known as the Military Staff buildings. In 1864 during the Share Mania time they were (Government Resolution, General Department, No. 1328 dated 1st August 1864, and Bombay Collector's Compilation No. 626-S. of 1863) sold by Government in several lots to different persons, the total realising Rs. 6,64,138, an amount six times as great as the Rs. 1,05,000 paid a century before.

This house, which is still one of the finest on the island, stands in the Bombay Collector's rent roll in Mr. William Hornby's name for the first time in 1771-72.\u00b9 Mr. Hornby was President and\n\n\u00b9 For previous entries showing in whose names this house stood before 1771-72, see below Great Western Hotel.\n\nBetween 1764 and 1770 it is probable some house other than Mr. Hornby's may have been rented occasionally for the Admiral or the Naval Commander-in-Chief. On the 15th September 1769 the Court write (Pub. Dep. Court's Letters Vol. 8 of 1769-1771, 114-115 and Compilation of Standing Orders Vol. 2 of 1759-1788, 341): Notwithstanding the directions in the 15th paragraph of our letter of the 8th instant (to pay at the rate of Rs. 16 or 40 shillings a day to defray the expense of house rent), as it has since appeared that the commanding officer of His Majesty's Naval forces in the East Indies has been provided with a house, you are therefore to accommodate Sir John Lindsay or the Commander-in-Chief of His Majesty's ships for the time being while he shall reside at your Presidency with a handsome and commodious house at our expense as has been usual. Next year, on the 3rd December 1770, the Bombay Government write to the Court (Pub. Dep. Letters to the Court Vol. 17 of 1770, 136 and Pub. Diary 55 of 1770, 358, 377): Sir John Lindsay on the 3rd July addressed us a letter on the subject of his allowance and enclosed us copy of a letter to him from Mr. Secretary Michell, dated some days after his instructions, whereby it appeared to be your intentions during his stay at any of your Presidencies he should be allowed a handsome and commodious house. We therefore ordered the rent of the house he had occupied here to be good, and are glad to find the same is conformable to your orders of 15th September 1769 since received.\nGovernor from 1771 to 1784 during which period he may have enlarged and improved the building; Mr. Hornby's house must have been used as Admiralty House before 1781. In that year (24th April 1781, Bombay Town Materials, II. 201-203) Admiral Sir Edward Hughes recommended the removal of the hospital and of the two surgeons' houses from the Marine Yard (the present Dockyard). When the decision of the Naval Authorities was communicated to them the Medical Authorities (19th June 1781, Pub. Diary 78 of 1781, 326) gladly offered to leave the Marine Yard provided the house the Admiral lately occupied with its high dry and healthy rooms, its convenient out-houses, and its spacious accommodation fit to receive 400 sick Europeans was made over to them as an hospital. As this proposal did not find favour Mr. Hornby's house continued to be the Admiralty House. In the following year (October 1782), at a monthly rent of Rs. 2000, Government leased Mr. Hornby's house for ten years to serve as an Admiralty House. In 1786 (Bombay Town Materials, II. 488-490) part of the house was set aside for the records of the Mayor's Court and another part for the Court House; but in 1788 the Court was turned out to make room (Pub. Diary 11th March 1788, Vol. 92 of 1788, 221) for the officers of the 71st Regiment as no other house was unoccupied. At the end (1792) of the ten years' lease Government continued to hold part of the building at a monthly rent of Rs. 800. The reason why the Court was turned out of Hornby House in favour of the officers of the 71st Regiment is to be found in a letter of the Court of Directors dated the 25th January 1782 (Pub. Dep. Court's Letters Vol. 10 of 1778-1782, 297-298, 335): We are sorry to observe, notwithstanding our express command that His Majesty's forces should be properly accommodated with barracks or places to lodge in when not in the field and that in general the same attention should be paid to their welfare as to that of the Company's own troops, there should have been any ground of complaint on the above account from Fort St. George. Copy of a letter from Lord Macleod to the Secretary at War and of his letter to us on the subject are transmitted for your further information, and we now most positively enjoin you to take effectual care that every proper and necessary accommodation be made for the reception of His Majesty's troops on their arrival at your Presidency. The Court continue: The Admiral or Commander-in-Chief of the Navy in India must also be accommodated with a proper house and two houses must be provided for the captains; but be the number of captains ever so great we cannot allow more than two houses for their reception on shore at the expense of the Company.\n\nReferring to these orders on the 30th September 1783 (Pub. Dep. Letters to the Court Vol. 27 of 1783-84, 28-27; Pub. Diary 80 of 1782, 588-589, 602-603; Pub. Dep. Letters to the Court 10th February 1784, Vol. 27 of 1783-84, 117) Government write to the Court: It being necessary to provide a proper house for the accommodation of the Commander-in-Chief of the fleet in India as directed in your commands of the 25th of January 1782, and there being no other in the place either in point of situation or convenience or in any other respect so well adapted for his residence as a house in the\nApollo street belonging to the President which was occupied by Admiral Hughes when he was at Bombay the time before last, the same being very spacious and commodious and contiguous to and commanding a full view of the docks; And as we were certain that this house would be most agreeable to the Admiral, we requested the President in Council the 25th October last (1782) to acquaint us on what conditions he was willing to let it. He informed us that he would agree to let it to the Honourable Company with all the warehouses and appurtenance at the monthly rent of Rs. 2000 provided it was taken for the term of ten years certain, but not for a shorter time. This offer having been considered and a schedule of the house and warehouses being laid before us, we observed that the whole of the warehouses would be required and indeed were then mostly occupied for the Company's service. And that after deducting their rent the remainder of the house allotted for the Admiral's residence would only amount to Rs. 1095, which, in case of the fleet quitting India, may be applied to other useful and necessary purposes. We therefore resolved for the above reasons to take the house on account of the Honourable Company at the rent offered for the term of ten years provided you should approve of it. But should you signify your disapprobation thereat and give orders for that purpose, it was made a special agreement that upon due notice being given to the owner of such disapprobation the lease of the house for the remainder of the time that might be unexpired was to be null and void and the Company be liable for the rent for such period, only as the house may have been occupied on their account. It was also agreed that the house was to be in perfect repair when received on the part of the Company, after which common and incidental repairs such as whitewashing and glazing, were to be at the expense of the Company.\n\nIn 1800 when the new Recorder's Court was established in the main\n\n---\n\n1 The schedule or account of Mr. Hornby's Large House contains the following particulars (Pub. Diary 80 of 1782, 602-603): Warehouses, one large warehouse separated from the house, estimated at the monthly rent of Rs. 230; six large warehouses under the body of the house, Rs. 500; six large warehouses under the back veranda, Rs. 80; one large warehouse or stable in the yard, Rs. 40; two warehouses or godowns in the yard, Rs. 40; three small warehouses in the back compound, Rs. 15; total Rs. 905. Remains for the monthly rent of the house which exclusive of the above warehouses, contains as under mentioned, Rs. 1095; total rent Rs. 2000 a month.

Finlay Muir and Company's offices which Dady Nasarv\u00e1n\u00edji completed between 1790 and 1800. Occasions on which Dady's Admiralty House must have been a centre of business and of gaiety are in 1795 (Low's Indian Navy, I. 206) the expedition against the Dutch in Ceylon when Rear Admiral Rainier left on board His Majesty's Suffolk of 74 guns with Commodore Picket in command of the newly built (1793) Bombay of 88 guns; in 1810 (Ditto, 229-231) when Admiral Bertie and the Bombay Marine made their expedition to Mauritius; in 1811 (Ditto, 237) when Rear Admiral Stopford led an expedition against Java; and in 1824 (Ditto, 410-411) when Commodore C. Grant, C.B., fitted out the Asia built in Bombay for the British Navy and led an expedition against Rangoon. In 1845 this great block of buildings is described at page 16 of the Bombay Calendar and Almanac as the Dady Buildings formerly known as Admiralty House. And in the conveyance dated the 13th December 1867 from the trustees of the Land Mortgage Loan to Mr. A. A. Sassoon the property is described as formerly called or known by the name of Admiralty House.\n\n---\n\n1 Bombay Town Materials, III. 47-48. The Court must be credited with a monthly sum of Rs. 50 being the amount required to hire a godown if the Admiralty furniture did not continue stored in the house.\n\n2 These buildings are (1894) owned by the heirs of the late Mr. S. D. Sassoon. The old title-deeds recite (Indenture dated 17th January 1821): Whereas the said Dady Nasarv\u00e1n\u00edji did some time in or about the year of Christ 1790 pull down and demolish all the said messuages and dwelling houses in order to erect a set of buildings on the site thereof, and on or about the year of Christ ... the said Dady Nasarv\u00e1n\u00edji completed the erection and building of four large tenements to which he gave the name of Dady's Buildings. Dady Nasarv\u00e1n\u00edji died in 1799. The details bearing on the erection of the Dady Buildings are: Committee of Buildings' Consultation of the 20th December 1788 (Diary 177 of 1787-1793, 78) records: Read a petition from Dady Nasarv\u00e1n\u00edji craving leave to rebuild a house situated in the street leading past the Governor's house towards the Apollo Gate, and also to three warehouses under one roof situated in the street leading along the back part of the garden belonging to the Governor's house; on which the clerk of the works reports that the alterations and repairs proposed by the petitioner will not in either case infringe any regulations of Government. Agreed therefore to recommend that the request of the petitioner may be granted. Seven years later it is recorded: On the 23rd May 1795 Dady Nasarv\u00e1n\u00edji applied for rebuilding some houses in Forbes' street which are in decayed condition for whose repairs he has spent a large sum of money from time to time. He has consulted several of the professional gentlemen in order to settle a plan for a body of warehouse and dwelling houses which may be ornamental to the town and with the building so disposed as to allow free currents for the air at the warm season of the year. On this a Consultation of the 6th June 1795 (Committee of Buildings' Diary 178 of 1794, 99) records: Read a petition from Dady Nasarv\u00e1n\u00edji. The committee are of opinion that leave may be granted to him to raise his new building in Forbes' street to the height he desires as specified in the petition.\n\n3 During the last years of the eighteenth and the first years of the nineteenth century the house which in accordance with the Court's Orders of the 25th January 1782 was allotted to the Naval Commanders was General Jones' house in the Marine street that is the present Port Trust Apollo Bonded Warehouse. Compare Bombay Town Materials, II. 494 and I.I. 47; Pub. Diary of 1797, 964 and 988; Pub. Diary of 1793, 287; Pub. Diary of 1804, 865 and 1043-1045.\n\n4 Between 1801 and 1840 the following notices relate to the Buildings that were used as Admiralty Houses: Mr J. J. Johnson's letter (to Government), dated Admiralty\nBetween 1840 and 1864 Admiralty House, or rather the Commodore\u2019s House, was probably some bungalow in the Marine Lines.\n\nThe following note records the beginnings of the Arsenal: In 1767 a Committee was appointed to find a proper spot for a smiths\u2019 shop and carpenters\u2019 yard. On the 23rd February 1767 the Committee reported that the only spot within the town walls proper for the purpose was to the east end of the Bandar warehouse (the present [1894] Customs House), between it and the Castle, whereon then stood an old house belonging to the heirs of the late Baman Jiva deceased. On the 10th March 1767 Government directed that Baman Jiva\u2019s house be purchased at Rs. 5510 as valued by the land paymaster.\n\nA Surat letter to Bombay of the 4th July 1676 shows that the two horn works to be added to the Castle in that year were to include quarters for the garrison.\n\nIn June 1703 the Court recommended the building of barracks somewhere near the Fort, that is the Castle. They directed that the soldiers should be kept under strict military discipline and not suffered to lie a night out of the fort or barracks. Regarding the soldiers\u2019 food the Court at the same time expressed the necessity of appointing a sutler to provide and oversee that the provisions be good and wholesome.\n\nA report from the land paymaster, dated the 15th January 1741, mentions foot barracks built near the Mint, that is to the north-east of the Castle about thirty-six years ago (that is in 1705). These barracks are said to have been built of walls of chunam and stone not above one foot ten inches thick covered with a terrace because they were not able to stand an upper storey. In 1708, apparently before news of the building of the barracks reached them, the Court positively required, all excuses apart, that barracks for the soldiers be built and a good sutler engaged for want of which they had heard the soldiers were forced to lodge with the natives who soon poison them. A few years after the foot barracks were built, the terrace became exceedingly leaky and rendered the barracks very wet and prejudicial to the health of\n\nHouse 25th May 1819, runs: Sir, I am instructed by the Commander-in-Chief to state to you that during his residence in this house great inconvenience has been experienced in consequence of the dilapidated state of the kitchen, which will not admit of a free passage for the smoke to pass through. On this a Consultation of the 16th June 1819 records: Ordered that an extract of the letter from the Secretary to the Admiral be forwarded to Messrs. Shelton Malcolm & Co., executors to the estate of the late Ardesar Dady, with a request they will cause such alterations to be made to the kitchen of the Admiral\u2019s house as will render it useful and likewise to direct the ceiling of the house to be painted which is reported to be equally necessary. (Pub. Diary 431 of 1819, 962-964.) Ten years later the Bombay Courier of the 14th March 1829 contains the following public notice: To be let a commodious and upper roomed house formerly called Upcar\u2019s and lately Admiralty\u2019s house situated in Rampart Row. Apply to Barjorji Bustamji at the office of Messrs. Roger DeFaria & Co.\u2014Bombay 11th March 1829.\n\n---\n\n1 Bombay Town Materials, II. 177.\n2 Bombay Town Materials, III. 70.\n3 Bombay Town Materials, III. 81.\nthe people. It was therefore judged expedient that without taking up the terrace and pavement a roof should be raised over it. This roof was accordingly made but of such bad materials that during his survey in 1741 the engineer found it ready to fall in. The rafters were entirely rotten and decayed, the greatest part of the ridge timbers were broken, and the main beams were cracked through in several places.\\(^1\\)\n\nIn 1736 representations were made of the inconvenience of the guard rooms and of the foot barracks near the Mint. These buildings are described as not near large enough for the number of Europeans Government had on shore in the time of the rains. The guard rooms in particular are said to be very damp and so incapable of sheltering the people from the inclemency of the season as to occasion the loss of some of the inmates. In these circumstances on the 8th October 1736 Government resolved that the necessary repairs and additions to accommodate the soldiers be made without any superfluous charge to the Honourable Company.\\(^2\\)\n\nUp to 1738 Ensigns were accommodated in the east curtain in the fort. In that year their apartments, which were very old and undermined by rats, fell down. Government ordered them to be re-built in the most frugal manner possible.\\(^3\\)\n\nIn 1741 a special survey of the foot barracks showed that the upper roof had for some years back been supported by a few stanchions fixed in the common barrack. But these stanchions very much in-commoded the people and likewise were liable to be thrown down, thus making the whole building in danger of falling in by the excessive weight of the terrace pavement and roof, the walls being not of substance sufficient to support so great a weight. The engineer esteemed it highly expedient that without loss of time the terrace should be taken off as well as the roof and that new beams should be fixed and an entirely new roof erected of the best materials in the most substantial manner. The cost was estimated at Rs. 4041. On the 30th January 1741 Government resolved that the defects be remedied according to the proposal of the engineer and that the work be performed with the best and most substantial materials but without any superfluous charge.\\(^4\\)\n\nAn entry in the Bombay Diary of the 14th August 1753 states that as the Honourable Company have ordered barracks to be erected and as it was impossible to enlarge the existing barracks, the military paymaster and the clerk of the works should pitch upon some place proper for the purpose.\\(^5\\) In the end, as no suitable site could be found, an addition to the existing barracks was sanctioned by the Court in their letter of 26th March 1755.\\(^6\\)\n\nIn 1757 Sir James Foulis proposed a scheme for building barracks at the cost of the soldiers' daily dram instead of at the expense of the Honourable Company. The Court so warmly approved of Sir James'\\(^7\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Bombay Town Materials, III, 81, 91-92.\n\n\\(^2\\) Bombay Town Materials, III, 83.\n\n\\(^3\\) Bombay Town Materials, III, 83.\n\n\\(^4\\) Bombay Town Materials, III, 91-93.\n\n\\(^5\\) Bombay Town Materials, III, 120.\n\n\\(^6\\) Bombay Town Materials, III, 123.\n\n\\(^7\\) Bombay Town Materials, III, 123.\nproposal that on the 25th April 1759 they directed that the building of these barracks be no longer protracted. Major Fraser, who had succeeded Sir James Foulis, agreed regarding the want of barracks, but derided the proposal of paying for them at the cost of the soldiers' grog. At a Consultation on the 30th October 1759 Government considered the matter and concurred in the necessity of building barracks and proper apartments for officers. As the carpenters' yard, a little south of the original Customs House at the north-east corner of Elphinstone Circle, was judged the fittest place for building the barracks and apartments, Government resolved that they be built there as soon as possible and the carpenters removed elsewhere. For this purpose Government appointed Major Fraser and Messrs. Byfeld and Hornby, together with the principal engineer, a committee for surveying the carpenters' yard, pitching on a proper place for removing those workmen to, and submitting a plan and estimate of the expense which might attend building the said barracks and apartments for the officers. The committee represented the carpenters' yard to be a proper place for building barracks. But the required plan could not be drawn unless the yard and the Company's batty warehouses adjoining thereto were cleared. Government directed (20th November 1759) the warehouse-keeper and land paymaster to comply therewith as soon as possible and ordered the warehouse-keeper to inquire whether any other warehouses proper for lodging grain were to be procured.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 15th January 1760 the Board read the following letter from the Barrack Committee: Having, agreeably to your orders, examined the batty warehouses about the old timber yard as also the little barrack now occupied by part of the Honourable Company's troops, we are of opinion that by removing the King's artillery people into the abovementioned little barrack (which we apprehend will be sufficient to accommodate them) those in which they now are with the adjacent warehouses may be converted into barracks for the Honourable Company's Infantry, and, by adding some pillars, apartments for officers may be raised by making light walls of brick and timber. Upon mature consideration this appears to us the most reasonable and expeditious method that can be fallen upon to comply with our Honourable Masters' commands. It will also be of less hindrance to the other public works in hand, as it will not require so many work-people as if a new building had to be raised. On reading this report Government order that suitable directions be given the principal engineer and the new fortification paymaster for proceeding thereon.\n\nThe plan of fortifications carried out between 1757 and 1764 necessitated the erection of new guard rooms in place of the accommodation at the Apollo Gate. A Consultation of the 5th June 1764 records: The new works at the marine battery having rendered the former guard-room improper for the accommodation of the guard at the Apollo gate,\n\n---\n\n1 Bombay Town Materials, III. 130, 135-136.\n2 Pub. Diary 34 of 1760; 43-44. Bombay Town Materials, III, 136.\nand the Major representing that it is absolutely necessary to have some house to shelter the men from the weather during the approaching rains, it is directed that he and the clerk of the works survey the place and pitch upon a spot for erecting a strong shed which, as there has been lately a guard room built for the officer, we imagine, will be sufficient for the men. Agreeably to this order Mr. A. Werner on the 19th June reports: According to your orders I have inspected into the Castle for a place for new guard rooms to be built for a captain and two subalterns. The properest place that I find is over the gateway which will consist of a hall and a closet for the captain and one room on each side for the subalterns, agreeable to the plan here enclosed. On perusing Captain-Lieutenant Andrew Werner's letter with a plan of the guard rooms proposed in the Castle, Government ordered (19th June 1764) that a calculate of the expense be prepared and laid before them for their notice.\n\nIn a letter of the 31st December 1769 Colonel Charles Pemble writes to Government: The preservation of our Europeans in this country being an object of the highest consequence, I beg leave to subject to the judgment of your Honour whether their remaining on Old Woman's island during the fair season of the year will not greatly conduce to this effect. The great benefit the Europeans have derived from the short time they have been encamped there, is obvious in every point. Drunkenness, that bane to discipline, appears already in a manner abolished and the health of the men consequently better preserved. The salubrity of the situation is likewise a very favourable circumstance. The troops at this time bear testimony of it in their countenance, and the great advantage they have when off duty of amusing themselves in a rational and manly manner instead of sinking into every kind of debauchery are motives for the measure I recommend, which, I am convinced, will have their due weight with the Honourable Board. The duty of the garrison may also as well be carried on by the troops being cantoned on Old Woman's island as if they remained in the Fort with the difference only of relieving the guards every second morning. A standing shed or sheds with the rear part walled up, to shelter the troops from land winds, and the front open to the advantage of the sea air with gunnies to drop occasionally, would answer the purpose of barracks exceeding well, and with occasional small repairs will stand a number of years. The officers may be cantoned in bungalows in the rear of the shed which may be erected on the Bengal plan at a very reasonable expense.\n\nOn this letter from Colonel Pemble on the 23rd February 1770 Government resolve: The land paymaster is directed to erect the sheds and bungalows recommended by the Colonel, in which he must observe the utmost frugality and make use of cocoanut trees where it can be done with propriety.\n\n---\n\n1 Bombay Town Materials, III, 141-142.\n2 Pub. Diary 55 of 1770, 142-143. This passage is interesting as explaining how the Bombay country house came to be known as the Bungalow, that is, the Bengali house.\n3 Pub. Diary 55 of 1770, 137.\nIn 1777 the barracks on Old Woman's island were out of repair and not in use. They wanted tiles, window shutters, doors, and flooring. In spite of the cost at which these barracks were built the Europeans lodged in tents. On the 29th October 1777 Government ordered that the barracks be put in proper order for the reception of the Europeans then encamped in tents. They further directed that plans and estimates of the expense of erecting on Old Woman's island a range of barracks sufficient to accommodate the officers of two battalions, and also a plan and estimate of the expense of building separate bungalows for them upon the plan proposed by Colonel Pemble in March 1770, should be prepared.\n\nIn 1675 the English burying ground was known as Mendham's Point. In his letter dated 18th January 1675 Dr. Fryer (New Account, 67) writes: The English have only a burying place called Mendham's Point from the first man's name there interred, where are some few tombs that make a pretty show at entering the haven.\n\nFor about eighty years after the transfer of Bombay to the English the Roman Catholic burial ground was within the limits of the town. In 1740 the Catholic Bishop represented (Pub. Diary 13 of 1739-40, 355) the inconvenience of this place and obtained from Government a site without the town wall in exchange for a spot belonging to the Roman Catholics within the town wall. A Consultation of the 3rd October 1740 contains the following entry: The Romish Bishop represents the want of a spot of ground for a burying place, the present one being on the public high road and therefore greatly inconvenient; he requests an assignment of a certain parcel belonging to the Honourable Company in lieu of which he offers another parcel to be by him made over. As we presume our Honourable Masters will not disapprove such an appropriation, it is ordered that the overseer of the oarts do survey and report the situation and value of the place designed, when we shall determine in what manner to gratify the Romish Bishop. Three weeks later the Diary of the 27th October 1740 records (Pub. Diary 13 of 1739-40, 374): In pursuance of the reference to the overseer of the oarts for ascertaining the value and situation of the ground requested by the Bishop, as well as that by him tendered in lieu thereof, the overseer now presents a letter together with the vereadores' valuation of the two parcels, the difference being Rs. 439-2-12 in favour of the Honourable Company. Though by their standing orders it is forbidden to alienate their oarts, yet as that proposed to be made over is within the town wall and the other without, designed wholly for a burying place, we are willing to hope our Honourable Masters will not disapprove thereof.

Dickinson's Plan of 1814.\nEngineer Major Mace, on the 22nd July 1759, wrote to Government (Bombay Town Materials, II, 458): There is an absolute necessity for pulling down or otherwise destroying the village without the Apollo Gate together with the cocoanut trees and houses adjacent; also, the walls and other buildings in and about the burying ground. The reasons are that those places jointly or separately are capable of concealing and covering a great number of troops should an enemy land on or near Old Woman's island. They will be found proper places for them to occupy and commence their approaches. From them also any enemy can greatly annoy the garrison, and in one night be able to make the position so tenable that our whole strength could hardly force them to abandon it.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 29th January 1760 the Board received the following letter dated 25th January 1760 from the Principal Engineer: Your Honour were pleased to approve of my representation in regard to the inconvenient and dangerous situation of the buildings before the Apollo Gate. As I humbly apprehend that to secure the defence of this town your Honour's intentions were to include the burying ground amongst the other buildings which your Honour were pleased to give me orders to have pulled down, I have in consequence looked out for the most convenient spot for a burying ground just without the limits of 400 yards of the town. This spot is in a cocoanut garden near the water side at the nether end of the Moormen's old burying place. I hope your Honour will be pleased to take this into consideration that if you are pleased to think proper no more bodies may be buried in the old ground, as the longer the old ground is continued as a burying ground the more it must delay the opportunity of converting that spot into a defence instead of leaving it an easy means for an enemy to avail themselves of such advantage.\n\nOn this the Board pass the following order: The Principal Engineer proposing an oart for a burying ground in consequence of the necessity for discontinuing the burial of any people without the Apollo Gate, Messrs. Byfeld and Hornby are appointed a Committee with him for inquiring whether any other proper place can be pitched on to avoid the expense of purchasing the said oart.\n\nOn the 4th March the Board read a letter from the Committee appointed to inquire after a proper place for a burying ground. As the Committee recommend the spot pitched on by the Principal Engineer and advise that it should be enclosed with a wall to be built out of the church stock, it is agreed that the Provisional Collector be ordered to remove the sixteen small houses situated in the oart Sonapur and seven others in one adjacent thereto, the property of Bana Limji, also to purchase the eleven cocoanut trees mentioned in their letter. The question of enclosing the ground with a wall is referred to the Church Warden's consideration.\n\nAt their Consultation of the 10th June 1760 Government resolved (Pub. Diary 34 of 1760, 441) that no more bodies be buried in the usual place at Mendham's Point; that the buildings there be pulled down.\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 34 of 1760, 76.\n2 Pub.

Mr. Howell be directed to bury in future at the place lately pitched on without the Church Gate. Some difficulty in the way of carrying out these orders must have arisen as on the 3rd February 1761 Major Mace repeats the complaint: On the south-west of the town a body of troops might be lodged and sheltered within two hundred yards of the place, under cover of houses, walls, banks, holes, trees, and a burying ground with large monuments. Under favour of these means of shelter an enemy might approach unseen within a few paces of the Apollo Gate.\n\nA Consultation of the 14th September 1762 records: The cart of Fakirshaw Janulla being well situated for a burying ground, it is ordered that it be appropriated to that use, and that it be enclosed with palisades and dwarf wall about a foot and a half high. After this no person whatever is to be buried in the Church yard. And that no inconvenience may result to the fortifications, no tombs in the new ground are to be erected above a foot high. This must be observed as a standing order and be issued to the Chaplain and Church Wardens accordingly.\n\nA Consultation of 22nd March 1763 records: The new burying ground being now finished, and as the burying in the Church yard which has for some time been forced upon us, will, in the opinion of our surgeons, prove prejudicial to the health of the inhabitants in this hot climate, the Chaplain must be ordered not to bury any more bodies there in future.\n\nOn the 23rd December 1767 the Principal Engineer reports: The road from Church Gate to the black town is carried very near its full length of 360 yards. Another branch from this road leading 672 feet to the English burying ground is nearly finished.\n\nOn the 15th February 1780 the Principal Engineer Mr. Lawrence Nilson writes: I have removed a very large and extensive sand bank on that part of the esplanade next to the sea. At the same time I was under the necessity of leaving the burying ground untouched along whose whole length of 380 and half of its breadth of 240 feet runs a sand bank more than eight feet high above the common level and not more than five hundred yards from the nearest cannon of the place. As this renders it very commodious for an enemy to erect batteries on, the removal of the burial ground becomes highly advisable. As it is necessary to have another place appointed for the purpose of burying the dead, I have to request your Honour\u2019s orders for enclosing another place for that purpose where your Honourable Board shall please to direct. After this, as soon as it shall be judged proper or be found absolutely necessary, the high bank on the present burying ground may be removed.

I am of opinion that none is so proper as a spot situated behind the sepoy hospital which is at present occupied only by a few huts; its situation is so much more convenient for the purpose as it has a rising ground. This spot of ground is about 73 yards long and 42 broad. If your Honour shall approve of the same, I request I may have an order for enclosing it.\n\nOn this the Board observe: Read the above letter from the Principal Engineer. Ordered that the spot therein pointed out be appropriated for a burying ground and enclosed with a wall of masonry.\n\nOn the 6th September 1780 the Board read the following letter from Lieut.-Colonel Lawrence Nilson, Principal Engineer, dated 6th September 1780: In consequence of some objections made by the principal surgeons to the situation of the place I lately reported to your Honour as a convenient spot for a new burying ground, I did request the favour of them to give their opinions in writing in order to lay the same before your Honourable Board. This they have done, and I have now the honour to enclose the same. As, in the opinion of the principal surgeons that situation will prove inconvenient to the hospital, I am of opinion that some of the oarts about one or two hundred yards further would answer very well or at Old Woman's island.\n\nThe letter from the principal surgeons was as follows: Agreeable to your desire, we have examined the ground at present proposed for a burying place. We are of opinion it is too near the sepoy hospital, and will render it unhealthy. Also that the military honours which are always paid to deceased officers and soldiers will prove highly prejudicial to the sick and wounded.\n\nOn these two letters the Board ordered that the Engineer be directed to look out for another spot as we do not approve his proposal of putting the Company to the expense of purchasing an oart.\n\nBefore 1675 according to Dr. Fryer (New Account, 67), though it was mightily desired, the English on Bombay had no church. About 1720 Hamilton (New Account of the East Indies, I. 187-188) writes: Notwithstanding the Company was at so much charge in building forts, they had no thoughts of building a church. Sir George Oxinden began to build a church, and charitable collections were gathered for that use. But when Sir George died (1669), piety grew sick and the\n\n---\n\n1 Bombay Town Materials, II. 485-486\n2 Pub. Diary 77 of 1780, 154.\n3 Pub. Diary 77 of 1780, 149. Comp. of Standing Ord.

Indeed it was a long while before the island had people enough to fill a chapel that was in the fort; for as fast as recruits came from Britain, they died in Bombay, which got the island a bad name.\n\nThe Fort Chapel, which consisted of two rooms in the Governor's house, was before long considered unsuitable for Service. On the 11th January 1676 Surat writes to Bombay (Surat Fact. Out. L. B. 2 of 1675-76, 22): To erecting the Church and the place where, we shall have time enough to consider thereof, seeing we cannot get in hand with it till we have an answer from the Honourable Company. A week later, 17th January 1676 (Surat Fact. Out. L. B. 2 of 1675-76, 26-27) Surat writes to the Court: The building of a Church or chapel in Bombay is certainly a work which well deserves that pious zeal you are pleased to entertain thereof. The reasons are obvious; and were there no other, that of inviting the natives and strangers to a reverence and embracing of our wholly reformed religion were of force, who now can have little knowledge thereof in regard our public worship being performed in the hall belonging to your Fort. It is neither safe to admit them, and if it were, there is no room, the place being scarce capable of those few people you have. We judged it a matter of such import that we would not begin or determine the place form or dimensions of the fabric without your order. We now send you a draught thereof which will be capacious to contain about 1000 people, the form proportionable to our usual churches in England, to be plain and free from superfluous ornament or charge. The way proposed for raising money is voluntary contribution whereunto to our comfort we observe all your servants freely and conscientiously inclined, some offering one year's wages, some half a year's, and the least a quarter. These contributions we hope by degrees will raise sufficient to lay a fair foundation. The rest we humbly recommend to your exemplary charity. What is already subscribed among us we have desired your chaplains Mr. John France Mr. Robert Ford and Mr. William Flower to see laid out in materials of brick, stone-facing, lime, and timber, and to keep an account of what is disbursed thereon that it may be the better carried on when your order comes. The place is not yet fully resolved on. Some propose the Church should be erected on Mendham's Point which is our usual burying place, and that were proper enough as to ourselves. But it will not answer our main design of inviting the natives to repair thereunto and observe the gravity and purity of our devotions. For that place is quite out of the way of concourse and will seem wholly appropriated to the English. Wherefore others think it may be as convenient to build the Church near the present town or between it and the place designed for the English and Europeans to inhabit in, and to be adjoining to the high road leading to the great street or bazar of the present town, to the end that being open and free to all to enter without scruple, some may be persuaded at first out of curiosity to visit it and our way of devotion therein; and at length when the merciful pleasure of God shall think good to touch them with a sense of the eternal welfare of their souls, they may be convinced of their error, sensible of their\npresent dangerous uncertain wanderings, and desirous to render themselves happy in a more sure way of salvation which we pray God grant in his good time. To the latter opinion we at present incline, but shall govern ourselves by your wise judgment. We do all agree that the Church must not be far distant from your Fort to say not above 80 rods which is distant enough for the security of both in time of danger. Also that the plain be left open and free from other buildings between it and the Fort; all which we humbly recommend to your Honour's determination. Only, in regard the fabric requires the greatest care we can employ therein, we entreat that an able builder or surveyor may be sent out to undertake and oversee the work, for whose salary you may please to agree and order it to be paid out of the money received for the use of the church, to which account it ought to be charged.\n\nOn the 2nd July 1684 the Court write to Surat (Pub. Dep. Court's Letters Vol. I of 1681-1685, 93): We having now ordered one-half of your shipping to load directly at Bombay without going at all to Surat or Swalley, it will be convenient that you should proceed to finish the great Church, which we hear is carried up as far as the wall plates, or roof rests, wanting only a roof. To this you may induce our commanders and officers to make voluntary contribution, as they have to the hospital and fine church at Fort St. George, which are both now completely finished. A Bombay general letter to the Company, dated 29th December 1686, has the following (Bombay Town Materials, II. 435): The new Deputy Governor, Sir John Wybourne, has made the house in the Fort much more commodious than ever it was, having fitted up a very convenient chapel out of two rooms situated in the middle of the house, where there is room enough for four times the number of people that we have on this island (Sec. Out. L. B. 4 of 1677-1687, 41-42).\n\nPerhaps because of this improvement to the Fort Chapel no further progress was made with the great Church till 1715. On the 21st September 1714 the Rev. Richard Cobbe Chaplain arrived in Bombay from England. On his arrival the Governor, the Honourable W. Aislabie, gave Mr. Cobbe a convenient chamber near his own lodgings in the Fort and near the chapel. After some months' experience, Mr. Cobbe considered the performing public devotions under lock and key in two upper rooms in the Fort or Castle beat into one inconvenient and unsuitable. Accordingly on Sunday the 19th June 1715, being the first Sunday after Trinity, he preached a sermon advocating the building\n\n---\n\n1 Hamilton (New Account of the East Indies, I. 187-188) writes: There were reckoned above \u00a35000 had been gathered towards building the church, but Sir John Child (A.D. 1690), when he came to reign in Bombay, converted the money to his own use, and never more was heard of it. The walls were built by his predecessors to five yards high, and so it continued till the year, 1715, that Mr. Boone came to the chair, who set about building it, and in five years time finished it by his own benevolence and other gentlemen who by his persuasions were brought in to contribute. The Company also contributed something towards that pious end.\n\n2 R. Cobbe's Account of the Bombay Church (1766), iii. v. vi. Bom. Quar. Review, III. (1856), 37.\nof a church for God's honour and service, according to the use of the Church of England, that all the island might see the English had some religion among them, and that the Heathens and Muhammadans and Papists round about might in time be brought over as converts to the profession of the Church of England.\\(^1\\)\n\nAfter sermon, says Mr. Cobbe, 'according to custom, I waited on the Governor the Honourable William Aislabie Esqr. at his lodgings in the Fort before dinner. The Governor was pleased to address me very friendly in these words: 'Well Doctor, you have been very zealous for the church this morning.' I replied: 'Please your Honour, I think there was occasion for it and I hope without offence.' The Governor said: 'Well then, if we must have a church, we will have a church! Do you see and get a book made, and see what every one will contribute towards it, and I will do first.' This was accordingly done, leaving a blank for the Company's subscription which was afterwards filled with Rs. 10,000. A rupee is half a crown.\n\nThe Honourable W. Aislabie Esq., General and Governor of Bombay, gave leave for the building of Bombay Church the 19th June 1715. The Worshipful Stephen Strutt Esq., Deputy Governor of Bombay, laid the first stone the 18th November 1715. The Honourable Charles Boone Esq., President and Governor of Bombay, gave order for the opening the church of Bombay the 25th December 1718.\\(^2\\)\n\nIn a letter of 5th October 1715, before the first stone was laid, Mr. Cobbe writes: The number of inhabitants together with the English are reckoned about 16,000 souls, of different languages as well as religions. The Moors and Gentus have their mosques and pagodas, the Portuguese several, I think five, churches supplied with Padres and Clericos from Goa. But the English have only a private chapel for their public devotion. Here are indeed the remains of a spacious church formerly intended, but never brought to perfection, the ruins of which are to this day a standing monument of reproach to us among the Heathens to a proverb. This reproach we hope in a little time to wipe off, having already gotten considerable large contributions from the neighbouring factories, as well as this place, in order to re-build it.\\(^3\\)\n\nOn Christmas-day 1718, the Governor and Council, attended by the free merchants, military, and other inhabitants of the place, proceeding from the Fort in great order to the Church, and approaching the great door at the west end, were met by the Chaplain in his proper habit, and introduced repeating the twenty-fourth Psalm (Lift up your heads O ye gates; even lift them up you everlasting doors) with the Gloria Patri. The church was dressed with palm branches and plantain trees, the pillars were adorned with wreaths of greens, and the double crosses over the arches looked like so many stars in the firmament. Service began as usual on Christmas-day, but with this addi-\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Cobbe's Account of the Bombay Church (1766), vii.\n\n\\(^2\\) Cobbe's Account of the Church at Bombay (1766), 19. Bom.

The Governor, Mrs. Parker, and Mrs. Crommelin, who stood gossips came down to the font in time of divine service, where the child was baptized according to order, by the name of Susanna. A whole crowd of black people stood round about, among them R\u00e1m\u00e1ji and all his caste (this must be the well-known traitor R\u00e1m\u00e1ji K\u00e1m\u00e1t\u00ed), who were so well pleased with the decency and regularity of the way of worship, that they stood it out the whole service. When the sermon from Isaiah LVI. 7 (Let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thought) was over, the Governor and Council and ladies repaired to the vestry where having drunk success to the new church in a glass of sack, the whole town returned to the Governor\u2019s lodgings within the Fort. Here was a splendid entertainment, wine music and abundance of good cheer. After dinner the Governor began \u2018Church and King,\u2019 according to custom. In addition upon this occasion a compliment of twenty-one great guns was given from the Castle, which were answered by the European ships in the harbour; with several other healths drinking and firing till almost four o\u2019clock. Lest so good an opportunity should slip, by the Governor\u2019s leave the Chaplain brought in the subscription book, and got above Rs. 2400 to the church, of which, for example\u2019s sake, the Governor launched out Rs. 1000 himself. On the tower, which on the opening day was not quite finished, a steeple was designed to be built, and raised, in order for a sea-mark, as high as funds could tower it. The church itself, adds Mr. Cobbe, is indeed a structure deservedly admired for its strength and beauty, neatness and uniformity, but more especially for its echo. The roof is arched with three regular arches of stone, supported by two rows of pillars and pilasters on each side, with a large semi-dome at the east end to receive the communion table, like that of St. Paul\u2019s, London, ascending by three steps, and a rail to separate it from the body of the church. Its situation is very commodious, in the midst of the inhabitants, within the town wall, and at a due distance from the Castle. As to its extent, it is larger than either of the English churches at Madras or Bengal, or any of the Portugese churches in Bombay. It is suitable in some measure to the dignity of our Royal settlement, and is big enough for a Cathedral. Thus was the ceremony of opening Bombay Church performed with every public demonstration of joy, and with the decency and good order which were suitable to the solemnity.\n\nNot satisfied with the Rs. 2400 realized on the opening day, Mr. Cobbe continued to collect subscriptions. On Whitsunday 1720 the total contributions since the 1st of July 1715 amounted to Rs. 48,992 or \u00a35499.\n\n---\n\n1 The Rev. R. Cobbe to the Chief of Calicut and Tellicherry, 10th Jan. 1719.

Perhaps in reward for Mr. Cobbe\u2019s energy, in a Despatch of the 4th November 1719 the Court ordered (Compilation of Standing Orders Vol. I of 1715-1721, 189) that the Chaplain of Bombay take place next to the Council. Mr. Cobbe did not long continue to enjoy his new dignity. At a Consultation of the 23rd July 1720 (Pub. Diary I of 1720, 116-117), it was unanimously resolved that\nIn 1750 Grose writes (Voyage, I. 51): The Church on the Green is extremely commodious fully sufficient for any congregation.\n\nAbout 1784 Forbes (Or. Mem. I. 152-153) says: The only Protestant Church on the island stood near the centre of the town, a large and commodious building with a neat tower. There were seldom more than two chaplains belonging to the Bombay establishment. When I was in India (1766 - 1784), the one resided at the Presidency, the other alternately at Surat and Broach, where were considerable European garrisons. (Bombay Town Materials, II. 486.)\n\nIt appears from Dr. J. Gerson Da Cunha\u2019s translation of the Diary (pages 355, 363) of the French missionary Abb\u00e9 Cottineau that on the 27th January 1828, in the presence of the Bishop of Antiphile, a solemn Mass was sung and the Abb\u00e9 who had been appointed chaplain preached the opening sermon of a new chapel at Colaba from the text *Ecce annuntio vobis gaudium magnum* Behold I bring you tidings of great joy.\n\nAccording to Fryer (New Account, 66-67) in 1675, at the end of the town looking into the field where cows and buffaloes grazed, the Portugals had a pretty house and church with orchards of Indian fruit adjoining. In improving the defences of the town this church had to be pulled down. On the 20th November 1760 the Bombay Government write to the Court: The Portuguese have a Church without the Baz\u00e1r Gate considerably within 400 yards of the gate. We are satisfied that, if attacked by an European enemy, this church would prove of the utmost ill consequence to the defence of this place, especially as some of the walls are four feet thick built of chunam and stone. We therefore resolved on the 29th July, that it be pulled down and ordered the Principal Engineer to pitch on a proper place for the materials being removed that the church may be re-built. A new valuation amounted to Rs. 18,675-3-95 or Rs. 7565-3-75 less than the estimate made by the clerk of the works in 1755, because 2\u00bd feet are now considered thickness enough for the walls of the new church. The valuation of an oart belonging to your Honours given in exchange for one appropriated to re-build the church in, will be deducted from the valuation. The demolition of the church is nearly effected and we hope that your Honours on considering its extremely dangerous situation and the prodigious strength of the walls will concur with us in the necessity for having it removed. (Pub. Dep. Letters to the Court Vol. 7 of 1760, 196-197.)\n\nIn 1742 the Cooperage was in the Marine Yard.

Then Mr. Cobbe was called in and the President acquainted him with the resolution of the Board to which he answered: \u2018Very well, what your Honour pleases.\u2019 Mr. Cobbe was ordered to withdraw and his place and salary as Chaplain to be taken by Mr. Waters, a good reader.\nplace in the Marine Yard to a Smiths' workshop. But as a proper place belonging to the Company was not found, Mr. Broughton's warehouse was rented for the Cooperage. A Consultation of the 25th May 1742 records: There having been a necessity to appropriate the Cooperage in the Marine Yard for a smiths' shop, the former one being covered with cajans and at the same time extremely near the vessels lying in the dock from which many fatal consequences might ensue, and, as at present, there is no proper place of the Company's conveniently situated near the waterside for the cooper's people, it is agreed to hire for that purpose a warehouse belonging to Mr. Broughton, and to allow him a rent at the rate of Rs. 20 a month, which, we are told, is the same as the warehouse was formerly rented at to private people.\n\nThe next reference to the Cooperage is in the following entry in the Bombay Diary of the 4th February 1752: Read the report of the hospital for linen to be supplied and such repairs and additional buildings as are necessary set about. The drain which at present runs under the sick-ward to be turned into another channel under the Cooperage, and a report to be made to the Board what the expense of repairs will amount to.\n\nA Consultation of the 6th November 1759 records: The Superintendent representing that the building of a shed in the Marine Yard will save the Rs. 15 a month rent which is now paid for a place the coopers work in, the land paymaster is ordered to set about making the shed.\n\nIn spite of this order for many years more the Cooperage appears to have continued in hired warehouses. On the 24th April 1781 Rear Admiral Sir Edward Hughes strongly recommended its removal from the warehouses it occupied at the time near the garrison. His suggestion seems to have led to the erection of the Cooperage buildings on the Esplanade. The Rear Admiral's letter runs: One thing more occurs to me as not only useful but necessary which I submit to your consideration. As the Company furnish warehouses for the reception of the salt provisions sent to this place for the service of His Majesty's squadron, and as much inconvenience has arisen to the inhabitants residing in the garrison from the necessary surveying re-packing and re-pickling the said provisions, I am of opinion that lodging such provisions in a dry well-built shed or in a house erected on the Apollo ground walled round and tiled on the roof would relieve the inhabitants from the much-complained-of stench arising from doing what is absolutely necessary for the preservation of the salt provisions. This change would also tend to the better preservation of the provisions as such a house properly constructed must be much cooler than the warehouses where they are now lodged within the garrison and the heat of such close warehouses must promote the decay and rottenness of the meat. If this mode of storing the salt\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 15 of 1741-42, 255-256.\n2 Pub. Diary 25 of 1752, 38.\n3 Pub.

On this letter on the 13th June 1781 Government resolved that a proper shed be erected on the Apollo ground for the reception of the King's provisions.\n\nIn 1670 the Administration of Justice was in the hands of justices who held their sittings in the Customs Houses of Bombay and Mahim. The Bombay Customs House was then situated near the present (1894) Town Barracks.\n\nIn 1675 when a Judge was appointed a house was taken as a Court of Judicature. After about a year Government decided to buy for a Court the Deputy Governor's house, apparently the building part of which still exists in the Castle, and which was then the private property of a Portuguese lady. This house was never used as a Court house and the Judge continued to sit in his originally hired quarters till in 1677 the Court was housed in the Mapla Por Buildings.\n\nIn 1671 one of President Aungier's large-minded proposals for improving Bombay was to build a Fair Common House wherein might be also appointed chambers for the Courts of Justice, warehouses or granaries for corn and ammunition, as also prisons for several offenders. According to President Aungier's design all these buildings were to be located in the large enclosure on the west side of Bohora Baz\u00e1r street of which details are given below under Mapla Por. In 1677 the work of building this Court of Judicature was so far advanced that Government deemed it unnecessary to use the Deputy Governor's and Mr. Petit's house in the Castle for the purpose of Courts of Justice. This new Court House also served as a Town Hall where sessions were held, and probably as an Admiralty Court to which Dr. John St. John was appointed Judge in 1684. In 1676, in consequence of the Company's displeasure at the heavy charges incurred in erecting new buildings at Bombay President Aungier offered to take the Court House to his account provided Government allowed\n\n---\n\n1 Bombay Town Materials, II. 202-203.\n2 Bombay Town Materials, III. 1-4.

The following entry relates to the position of this Old Court House or Old Hospital: On the 30th July 1762 the Sub-Engineer writes to Government: It is in my opinion probable that any European enemy that would attempt a siege against this place, must land their troops upon Old Woman's island as the most convenient place both for landing the men and warlike stores, and the point behind Mr. Court's house would afford them a very sufficient shelter till such time as they could survey the ground along the Back Bay. I therefore humbly suggest that in order to scour the beach opposite to Old Woman's island so as to annoy the enemy and hinder their gaining any favourable spot of ground they may think convenient for them, a redoubt should be raised behind the Old Hospital with a communication with the outworks of the town. While they remain within cannon shot this redoubt will also create the enemy as much trouble and loss after passing it as before they came up to it. The distance of the redoubt from the town ditch will be but 620 feet which renders the communication tolerable safe and will amount to but a small expense. Pub. Diary 38 of 1762, 410-412. Bombay Town Materials, II. 343.\n3 Bruce's Annals, II. 497.\nhim a reasonable rent for its use as a Justice Hall and Prison. This arrangement seems to have been carried out and continued till 1720. In 1720 rent free accommodation was provided for a Court and Town Hall in the Baz\u00e1r Gate out of the forfeited estate of the traitor R\u00e1ma K\u00e1m\u00e1ti.\n\nFrom 1720 to 1786, when this Baz\u00e1r Gate Town Hall was sold, the Courts of Justice continued to hold their sittings in R\u00e1ma K\u00e1m\u00e1ti\u2019s Buildings, though, for the use of the quarter sessions during the latter years of this period, private buildings, such as the Theatre, appear to have been occasionally rented.\n\nAfter the sale of R\u00e1ma K\u00e1m\u00e1ti\u2019s Court House and Town Hall in 1786 accommodation had to be provided for the Mayor\u2019s Court and their records. At their Consultation on the 24th August 1786 Government directed the land paymaster to appropriate a dry and secure room in the back part of the large house rented of Mr. Hornby, that is the present Great Western Hotel, for the lodgment of the records of the Honourable the Mayor\u2019s Court. In reply to the Mayor\u2019s Court\u2019s disapproval of this arrangement and their request that some more suitable place should be appointed for the Court to meet in, the Board on the 30th August 1786 resolved that the Mayor\u2019s Court be acquainted that Government had come to a determination of building a New Town Hall and that, until the New Hall was finished, the Court would be accommodated with a room in the house rented of Mr. Hornby if convenient to them.\n\nUntil March 1788 the Mayor\u2019s Court continued to occupy the room in Mr. Hornby\u2019s house which was then known as Admiralty House. On the 17th March 1788 Government offered the Mayor\u2019s Court a set of rooms in the Bandar that is in the present (1894) Customs House. This proposal did not meet with the approval of the Mayor\u2019s Court. On the 17th March 1788 the Register to the Mayor\u2019s Court wrote to the Secretary to Government that the Court unanimously came to the resolution that they should consider an assent on their part to be highly derogatory to the dignity of the Court. They considered the proposed place extremely inconvenient for the Court\u2019s meetings and desired that some proper and commodious building might be allotted for their reception. On this letter a Consultation of the 20th March 1788 records: The President lays before the Board the above letter and acquaints the Board that the Admiralty House wherein the Mayor\u2019s Court had for some time past been assembled, being now appropriated to the accommodation of the officers of His Majesty\u2019s 71st Regiment, he had directed a suite of apartments in the Bandar to be fitted up for the Court not as a permanent but as a temporary place for their meetings until a more suitable building could be provided for them. At the same time the President observed that Courts had been\n\n---\n\n1 Bombay Town Materials, I. 149-150.\n2 For details see Bombay Town Materials, II. 487-488. The site of this Theatre is now (1894) occupied partly by the Elphinstone Circle and partly by the road in front of Messrs. Fleming MacFarlane & Co., and Messrs. Thomas Hill & Son\u2019s offices.\n3 Bombay Town Materials, II. 488-489.\nfrequently held in the Bandar without its having ever been considered derogatory to their dignity. Resolved therefore that the Court be acquainted that we shall provide a suitable place for their reception as soon as it may be in our power. And that in the meantime we hope the Court will put up with such accommodation as the Bandar affords.\n\nIn spite of this resolution the Court refused to accept the accommodation offered at the Bandar. At last at a Consultation of the 25th March 1788 Government decided to offer the Court a part of the Marine House in lieu of rooms in the Bandar. The entry in the Diary runs: The President acquaints the Board that in consequence of the inconvenience which the Mayor's Court apprehend would attend their carrying on their proceedings in the Bandar he has directed that the part of the Marine House at present occupied by the Secretary to the Marine Board be fitted up as a Court House and Town Hall, the expense of which by an estimate made by the engineer and now laid before us will not exceed Rs. 133. This intention must be accordingly communicated to the Mayor's Court.\n\nIn 1798 on the arrival of Sir William Sayer the first Recorder, the Recorder's Court succeeded the Mayor's Court (Bombay Town Materials, II. 494-495 and III. 44-47). In 1800, with the permission of the Governor, on account of the numberless inconveniences attending the Court House, the Court offered Mr. Maister to rent the Admiralty House, that is the present Old High Court or Great Western Hotel, on certain terms. To these Mr. Maister on behalf of Mr. Hornby agreed.\n\nThe first Recorder was Sir William Sayer. He died much regretted after he had been four years in Bombay. In their despatch to the Court of Directors on the 7th October 1802 the Bombay Government wrote (see above page 50): Sir William Sayer's death constitutes a peculiar subject of regret to your Government with which Sir William preserved the utmost harmony throughout his most useful and judicious administration of the authorities vested in him which he never sought to exercise but for the essential and important purposes of insuring impartial justice to those within the limits of his jurisdiction without seeking to extend these limits beyond that criterion or to cramp your Government in the execution of theirs. Sir William's successor was the 'Man of Promise' Sir James Mackintosh who, in the words of his Diary, used to vary his idle and disengaged life at the Governor's noble country house of Parel by days of business at the Recorder's Court. In 1804 he writes (Life, I. 228): I have four terms for civil business and four sessions for criminal. The number of my days of attendance is about 110 in a year; and I commonly sit three or four hours each day. I have\n\n---\n\n2 Bombay Town Materials, II. 489-490.\n3 At this time the Recorder's Court was held in Col. Jones' house in Marine Street the present (1894) Port Trust Apollo Bonded warehouses. In his letter of the 26th April 1800 Col. Jones' attorney Mr. Anderson writes to Government (Pub. Diary 147 of 1800, 998): The Civil Paymaster having applied to me for the house late in the occupation of the Court of the Recorder (Bombay Town Materials, II. 499 and III. 47) for the residence of His Majesty's Naval Commanders I am inclined to comply with his request.\n4 For details see Bombay Town Materials, III. 46-48.\nfound the business very easy; indeed rather an amusement than a toil. The two barristers are gentlemanlike men.\n\nIn 1879 the Court, which, in 1824, was styled the Supreme Court and in 1862 was named the High Court, was removed from Hornby House to the present (1894) High Court buildings on the Esplanade.\n\nThe present (1894) Customs House between the Arsenal and the Dockyard has, on a slab over the porch, the Honourable East India Company's arms and below the coat of arms the words: The Honourable Aislabie Esq. 1714. As Mr. Aislabie was Governor from 1709 to 1714, and as the masonry seems throughout to be of the same age and style, there appears no reasonable doubt that the whole front of the building was completed in that year. Several references seem to show that it was built to serve as a warehouse. The inner flat-roofed row of buildings parallel to the street front and between that front and the Bandar Basin originally ran in an unbroken line. The present division into two blocks, with a broad space between, dates from 1844. Like the street-front row this inner row of buildings, which until 1758 was of three storeys not of two, seems originally to have been warehouses. Their date is not known. They are probably older than the street front.\n\nFrom 1665 to 1714 the English Customs House was on Moody Bay. The apparent site is to the east of the Town Barracks near the Fort market. The original Customs House formed part of what was known as the India House regarding which and their other house properties in July 1684 (Pub. Dep. Court's Letters Vol. I of 1681-1685, 93) the Court complain: We understand we have great warehouses as also an hospital, a large house called the East India House, as also the cheetry (chhatri) or bandar and great stables. Of all of these little use is made and no profit at all to the Company. On the contrary the Sidi when he is there with the Moghal fleet makes use of them to live in and to secure and fit his rigging. This will make but a mean account for the great expenses the Company have been at in erecting such chargeable edifices. We therefore would desire you to spend some serious thoughts and to invent some means whereby these buildings may be employed to make us some better return for our great cost.\n\nFive years after this complaint the Sidi made a worse use of the building than as a rope walk. Hamilton (New Account, I. 226) says during the Sidi war (1689-90) Sidi Y\u00e1kut Kh\u00e1n put four great guns in the Customs House commonly called the India House. Though the Customs House was at Moody Bay the chief Bandar or landing, on which was the great chhatri or pavilion mentioned in the Court's despatch of July 1684, was at the present (1894) Town Customs Bandar.\n\n---\n\n1 Compare Captain DeFunck, Pub. Diary 28 of 1755, 349-362, 'The Honourable Company's grand warehouses on the bandar.'\n2 See Note 2 page 590.\n3 No known evidence supports the statement (Macleau's Guide for 1879, 222-223) that the Customs House front was a Portuguese barrack. It is unlikely that the Portuguese had any barracks outside of the Castle. If any portion of the existing building is Portuguese the inner line of warehouses seems the most likely.\nThis was doubtless the reason which in 1710 induced Governor Aislaby to build new warehouses at the Bandar head. Shortly before 1728 the bandar pier seems to have been built or rebuilt, as, in February 1728, the charter constituting the Mayor's Court was read at the newly built pier (see above page 9). This is apparently the pier described in the French map of 1758 as Port de la Montagne de Pierre. This should mean the landing for the hill of stone, but Montagne apparently should be Montage and the entry would mean the Stone Bandar landing. In 1755 Capt. DeFunck the Engineer proposed that a fortified line should be thrown in front of the Company's grand warehouses at the Bandar whose only defence had been a small battery on the bandar pier (Pub. Diary 28 of 1755, 349-362). To provide rooms for certain of the writers who in 1757-58, owing to the removal for military reasons of Government and other houses, were ousted from their quarters in the Castle, the range of warehouses in the Bandar next to the sea was altered (Bombay Town Materials, II. 462) to make apartments for the covenanted servants. The Bandar warehouse did not provide quarters for all the writers. Six of the juniors remained in some ground-floor rooms in the Castle of which, in an address to the Government, dated Bombay Castle April 2, 1765, they give the following account:\n\nThe many inconveniences we at present suffer in the rooms allotted for our accommodation oblige us to give you this trouble though we flatter ourselves that the various circumstances we now lay before your Honour will excuse us from the charge of an idle intrusion. In the heats as well as in the rains we can with the greatest reason assure your Honour that our healths, nay our lives, are much endangered. For during the hot weather which is already set in, the heat in our rooms is so very great as to be almost unsupportable than which nothing (it is well known) more frequently brings on dangerous disorders and in case of sickness in this country and in such a habitation the consequences are but too likely to be fatal. During the rains our prospect is by no means more comfortable. At that season the roofs walls and floors are perpetually running with water in which situation the greatest care cannot keep so much as the cots whereon we sleep dry. Sickness at such a time must if possible be worse than in the heats. Last year's experience (to go no further back) has shown that these inconveniences cannot be remedied by repairs; for notwithstanding workmen were almost continually employed at our apartments they were little or nothing the better for the pains bestowed on them. All these so very disagreeable and dangerous circumstances have induced us to apply to your\n\n---\n\n1 In the French map (see above page 129) in the entry Montage de Pierre or Stone Bandar, the word montage has the double sense of landing and lifting closely corresponding to the use of the Italian Scala or Scalo. Compare Hobson-Jobson, 97.\n\n2 Bom. Gov., Consultation 2nd Oct. 1759, Pub. Diary 35 of 1759, 568. A Resolution of Government dated 3rd October 1758 (Bombay Town Materials, I. 327; Pub. Diary 31 of 1758, 439) ordered that as the pulling down of the Fort House had increased the existing great want of apartments for the Company's servants, materials from the Fort House and from the sea side walls of the Bandar warehouses be used in building apartments and directed the paymaster to set about this work. It had been found by experience that the walls of the Bandar warehouses next the sea-side were much too high to be filled up with any sort of goods and therefore it was deemed serviceable to lower them. These orders do not seem to have been carried out for ten years. In Footnote 3 at page 462 of Vol. II. of Bombay Town Materials the suggestion is offered that this converted range of warehouses came to be called the New House. This is a mistake. The New House is the new Government House that is Mr. Spencer's residence the present (1894) Old Secretariat.\nHonour for the usual allowance of house rent which we hope your Honour will not refuse us when you consider the real necessity of our quitting our present apartments and that the allowance made us for our subsistence will not suffice to support the expense of house rent without your Honour granting us the allowance for rent. So great are the apprehensions we entertain of the heats and rains (the former already set in and the latter not far distant) that should our Honourable Masters disapprove thereof and require a restitution, we are willing to enter into any engagement your Honour may propose to oblige ourselves to refund the amount of the allowance we request. We hope your Honour will not consider our request as a light matter being of no less consequence to us than that greatest blessing health which if once impaired in a climate we are not yet inured to, may prove very difficult and precarious to regain.\u2014Signed Richard Thomas Benjamin Price, John Dicey Wilder, James Cheape, George Biggen, Robert Webb, Edward Ravenscroft. Pub. Diary 44 of 1765, 206-208.\n\nOn this petition a Consultation of the same date (2nd April 1765) records: It is agreed to make them an allowance of Rs. 10 a month each for house rent until proper apartments can be erected for them. On the Engineer\u2019s arrival he must be ordered to survey the old apartments in the Fort to see what use they can be converted to (Pub. Diary 44 of 1765, 204). Apparently the grant of house rent instead of quarters did not find favour with the Court. For three years longer the young writers had to remain in their dungeons in the Castle. At a Consultation on the 22nd January 1768 the Board record the following opinion: The upper part of the Fort House having lately been entirely taken down and the lower apartments thereby rendered unfit for keeping stores until as originally intended a proper bomb-proof roof is thrown over them, we have been under the necessity of appropriating for stores the apartments in the Castle occupied by the junior servants. As even before this the number of apartments was so insufficient as to render the construction of more indispensable and as there is space for two sets of rooms at each end of the bandar, the building of them is ordered to be set about immediately an estimate of the expense being previously laid before us. These two sets of quarters at each end of the Bandar are the wings of the present Customs House.\n\n---\n\n1 Bombay Town Materials, II. 474.\n2 The phrase the \u2018chhatri or bandar\u2019 quoted above from the Court\u2019s Despatch of 1684, should probably be read the chhatri on the bandar. Like the Madras chawris (compare Hobson-Jobson, 163) this bandar chawri was used as a lock-up and so came to be known as the Grand Chauki. In a Consultation of the 19th November 1765 the Board record: The Grand Chauki being greatly out of repair the land paymaster now lays before us an estimate of the expense which will be incurred in repairing it amounting to Rs. 21744. Ordered that the same be repaired accordingly. (Pub. Diary 45 of 1765, 767.) On the 21st February 1768 Government ordered: When any prisoners are confined in the Grand Chauki, their names are to be inserted in the general morning reports, with the day they were confined, and by whom. On the 16th May 1769 Government issued the following orders: The officers of the port guards are to be very exact in going their rounds at the hours appointed, and particularly careful to take up all persons who cannot give a proper account of themselves. They are not only to patrol through the high streets but also all the inner ones, and passages leading to the works. The patrols from the Grand Chauki are to observe the same orders which are to be minutely explained to them. So soon as one patrol is sent out another is to be warned so that a constant patrol from that guard may be going the whole night. The field officer of the day will be pleased to appoint the hours for the different rounds, and the officers of the port guards are to insert the time of their going in their morning report. On the 7th July 1773 Government ordered that a Captain mount at the Grand Chauki.\nAfter 1728 when the Mayor's Court was established its meetings were frequently held in the front row of warehouses. In March 1788, as, in consequence of the dangerous condition of R\u00e1ma K\u00e1m\u00e1ti's buildings in Bazz\u00e1r Gate street, Government were badly pressed for Court accommodation room in the front row of warehouses was offered to the Mayor's Court. The Register replied that the members of the Honourable Court had come to the decision that they should consider an assent on their part to be highly derogatory to the dignity of the Court and at all events the place to be extremely inconvenient for its meetings. (Bombay Town Materials, II. 490.) Some years before, about 1770, Mr. Forbes (Or. Mem. I. 166) had given a lasting interest to the inner flat-roofed block of warehouses by describing how when a young writer, unable to afford either supper or a light, he spent the evenings reading by moonlight a small-typed Shakespeare on the flat roof of the writers' building close to the Bandar. In 1802 the front row of warehouses was turned into the Customs House and has since continued to serve this purpose with efficiency and fair comfort.\n\nIn his account of Bombay Dr. Fryer (New Account of India and Persia, 1672-1681, 63-64) writes: In 1664 when Mr. Cooke landed on Bombay with the Royal fleet, they found a pretty well-seated but ill-fortified house, four brass guns being the whole defence of the island, except a few chambers housed in small towers in convenient places to scour the Malab\u00e1rs. About the house was (1672) a delicate garden, voiced to be the pleasantest in India. This garden of Eden or place of terrestrial happiness, would put the searchers upon as hard an inquest as the other has done its posterity. The walks which before were covered with nature's verdant awning, and lightly pressed by soft delights, are now open to the sun, and loaded with the hardy cannon. The bowers dedicated to rest and ease, are turned into bold rampires for the watchful sentinel to look out on. Every tree that the airy choristers made their charming choir, trembles, and is extirpated at the rebounding echo of the alarming drum. And those slender fences only designed to oppose the sylvan herd, are thrown down to erect others of a more warlike force.\n\nOn the 18th March 1742 the President acquaints the Board that having lately been to see the several houses erected by the inhabitants who have been obliged to remove their former houses for clearing round the town wall, he finds that to accommodate some it will be necessary to appropriate the spot now kept for the Company's garden. It is further thought a part of some private carts will be required as well for the benefit of the people as to make the building uniform and regular. The Board agree and note that a proper place for a garden should hereafter be fixed.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 Bombay Town Materials, I. 251.\nIn a report on wells and holes within the town, on the 16th June 1746, Messrs. Spencer and Cameron, clerks of the market and the works, mention a deep well in the Coffee Garden near the compound of the parsonage house.\n\nIn 1750 Grose (Voyage to the East Indies, I. 46) writes There are two very pleasant gardens belonging to the Company, cultivated after the European manner. The one a little way out of the gates, open to any of the English gentlemen who like to walk there; the other much larger and finer, at about five miles distance from the town, at a place called Parel where the Governor has a very agreeable country house. Grose adds (Ditto, 52): What is called the Green is a spacious area that continues from the Fort to the English Church and is pleasantly laid out in walks planted with trees round which are mostly the houses of the English inhabitants. These are generally but ground-floored after the Roman fashion and mostly with a court-yard before and behind, in which are the offices and out-houses. They are substantially built with stone and lime, and are smooth-plastered on the outside.\n\nThe garden of the Dady Buildings formerly known as the Admiralty House (Bombay Calendar and Almanac for 1845, 16, 18) joined the garden of the old Government House now (1894) known as the Old Secretariat. The garden of this Old Secretariat was in 1845 planted with mulberry trees, the leaves of which were given to the silk worms belonging to Mr. DeRamos the assistant superintendent of silk culture in the Konkan.\n\nIn 1675 Fryer describes (New Account, 68) Old Woman\u2019s island as a little low barren island of no other profit but to keep the Company\u2019s antelopes and other beasts of delight. In the beginning of the present century (1816) the beasts of delight seem to have spent rather a trying time in the Old Woman\u2019s menagerie or training school. Qui Hi notes (Adventures, page 62): The menagerie near Colaba island has many tame asses of the Zebra kind striped and spotted. The method of training them is severe to excess their noses being generally bored. Many die under the process.\n\nOn the 1st March 1757, seeing that Captain De Funck insisted that most if not all the upper part of the Fort House must be pulled down, Government resolved to purchase (Pub. Dep. Letters to the Court Vol. 5 of 1758, 75) Mr. Spencer\u2019s house that is the present (1894) Old Secretariat, or a part of it for Rs. 15,161-0-91. Before 1757 the aforesaid Fort House in the Castle had been the Government House. The first clause of the military regulations (Enclosures to Court\u2019s Letters Vol. 7, 194-201) which accompanied the despatch of 17th June 1748, runs: That the Governor make his constant residence at the Fort that he may have the military more immediately under his eye and that he may be the better\n\n---\n\n1 The Parsonage is across Cathedral Street about thirty yards south of the southwest corner of the Cathedral close. Compare Bombay Town Materials, II. 292, 442.\nable to judge of the conduct and capacity of the officers and soldiers. It is not by this intended to restrain the Governor from being absent on the customary visits or tours in the country for health or diversion.\n\nMr. John Spencer's house continued to be the Government House till 1829. After its purchase as a Government House in 1757 Mr. Spencer's house was for some time known as the New House. Out of this New House about 11 A.M. on the 28th February 1760 came the President Mr. Bourchier, the most honourable man who ever graced the President's chair, and who in the year before had resigned in consequence of ignorant and unmerited censures by the Court of Directors on their President's exceedings. The President was attended by all the Council of thirteen except by Mr. Waters who was indisposed. He passed from the New House to the Marine House, in the present Dockyard, where he was received by the rest of the covenant servants and other principal inhabitants, and delivered the keys of the garrison to his successor Mr. Crommelin, the King's artillery and Company's infantry and artillery being drawn up on one side of the Green and sepoys on the other. (Pub. Diary 34 of 1760, 151.) In 1767 the title New House was dropped. On the 27th January 1767 about eleven o'clock in the forenoon the President the Honourable Charles Crommelin, whose resignation had been required in consequence of a disregard of orders in the case of certain pepper ships, attended by the Council, the rest of the covenant servants, and other leading Europeans and native inhabitants went from the Honourable Company's House to the Marine House, the infantry artillery and sepoys being drawn up on the Green from the President's House to the Marine House. (Pub. Diary 48 of 1767, 81.) In 1829 this house ceased to be the Government House and became the Secretariat, the Governor having removed his residence to Parel. The Bombay Gazette of the 18th March 1829 has the following: In the course of the last and present week the Secretariat has been removed into the Government House in the Fort.\n\nOf the Government House at Parel in 1750 Grose (Voyage to the East Indies, I, 46) writes: At Parel the Governor has a very agreeable country-house which was originally a Romish chapel belonging to the Jesuits but confiscated about 1719 for some foul practices against the English interest. It is now converted into a pleasant mansion house, and what with the additional buildings and improvements of the gardens, affords a spacious and commodious habitation. There is an avenue to it of a hedge and trees near a mile long; and, though near the sea side, is sheltered from the air of it by a hill between. Here the Governor may spend most part of the heats the air being cooler and fresher than in town; and nothing is wanting that may make a country retirement agreeable.\n\nAbout 1803 Sir James Mackintosh, then Recorder of Bombay, writes (Life, Vol. I. 228): We live about five miles of excellent road over a flat from our capital. We inhabit by the Governor's kindness his official country house, a noble building with some magnificent apartments and with two delightful rooms for my library in\nwhich I am now writing overlooking a large garden and fine parkish ground.\n\nAccording to a statement at page 50 of the Monthly Miscellany for 1850, Parei is a shortened form of Non-Pareil the Peerless. This whether intentional or otherwise is nothing more than one of the meaning-making family of jokes. The joke may possibly have been suggested by Neibuhr's French remark, 1763-64, Voyage, II. 12, that in the whole of India there is nothing equal 'point de Pareille' to Parei's splendid dining and ball rooms. Compare Hobson-Jobson, 842. In 1554 the name Parei, with Verella (Vad\u00e1la) Varel (Varli) and Siva (Sion), occurs in Botelho's list of aldeas or hamlets under the town of M\u00e2him. Compare Hobson-Jobson, 513. There seems no reason to doubt that the name of the house is taken from the name of the village. The probable origin of the village name is the tree Paral or padel Heterophragma chelonoides or Bignonia suaveolens the Tree Trumpet Flower.\u00b9\n\nThe history of St. George's Hospital, known as the European General Hospital, begins at the close of the seventeenth century. The climatic conditions of the four months between October 1675 and February 1676 were so deadly that a hundred English soldiers perished.\u00b2 In these circumstances it is not surprising that panic took the form of a demand for an European General Hospital. The plan of a hospital was forwarded to Bombay by the President and Council of Surat.\n\n\u00b9 Mr. A. Cumine, I.C.S. In support of this derivation Mr. Cumine notices that Parei is the centre of a group of tree names, East lies Vad\u00e1la the Banian Grove, south Chinchopkli the Tamarind Dell, west Mingut-Mandli the Pricklypear Tract, and north Madmala, the Cocoapalm Orchard now known as the M\u00e2him Woods. Beyond this group are Kambala Hill apparently the grove of kambal or kamal also called skimli Odina wodier; Byculla, Bh\u00e2yakhala, the Cassia fistula Level, bh\u00e2ya being a local Kumbi form of b\u00e2wus; Umbarkhadi the Fig Tree Creek; B\u00e2bhula Tank near the Jamsetji Hospital and B\u00e2hanlath on the east slope of Malabar Hill called after the babh\u00fbl or Acacia arabica; T\u00e2ddev the Brab God west of Byculla and T\u00e2gv\u00e2di the Brab Garden in west M\u00e2gaon; Phanasv\u00e2di the Jack Garden in Bhuleshvar; Bhendi Baz\u00e2r from its row of bhendis Hibiscus populnea north of Paidhoni; S\u00e2t\u00e2d the Seven Brabs and Vad\u00e2chigadi the Banyan Shoprow in the Old Town; Chinch Bandar the Tamarind Landing below Nauroji Hill; and A'm\u00eel\u00e2g\u00e2l In front of the Tamarind the bullock driver's name for Elphinstone Circle from the old tamarind at the north-east corner of the Cathedral close.\n\n\u00b2 Even before 1675 a hospital existed. What sort of building it was, when it was built, or whether it was simply a hired house, is not known. Still that some place was set apart for the sick, and that it was capable of accommodating other people in addition to the sick, can be gathered from the two following extracts of 1672. On the 23rd April 1672, in connection with the subject of building houses or providing accommodation for the Company's servants, the Surat President and Council write to Bombay (Surat Fact. Out. L. B. I of 1630-1673, 256; Forrest's Home Series, I. 64; Bombay Town Materials, II. 433): We take due notice of what you write concerning the building the houses of accommodation we ordered, and to that purpose sent you down bricklayers; and in regard you make so great difficulties in the matter, and that there is present accommodation in the hospital for factors and also warehouse room, you may defer the building of said houses until the President's coming down. Three weeks later, 16th May 1672, they again write: In regard you have satisfied us that for the present there is accommodation enough in the hospital, and other places, for the Company's servants, we think good that you totally desist from building those houses formerly ordered this year. (Surat Fact. Out. L. B. I of 1630-1673, 262; Forrest's Home Series, I. 64; Bombay Town Materials, II. 433.) In spite of this so-called Hospital, Fryer (New Account, 67) noticed in 1674 that Bombay had neither church nor hospital, though both were mightily to be desired.\nThe proposed building was to be able to receive seventy persons. The cost was not to exceed Rs. 4000, and it was estimated that about a thousand rupees would cover the annual expenses of the establishment, which was to be under the superintendence of a Resident Surgeon. As a temporary measure the old Court of Justice, a hired house on the Esplanade to the south-east of the present Cooperage, was prepared for the reception of the sick. In the following year a remarkable decrease in mortality was attributed to the establishment of the new hospital.\n\nDuring the early years of the eighteenth century near the Marine Yard, a building seems to have been erected to serve as a hospital, the cost being met from the proceeds of a half per cent duty on trade. That the work was completed some time before 1733 may be gathered from the following extract from a Bombay Government Consultation held the 11th June 1745: The small stock raised for the Church by appropriating the balance of the half per cent duty (after the hospital was finished) on close of our books in July 1733, and the continuance of it the year following, was such as the interest thereof defrayed the ordinary repairs and charges. Further the Diary of the 31st July 1744 records: The Committee appointed for visiting the Hospital report: The compound wall next the sea being pretty fallen down and the rest very old and much gone to decay, we beg leave to represent the necessity of having it rebuilt so soon as the season will permit. On this on the 3rd August the Board record: As there is an absolute necessity of repairing the compound wall, the same is ordered to be done with frugality.\n\n---\n\n1 Sec. Ont. L.

The following extracts show the want of an hospital and how it was supplied before 1677. On the 4th July 1676 Surat writes to Bombay (see above page 70): Take the first opportunity that presents for raising an hospital that we may sooner prevent those sicknesses that our people are so much subject unto. On the 19th July and 21st August 1676 Surat writes to Bombay: We like well your proposition of making the present Court of Judicature (that is the hired house outside of the Apollo Gate) an hospital and of taking the Deputy Governor's and Mr. Petit's house for the Court of Judicature (Surat Factory Out. L. B. 2 of 1675-76, 163, 174). On the 10th October 1676 Surat continues: We desire you to go forward without delay in fitting up the present Court of Judicature for a hospital. The sooner that so necessary a work is finished the better. (Surat Factory Out. L. B. 2 of 1675-76, 229.) On the 24th January 1677 (see above page 72) Bombay writes to Surat: Our soldiers continue healthful. Much of this improvement we attribute to our new hospital, we having taken the old Court of Judicature for that use. After the subsequent erection of the New Hospital in the Marine yard before 1733, this first hospital of 1676 was known as the Old Hospital. The following extract relates to its site. On the 30th July 1762 (Pub. Diary 38 of 1762, 410-412) the Sub-Engineer writes to Government: It is in my opinion probable that any European enemy that would attempt a siege against this place must land their troops upon Old Woman's island as the most convenient place both for landing the men and warlike stores, and the point behind Mr. Court's house would afford them a very sufficient shelter till such time as they could survey the ground along Back Bay. I therefore humbly suggest that in order to scour the beach opposite to Old Woman's island, so as to annoy the enemy and hinder their gaining any favourable spot of ground they may think convenient for them, a redoubt should be raised behind the Old Hospital with a communication with the outworks of the town. While they remain within cannon shot this redoubt will also create the enemy as much trouble and loss after passing it as before they came up to it. The distance of the redoubt from the town ditch will be but 620 feet, which renders the communication tolerable safe and will amount to but a small expense. Bombay Town Materials, II. 348.\n\n2 Pub. Diary 18 of 1744-45, 152.\nThe site of this hospital seems to have been nearly opposite the Old High Court, the present Great Western Hotel. It is so shown in Grose's map of about 1750.\n\nDuring the latter years of the eighteenth century an agitation was raised advocating the hospital's removal to meet the wants of the Marine Yard for space for timber and workmen. On the 4th April 1767 the Court of Directors write: As a proper place near the Marine Yard for the Company's timber, which is mentioned in the report of the Committee of Enquiry, seems absolutely necessary we permit you for this purpose to make any alteration with regard to the hospital or in any other manner that may be most conducive to our interest.\u00b9\n\nOn the 27th December 1778 the Committee appointed to survey the Bombay Docks write to Government: We are of opinion that two new docks may be built abreast of the second and third docks, capable of receiving any of the 74-gun ships, by removing the hospital, as mentioned by the Honourable Company in their commands of the 4th April 1767, and fixing the slips for building where the hospital now stands. Such a removal would greatly conduce towards making the Marine Yard more commodious, as there is at present little room.\u00b2\n\nOn the 24th April 1781 Rear Admiral Sir Edward Hughes writes to Government: The extent of the Marine Yard, as it is at this time, is much too small to give room for the necessary quantities of timber and workmen, and I earnestly recommend to you that you will extend it so as to comprehend the two surgeons' houses and the hospital on that side.\u00b3 Thereupon, on the 13th June 1781, Government resolve: The surgeons must be directed to report to us what place may be most suitable and convenient to remove the hospital to.\u2074\n\nA week later, the 19th June 1781, the surgeons write: After mature consideration on the qualities so highly requisite to be attended to in the choice of places for hospitals in this climate on which the speedy recovery of the sick so materially depends, and in some degree the health and strength of the garrison, we do recommend the house the Admiral lately occupied as the most convenient and suitable for a general hospital, since the situation is high, dry, healthy, and convenient, the apartments are very spacious, lofty, dry, and airy\u2014indeed they are so well adapted as to admit of a free circulation of air through the whole of them in every season of the year, a circumstance of the greatest importance in a hospital. The out-offices are also convenient, with the command of good water, and there is room sufficient to accommodate 400 sick Europeans, allowing from 42 to 64 square feet to each man. We are of opinion that there is not in or near this garrison any place or building equally convenient, healthy, and commodious for the above purpose.\u2075\n\n\u00b9 Pub. Dep. Court's L.

Diary 78 of 1781, 332.\nAt the next day's Consultation, the 20th June 1781, Government resolve: Before we consider this subject, it is further ordered that a plan be prepared and laid before us, for our approbation, of a suitable hospital for this garrison, constructed with bomb-proof apartments for the reception of the sick in case of a siege.\n\nAccordingly on the 23rd September 1781 the Principal Engineer reports: In obedience to an order received from General Goddard, the 22nd June last, I have the honour to present to your Honourable Board the accompanying plan and estimate for building a hospital for 500 men with the other necessary buildings thereto appertaining: cook-rooms, apartment for lunatics, salivating rooms, dispensary, and a guard room. In the upper bomb-proofs I have placed apartments for two assistant surgeons and twenty-two apartments for sick officers which during the time of a siege will be much wanted. The situation of this hospital is proposed to be in Moody's bay behind the present old revetment laying between the two-gun battery and the cremaillere work. Many other situations in the town would be more eligible for an hospital; but the removal of so great a number of houses to give sufficient space for so large a building would seriously increase the expense. All such situations as would be greatly superior in point of air near the ramparts have, besides the inconvenience of many large and expensive buildings, the danger of being subjected to the fire of an enemy during a siege. I have made the bomb-proof as spacious as possible for the number of patients they are intended for, well knowing that in this climate a number of sick persons being too closely lodged must be very unsalutary. At the same time the situation in the Moody's bay has great advantages. It will be seldom incommoded by an enemy's fire. It will be well ventilated having one side next to the sea where a number of windows will be opened, and the filth will be constantly washed away by the tide. It will be necessary to remove two houses and part of a third which are now standing on the ground where the hospital is proposed to be built. The valuation for the removal of these is not yet made; but I will immediately set about it, should your Honourable Board resolve to put this plan into execution. In front of the whole I have proposed a compound wall by which means a sufficient space will remain clear to render the building more airy and consequently more salutary than it would be without the wall.\n\nOn receipt of this report on the 26th September 1781 Government passed the following order: Read a letter from the Principal Engineer, accompanied with a plan and estimate of a bomb-proof hospital for this garrison, from which it appears that the expense thereof is computed at the large sum of Rs. 5,15,025-0-27. The expense of this undertaking, even allowing it should not exceed the estimate, is too great for us to think of incurring in our present circumstances. Still that we may be judges of the whole expense, and that the plan may be digested and prepared in all its parts, in case at any time hereafter it should be\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 78 of 1781, 326.\n2 Pub. Diary 78 of 1781, 457-458.\njudged proper to carry it into execution, the Engineer must be directed to give in an estimate of the expense of removing the houses necessary to make room for this building, and the principal surgeons must also give us their opinion on the situation and construction of the proposed hospital with respect to healthiness and convenience.\n\nTen years later, on the 18th November 1791, the Hospital Board write: Agreeable to your commands we have in concert with the Chief Engineer fixed on a large vacant spot of ground in the possession of D\u00e1da Nasarv\u00e1nji formerly intended by General Sir Archibald Campbell for a place of arms opposite to the Cumberland ravelin (now in Hornby Row about forty yards north of Sir Jamsedji\u2019s town residence) which we think in every point of view a most eligible situation for a General Hospital. On the 29th November the Board ordered the survey of the ground. On the 6th December the Chief Engineer reports the expense of building a new hospital to be: New hospital Rs. 63,985, ground and houses of D\u00e1dy Rs. 13,500, Barjorji Dor\u00e1bji\u2019s house Rs. 18,000, total Rs. 95,485.\n\nRegarding this proposed site on the 18th January 1792 the Bombay Government write to the Court: The adoption of the Chief Engineer\u2019s report would occasion the necessity of erecting a general hospital in lieu of the hospital proposed to be removed for the enlargement of the Marine Yard. As we were desirous that you should be possessed of the fullest information to direct your judgment in determining on a plan as complete as possible, we called on your Medical Board assisted by the Chief Engineer to recommend a spot the most eligible in every point of view for the erection of an hospital. Having received their opinions at large we do ourselves the honour to transmit the several reports plans and estimates for your Honourable Court\u2019s decision.\n\nIn reply on the 25th June 1793 the Court write: From a consideration of the very great expenses which will attend the proposed enlargement of your Marine Yard amounting to Rs. six l\u00f3khs we think it necessary before we authorise you to commence the work to submit the plans to the inspection of such gentlemen as have been high in station at your Presidency and of such professional men whether in the King\u2019s or Company\u2019s service as may have had an opportunity of forming a judgment. In the meantime we repeat our directions contained in the 22nd paragraph of our letter in the Public Department of the 15th December 1790 that no part of the work be undertaken without our previous approbation.\n\nIn consequence of these divergent estimates and opinions no action was taken for many years. The Fire Map of 1803 shows the General Hospital on the old site, hampering the Marine Yard. At a Consulta-\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 78 of 1781, 453 - 454.\n2 Pub. Diary 99 of 1791, 861, 878.

No space will be left unoccupied by buildings within the walls except the plot of ground where the fire began. To this site Ardesar Dady a rich Parsi merchant claims a right but he is willing to give it to Government for an equivalent in land on the island of Salsette. This exchange seems the cheapest and best means for gaining this large area of private property within the walls. Upon that site there would be room to build a barrack for your artillery and as it is about the centre of the garrison the artillery could be nowhere better placed. This ground you may say would come to the Honourable Company for a mere trifle as the lands of Salsette are not profitable. Besides there might be a future advantage in this rich man's example inducing other wealthy natives to settle and cultivate that beautiful island. The Board ordered the Town Committee to complete an inquiry into the title or claim Ardesar may prefer to the spot in question, adjusting with him thereon such a compensation of land that may be at the Company's disposal at Salsette as may leave the ground adverted to by General Nicolls at the disposal of Government for the construction of such buildings as they may deem necessary.\n\nOn the 22nd February 1806 Government write to the Court: We have the honour to refer to your Honourable Court's particular attention a representation from the Commanding Officer of the Forces, dated the 1st July, of the great want of comfortable barracks for Europeans within the garrison. And proposing in the first instance to effect an exchange with Ardesar Dady for a space of ground, in which a barrack for the artillery might be built, belonging to that merchant left unoccupied by buildings for an equivalent in land on the island of Salsette. The proposed exchange of property is under reference to the Town Committee. We are fully impressed with the particular eligibility of the site pointed out for barracks.\n\nOn the 25th February 1807 Bombay resumes: In the 18th paragraph of our address in the Military Department dated the 22nd February 1806 your Honourable Court were advised that a reference had been made to the Town Committee on the subject of an exchange of ground between the Honourable Company and Ardesar Dady, the latter receiving on the island of Salsette an assignment of land equal in value to what he was to transfer to Government for the important public purposes adverted to in that paragraph. On the 1st of August the Committee delivered their report. They fixed the value of the ground measuring 5000 square yards at Rs. 25 a square yard. Government resolved to give Rs. 20 a square yard. Ardesar refused to take the offer of Rs. 20 a square yard but was\n\n---\n\n1 Military Diary 81 of 1805, 2566-67, 2570-71.\n2 Military Dept. Letters to the Court Vol. 6 of 1805-1807, 89.\nwilling to take Rs. 25 a square yard. A Committee was appointed to fix the value, who confirmed the resolution of 5th August 1806, namely the offer of Rs. 20 a square yard. Ardesar wrote a letter asking the Government to refer the matter to the Court by whose resolution he was ready to abide.\n\nThe Court of Directors in a letter of the 21st April 1809 write: We find the value put upon the ground by the Town Committee to be Rs. 25 per square yard while the Governor was of opinion that Rs. 20 the square yard was a fair price because at that rate it would produce to Ardesar Dady Rs. 1,01,020, a sum not only far exceeding the original purchase money but even the valuation put upon it by his father in 1791 which was only Rs. 60,000. This fact, however, does not weaken Ardesar's claim to the rate recommended by the Town Committee. We therefore direct that you pay him for the ground in question at the rate of Rs. 25 a square yard according to the valuation of the Town Committee.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 9th March 1810 Government read the following letter from the Agent for Supplies to Government, dated 7th March 1810: Having received the directions of the Honourable the Governor dated 2nd instant to make up the gun carriage for His Majesty's ship Minden I lose no time in requesting that a convenient place may be allotted for the purpose of carrying on the work and at the same time respectfully beg leave to observe that the spot of ground situated near the Bazar Gate which was lately purchased by Government from Ardesar Dady is in every respect well suited for a workyard. The Government acquiesced in his request.\n\nAt a Consultation of the 17th February 1813 Government read the following letter from the Military Board, dated 11th February 1813: Temporary sheds which were erected by the late Agent for Supplies on the ground now occupied by the Agent of the gun carriage factory are become completely decayed and want repairs. The consideration of this letter was postponed.\n\nOn the 31st December 1814 Government write to the Court: It is necessary we should acquaint your Honourable Court that it has for some time past been an object to us to ascertain if we could not appropriate to greater advantage the ground purchased some years ago from the late Ardesar Dady for the purpose of erecting a barrack for European troops within the Fort than by allowing it to be appropriated to the use of the gun carriage factory. With this view we called upon the Military Board to lay before us an estimate of the expense which would attend the removal of the present factory to a vacant spot of ground contiguous to the Castle, called Moody's bay; but finding the estimate to amount to Rs. 56,226-0-41, we have for the present abandoned the measure. The Military Board, in transmitting to us\n\n---\n\n1 Revenue Dep. Letters to the Court Vol. 5 of 1804 - 1810, 63-72.\n2 Pub. Dep. Court's Letters Vol. 17 of 1807 - 1809, 365-373. The Salsette villages given to Ardesar Dady in exchange were Malar, Eksar, Kaneri, Tulsi, Era, Magathan, and Daisar.\n3 Military Diary 161 of 1810, 1311 - 1312.\n4 Military Diary 225 of 1813, 710 - 711.\ntheir recommendation for the formation of the ordnance wharf, took advantage of that opportunity to suggest that in case the gun carriage factory should be removed to Moody's bay an hospital for Europeans might be erected on the ground now occupied by the gun carriage factory, and that the sheds now appropriated to the use of a Garrison Hospital immediately under the walls of the Castle and contiguous to the ordnance wharf might be converted into a place for the reception of the field and battering trains and of other stores belonging to the arsenal. From the Military Board's report the present Hospital appears to be very ill suited to the accommodation of the sick from its very confined situation to leeward of the town and surrounded by buildings, whereas the spot which has been selected by the Military Board possesses advantages superior perhaps to any other within the Fort. And as the amount authorised by your Honourable Court in your despatch of the 5th January 1810 to be incurred for building the barrack has not been expended, your Honourable Court may perhaps be inclined to view this proposition in a favourable light especially when you understand that should this plan be adopted the sum of Rs. 40,000 which would be required for the erection of a gun-shed will not be necessary should the field train be accommodated in the shed now occupied by the European sick.\n\nIn reply, on the 15th January 1817, the Court write to Bombay: We desire to be informed of the total expense which would be incurred by the adoption of the plan recommended to our consideration for erecting an European General Hospital on the ground now occupied by the gun carriage factory.\n\nIn reply on the 20th December 1817 Government write to the Court: In pursuance of your orders of 15th January 1817 we had called for the plan and estimates of a hospital for the European sick to be constructed on the site of the gun carriage factory, and had suggested the removal of the factory to the present hospital. This was done mainly because the gun carriage factory was better calculated for the comfortable accommodation of the sick and because the present hospital from its contiguity to the arsenal appeared to possess considerable advantages as a factory. These documents have now been received and are transmitted for your Honourable Court's inspection. We hope to be favoured at an early period with your permission to erect an appropriate building for the comfortable accommodation of the sick the present buildings being very ill adapted to that purpose. In the plan two buildings are proposed to be erected. Of these the principal is to be divided into eight wards and the other is to be detached into two without any immediate communication, one of the two being appropriated for the reception of women. Out-offices and hot and cold baths are also included in the plan. The expense of construction is estimated at Rs. 1,44,095-2-90. The proposed dimensions of each of the ten wards are 50 feet by 25 and 17 feet high. Each ward will have 82 feet of wall applicable to cots with space for three\n\n---\n\n1 Military Dep. Letters to the Court Vol. 9 of 1812 - 1814, 361-365.\n2 Military Dep. Court's Letters Vol. 10 of 1817, 64-65.\ncots between the doors and windows opening to the front veranda. Each ward may be considered capable of accommodating twenty sick without being crowded or placing any cots in the veranda. The Medical Board consider the hospital to be on the whole well adapted for its intended purpose. The few suggestions offered by that Board are noticed by the Military Board in sending up the plan. Your Honourable Court will learn from the letter which accompanied the plan, that provision is made for securing an ample supply of water, and that the ravelin immediately fronting the proposed hospital and divided from it only by the road affords a hearty and desirable place of recreation for convalescents. It must be unnecessary to add anything to the representation already before your Honourable Court of the necessity that exists for constructing a hospital within this garrison which frequently contains three or four European regiments. We confidently hope the measure now proposed will receive your approbation. In regard to the expense attending the removal of the gun carriage factory and the suggestion that it should be transferred to the site on which the garrison hospital now stands, the Military Board have reported that the barracks lately occupied by the artillery on Old Woman's island appear far better calculated for a factory than either the garrison hospital or Moody's bay and admit of being more easily converted into a commodious factory than the buildings now appropriated to that purpose. The estimate for the gun carriage factory on Colaba amounts to Rs. 30,765-1-40, which only exceeds by Rs. 643-0-90 the sum which it would have cost to repair the buildings now occupied by the factory.\n\nOn the 25th May 1819 the Court write to Bombay: We are very unwilling to sanction the expenditure of so large a sum of money as the European Hospital is calculated to cost without full assurance that the proposed hospital will answer all the purposes for which such a building is designed. Of this we are led to entertain some doubts from remarks of the Medical Board relative to the necessity of free ventilation, the position of the privies, and a place for the exercise of the convalescents. At Fort William the European Hospital is without the walls of the fortress by which a much freer ventilation is obtained than could be procured within the works unless indeed the building were to be raised to a level with the rampart which does not appear to be the design in contemplation with you and would be objectionable on the score of expense as well as on other considerations. For the present, therefore, we must decline authorising so expensive a building as is here proposed to us, but we desire that you will communicate these remarks to the Military and Medical Boards with a view to a revised consideration of the subject. For the reasons given in your letter dated the 20th December 1817, for the removal of the gun carriage factory to Colaba we sanction this expense.\n\nIn continuation, on the 14th November 1821, Government write to the Court: In reply to your letter dated 25th May 1819, we have the\n\n---\n\n1 Military Dep. Letters to the Court Vol. 12 of 1817, 217-230.\n2 Military Dep. Court's Letters Vol. 12 of 1819, 62-64.\nhonour to submit to your Honourable Court a report from the Military Board with one from the Superintending Engineer forwarding revised plans and estimates for a garrison hospital at this Presidency. These documents were prepared by the Chief Engineer agreeably to the suggestions of the Medical Board with the exception of the measure of retaining a part of the old hospital as it appeared to the Military Board that by the addition of a third storey the accommodation required by the Medical Board would be obtained in one building. The plan as now submitted has been laid before the Medical Board. As they are of opinion that it will answer all the purposes for which it is intended we trust that it will meet with the approbation of your Honourable Court and that you will authorise it to be carried into execution. The estimate amounts to Rs. 1,58,394-2-11. As your Honourable Court has noticed that the European Hospital at Fort William was without the walls of the fortress the Military Board have endeavoured to ascertain how far such a measure could be adopted at Bombay. In communication with the Medical Board they have for the reasons stated found an hospital outside of the walls to be impracticable.\n\nOn the 31st October 1822 Bombay resumes: His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief has represented that the site of the General Hospital proposed in our letter of the 14th November 1821, though the best to be had, is objectionable for a building allotted to such purposes on so large a scale. His Excellency has suggested the expediency of reducing the dimensions and consequently the expense of the hospital by providing for the sick of the European regiment quartered in Fort George in a hospital to be there erected. The arguments which satisfied His Excellency of the expediency of this arrangement were fully concurred in and supported by the recommendations of the Medical Board, the Chief Engineer, and the Military Board. We have accordingly sanctioned an estimate of Rs. 68,452-3-5 for the construction of a hospital at Fort George. As this will materially reduce the expense of the General Hospital we trust your Honourable Court will approve the measure.\n\nIn reply, on the 6th October 1824, the Court write to Bombay: For the reasons given we are disposed to approve and sanction the erection of the building described in your letter of the 31st October 1822.\n\nOn the 30th April 1825 Bombay writes to the Court: In the 132nd paragraph of our despatch of the 17th September 1823, your Honourable Court were informed that steps had been taken for ascertaining what difference would arise in the estimate for a hospital for Europeans in garrison handed up in the Military Board\u2019s letter of the 5th March 1805, by the reduction in its dimensions consequent on the erection of the hospital in Fort George. We have now the honour to report our proceedings on the subject subsequent to that communication.\n\n---\n\n1 Military Dep. Letters to the Court Vol. 16 of 1821, 131-132.\n2 Military Dep.

Letters to the Court Vol. 18 of 1823, 165-167.\nIn reply to a reference to the Military Board relative to the reduction in the work it appeared by their Secretary's letter of the 27th September 1823 that a saving would thence be effected in the sum of Rs. 45,152-2-35. On receiving this estimate it became a point of consideration whether the delay of a further reference to your Honourable Court should be incurred or whether the work should be proceeded with under the sanction of the 25th May 1819. As a period of ten years has elapsed since the subject of the hospital was first recommended to your Honourable Court and as our letter of the 14th November 1821 put you in possession of the fullest assurance that it would answer all the purposes for which such a building is designed, there seemed no ground for any longer delaying to carry the work into execution. Still, owing to the improbability of more than two European regiments being at any time stationed within the garrison of Bombay, some doubt was entertained of the necessity for providing accommodation for another European regiment to be quartered in the town barracks. We therefore deemed it expedient to consult the Medical Board both as to the extent of the General Hospital when reduced to two stories for the accommodation of seamen of the navy marine and merchant service, of staff sergeants, conductors, Europeans generally, and females, and also as to the site of the proposed building in point of salubrity. It was likewise suggested for the consideration of the Medical Board whether part of the town barracks might not be appropriated to hospital purposes; or a floating hospital be established in the harbour with reference to our confined space on shore; or if it were ultimately found necessary to erect a new building whether Colaba would not offer a preferable site supposing it were intended to complete the causeway. The reply of the Medical Board, dated 12th January 1824, embracing all these points clearly satisfied us of the utter impracticability of providing accommodation for the description of sick above alluded to or for the sick of a regiment quartered in the town barracks without proceeding in the construction of a new hospital. It was accordingly resolved (Mr. Warden dissenting): (1) That an hospital should be built to unite the purposes of a Garrison and an European General Hospital capable of accommodating 120 patients, namely 60 general patients and 50 military (the Commander-in-Chief being of opinion that no greater number need be provided for) and 10 to spare with the requisite apartments for petty officers and females. (2) That the lower part be appropriated for the accommodation of the hospital establishments store-rooms and other offices, so as to obviate the necessity for many out-buildings, and to secure to the sick all the ventilation and advantage of elevation. The site of the former gun carriage factory was decidedly recommended by the Medical Board in their letter to the Military Board of the 17th July 1820 and repeated on the 12th January 1824 as the most salubrious and convenient situation for the hospital. We accordingly fixed upon that site and directed that a revised estimate of the work might be prepared showing the further reduction that would arise from the change in the plan and dimensions. The estimate was submitted in the Military Board's letter of the 25th August 1824 which compared with the original estimate exhibited a\nsaving of Rs. 64,431-3-64. The new estimate was accordingly passed and the work is now in progress.\n\nThree years later, 25th January 1828, the Court express their consent to the erection of this hospital. They write: As the majority of the members of your Government were of opinion that a new hospital as described in your letter of the 30th April 1825 was necessary, we shall not object to your resolution for erecting it.\n\nIn March 1860, on a report by the medical authorities condemning the Hornby Row Hospital as no longer suitable, Government determined to dispose of the building with the ground on which it stood, and to utilise the proceeds towards erecting a new hospital on the Cooperage site. Meanwhile it was decided to use the barracks in Fort George as a temporary hospital. The barracks were vacated by the troops in September 1861; the old hospital, with its site, was sold in April 1862 for Rs. 3,10,000; and in December 1862 the Executive Committee for the removal of the ramparts were directed to set aside a site near the Cooperage.\n\nThe next fourteen years (1862-1876) passed without any actual progress.\n\nThe first project prepared in 1862 for a building on the Cooperage site was estimated to cost Rs. 3,86,605. This design was rejected as not being suitable; and it was decided to call for designs by competition, and to offer prizes of Rs. 2500 for the best, and Rs. 1000 for the next in order of merit. The cost was limited to Rs. 3,80,000 for the main hospital and Rs. 1,25,000 for residences for the Surgeon and House Surgeon and quarters for eight sick officers. Of seventeen designs received, one by an English architect was selected, and foundations on the Esplanade Parade ground were begun, when the work had to be stopped that the design might be referred to the Sanitary Commissioner. This stoppage of work involved the loss of about Rs. 49,000.\n\nIn 1876 the hospital was moved from the temporary huts in Fort George into the building called the Officers\u2019 Quarters, which had previously been used partly as the residence of the Resident Surgeon, partly for convalescent patients, and also as a contagious ward. This though regarded as a temporary measure, for a time removed all serious cause of complaint.\n\nTen years later in April 1886 His Excellency Lord Reay Governor of Bombay, and the late Sir M. Melvill Member of Council, inspected the hospital. Sir M. Melvill revived the question of erecting a new hospital, in an able and strongly worded minute dated 12th April 1886, and a Committee was appointed to report:\n\n(a) Which site or sites would be appropriate and\n(b) What accommodation would be required.\n\nOn receipt of the report, on the 25th September 1886, orders were issued for the preparation of complete plans and estimates. The plans\n\n---\n\n1 Military Dep. Letters to the Court Vol. 20 of 1825, 68-74.\n2 Military Dep. Court\u2019s Letters Vol. 21 of 1828, 29.\nand estimates were returned as they appeared to Government to require an extravagant area of very valuable ground. Meanwhile, the Finance Committee had reported that the project of the hospital could be deferred until finances were more flourishing. Government contested this view, and determined to utilise the funds at their disposal in starting the work.\n\nIn April 1888 a Committee, appointed to consider the question of area, recommended a curtailment which Government accepted as reasonable. A complete block plan of the site was thereupon called for.\n\nIn the meantime Government had decided that the new hospital should provide 180 beds against 140 in the old hospital, with a nursing establishment of a Lady Superintendent, 13 nurses, 10 probationers, and an inferior establishment, in all of 61 persons.\n\nOn the 22nd February 1889, on the ruins of the old Fort George, the foundation stone of St. George's Hospital was laid by His Excellency Lord Reay and the building was completed and handed for occupation in the beginning of December 1892.\n\nThe buildings actually carried out are: The Nurses' and Probationers' quarters including a ground and two upper floors. On the ground floor are a sitting-room, a dining-room, and an office, and two bed-rooms with bath-rooms, and verandas to the east and west. On both the first and second floors are eight bed-rooms with bath-rooms, a west veranda, and a principal and servants' staircase. The Lady Superintendent's and Sisters' quarters include a ground and an upper floor. The ground floor contains a sitting-room for the Lady Superintendent, a general sitting-room, a dining-room, and an office with verandas to the east west and south. The upper floor contains a bedroom for the Lady Superintendent, with a bath and dressing-room, and five other bed-rooms with bath-rooms, and verandas to the west and south. A separate staircase for the Lady Superintendent in the southeast corner, and a principal and servants' staircase to the north, are also provided.\n\nThe Male Ward of the hospital, a building 318 ft. 9 in. long and 118 ft. 79 in. wide, includes a ground and two upper floors. On the ground floor three general wards give accommodation, in the aggregate, for 40 beds, and a special ward for one bed. There are also two rooms for nurses and a dining and reading-room. On the first floor are two wards, each containing 14 beds, and a special ward for one bed, two nurses' rooms, a chapel, a dining operating and dark-room, and a general store-room. On the second floor are two wards, each accommodating fourteen beds, and two special wards for one bed each, a reading, a dining, and a nurses' room. Over the porch are two large rooms. The room on the first floor is the Physician's private room, and that on the second floor the Physician's office. Attached to each floor are bath-rooms and lavatories. In the rear of the hospital a detached block, connected with the main building by a passage, provides accommodation for a dispensary, and offices and store-rooms for an apothecary a steward and an overseer. There is also a detached building, connected with the main building by a passage, in which is a cook-room, scullery, and store-room.\nThe whole of the main building is surrounded by corridors which extend to the blocks on the flanks.\n\nThe Resident Surgeon's quarters include a ground and upper floor. The ground floor contains a dining-room, drawing-room, an office, pantry, and a carriage porch. On the upper floor are two bed-rooms, a dressing-room, and three bath-rooms.\n\nThe total expenditure on works connected with the hospital amounted to Rs. 5,78,859. The details are:\n\n| Item                                      | Cost   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Male Ward and Roads                      | 4,26,693 |\n| Nurses' and Probationers' Quarters        | 45,911 |\n| Lady Superintendent's and Sisters' Quarters | 37,751 |\n| Coach and Servants' Rooms                 | 5352   |\n| Drainage                                  | 4898   |\n| Water-supply                              | 3021   |\n| Coach-house                               | 7128   |\n| Resident Surgeon's Quarters               | 39,915 |\n| Iron Railing                              | 7835   |\n| Garden                                    | 1380   |\n| **Total**                                 | **5,78,859** |\n\nThe buildings as executed were all designed by Mr. J. Adams, Architectural Executive Engineer, and the works were carried out by Kh\u00e1n Bah\u00e1dur Mancharji K\u00e1vasji Marzb\u00e1n, C.I.E., under the supervision of the Honourable Mr. T. D. Little, Chief Engineer Northern Division.\n\nOne of the proposals put forward by President Aungier in 1671 was to build a Fair Common House wherein might be also appointed chambers for the Courts of Justice, warehouses or granaries for corn and ammunition, as also prisons for several offenders. The prison portion of the new buildings was to be in the Baz\u00e1r street so that the inmates might beg alms of passers. It therefore occupied the east or Bohora Baz\u00e1r front of the Court House which as detailed below is the central ruin in the enclosure now known as M\u00e1pla Por.\n\nThe following extract shows that in 1687 the jail was in this M\u00e1pla Por Building. On the 13th April 1687 the Bombay Council write to Surat: We presume Your Excellency will have the matter stated according to the canons of the church by our Padres here, and remit the same by this conveyance. The Padre who christened or received into the society of the Romish religion one N. Thorpe, was committed prisoner to the county jail in the Baz\u00e1r by Judge Vauxe on the 11th April 1687.\n\nBetween 1720 when the Court House was accommodated in R\u00e1ma K\u00e1m\u00e1ti's Buildings and 1728 no reference has been traced to the prison. It seems probable that at least during the latter part of this period\n\n---\n\n1 Bombay Town Materials, I. 40.\n2 Bombay Town Materials, III. 4.\n3 Sec. Out. L. B. 4 of 1677-1687, 66, 76-77.\nprisoners were confined in Dongri Fort near the site of the present (1894) European General Hospital. A Consultation of the 3rd May 1728 records: The justices of the late sessions held the 29th and 30th April and 1st instant, having upon a presentment made them from the Grand Jury, complained of the want of a prison, a plan was laid before them showing how at a cost of Rs. 2000 Dongri Fort can be made proper for the same. As the justices approved and ordered this amount to be levied on the English inhabitants as well as on the several other castes on this island, and as for some time past the said fort has been of no other use than for a prison and may be rendered more commodious than any building we can erect for the same expense, it is resolved that Dongri Fort be appropriated for the purpose of a prison. The following quotations seem to imply that instead of adapting the fort for a prison at a cost of Rs. 2000 a separate building was raised close to the fort at a cost of over Rs. 5000.\n\nIn 1739, apprehending a Maratha invasion of Bombay, Dongri Fort was strengthened and the prison at Dongri was demolished when the prisoners were accommodated in a house rented of the Modi at Rs. 25 a month, situated within 200 paces of the fort. In 1745 as the Modi\u2019s house required costly repairs it was given up. A Consultation of the 19th March 1745 records: The house rented by the Honourable Company of the Modi at Rs. 25 a month and used for the county prison requiring such costly repair as neither the Modi nor the county agree to meet, and considering that the county has already laid out Rs. 5000 in building the prison at Dongri since demolished upon erecting the new fortification, it is agreed that some of the lower rooms of the house in the Marine Yard be appropriated for a prison. This arrangement seems not to have been carried out. In 1750 Grose describes a small untenable little fort on Dongri Point of no defense and which serves now for the town prison for debtors or criminals. Probably prisoners continued to be kept in Dongri fort till the fort was demolished in 1769. Apparently the prisoners were then as proposed in 1745 transferred to the Marine Yard rooms.\n\nFrom 1769 to 1804 the prison accommodation in the Marine Yard continued unsatisfactory. At a Consultation on the 24th July 1771 the Board read the following letter from the clerk of the peace, dated 23rd April 1771: The Grand Jury have represented that the town jail\n\n---\n\n1 Prisoners could hardly have been kept in Dongri Fort in 1689-90 when the Sidis raised batteries on the hill. On the other hand the Dongri Fort had been in use for a prison some time before 1728. See Bombay Town Materials, II, 513 and III, 22.\n\n2 See above page 22.\n\n3 A Consultation of the 24th December 1742 records: The Mody presenting a bill for the rent of a house used for a prison from the 1st May 1739 to the 30th September 1742 amounting to Rs. 1025, also for provisions supplied the criminals Rs. 1036-3-83 making in the whole Rs. 2061-3-83 in part whereof he has only been paid Rs. 398-3-9 whence there remain due Rs. 1663-0-74 to which the Mody is justly entitled. It is therefore directed that his account be credited for the sum of Rs. 1064-2-38 he owed under the 31st July last and the further sum of Rs. 598-2-36 to be paid out of the treasury and cleared on the books by the head of Account Fines.

Under this letter is the entry: The consideration of this letter is deferred. Two years later the subject was again brought to the notice of Government. In 1773 the Sheriff represented the jail to be in a ruinous and untenable situation and unfit for the reception of prisoners. But on a survey made the land paymaster held the jail to be in good condition. After an interval of four years (1777) the Grand Jury represented the ruinous condition of the jail. Government said they were convinced the jail was ruinous, insecure, and unfit for the use to which it was put. Government thought a part of Fort George might very easily be converted into a proper place for a jail, and ordered the engineer to survey it and to report what alterations or additions might be necessary with the expense of carrying the same into execution. This project being found to be attended with great expense it was given up. As a jail was indispensable the engineer was ordered to frame an estimate showing the cost required to make additions to the then existing jail in the Marine Yard. This estimate submitted in 1778 amounted to Rs. 16,252-3-0. On account of the largeness of this estimate and because Government considered the existing building particularly inconvenient to the Marine Yard they resolved that a proper place should be found in the town to build an entirely new jail. This they supposed would not cost more than the estimate of Rs. 16,252-3-0.\n\nIn 1779 the complaints against the existing jail were renewed. The Sheriff represented the condition of the jail to be very bad and the jail to be very full of prisoners. Government again took into consideration the selection of a proper spot for a new jail. But, after a visit to the existing jail, the President and Mr. Carnac and the Engineer came to the conclusion that at a small expense the existing jail might be rendered sufficiently commodious and separate places be made for the felons and the debtors by appropriating for the accommodation of the prisoners the upper part then used as a sail loft. Government therefore directed the engineer to submit an estimate of the cost required to make the necessary alterations. This estimate amounted to Rs. 14,073. The engineer also reported that a jail might be erected on the spot between the new work and the Bandar battery, but, he added, it might in that case prevent the cannon of the Castle playing on the Pen and ground adjacent within the works. For this reason Government resolved not to erect a new jail on the spot in question, but to make the necessary additions to the existing jail. Two years later (1781) Rear Admiral Sir Edward Hughes recommended that the Marine Yard should be extended. This project required that the jail be removed to some other spot, and this Government ordered. In spite of this order the jail seems to have continued in the Marine Yard for many years. In 1786 its inconvenient situation and untenable state were again represented to Government by the Sheriff. On this representation in January 1787 Government observed that repairs had been executed to the jail when required but as to its situation it was out of their power to allow a more secure place.\nOn the 18th April 1798 (Pub. Diary 132 of 1798, 953) the Civil Auditor writes to Government: This building, the county jail, would be very valuable if laid into the Marine Yard. And I do not see any necessity for having a prison within the fort. The present one has been often and very justly complained of for not affording sufficient accommodation to the prisoners.\n\nAt last in 1799 a plot of ground at Umarkh\u00e1di was purchased and the present jail was begun and completed in 1804. A slab on the western gateway of the jail enclosure bears this inscription:\n\nTHIS GAOL WAS BUILT DURING THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE HONOURABLE JONATHAN DUNCAN ESQUIRE 1804.\n\nOnly three references to the old Mint have been traced. In January 1677 a statement of the cost of the Mint was sent to the Court of Directors; in January 1741 the land paymaster complained of the risk of parts of the Mint having palm-thatched roofs; and in September 1755 Captain De Funek said the Mint interfered with the Castle guns and should be moved.\n\nThe present (1894) Mint was built in 1829 at a cost, as valued about 1874, of Rs. 35,77,000 of which the ground cost Rs. 12,62,000, the building Rs. 15,84,000, and the machinery Rs. 7,31,000. The inscription runs:\n\nTHE MINT DESIGNED AND CONSTRUCTED BY MAJOR JOHN HAWKINS OF THE BOMBAY ENGINEERS COMMENCED A.D. 1824. COMPLETED A.D. 1829.\n\nA Parsonage House was bought by Government in 1738 and continued as a Parsonage till 1801. The site is (1894) across Cathedral street about thirty yards south of the south-west gate of the Cathedral close. It is the second house to the south of Armenian Lane. In their letter of the 25th February 1747 para 57, the Court write (Pub. Dep. Court's Letters Vol. 3 of 1742-1751, 141): We cheerfully acquiesce in the requisite expense for putting the Parsonage House in decent order. The house (Bombay Town Materials, II. 292) was given up in 1801 because as the report says the clergyman was unable to sleep in consequence of a cotton screw built close by it. The clergyman who complained was the Rev. H. Burrows after whom, as recorded in 1816 in Qui Hai's Adventures, the Sonapur burying ground on Back Bay was known as Padre Burrows' Godown. Padre Burrows did not use his own Godown. As late as 1818 he stated in an English Law Court that he had been a resident chaplain in Bombay for forty-two years.\n\nSince 1874 (January 1) the Secretariat has been housed in the large building the southmost in the line of great public offices that face Back Bay. Before 1874 the Secretariat offices were accommodated.\n\n---\n\n1 Bombay Town Materials, II. 434.  \n2 Bombay Town Materials, III. 92-93.  \n3 Bombay Town Materials, II. 312.\nin the large house on the west side of Apollo Street now known as the Old Secretariat and chiefly used as the offices of the Solicitors to Government. About the middle of March 1829 during the Governorship of Sir John Malcolm the Secretariat offices were moved into this Old Secretariat.\n\nBefore 1829 the Secretariat offices were accommodated in a large block of buildings to the north of the Cathedral, the site now occupied by Kemp's Buildings and by the offices of the B. B. & C. I. Railway Company. The details recorded in the 1813-1825 survey are confirmed by the following passage in Warden's Landed Tenures of Bombay (20th August 1814, Bom. Gov. Sel. LXIV. 47-48 and MS. Sel. 54, 30-31 paras 121, 122): A part of the extensive range of buildings at present (1814) appropriated for the accommodation of the Secretary's office was in 1764 bought from Mr. Whitehill for the sum of Rs. 45,000. About the same time the rest of the public offices were accommodated in a neighbouring house which was bought from Mr. John Hunter for Rs. 60,000. Mr. Warden notices (Ditto, para. 122) that Mr. Hunter's House was formerly called either the Second's House or the Guard's House perhaps because the Church Gate Guard were lodged in the large rooms on the ground floor.\n\nIn 1798 (Pub. Diary 132 of 1798, 946-947) the offices were turned out of Mr. Hunter's House apparently to make room for the Sadar Adalat, as in 1814 Warden describes the house as appropriated partly as a\n\n---\n\n1 The Bombay Gazette of the 18th March 1829 says: In the course of the last and present week the Secretariat has been removed into the Government House in the Fort and certain public offices (accommodated in private buildings rented for that purpose) are now (1829) to be accommodated in the Old Secretariat (to the north of the Cathedral) after the 1st proximo. The Gazette continues: We have heard that the following public offices will be thus provided for: The Military and Medical Boards; the Medical Storekeeper's office and public dispensary; the offices of the Adjutant-General and Quartermaster-General of the Army; and of the Brigade Major of the King's Troops and the Commissariat. The vacating of the present offices by these above establishments must materially affect the present high rent of houses within the Fort. We have also heard that it is in contemplation to occupy that part of the edifice now rented for the Supreme Court and not required for the Court or the accommodation of the Honourable Judges as offices for the officers connected with the Court which is now occupied by individuals having no claims to public quarters. We have heard that the master in equity, prothonotary, registrar on the Ecclesiastical side of the Court, and the sheriff will be thus accommodated and as they at present rent offices at the public cost the savings by this and other means in the public charges for office rent alone will exceed Rs. 30,000 per annum calculating on probable conjecture what is now paid.\n\nThe sacrifice of the Town Government House which made the accommodation of so many offices possible was a change of some importance. The first paragraph of the Military Regulations of 1748 (Bombay Town Materials, III. 109) runs: \"That the Governor make his constant residence at the Fort that he may have the military more immediately under his eye and that he may be the better able to judge of the conduct and capacity of the officers and soldiers. It is not by this intended to restrain the Governor from being absent on the customary visits or tours in the country for health or diversion.\" Since the death of Mr. Jonathan Duncan on 11th August 1811 the Governors have spent most of their time at Parel and at Malabar Point.\n\n2 The details were: 21334 square yards paying the Company Rs. 32 a year at the rate of 6 res the square yard.\n\n3 The details were: 27666 square yards paying the Company Rs. 41\u00bd a year at 6 res the square yard.\nCouncil Chamber and partly for the Sadar Adalat. The two purchases in 1764 are said to have saved the Company Rs. 1766 a year.\n\nThe two houses purchased in 1764 did not include quarters for the Secretary who resided in a house close by, which in 1780 Government purchased from Mr. Ravenscroft for Rs. 20,000 for the Secretary's residence. The boundaries of this house are thus detailed in a deed of 17th November 1772: On the north a wall belonging to the premises; on the south Church Street; on the east the wall of the office of the Honourable Company's Secretary; and on the west Mr. Hunter's warehouse.\n\nIn September 1758 when the demolition of the Fort House forced them to leave the rooms in the Castle which they had apparently occupied since the introduction of the Company's rule in 1668, the Secretary's and other offices were at first accommodated in warehouse sheds adjoining the Marine Yard. In April and May 1760 as there was no immediate hope of securing permanent quarters the Collector and the Fortification Paymaster were allowed to hire houses for their offices. (Pub. Diaries 14th April and 20th May Vol. 34 of 1760, 285, 393.)\n\nFor some reason this permission was either not obtained or not acted on in the case of the Secretary's and Accountant's offices. In a joint letter (Pub. Diary 42 of 1764, 327-328) to Government, on the 22nd May 1764 Mr. Andrew Ramsay the Secretary and Mr. Dalton the Accountant write: The many inconveniences we experience in carrying on the business of our respective offices from the improper construction of the places we now occupy (which were never intended for anything but warehouses) and the necessity for the preservation of the several books and papers under our charge, lead us to trouble your Honour by requesting you would take the same into your serious consideration, and either build or purchase such houses as may be fit for the purpose. The approach of the rainy season makes this more immediately necessary, for the present offices not being ceiled, and only covered with a mat, they leak very much, and the dust and dirt which in the course of the fair season have been collected between the rafters and the top of the mat, being forced down by the rain, not only spoil the books desks and papers, but render it both unwholesome and disagreeable to write in them. The variety of different sorts of goods lodged in the adjoining\n\n---\n\n1 Warden's Landed Tenures of Bombay 20th August 1814 paras 121-123, Bom. Gov. Sel. LXIV. 47-48 and MS. Sel. 54, 80-81.\n2 Collector's Deed File Record No. 38 page 199 Of the fortunes of this Secretary's house Mr. Warden has preserved the following particulars: The first person who appears to have rented this ground of the Company was Samuel Hough; on the payment of the quit and ground rent of six res the square yard. In 1761-62 Hough sold this property to Captain G. England. England in 1766-67 sold it to Manekji Limji. From Manekji it passed in 1772 to Mr. John Hunter, and from Mr. Hunter in 1773-74 to Mr. Secretary Skipp; Mr. Ravenscroft bought it from Mr. Skipp in 1779-80 and sold it as above to the Company. Landed Tenures 20th August 1814 paras 125-126, Bom. Gov. Sel. LXIV. 48-49.\n3 In 1755 Captain DeFunck wrote (Bombay Town Materials, II. 308): Round the polygon interior of the Castle are some buildings for lodging a small part of the civil and military besides the houses for the Governor's Council Room and public offices of the accountant, secretary, stores, and treasury.\nwarehouses likewise attracts numbers of rats, musquitos and other vermin, and the constant noise of the ham\u00e1ls and coolies in transporting such goods is extremely inconvenient. This has been often mentioned by us to the Honourable the President, and in consequence thereof your Honours were pleased to represent the same to the Honourable Court of Directors in your address per ship York, which was the reason of our not troubling you sooner on the subject, in hopes that their answer would have led you to determine either on building or purchasing. But as your attention has been otherwise engaged, we now beg leave to repeat the necessity of the offices being removed, for notwithstanding our utmost care many of the books are greatly damaged, and we have been obliged to re-bind most of them, owing to the covers rotting by the damp and dust. Should you determine to build, we likewise beg leave to add that it will be very proper to remove into some other house until the building is completed. In consequence of this letter before the end of May in the absence of the Admiral the Secretary's and Accountant's offices were temporarily moved into Mr. Whitehill's House. Towards the close of October 1764 Mr. Whitehill's House as already noticed was purchased for the Secretary's office at a cost of Rs. 45,000 and the neighbouring house belonging to Mr. Hunter was at the same time bought for the other offices at a cost of Rs. 60,000. In notifying these purchases to the Court of Directors the Bombay Government (14th December 1764, Bombay Town Materials, II. 469-470) write: Both houses are together sufficient for all the different branches of your Honour's business except the Marine. Though, as already noticed, the Accountant's and other offices seem to have been turned out of Mr. Hunter's House in 1798 to make room for the Sadar Ad\u00e1lat and Council Hall, the Secretary's office continued in these buildings till in 1829 it was moved to the present (1894) Old Secretariat buildings and from there, about 1871, to the present Secretariat.\n\n**Town Hall.**\n\nDuring the first years of British Rule there naturally was no Town Hall. The Justices held their sittings in the Bombay and M\u00e1l\u00edm Customs Houses, and when (1675) the Judicial Courts were removed to a hired house, this hired house served also as a Town Hall. In 1677 the chief chamber of Mr. Aungier's Court of Judicature was named the Town Hall. Details of this building are given under M\u00e1pla Por. In 1720 when R\u00e1ma K\u00e1m\u00e1ti's house in Bazar Gate street became the Honourable Company's property the chief chamber was fitted up as a Court House and Town Hall, and was used by the Justices and by the Court of Admiralty.\u00b9\n\nDuring the next fifty years the want of room and the bad repair of R\u00e1ma's buildings were a favourite topic of complaint by the Grand\n\n\u00b9The Admiralty Court whose chief function was the trying of pirates was held at the President's house as well as at the Town Hall (Pub. Diary 41 of 1763, 522). The Diary of the 7th January 1764 records: This morning Andrew Pope and William Bruce, two of the pirates condemned at a Court of Admiralty held the 10th day of November (1763) were executed agreeable to the sentence of the Court, and afterwards hung in chains upon Oyster Rock. Pub, Diary 42 of 1764, 19.\nJury and the Justices of the Peace. At a Consultation of the 23rd April 1771 the Board read the following letter from Mr. Gregory Page clerk of the peace, to the President and Council, dated the 20th April 1771: The Grand Jury at the last sessions represented to His Majesty's Justices that the ruinous condition of the present Town Hall, added to the great inconvenience attending the holding the sessions there, from the want of proper apartments for the juries, with rooms for the prisoners and evidences, rendered the constructing a new hall or the complete repairing of the present so essentially necessary that they recommended to the Mayor's Court to carry the same into execution. Government resolved that the consideration of this letter be deferred. Three months later at a Consultation of the 24th July 1771, the Board read the following letter from the Clerk of the Peace to the President, dated Bombay Town Hall 23rd July 1771: The Grand Jury have again presented the Town Hall as being unsuitable improper and dangerous. The Mayor's Court particularly concur in the propriety of this part of their presentment and have enjoined me strongly to recommend to your Honour the providing a Town Hall more secure suitable and commodious than the present one. The Board resolved that the consideration of the above letter be deferred.\n\nTen years later, on the 23rd August 1780 Government at last resolved that a survey be made of the Town Hall and a report delivered in of its present state and condition. In spite of this Resolution matters continued as before except that at times the sessions were held in hired houses. One of these houses was the Theatre the site of which, as shown by the 1814 survey map, lay to the north of the Elphinstone Circle, a plot of ground now merged partly in the Circle and partly in the road. On the 17th July 1786 the managers of the Theatre forwarded to the Justices a bill for rent due which was in time submitted to Government. At a Consultation of the 27th July 1786 Government observe: Read a letter from the managers of the Theatre addressed to His Majesty's Justices enclosing a bill amounting to Rs. 500 for the rent of that building during the time it has been occasionally appropriated for the meeting of the quarterly sessions. As we have had it in contemplation to dispose of the Old Town Hall and erect a new building from the produce of its sale, and, as the exorbitance of the present demand renders it necessary to come to an immediate determination, it is resolved that the old building be sold at public outcry on Monday the 21st of the ensuing month of August for ready money and on the terms which will be noticed. As the warehouses under the old Town Hall are appropriated by the farmer's lease for the lodgment of his tobacco, our determination must be communicated to the Collector who is to settle with the tobacco farmer for a compensation in lieu thereof during the remainder of the lease. The General will direct the clerk of the works to draw out a plan of the intended building on the most frugal scale to be erected on the ruins of the old Marine House (in the north of the present [1894] Dock Yard) which appears to us to be the most convenient and proper place for this purpose. On the 21st\n\n---\n\n1 Bombay Town Materials, II. 476.\n2 Bombay Town Materials, II. 486.\nAugust 1786 the Town Hall was accordingly sold. Accommodation for the Mayor's Court and the Town Hall was provided in Hornby House, the present (1894) Great Western Hotel then also known as Admiralty House. Within two years (1788) the Courts had to vacate Hornby House in favour of the officers of His Majesty's 71st Regiment. At a Consultation of the 25th March 1788 Government directed that the portion of the Marine House occupied by the Secretary to the Marine Board be fitted up as a Court House and Town Hall, the expense of which was estimated by the engineer at about Rs. 133.\\(^1\\) Ten years later, on the 18th April 1798 (Pub. Diary 132 of 1798, 947-948) the civil auditor writes to Government: As to the Town Hall and site of the old Marine House with the warehouse for the Patent Cotton Press erected thereon, the convenience of the ground they occupy in the landing and shipment of goods is a greater consideration than any sum that would probably be offered for the ruinous buildings standing thereon or the Patent Cotton Press which has been found of no use. Besides the Town Hall the Company are at the expense of Rs. 200 a month for a sessions house. By having a good Town Hall this latter expense might be saved; and though I am extremely averse from any increase of the Company's buildings, I think that with a proper arrangement the accommodation pointed out by the Committee might be made, and on the remainder of the site might be erected a building the lower part of which would contain warehouses in the most convenient situation possible for nearly the whole of the Company's goods, and over them a town hall, and any other offices that might be required. This suggestion was not carried out. Five months later on the arrival in September 1798 of Sir William Syer the first Recorder, Colonel Jones' house, that is the present Port Trust Bonded Warehouses in Marine Street, was taken for his residence. Next year (October 1799), when Sir William quitted this house, it was retained as a Town Hall (Bombay Town Materials, II. 494-495). This arrangement did not last long. Within less than a year the Recorder's Court and with it very probably the Town Hall were provided with accommodation in Hornby's House.\n\nFor ten years the main room in Hornby House seems to have been used as a Town Hall.\\(^2\\) A general desire to have a separate Town Hall took shape in the following letter to Government, dated the 10th October 1811, from the Recorder the Honourable Sir James Mackintosh: At the desire of some of the principal British inhabitants of this settlement I have the honour to lay the following circumstances before you respecting a plan of public ornament and utility. The want of a Town Hall for public meetings and entertainments has long been complained of as a singular deficiency in so prosperous and considerable a settlement. There are several circumstances at the present moment which\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Bombay Town Materials, II, 486-490.\n\n\\(^2\\) The following notice in the Bombay Courier of the 14th January 1826 shows that before the erection of the new Town Hall the sessions were held in Hornby House: By virtue of a precept to me directed I hereby proclaim and give notice that a sessions of Over-and Terminer and general gaol delivery will be holden before the Supreme Court of Judicature at Bombay at the Court House in the Town Hall.\nwould probably encourage us to commence such a building if we could hope for the patronage and aid of Government. The estimated expense is one lakh. There are various sources from which we hope to complete a sufficient part of that at least to justify a commencement, namely (1) The Committee for managing the erection of a statue of the Marquis Cornwallis are of opinion that they may apply out of the surplus in their hands to the erection of a building where that statue may be placed about Rs. 20,000. (2) The Literary Society of Bombay on consideration of apartments for a public library as well as from a desire to contribute their mite to the public accommodation will give Rs. 10,000. (3) We humbly hope that considering the aid which Bombay has afforded to the improvement of Calcutta by the annual purchase of 400 lottery tickets for several years your Honourable Board will deem it proper to propose to the Supreme Government to add to the Calcutta lotteries such a number of tickets as will allow one thousand to Bombay for the Town Hall being the number which on such an occasion is likely to be annually taken here. This is calculated annually at Rs. 20,000. (4) We also venture to hope that the liberality of Government will aid such an undertaking with a small sum, say Rs. 10,000. With such a sum the Town Hall might be immediately begun which under the scientific direction of Major Cowper would combine architectural beauty with public accommodation and reflect honour on this Presidency, but more especially on the Government under whose liberal patronage it was commenced. I humbly solicit the favour of an answer respecting both the last items, and in my present circumstances I hope that I do not deviate from the respect which I owe and feel when I request that the answer may be early as well to my present communication as to that of yesterday.\n\nOn perusing this letter at their Consultation of 15th October 1811, Government resolved to address the Governor-General in Council at Fort William in the following terms: We have the honour to forward to your Excellency copy of a letter from the Honourable Sir James Mackintosh, the Recorder of Bombay, submitting to consideration a plan for the construction of a Town Hall at this Presidency. Your Excellency in Council will observe that the attainment of that object entirely depends upon your Excellency\u2019s acquiescence in the suggestion offered by Sir James Mackintosh, of admitting this Presidency to a participation in the funds realised at Bengal for a similar purpose through the means of lotteries by increasing the Calcutta lottery to the extent of 1000 tickets on account of this Presidency. As the proposed plan will not in any degree that we are aware of deprive the Presidency of Fort William of the full amount of the sum at present derived from the success of the Calcutta lottery; and as its adoption would supersede the necessity of our endeavouring to establish one at this settlement and thus circumscribe the evils which in a greater or less degree are experienced from the toleration of that system of raising supplies of money for any particular purpose; we are induced upon these grounds strongly to recommend Sir James Mackintosh\u2019s proposal to the favourable consideration of your Excellency in Council. As our determination in subscribing the sum of Rs. 10,000 for the construction of the Town Hall on the part of the Honourable Company will depend upon the result of\nthis reference, we request that your Excellency in Council will be so obliging as to favour us with an early reply to the object of this application.\n\nAt the same time Government wrote the following reply to Sir James Mackintosh: We have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated the 16th of this month. Entirely approving of the suggestions which you have offered for the construction of a Town Hall at this Presidency we are cordially disposed to extend our support to the measure. Under these impressions we have forwarded a copy of your address to the Bengal Government, accompanied by a recommendation of the proposed plan of increasing the Calcutta lottery to the extent of 1000 tickets on account of this Presidency. Should his Excellency in Council consent to grant the aid solicited by the adoption of the proposed plan we shall also have much pleasure in promoting the construction of the building in question by meeting your wishes in subscribing the sum of Rs. 10,000 for that purpose.\n\nIn reply to the Government of Bombay on the 10th December 1811 the Supreme Government write: From the inquiries which have been made on the subject the Governor General in Council has every reason to believe that the ordinary number of tickets in the Calcutta lotteries could not be increased with any reasonable prospect of disposing of them. His Lordship in Council in consequence regrets that no means exist of meeting the wishes expressed by the Government of Bombay with respect to that point.\n\nOn learning of the Supreme Government's refusal on 11th April 1812 Messrs. Forbes & Co. and Messrs. Bruce Fawcett & Co. wrote to Government: We have to acknowledge the communication of the refusal of the Supreme Government to accede to our offer of taking 1400 tickets in the Calcutta lottery provided 1000 in addition to the ordinary number were appropriated for the benefit of this Presidency, having by that offer entirely removed the sole objection made by the Supreme Government to render the Calcutta lottery contributory to the improvement of Bombay. We must henceforth look to the resources of this Presidency alone for the funds necessary to the erection of a Hall. We therefore have the honour of submitting the plan of lottery which we propose shall be drawn on the 1st of August next under the sanction or patronage of Government. The ruling motive to take a ticket in the Calcutta lottery undoubtedly is to obtain a chance of having the highest prize a lakh of rupees. We have therefore so arranged this plan that the Bombay lottery shall not yield an inferior temptation while it will possess the superior advantage, that he who adventures in it for the object we have mentioned will have 3000 fewer chances against his success than he would have in the Calcutta lottery, the one containing 2400 and the other 5400 tickets. Hoping that this scheme will appear to Government to be deserving of adoption and support we tender our voluntary services to carry it into effect. Our scheme is as follows:\n\n1 MS.

The details are:\n\n**First Bombay Lottery, 1812.**\n\n| Prizes | Rate | Amount |\n|--------|------|--------|\n| No.    | Rs.  | Rs.    |\n| 1      | 1,00,000 | 1,00,000 |\n| 1      | 90,000   | 90,000  |\n| 1      | 20,000   | 20,000  |\n| 1      | 10,000   | 10,000  |\n| 560    | 1,000    | 56,000  |\n| Total  |        | 2,20,000 |\n\nIn addition to these 550 prize-tickets worth Rs. 2,20,000 there will be 1850 blank tickets worth Rs. 20,000 applicable to the improvement of Bombay and the expenses of the lottery. In all there will be 2400 tickets of Rs. 100 each representing a total sum of Rs. 2,40,000. The hundredth ticket drawn on the last day will be entitled to the prize of Rs. 30,000. On perusing this letter at their Consultation of the 15th April 1812 Government ordered that the subject lie for consideration.\n\nTwo weeks later, on the 27-29th April 1812, the following minute was recorded: Resumed consideration of the letter from Messrs. Forbes & Co. and Bruce Fawcett & Co. The Governor in Council having received every assurance from those firms, corroborated by the general opinion of the community that the resources of this Presidency are sufficient to support at least two lotteries in the year which will realise about Rs. 40,000 a year to be appropriated for public purposes, is disposed under such circumstances to extend the patronage of Government experimentally to two lotteries being annually opened for the improvement of the Town and Island of Bombay. The Governor in Council is at the same time not unaware of the objections that are justly entertained on general principles to the encouragement of lotteries. It was in consideration to those objections and with the view of circumscribing the evils that have been experienced from their introduction into other countries that this Government preferred an application to the Supreme Government to admit this Presidency to a participation in the profits that might be realised from a limited increase in the number of tickets allotted to the Calcutta lottery. As that suggestion has not been approved; as the object in view in realising funds cannot be accomplished from any other source; and further as the utilising of lotteries appears to be virtually sanctioned by the spirit of the Honourable Court's instructions conveyed in the 181st paragraph of their letter of the 2nd May 1806, the Government are under these impressions, induced to acquiesce in the measure. To this they the more readily agree, seeing\n\n---\n\n1 MS. Selections 110 of 1811-1817. Pub. Diary 333 of 1312, 1204-1207.\nthat, as is adverted to by the Honourable Court, the objections to lotteries in England do not apply in their full extent to lotteries in this country not only from the nature and the state of society on this island and its subordinates but also because the lotteries are entirely and immediately subject to the control of the Government and are conducted under the agency of gentlemen of the first respectability of character. (1) Resolved therefore that William Taylor Money, Richard Torin, O. Woodhouse, James Gathorne Remington, John Kaye, and William . . . Esquires, be appointed commissioners and requested to undertake the arrangement and general superintendence of the lottery, framing and submitting for the decision of Government such regulations connected therewith as may appear to their judgments calculated to ensure its being conducted with due satisfaction to the public. (2) Resolved that the following scheme containing a slight modification of the scheme submitted by Messrs. Forbes and Company and Messrs. Bruce Fawcett and Company be adopted and sent to the commissioners as the basis of the lottery preparatory to its being published in the Government newspaper. (3) Resolved at the nomination of the Honourable the Governor that H. B. T. Crozier Esq. be appointed to the office of Superintendent of lotteries, being allowed to draw from the profits of each a personal recompense and Rs. 4000 to defray the charges of management and contingencies with the exception of stationery which the Chief Secretary under the consideration of its being an undertaking for the public benefit may be allowed to supply from the public stores.

On the 8th July the Board reply that Government do not consider themselves at liberty to comply with the Commissioners' solicitation.\u00b9\n\nThe first lottery proved so successful that the Commissioners submitted a scheme for an improved second lottery. On the 11th August 1812 they write: The success which has attended our late endeavours to accomplish the drawing of the first Bombay lottery, induces us thus early after its completion to lay before your Honourable Board the accompanying copy of an amended scheme for the second Bombay Town Hall lottery which if it meet with your concurrence we propose publishing in the Courier of Saturday next. Our scheme is as follows:\n\nBombay lottery for the erection of a Town Hall within the Fort established by the Honourable the Governor in Council and to be conducted by a Superintendent under the immediate direction of Commissioners appointed by Government.

The Right Honourable the Governor in Council is also desirous of receiving information of the particular objects which the lottery is intended to promote and what may be the sum estimated as necessary to realise. Also to furnish plans showing the purposes for which the building may be intended.\u00b2\n\nIn reply on the 14th September 1812 the Commissioners write: We have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Mr. Secretary Newnham's\n\n\u00b9 MS. Selections 110 of 1811-1817. \u00b2 MS. Selections 110 of 1811-1817.\nletter of the 9th instant, requesting us to state whether we would guarantee the sale of the tickets in the second plan in the event of Government sanctioning the drawing of another lottery and calling upon us to mention the objects which the lottery is intended to promote; the sum necessary to realise these objects; and any plans that may have been determined on. Permit us in reply to observe that having no interest whatever in the success of the lotteries separate from that of the community at large and having gratuitously undertaken a public duty at the request of Government as will more clearly appear by reference to Mr. Acting Secretary Farish's letter of the 27th April last we should not feel ourselves warranted in incurring any degree of risk by guaranteeing the sale of tickets. At the same time it is satisfactory to be enabled to remark from the success of the last lottery which has yielded above Rs. 1,11,000, were so improbable a circumstance to occur as one-half of the tickets in the next to remain unsold and all to be drawn blanks no loss could ultimately accrue by undertaking another lottery. The immediate object which the lotteries intended to provide for is the construction of a Town Hall the want of which, to use the words of Sir James Mackintosh in his letter to Government under date the 10th October 1811, has long been complained of as a singular deficiency in so prosperous and considerable a settlement. The purposes to which the Hall is intended to be appropriated are chiefly the following:\n\n1. For all meetings of the British inhabitants whether for public business or for national entertainments under such regulations as the Government may please to lay down.\n\n2. For the meetings of His Majesty's Justices in quarter sessions assembled and otherwise.\n\n3. For the accommodation of the Literary Society and the reception of their valuable and increasing library.\n\n4. For the reception of the statues of Marquis Cornwallis and Mr. Pitt and of any future monuments of British art which public gratitude may bring to Bombay.\n\nThe estimated expense was stated by Sir James Mackintosh through some mistake that cannot be accounted for to be one lakh of rupees whereas it was supposed that it would amount to upwards of two l\u00e2khs and that under all circumstances three l\u00e2khs would cover the expense of a building which as is observed in his letter above quoted would 'combine architectural beauty with public accommodation and reflect honour on the Government under whose liberal patronage it should be commenced.' The only plan which has ever been submitted was one drawn by Major Cowper of the Engineer corps the gentleman under whose scientific direction it was the wish of the settlement that the Hall should be constructed. Major Cowper's subsequent appointment to the charge of the commissariat has deprived the public of the benefit of his services in the erection of the Hall, and in consequence whenever it shall be determined that funds sufficient for the commencement of the work have been collected those to whose management the important business will be confided must consider of the best means to be recommended to Government for supplying his loss. The funds at\npresent at command to commence the construction of the Hall are as follows:\n\n| Description                                                                 | Rs.   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|\n| Realised by the first lottery about                                         | 1,11,000 |\n| The amount subscribed by Government                                         | 10,000 |\n| Ditto by the Literary Society who are to have apartments in the Hall        | 10,000 |\n| Considered by the Committee for the erection of Marquis Cornwallis's statue to be applicable to the construction of the Hall in which it is proposed to place the statue | 20,000 |\n\nTotal ... 1,51,000\n\nFrom this statement the best hopes may be entertained that the Town Hall, if the erection be early commenced, will be completed in the course of three years, and we beg to observe that should any funds remain they may be rendered applicable to many other public improvements much needed in this settlement.\n\nOn the above report from the Commissioners on the 15th September 1812 Government observe that upon the estimate submitted by the Commissioners for the construction of a Town Hall amounting to three lakhs of rupees it will be necessary to sanction at least seven lotteries before the sum required to complete that estimate can be realised, and as Government are desirous to discontinue the practice of raising funds for any purpose through so objectionable a medium, it is ordered that the Commissioners be requested to lay before Government a plan for the proposed Town Hall with intimation that if they can circumscribe its dimensions so as to admit of the building being constructed for the sum of two lakhs the Government would have the less reluctance to sanction a mode for raising money which as they must themselves admit is liable to many objections. On the 23rd September, Government repeat this order of the 15th September 1812.\n\nIn reply on the 7th October 1812 the Committee write: We have been favoured with your commands, under date the 23rd ultimo, to submit a circumscribed plan for the construction of a Town Hall the expense of which shall not amount to more than about two lakhs of rupees. It will require some time to obtain such a plan as shall be perfectly approved; but we hope to have one prepared which shall not exceed the limits prescribed. In the meanwhile we beg to recommend that measures may be pursued for raising the necessary funds.\n\nOn perusing this letter on the 21st October 1812, Government resolved that the scheme of the second lottery recorded under date the 19th of August last be approved and sanctioned under the assurance afforded by the Committee that the objects of the lottery can be effected for the sum of two lakhs of rupees.\n\nIn continuation of their above letter of the 7th October 1812 the Committee write on the 21st October 1812: In reference to the letter of the 7th instant which we had the honour of submitting to your\n\n---\n\n1 MS.

We take the liberty of recommending that the building should be on the Bombay Green nearly in the site of the present guard-house and of the temporary buildings contiguous to it. The reasons which have induced us to recommend this spot are that a structure intended for ornament as well as utility should not be placed in a confined situation but stand insulated and exposed on all sides to public view. We are further induced to make this recommendation seeing that it is in the contemplation of Government to erect a new main guard and that perhaps the situation of the present fire engine house which is too limited for a Town Hall may be deemed amply sufficient and equally convenient for the new main guard. Should the suggestion be favourably received we request that the proper officers be instructed to measure the ground which may be allotted for the Town Hall and to communicate the measurement to us in order that its dimension may be inserted in the advertisement. The advertisement would run:\n\nTown Hall of Bombay\u2014The Committee appointed to superintend the erection of the Town Hall of Bombay will on or before the 15th day of January next receive plans and elevations for the construction of a Town Hall addressed to the Chief Secretary to Government. The following information is given for the guidance of those who may be disposed to furnish the Committee with plans. The Town Hall is intended first (1) For the meetings of the British inhabitants of Bombay whether for public business or for entertainment; the number assembled is calculated at 300 persons. (2) For the permanent accommodation of the Literary Society of Bombay and the reception of their library. (3) For the reception of the statues of Mr. Pitt and Marquis Cornwallis and of any future monuments of British art.

The funds intended for the erection of the building amount to two lakhs of rupees and the estimates which it is desirable should accompany the plans and elevations ought not to exceed that sum. Bombay 21st October 1812.\n\nOn perusing the above on the 28th October 1812 Government ordered that copies of the preceding papers be referred to the Chief Engineer with directions to report whether the erecting the proposed Town Hall on the spot pointed out by the Committee will render it necessary to remove any public buildings or be in any other respect attended with detriment to the Company's interest.\n\nIn reply on the 22nd December 1812, the Chief Engineer Lieut.-Colonel Atkins writes to the Chief Secretary to Government: I have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter enclosing one from the Committee appointed by the British inhabitants of Bombay to superintend the erection of a Town Hall and desiring that I report whether the erecting the proposed hall on the spot pointed out by the Committee will render it necessary to remove any public buildings or be in any respect attended with detriment to the Honourable Company's interest. I request you will be pleased to inform the Right Honourable the Governor in Council that I have inspected the premises noticed in\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Diary 341 of 1812, 4750-4753. MS. Selections 110 of 1811-1817.\nthe Committee's letter; a sketch of the space it will occupy is laid down in the accompanying plan of Bombay Green and distinguished by a pale-yellow colour 250 feet front by 130 feet deep. With all deference I beg to notice that if the intended building is brought to the dotted line ab, there will be more space left between it and the Castle for buildings that may hereafter be required for arsenal purposes. The public buildings that it will be necessary to remove are the main guard and part of the old arsenal, both of which are constructed of temporary materials. I am not aware that the erecting a Town Hall on the place proposed can be of any detriment to the Honourable Company's interest.\n\nOn reading the above report, on the 23rd December 1812, Government ordered that a copy of the Chief Engineer's letter be forwarded to the Committee of the British inhabitants of Bombay with notice that Government have no objection to the Town Hall being erected on the spot pointed out by Colonel Atkins.\n\nAfter having disposed of a number of tickets, the Committee write on the 5th April 1813: The number of tickets disposed of to the 31st ultimo is 1275. We rely on the local attachment and public spirit of numerous individuals for the disposal of 300 more, and if Government will be pleased to contribute its aid by taking a similar number, we are of opinion that the drawing may be commenced in full confidence from past experience that the residue will be sold between the days of drawing. On the 7th April Government ordered that the Commissioners be informed that Government does not feel itself authorised to afford any aid to the lottery of the nature they have solicited.\n\nOn the 10th April 1813 the Commissioners write: It only remains for us to state the impracticability of proceeding further with the lottery unaided by Government and the consequent necessity of announcing its abandonment to the public and of returning the purchase-money of tickets to the several subscribers who laudably came forward to promote this second undertaking. Under your sanction we shall direct an advertisement to the effect of the enclosed draft to be inserted in the public prints to which it will be necessary that the sub-treasurer should be instructed to conform. The following is the proposed draft: The Commissioners appointed by Government for the management of the Bombay Lottery are concerned to be under the necessity of announcing its abandonment and of the sub-treasurer having in consequence been instructed to return the purchase-money of tickets to the several subscribers who have laudably come forward to promote the success of this second undertaking. On the 21st April 1813 the Board ordered that the Commissioners be informed that the Board have no objection to the publication of the advertisement notifying the relinquishment of the Bombay Lottery.\n\nOn the 4th November 1813 Mr. Erskine, the Secretary to the Committee, writes to the President and Governor: I am requested\n\n---\n\n1 MS.

Selections 110 of 1811-1817.\nby the Committee appointed for superintending the erection of the Town Hall and of apartments for the accommodation of the Literary Society, to lay before your Honourable Board the plan which has been selected by the Committee from among those presented to it. It is the production of Lieutenant Hawkins of the Engineers. And should it meet with your approbation the Committee respectfully suggest that orders may be given by your Honourable Board through the proper channel for clearing the ground so liberally granted by Government as a site for the intended building. The Committee have further to request that the Right Honourable the Governor in Council would be pleased to grant permission to Lieutenant Hawkins to superintend the work in the course of its progress. On the 17th November 1813 Government ordered that Mr. Erskine be informed that Lieutenant Hawkins has recently stated to Government that his whole attention is required in the execution of his public duties, and that his superintendence of the proposed building cannot consequently be permitted without his neglecting the more important duties of his station.\n\nFour months later, 25th March 1814, Government observe: As it appears from the communications which our President has had with Lieutenant Hawkins that the assessment of the houses on the island is nearly completed, and that no considerable portion of his time will be occupied in superintending the erection of the Town Hall before the assessment will be finished, it is resolved that that officer be permitted to superintend the construction of the Town Hall in compliance with the Committee's application. Resolved that in communicating this permission to Lieutenant Hawkins through the Chief Engineer that officer be informed that if it should be found that his superintendence of the work should interfere with the due execution of his public duties, the Right Honourable the Governor in Council will feel himself under the necessity of making some other arrangement for the performance of such duties.\n\nIn informing the Court of Directors on the 2nd August 1814 Government write: Your Honourable Court will observe by a reference to our Consultations the encouragement given to the British inhabitants to engage in the erection of a Town Hall by the institution of a lottery in 1812 which realised the sum of Rs. 1,11,870. Though we felt considerable reluctance in sanctioning a second lottery, we at last acquiesced under an assurance that the expense should not exceed two lakhs of rupees. So much difficulty was, however, experienced in the sale of the tickets that the second lottery was abandoned. Under whatever circumstances the Hall may now be erected, we have reason to believe that no disposition exists in the minds of the Commissioners to exceed the amount of the sum of two lakhs in construction of the building.\n\nRegarding the Government grant on the 8th April 1816 the Court write: Although you state your intention of waiting for our sanction\n\n---\n\n1 MS. Selections 110 of 1811 - 1817.\n2 MS. Selections 110 of 1811 - 1817.\n3 Pub. Dep. Letters to the Court Vol. 40 of 1814, 146 - 147.\nto the proposed donation of Rs. 10,000 towards the erection of a Town Hall, it would appear from the answer which you directed to be made to the Commissioners of the lottery on the 1st July 1812, that you had already engaged yourselves to grant that sum. We desire that you will in future avoid committing yourselves to any expense of this nature and that you will confine yourselves to an undertaking to recommend the subject to our notice. We cannot approve of your making any advances whatever from the Company's cash in furtherance of the proposed building of a Town Hall either as to the erection or furnishing of it, nor towards maintaining its establishment when completed. As to the grant of land on Bombay Green for the erection of the Town Hall, which you have recommended, we have to remark that notwithstanding the Chief Engineer's report that no detriment to the Company's interests is likely to arise from the appropriation of a portion of the Green to this purpose, yet we cannot consent to depart from the directions conveyed in paragraph 144 of our letter to you in this Department of the 2nd May 1806, that Bombay Green should 'remain applicable only to the purpose for which it is now used,' more especially as it is remarked in the said paragraph that 'Bombay Green is the only space where the troops of your garrison could be drawn up so as to move upon an emergency with either regularity or effect to points where their services might be required.' Lieut.-Colonel Atkins your Chief Engineer, in his letter to Mr. Secretary Newnham of the 22nd December 1812, adverts to a plan accompanying the said letter in order we suppose to shew that no detriment will arise to the Company's property on the Green by the adoption of the proposed measure. But this plan did not accompany your Consultations, so that we cannot derive any knowledge therefrom as to the site of the proposed building and how far it might be calculated to interfere with the objects stated in the paragraph of our letter before mentioned. Our directions as conveyed in the said paragraph must therefore be strictly observed.\n\nAfter communicating to the Committee of British inhabitants the Court's refusal to contribute, Government write to the Court on the 18th of December 1816: The Committee appointed by the British inhabitants to superintend the construction of the Town Hall have been informed that your Honourable Court declines confirming the grant of Rs. 10,000 conditionally made by this Government towards the erection of the Town Hall in the year 1812. We regret that the packet by the Wilmington had not reached you when the paragraphs under reply were framed as your Honourable Court would have observed that the intended site for the Mint, Town Hall, and new Main Guard are already nearly occupied by old buildings, many of them in a state of complete decay. These must necessarily be removed under your Honourable Court's orders for building a new Main Guard. Further they form no part of the Green which could at any time be appropriated for the movement of troops with the exception of the small spot intended for the new Main Guard. The spot on which this building is proposed to be erected.\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Dep. Court's Letters Vol. 21 of 1816, 72-75.\nis at present unoccupied by buildings but is of inconsiderable extent and partly detached from the Green. By erecting these three buildings on the uniform plan proposed the appearance of the town would be greatly improved and the limits of the Green be better defined. On these grounds we took the liberty of recommending to your Honourable Court the grant of ground for the erection of a Town Hall, it being intended that two spacious streets of 85 feet wide should be left on the north and south sides for the purpose of communicating with the Castle and the Garrison Hospital.\n\nReferring to the Court's letter of the 8th April 1816, declining to confirm the grant of money and land the Committee of British inhabitants write to Government on the 22nd February 1817: We have had the honour of receiving Mr. Chief Secretary Warden's letter dated 9th September last, enclosing paragraphs 36 to 38 of the Honourable Court's despatch of the 8th of April preceding, on the subject of our application for a spot of ground for the erection of a Town Hall within the walls of the fort. We have to regret that the sketch of Bombay Green which accompanied our application should not have been received by the Honourable Court as we indulge a hope that it would have led to a decision favourable to that application; because it would have proved to the Honourable Court that Bombay Green or the Place of Arms instead of being encroached upon will be enlarged by the grant of the ground in question. We have the honour of enclosing a duplicate of the sketch of the site of the proposed Main Guard, the Town Hall, Library and Museum, and the Mint and Assay Office, the construction of which by removing the old main guard and an old arsenal shed in a state of dilapidation will throw at least 200 feet into the Place of Arms, whilst the new main guard will stand in the rear of what was formerly termed the Tank or the Third Member of Council's House. Independently of this advantage in augmenting a space to which the Honourable Court justly attach so much importance, the proposed range of buildings will, with the exception of the New Cotton Screws and an old warehouse belonging to the Company, render the eastern face of the Green uniform and constitute a creditable testimony to the taste and liberality of a British community. For the Honourable Court will recollect that two of the chief objects in view in the construction of this building are first to afford accommodation to the Literary Society its library and a museum for the reception of the specimens in mineralogy natural history and other curiosities of India which at no inconsiderable charge they are now forming; and second for the reception of the statues of the late Marquis Cornwallis, Mr. Pitt, and the Marquis of Wellesley which have cost nearly \u00a320,000 sterling raised by the contribution of individuals. These, as they have hitherto done, are likely to remain in an obscure warehouse unless we can rear a suitable edifice for the reception of such splendid and exemplary testimonies of public respect and gratitude to the services and to the virtues of the most eminent statesmen of our country. The subscribers to this address, the Honourable the Court may rest assured, would\n\n1 Pub. Dep. Letters to the Court Vol. 42 of 1816, 403-406.\nnever have preferred an application open to the objections which the Honourable Court has advanced. The Chief Engineer was consulted as to whether the proposed site was in any respect objectionable and our application having been moreover supported by the recommendation of the Government, we relied confidently on the Honourable Court's acquiescence. Under such impressions we sanctioned the purchase of articles in England to the extent of Rs. 80,000, the principal part of which have been received and the timber frames prepared for the construction of the building. We therefore trust that as the ground on which the Honourable Court's objections to a compliance with our application appear erroneous and no inconvenience but the contrary will result from a grant which would contribute so materially to the accommodation and to the liberal views of the British inhabitants of Bombay that the Honourable Court will be pleased to sanction the measure.\n\nOn this on the 12th March 1817 Government direct: A duplicate sketch having been already forwarded to the Honourable Court of Directors, it is resolved that a copy of the above letter be sent to them by the first opportunity.\n\nOn the 31st December 1817 the Court write: Under the explanation afforded in the paragraphs 101 to 104 of your letter dated 18th December 1816, we shall not object to your granting upon a building lease of 50 years at an annual rent of one peppercorn, if demanded, the piece of ground which has been selected for the site of the intended Town Hall. At the same time it is to be clearly understood that the Company are not to be liable for any expense whatever on account of the erection or future establishment of the proposed structure and that conformably to the principle of building leases granted in this country the building itself shall at the expiration of the lease become the property of the Company.\n\nOn receipt of this Government ordered that a copy of this paragraph 38 of the Court's letter be transferred to the Committee of European inhabitants connected with the building of the Town Hall with information that on their acceding to the terms proposed Government will be ready to transfer the ground to them on the execution of the requisite deeds.\n\nShortness of funds was the next difficulty in the way of the promoters of the Town Hall. On the 28th February 1820 the Commissioners write to Government: The funds under our management for the construction of the Town Hall, including apartments for the library and museum of the Literary Society, being insufficient for that purpose we are desirous of completing the deficiency by one or more lotteries which under your authority we propose to establish at this Presidency on a plan which we have the honour to enclose:\n\n---\n\n1 MS.

It is expedient that the building be carried back as far as possible without confining too much the communication in the rear.

Before proceeding to give directions for putting a stop to the building they proposed to make over to Government the building and materials as they stand (on which from first to last upwards of two laks have been expended) to be completed at the Government expense and applied to Government purposes as accommodation for public offices, reserving merely the assembly rooms rent-free for the use of the British inhabitants. We accordingly appointed a Committee to report whether the Town Hall would answer the purposes suggested as well as the present offices of those departments which might be accommodated in it, submitting an estimate of the difference of expense between the proposed plan and the existing arrangement. The report of the Committee showed an appropriation of the apartments to several offices, the rent of which after allowing for annual repairs would leave as a set-off against any advance for completing the building Rs. 15,780 a year. This the Committee observed at 5 per cent is the interest of Rs. 3,15,600. They stated that to finish the building, without the Grand Hall, supper rooms, and Literary Society's apartments, would require Rs. 1,60,000 which on the above data would be cleared off in 14\u00bd years; that including the Literary Society's apartments, the finishing would cost Rs. 1,80,000 and might be cleared off in 17\u00bd years; and that the estimate of Rs. 2,50,000 for completing the whole might be cleared off in 32\u00bd years. Objections made in some instances to the allotment of offices proposed by the Committee and other suggestions have been considered with the result that the following appear to be the best arrangements if your Honourable Court should see fit to sanction the completion of the building at the public expense:\n\n| Description                                      | Rs.   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-------|\n| The Persian Secretary's Office                   | 250   |\n| Post Office                                      | 175   |\n| Court of Petty Sessions                          | 100   |\n| Literary Society's Rooms                         | 150   |\n| (rent to be paid by the Society)                 |       |\n| Court of Requests                                | 150   |\n| Collector's Office                               | 100   |\n| Godowns                                          | 400   |\n| An Examination Room                              | 10    |\n| Repository for the Native School-book and School Society | 80   |\n| Monthly Total                                    | 1415  |\n| Yearly Total                                     | 16,980|\n| Deduct for yearly repairs                        | 1200  |\n| Balance as a set-off against any advance for completing the building | 15,780|\n\nChapter X.\nInstitutions.\nTown Hall.\n1824.\nThis amount is calculated as above-mentioned by the Committee. At the same time the estimates for completing the building have subsequently been stated at higher amounts than those abovementioned, namely:\n\nFor finishing the building without the Literary Society's apartments ... Rs. 1,74,714 1 80\nFor the above with the Literary Society's rooms ... ... ... 1,98,846 1 0\nFor completing the whole ... ... ... 2,85,227 0 20\n\nIt is also represented to us that if the building remains long in its present uncovered state the expense of completing it will probably be increased. We beg to transmit a report showing the extent to which the building has been raised and the work remaining to be done with plans and sections of the building on its intended scale and refer you to all our proceedings on the subject. Your Honourable Court will observe Mr. Goodwin's opinion that the public money should not be expended for this purpose unless the whole building be given up to Government and that in that event it should be appropriated to the Supreme Court of Judicature, the house (Hornby's House) now rented on that account at Rs. 1625 a month being given up on the expiry of the lease in 1827. Mr. Goodwin's suggestion is open to the objection that to obtain the whole building it would be requisite to pay the proprietors the value of the work already constructed, namely Rs. 2,00,000 in addition to the expenditure yet to be incurred. Mr. Warden also apprehends that after completing the building, some of the successors to the offices of those gentlemen who now see no objection to the apartments allotted to them might be dissatisfied with them, and while the expense of finishing the building might exceed the amounts estimated the receipts from offices accommodated therein might be less than the above calculation. The building in question is certainly much more extensive than was required for the purposes intended at this Presidency. It is stated by the Committee and with some justice to be a structure which for classical purity of design and as far as it has gone elegance of execution stands unrivalled in the Eastern Empire, and we should consider it a subject of regret that so fine a specimen of architecture should be lost, not only to public purposes but as a model to aid the taste of the wealthier of your native subjects in a branch of general science by no means unimportant. We have shown that prospective calculations exhibit a full remuneration for the expenditure which is estimated to be requisite to complete the building, and we have not withheld the apprehension entertained that the result might be found to be less favourable than those calculations exhibit. To leave the building in its present unfinished state would be in all respects undesirable; to remove the materials of such an edifice, besides the heavy expense of such a measure, would not be consistent with the liberal and enlarged views of your Government. With these observations and adverting to the condition on which the building was sanctioned, namely that it should become the property of the Government after fifty years, we respectfully submit for the decision of your Honourable Court the course to be pursued respecting the Town Hall.\n\n1 Pub.

And should it ever be completed by Government at any future period the Committee leave it to that authority to assign the portion that should be set aside for the accommodation of the European inhabitants in consideration of the sums expended by them in the structure. Considering the importance of the object and the smallness of the amount required we have acceded to the Committee's application and directed the Civil Engineer to take charge of the building and materials and respectfully request to be favoured at an early period with the commands of your Honourable Court regarding it.\u00b9\n\nOn the 1st July 1825 Government further write to the Court: In our despatch of the 1st November last we took the liberty to bring to your Honourable Court's notice our proceedings connected with the offer made to us by the Town Hall Committee of the building which they had commenced but which they could not finish owing to the want of funds. Again in our letter of the 14th December we submitted to your Honourable Court the expediency of our being favoured with your commands regarding it at an early period. The Supreme Court of Judicature are desirous that all the offices of the Court should be accommodated in one building. At the same time among other objections to the present Court House the Honourable Judges are of opinion that it is not sufficiently large to accommodate the whole establishment, and, as the lease of the building will shortly expire, the Civil Engineer has suggested to us the propriety of completing the Town Hall which he states from its retired situation and ample powers of accommodation will afford every advantage and convenience required. We beg therefore to submit our proceedings connected with the subject to the consideration of your Honourable Court and beg to press on you the expediency of favouring us with your decision on the subject at an early period to admit of the building being commenced before the rains of 1826 and finished before the expiration of the lease of Hornby's House, should your Honourable Court deem it advisable to sanction its construction. We beg to refer your Honourable Court to a letter from the Registrar to the Supreme Court containing the sentiments of their Lordships on the subject.\u00b2\n\nIn reply to these despatches the Court write to Bombay on the\n\n\u00b9 Pub. Dep. Letters to the Court Vol. 46 of 1824-25, 285-286.\n\u00b2 Pub. Dep. Letters to the Court Vol. 46 of 1824-25, 316-319.\n25th January 1826: We now reply to the several paragraphs relating to the proposal from the Town Hall Committee to make over the building to Government for public offices. The principal question in this instance seems to be one of economy. The Town Hall Committee being under the necessity of leaving the building unfinished for want of funds the question is whether Government would be a gainer or loser by going to the expense of completing it on condition of obtaining the property of it for public purposes. You seem at present to destine the building in the event of its being made over to you for the accommodation of the Supreme Court, the House at present rented for the Court being not sufficiently large for the whole establishment and the lease being nearly expired. You calculate that the expense of enlarging the present Court House added to the present rent will be equivalent to an annual rent of Rs. 30,000, while the interest of the sum necessary to complete the Town Hall with the probable expense of the annual repairs will not amount to more than Rs. 15,376 a year, giving thus a net yearly advantage of Rs. 14,624 in favour of completing the Town Hall. You have not, however, informed us on what principle the interest of the outlay upon the Town Hall has been rated at 5 per cent only and the additional rent upon the present Court House occasioned by the outlay at 12 per cent. Besides Mr. Warden observes in his minute of 22nd January 1825 that the annual expense of the present Court House to the Company has been estimated too high by 700 or 1000 rupees a month which is equal to three-fourths of the expected saving. Your calculations, however, show that if, as was at first intended, the Town Hall be devoted to the accommodation of the public offices of Government the expense of the work will in no great number of years be covered by the saving of office rent. We therefore authorise you at all events to complete the building either with or without the Literary Society's rooms and devote it to the accommodation of the public offices or of the Supreme Court should that arrangement seem to you preferable. At the same time we do not feel ourselves bound either on the ground of justice or of liberality to incur an expense amounting to the difference between Rs. 1,98,846 and Rs. 2,85,227 for the construction of assembly and supper rooms for the inhabitants of Bombay who although they have commenced the buildings have not subscribed money enough to complete them nor even to prevent what has already been built from going to ruin. We desire that this additional expense may not be incurred.\n\nOn the 19th June 1827 Government intimate to the Court: We have authorized the completion of the Town Hall on the plan of the late Colonel Cowper but finishing the interior in the plainest style and have under consideration how to appropriate the building in a manner most advantageous to the Honourable Company.\n\nOn the 1st March 1828 Government further write: In the 44th paragraph of our despatch of the 19th June last we informed your\n\n---\n\n1 Paras 147 to 155 of Public Letter dated 1st Nov. 1824; paras 29 and 30 of 14th Dec. 1824; paras 43 to 45 of 1st July 1825.\n2 Pub.

At one time it occurred to us to appropriate the building as the Government House in the event of the Government House (that is the present (1894) Old Secretariat) being found to suffice for all the offices which it was originally intended to accommodate in the Town Hall. Independently of this consideration it must be observed in support of this proposition that the present town Government House is extremely ill suited for the residence of the Governor both from its situation and because from the large and increasing numbers of the Society of Bombay the building is wanting in space for those entertainments which are official and from which no Governor can exempt himself. This idea, though not matured into a measure resolved upon, showed us the expediency of reserving in our own hands under the orders of your Honourable Court, the appropriation of the building. And as the correspondence which had taken place with the Judges of the Supreme Court regarding the edifice appeared to give the Judges ground for concluding that they might if they pleased take the Town Hall for the Court House we thought proper again to write to the Judges placing the Town Hall at their disposal. We at the same time stated that as the building could not be completed in less than two years we would in reference to the wish expressed by the Judges for an early removal of the Court from the present house readily concur in any other arrangement that might occur to the Honourable Judges as capable of being earlier carried into effect in which case the Town Hall could be appropriated to other purposes. No answer having been received to this reference which was made on the 29th of March last we have now informed the Supreme Court that circumstances render it necessary to report again to your Honourable Court our proceedings regarding the Town Hall and the progress made towards completing and appropriating that building, and stated at the same time that any wish that the Honourable Judges may be pleased to express upon the subject to Government will accompany this despatch to England. We beg accordingly to bring our proceedings to the notice of your Honourable Court and to inform you that the building is in a considerable state of forwardness and it may be occupied entirely as your Honourable Court may approve. For the purpose of aiding your Honourable Court's decision we proceed to lay before you our ideas as to the plan which appears to us the most eligible for your Honourable Court to adopt. In the first place we would on no account recommend that the Supreme Court should be accommodated in this building. Such an arrangement would ultimately defeat the intention which we would wish to fulfill of allotting part of it to the public purposes intended. On reconsideration objections also occur to its being converted to a Government House. These are that it is not likely to supersede as the usual dwelling of the Governor the excellent house at Parel and the Marine Villa at Malab\u00e1r Point. So that for the few occasional purposes for which this magnificent mansion could be wanted it would be incurring a great and unnecessary expense to furnish it and to build the offices which would be required. This, it is true, might be met by the sale or appropriation to public purposes of the\npresent town Government House (the Old Secretariat). Even under this arrangement the same objection exists towards its being converted to a residence for the Governor as to a part being given to the Supreme Court. Though a wing of this building might answer for the limited objects of holding councils, levees, and occasional entertainments, the residence of the Governor could not well be under the same roof as the rooms appropriated for public meetings, library, museum, and other purposes connected with the convenience and advantage of the public of this large and increasing settlement. On a full reconsideration of the whole of this subject we should recommend to your Honourable Court to give us a latitude to appropriate this building when completed to the following general purposes: A Town Hall for the meetings of the inhabitants; An exchange for the commercial part of the community particularly the natives; A room for the meeting of the Literary Society with other rooms for its extensive library and its museum. The centre rooms and one wing will be quite sufficient for the above purposes. All of which we deem of consequence both in attention to the convenience of the Society and the facility and encouragement that will be afforded to the General and Commercial interests of this Presidency. The remaining wing of the Town Hall can either be appropriated as a Council room and offices for the Governor who can have the use of the central apartments for occasional levees and public entertainments, or be fitted as public offices, or be assigned in part or in whole for the uses stated in the letter under date the 4th December 1827 from the Committee of the Native Education Society to the Secretary in the Territorial Department. The important objects of this Society have already met and will continue to meet with the liberal aid and encouragement of your Honourable Court and perhaps no measure could tend more to promote these than an arrangement which must give such an impression of your decided favour and support as a grant of accommodation in part of the Town Hall. There is no doubt, as stated in the letter alluded to, that the present buildings are too small for its growing establishments. That they are inconveniently situated and that much precious time might be saved by their being concentrated on one spot. And were the building allotted them the property of Government and on a scale calculated to meet not only their present but future want of accommodation, a large and indefinite expense of house-rent would be saved. The upper rooms of a wing of the Town Hall if appropriated for this purpose would not only be sufficient for lecture-rooms, offices and library but would afford rooms for models and drawings in architecture and mechanics calculated to stimulate and promote a spirit of useful improvement, while the lithographic and other establishments might be in the ground floor. It will not escape the attention of your Honourable Court both with reference to this Society and to the accommodation which you have sanctioned to be given to the Literary Society of Bombay, whose library and museum have recently much increased, that such institutions receive an incalculable aid from their labours and results being so placed as to be constantly under general observation. This publicity gives a fame which is encouraging to those who are devoted to such objects, while it either entices men who would otherwise\nhave been indifferent into the path of literature and science or leads them by contributions to associate their names with such pursuits. It is chiefly on this ground that we shall be gratified to find that you deem the expectations indulged by the Literary Society and Native Society of Education of having accommodations in the Town Hall deserving of your attention.\n\nIn reply on the 25th March 1829 the Court write: Our object in authorising the completion of the Town Hall was to effect a reduction of the expense incurred either on account of the Supreme Court or of office rent and that object will not be attained unless the Town Hall be appropriated to the purposes originally contemplated. We therefore cannot consent to abandon the original intention in respect of the application of these premises more especially as the expiration of the lease of Hornby\u2019s House affords an opportunity of relieving us from the rental of a Court House. Further, as it appears that the new building is much larger than is necessary for the sole accommodation of the Supreme Court the remainder may be converted into public offices and thereby a further saving effected of the rental now paid by Government on that account. It appears, however, that notwithstanding our prohibition you have sanctioned an outlay of Rs. 2,58,712 and propose a further disbursement of Rs. 62,637. We strongly disapprove of the proceeding not only as involving a large and in our opinion unnecessary expenditure of public money but also as having been adopted and persevered in contrary to our positive orders and we must decline incurring any expense in this country on account of the Town Hall except for the cast-iron pillars which the Civil Engineer in charge of the building has pronounced to be necessary as well for its safety as durability.\n\nOn the 20th January 1830 Government explain: As your Honourable Court\u2019s objection to deviate from the plans originally proposed for the appropriation of the Town Hall rests on the ground that there will be no reduction of expense by the adoption of the measure suggested by us, we beg to refer the Honourable Court to our proceedings of the 25th of February 1829, 18th March 1829, 1st April, 15th April, and 27th May which have already been transmitted to your Honourable Court. From these proceedings you will observe that by the removal of the Secretary\u2019s office into the town Government House we have effected a saving of office rent to the amount of Rs. 1757 a month less the sum of Rs. 300 a month allowed to the Chief Secretary in lieu of the public quarters before assigned for his residence and now converted into public offices. This sum of Rs. 1757 is the rent of the undermentioned offices which have been put into the Secretary\u2019s residence:\n\n| Office                  | Rent |\n|------------------------|------|\n| Dispensary             | 92   |\n| Medical Storekeeper    | 260  |\n| Adjutant General       | 275  |\n| Quarter Master General | 150  |\n| Military Board         | 250  |\n| Commissary General     | 200  |\n| First Assistant General| 300  |\n| Brigade Major King\u2019s Troops | 80 |\n| Medical Board          | 150  |\n\nTotal ... 1757\n\n---\n\n1 General Dep. Letters to the Court Vol. 48 of 1828, 6 - 15.\n2 Pub. Dep. Letters from the Court Vol. 32 of 1829, 213 - 219.\nIt is also proposed to remove the Persian Secretary's office into the Government House which will occasion a further monthly saving of Rs. 225. In the meantime the room proposed to be allotted for the Persian Secretary's office has been appropriated for the office of Secretary to the General Prize Committee. The out-houses of Government House which are unoccupied by any of the Departments of the Secretary's office have been ordered to be made over to the Commissary General to be appropriated as godowns for receiving goods and stores to which they may at a small expense be made applicable. We authorized the renewal of the lease of Hornby's House on the 12th December 1828. But for want of the necessary power from Mr. Hornby to enable Messrs. Remington Crawford & Co. to do so the lease has not yet been executed.\n\nIn reply on the 9th March 1831 the Court write: As our objection to deviate from the plan originally proposed for the appropriation of the Town Hall rests on the ground that there will be no reduction of expense by the adoption of the measure suggested you refer us to proceedings of your Government from which you say we shall observe that 'by the removal of the Secretary's office into the Government House you have effected a saving of the office rent to the amount of Rs. 1757 a month minus the sum allowed to the Chief Secretary in lieu of the public quarters before assigned him,' which sum, we remark, you have without any reasons given fixed at Rs. 300 a month instead of the Rs. 200 recommended by the Building Committee.\n\nIt appears to have escaped your recollection that these savings have been brought to account already for a different purpose, namely to be set against the expenses incurred for the erection of a house for the Governor at Malabar Point and the purchase of another at Dapuri. What enabled you to convert the Government House into public offices was not the completion of the Town Hall, but the arrangements made for providing the Governor with two residences elsewhere. We certainly did not anticipate that the very same savings which we had deemed insufficient to compensate for our expense, would have been a second time presented to us as the beneficial fruits of another saving. It is obvious that what was saved by building a new Government House is not saved over again by completing the Town Hall.\n\nWe perceive that you reserve no part of the Town Hall for Government purposes, except a Council Chamber, an office for the Commander-in-Chief and his Military Secretary, and one for the lithographic establishment with some further space for depositing old records. It is therefore almost superfluous to observe that the expenses which would otherwise have been incurred on these accounts are the only charges which are saved by the arrangement. The office rent of the lithographic establishment was Rs. 125; that of the Commander-in-Chief's office was Rs. 300 which last charge it seems you cannot get rid of during Mrs. Keating's life; that of the Military Secretary to the Commander-in-Chief was\n\n---\n\n1 Pub. Dep. Letters to the Court Vol. 49 of 1829-30.\nRs. 70. The room in the Government House which you have previously intended to retain as a Council Room is now to be appropriated to the Medical Board and Dispensary, by which you will save Rs. 150 and 92. Altogether these sums amount to Rs. 737 a month. Whether any and what diminution of expense may have been effected by depositing the old Government records in the Town Hall we have not the means of ascertaining. But after all the total of these savings (which is all that we shall have to set against the expense of completing the Town Hall) will fall far short of Rs. 1457, the sum mentioned by you. Having thus stripped the question of all which tended to obscure it, we are now compelled to declare that a more unjustifiable waste of public money in a period of financial difficulty and a more flagrant violation of our positive orders has very rarely been brought to our notice. We sanctioned the completion of the Town Hall on principles of economy only, being assured by your Government that it would cost only Rs. 1,98,846, and that its appropriation to the use of the Supreme Court would occasion a saving of Rs. 14,624 a year. Subsequently to this you sanctioned an estimate of Rs. 2,58,712 independently of Rs. 30,000, the estimated expense of the cast-iron pillars for which you indented and which we accordingly supplied. An additional estimate of Rs. 1,27,452 has recently been submitted. Supposing this last estimate not to be exceeded the expense of the work will amount altogether to Rs. 4,16,164. In the meantime you have precluded yourselves from converting the building to the purpose which economy suggested, having renewed the lease of the present Court House and made arrangements for erecting additional offices to it. And this new lease, we must observe, was executed long after you had received our letter of the 25th March 1829, in which you were positively directed to appropriate the Town Hall to the purposes originally contemplated.\n\nThe monthly sum of Rs. 737 saved in office rent, is therefore the only pecuniary equivalent which we shall receive for the outlay of the enormous sum of Rs. 4,16,164. The interest of this outlay at 6 per cent is Rs. 24,969 a year or Rs. 2081 a month, so that instead of saving Rs. 1457 we shall lose on the lowest estimate Rs. 1344 monthly by this most culpable act of prodigality and improvidence. A review of the whole transaction and of the reckless and lavish expenditure of the public resources which has characterised your proceedings in every stage of it amidst continual ostentatious professions of regard for economy leaves us much reason to regret that we did not in the first instance reject the recommendation respecting the Town Hall as we did a similar one from Madras, where the purpose in view has since been attained at a comparatively trifling expense. We also deeply lament that the present is too late a stage to stop the prosecution of this most costly undertaking, the charges for which we foresee are yet far from being exhausted, while the object which was held out to us as our inducement to incurring them has not been attained. When the arrangements are completed, we direct that a statement be made out and transmitted to us of the total expense incurred on account of the Town Hall and the Governor's change of residence.\nand of the saving of office rent actually effected, not omitting the losses sustained by Government on the various leases which have been given up.\\(^1\\)\n\nOn the 4th January 1832 Government explain:\n\n| Description                                                                 | Rs.   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|\n| From a review of the proceedings of this Government it would appear that the sum sanctioned for the completion of the Town Hall on the 5th May 1828 amounted to | 2,58,712 |\n| In addition to the cast-iron columns indented for from England estimated at | 30,000 |\n| Further sum sanctioned by Government on the 21st July 1829                  | 1,27,453 |\n| Further amount sanctioned on the 11th December 1830                         | 75,257 |\n\nTotal: 4,91,422\n\nDeduct\u2014Amount saved by an alteration sanctioned in the railing surrounding the Town Hall ... ... ... 9413\n\nAmount sanctioned on the 23rd October and 11th November 1830 for fitting up the northern rooms of the Town Hall for the reception of the library and museum of the Literary Society ... ... ... 36,553\n\nAdditional sum sanctioned on the 9th December 1830 for four wooden railings to the four rooms and an iron one to the staircase gallery appropriated to the Literary Society ... ... ... 2450\n\nDeduct\u2014Amount saved by further alteration sanctioned in the railing surrounding the Town Hall ... ... ... 11,689\n\nTotal ... 5,09,323\n\nIt was at one time resolved to remove the undermentioned offices into the Town Hall calculated to produce a monthly saving of office rent of Rs. 2175 and to make over to the warehousekeeper the space in the lower part of the Town Hall for cotton and opium:\n\n| Office                          | Rs.   |\n|---------------------------------|-------|\n| Accountant General              | 400   |\n| General Paymaster              | 125   |\n| Persian Secretary to Government | 225   |\n| Clerk of the Court of Requests  | 150   |\n| Post Master General            | 175   |\n| Commander-in-Chief              | 300   |\n| Military Auditor General        | 200   |\n| Military Paymaster             | 400   |\n| Town Major                     | 120   |\n| Barrack Master                 | 80    |\n\nTotal: 2175\n\nIt has also since been resolved that the Civil Auditor's office, which was in the same building as the Accountant General's, should be accommodated in the Town Hall, and if the rooms in that building were not sufficiently large for the whole of the offices proposed to be removed there, the vacant space in the old Secretary's office should be\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Pub.

This meaning-making appears in 1673 in Fryer's 'convincing denomination Bombaim quasi Boon Bay';\u00b9 in 1690 in Ovington's 'originally called Boon Bay or Good Bay in the Portuguese';\u00b2 and in 1750 in Grose's 'Buon-Bahia now commonly Bombaim.'\u00b3\n\nThe joke is older than the seventeenth century. Dom Joao de Castro, writing in 1538, says the island is called Boa Vida or Good Living, because in 1528 Hector da Silveira's fleet had great refreshment and enjoyment in its beautiful groves, game, and abundance of meat and rice.\u2074 This Boa Vida like the later Boa Bahia is a meaning-making of the earlier Musalm\u00e1n and Hindu Manbai or Mumbai. In 1430, according to the Gujar\u00e1t histories,\u2075 a Hindu chief held the islands of M\u00e1him, Manbai, and Th\u00e1na.\u2076 In the sixteenth century, under the dates A.D. 1507, 1571, 1578, and 1583 the Mir\u00e1t-i-Ahmad\u00ed mentions Manbai or Mambe.\u2077 Among European writers who mention Bombay, Correa's\u2078 Bombaim in 1508 and Barbosa's\u2079 Th\u00e1na-Mayambu in 1516 are perhaps the earliest. Other Portuguese references to Mombaym, Bombain, and Bombayim occur in 1525, 1538, 1543, 1552, 1554, and 1563.\u00b9\u2070 In 1583 Balti writes Bombaim;\u00b9\u00b9 and Bombain is the form used by the Dutch traveller Baldeus in 1666.\u00b9\u00b2 In 1666 Thevenot has Bombaim a good harbour.\u00b9\u00b3 And in 1676 Tavernier speaks of the famous port of Bombye.\u00b9\u2074 Though the form Bombaim continued in use till the eighteenth century, the present spelling Bombay or Bombai occurs in 1538 in Dom Joao de Castro's Primeiro Roteiro (page 81); Bumbay is used by John Vian in 1626;\u00b9\u2075 Bombay adorns a rupee struck by the English in 1667;\u00b9\u2076 and though Fryer has Bombaim in the body of his book, the form Bombay heads his map of 1672.\u00b9\u2077\n\nA derivation which in meaning comes close to Boon Bay is that Bombay is Mub\u00e1rak, the Lucky, so called because it was the first land sighted by sailors from Arabia and the Persian Gulf to Sop\u00e1ra Chaul and Th\u00e1na. A passage in Frazer's Khor\u00e1s\u00e1n (page 29) suggests this origin as it notes that the first land sighted in entering the Persian Gulf is known to the sailors as Bomb\u00e1rak the Lucky. At the same time, as no known evidence supports the analogy, it may be accepted that Colonel Yule is right in adopting Mumba as the original form of\n\n\u00b9 Fryer's Travels, 62.\n\u00b2 Ovington's Voyage, 129.\n\u00b3 De Castro's Primeiro Roteiro, 81.\n\u2074 Grose's Voyage, I, 29.\n\u2075 R\u00e1s M\u00e1la, II, 350.\n\u2076 Bird's Gujar\u00e1t, 110, 129, 134, 214; Bayley's Gujar\u00e1t, 18, 21, 116, 218, 222.\n\u2077 Correa's Lendas, I, 926.\n\u2078 Stanley's Barbosa, 68.\n\u2079 Purchas' Pilgrimage, 615.\n\u00b9\u2070 Stanly's Barbosa, 68.\n\u00b9\u00b9 Thevenot's Voyages, V, 248.\n\u00b9\u00b2 Tavernier's Voyages, Ed. 1678, Part II, page 6.\n\u00b9\u00b3 Birdwood's Record Report, 214.\n\u00b9\u2074 Yule's Glossary, 586.\n\u00b9\u2075 Travels, 61.\nthe Musalm\u00e1n Manbai. It may further be accepted that the name Mumba comes from the shrine of Momba Devi, which is known to have stood near the Ph\u00e1si Tal\u00e1o or Gallows Pond, a site now included in the enclosure of the Victoria Station, till, about 1760, with other buildings, the shrine was removed to complete the Esplanade. In its present site at the south-west corner of the great Mumb\u00e1devi tank, as nearly as may be in the heart of the city of Bombay, the small shrine of Mumb\u00e1devi enjoys a more general reverence than perhaps any other place of worship on the island. In 1809 Mrs. Graham, though under some mistake in describing it as the largest pagoda in Bombay unless she included the whole group of temples and the tank, is right in stating that by her image and attributes Mumb\u00e1devi seems to be P\u00e1rvati, the wife of Siva. Momba is doubtless a corruption of Maha Amma, the Great Mother, the local manifestation of the universal influence of the great goddess P\u00e1rvati. Maham\u00e1devi seems to be the Surat goddess with the head of a deformed woman whom in 1660 Tavernier (Ball\u2019s Edition, II. 198) names Mama-niva and to be the Mahamaai of N\u00e1garkot or Jalandhar described in the Ain-i-Akbari (1583, II. 109) as the wife or power of Mah\u00e1dev. As regards the Bombay Mumb\u00e1devi the form Mahamma explains the curious name Mahomed Davey\u2019s Tank applied in the Principal Engineer\u2019s report of 1777 to a tank close to the former Mumb\u00e1devi shrine to the north-west of Fort George. To the common people of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r and Cutch Bombay is still Momai, and to the Sanskrit-knowing Maha M\u00e1ya the Great Glamour.\n\nIf Maha Amma was the original name to what is the local corruption Momba due? One explanation is an association with the word Mumb or water-pot, the jar so much used as a guardian-dwelling in Hindu temple and house rites. That Mumb is the original form of the name Mumbe finds support in the jingling assonance Trumb, the apparent root of the name of the neighbouring island Trombay. Still the absence of any reference to the water-pot either in the legends or in the temple or image ornaments, and the fact that the universal Dasara (September-October) brass pot inauguration in Mumb\u00e1devi\u2019s Temple is known as Ghat not as Mumba-sth\u00e1pana take almost all probability from this suggestion.\n\n---\n\n1 Compare Murphy 1844 (Trans. Bom. Geog. Soc. I. 130) Mumb\u00e1devi\u2019s temple was moved to its present site about eighty years ago.\n2 Bombay Town Materials, II. 403.\n3 Compare in Madras Siva\u2019s title Kumbhesvaram Lord of the Water Pot. Wilson (Works, III. 188) says the jar is a common but curious substitute for a goddess. Forbes (Ras Mala, I. 300) says the founder of a village sets up a water vessel as an emblem of the family goddess. To call a jar a substitute for or an emblem of a goddess is rather to miss the religious sense of the sanctity of the jar. The jar is properly the home of the goddess or influence, a dwelling, abiding in which, the wandering fiend settles into the kindly guardian. All through Hindu ritual and Hindu architecture the jar or pot is the spirit-home. The saying of Jelsl-ud-din Rumi (A.D. 1262), the mystic nightingale of meditation, our souls are housed in vessels of clay, illustrates the idea of the jar as a spirit-home. In his Diwan or Collection J\u00e1mi (A.D. 1480), the rival of Sa\u00e1d\u00ed (A.D. 1260), goes further blending in mystic union the guest and the guest-house. The God-Man, the wine and the wine-jar, himself the clay, himself the jar or body, himself the wine or soul in the jar, himself the maker of the jar, himself the breaker of the jar, the spiller of the wine, the spiller of the soul.\nAs Amma becomes Amba, Maha Amma may become Maha Amba. Further as Amma becomes Uma (Muir's Sanskrit Texts, IV. 403), and is equivalent to the Dravidian Umman, Mumba may simply be Maha Umba, the Great Mother. An important incident in the history of the island favours another origin of the local form Momba. Early in the fourteenth century, apparently either in A.D. 1317 or 1318, in the gleam of vigour which brightened the first year of his reign, the emperor Mubarak Shah, otherwise known as Sultan Kutb-ud-din (A.D. 1317-1320), spread his power from Daulatabad in the Dakhan to the coast and overran Salsette and Bombay. The local traditions that Mubarak Shah or his captains destroyed temples and persecuted Hindus in Bombay are borne out by the accounts of the Franciscan monks Jordanus and Oderic who were in Thana about A.D. 1320, and who describe how the country had lately passed under the Saracens who had destroyed an infinite number of temples. So grievously did the Bombay Hindus suffer that the name Mubarak Shah still lives in local tradition as Mumbarkshas, the demon Mumba. The fact that the pun has been preserved in Bombay tradition, coupled with the well-known practice of gods and goddesses taking as a title the name of a conquered demon, seems a natural explanation why the local Maha-Amma was turned into Mumba. The sudden slackening of Mubarak's hold over Bombay, perhaps news of the mad passion cruelty and lust, which, according to Ferishta, during his two remaining years, made Mubarak's name and reign too infamous for history, would, to the Brahmins of Bombay, seem possession by the avenging fury of the local Mother whom he had dishonoured. This suggestion may seem fanciful. It receives confirmation from the following passage from the Mahatmya or praise of the Bombay temple Walkeshvar quoted in Mr. Murphy's article on Early Bombay in the Bombay Geographical Society's Transactions of 1844 (Vol. I. page 130): 'The temple (of Mumbadevi) was built shortly after the Hindus of Bombay had suffered in their religion from the tyranny of Mubarak Shah.' This statement seems to imply some sudden cessation of Mubarak's interference with Bombay which the Hindus attributed to the guardian influence of the local Mother, and, in honour of the result, gave her as a title the name of the defeated foe Mubarak Shah, the demon Mumbarkshas. The tradition that the name\n\n---\n\n1 The exact year is disputed. See Elliot's History, III. 211 and 561.\n2 The Musalman historians are vague. According to the Tarikh-i-Firoz Shahi (Elliot's Musalmans, III. 210, 214-215) in 1318 all the Marathas were brought into subjection. Feudatories rulers and revenue collectors were appointed over the territories of the Marathas. Ferishta (Briggs, I. 389) has no special mention of the Konkan conquests.\n3 Jordanus Mirabilia, 23.\n4 Marathi History of Bombay, 30-34.\n5 Of the practice of Guardians adopting as a title the name of some conquered fiend examples may be cited in Mahishasuri that is Devi the destroyer of the Asur or fiend Mahish, and in Tripureshvar that is Siva who slew the fiend Tripura. The idea is a root idea. The spirit of the slain passes into the slayer; the spirit of the victim passes into the god to whom the victim is sacrificed.\n6 Briggs' Ferishta, I. 389-393; Elliot's Musalman Historians, III. 216-217.\n7 Compare Tarikh-i-Firoz Shahi (Elliot, III. 217), 'The violent vindictive spirit which possessed him led Mubarak Shah to kill Tagar [Tughral?] Khan who had committed no offence.'\nMomba is taken from some demon conquered by the local Mother has also been elaborated into a local Sanskrit Pur\u00e1n of uncertain date. The Pur\u00e1n tells how the demon Mumb\u00e1raka by faultless devotion won from Brahma the boon that no man demon or god should overpower him. Armed with the certainty of victory Mumba wasted mankind. His victims prayed to Vishnu. And the guardian, calling to his aid Siva and Brahma, from their united splendour produced a smiling eight-armed goddess. At the request of her three creators the Divine Energy sprang forth. For seven days she fought the demon Mumba. On the eighth she hurled him from his car. Before slaying him Devi asked Mumba to name a boon. Goddess, he answered, be pleased to take my name Mumba. The goddess agreed, and the demon worshipped, blessed her, and died. This legend is quoted at pages 30 to 34 of the useful Mar\u00e1thi work Bombay Past and Present. The author, Mr. Govind N\u00e1r\u00e1yan, adds: \u2018This demon was perhaps Mub\u00e1rak I. a hater of the Hindu religion, who, after himself, may have called the chief place on the island Mumb\u00e1pur or Mub\u00e1rakpur.\u2019 No known evidence supports the suggestion that Mub\u00e1rak called Bombay after himself. But if, as quoted by Mr. Murphy, the temple to Mumb\u00e1devi was built soon after Mub\u00e1rak\u2019s army retired from persecuting Bombay, the fact that the goddess\u2019 title is the name of the Hindu-hating emperor Mub\u00e1rak Sh\u00e1h is well nigh established.\n\nOddly Bombay is connected with a Momba older than Mub\u00e1rak Sh\u00e1h. The author of the Periplus of the Erythrean Sea (A.D. 247; McCrindle, 113) describes the land to the south of Indo-Skythia (that is of Sindh and Kacoh) and the whole of India as the territory of king Mombaros, a name and description which suggest the king of the island Mumba and of the neighbouring mainland. Still the absence of reference to Mumba either in local cave inscriptions (B.C. 100 - A.D. 300) or in Sil\u00e1h\u00e9ra grants (A.D. 8601 - 260) makes the connection between Mombaros and Mumbe improbable. Further at the time of the Periplus (A.D. 247) the North Konkan and West Dakhan were under the great Sinha or S\u00e1ha dynasty of Jun\u00e1gadh in K\u00e1thi\u00e1war. It is therefore probable that Mombaros is a corrupt reading for Mah\u00e1kshatrapa the title of the leading princes of that dynasty.\n\nThe result seems to be that Mumbe is a special form of Maha Amma the Great Mother, and that the special form was designed to glorify the local guardian by embedding in her name a trace of the defeated Mub\u00e1raksh\u00e1h the most fatal foe of Bombay Hinduism.\n\nThe following description of the Town and Island of Bombay is reprinted from the General Administration Report for 1892-93:\n\nFrom the south-west shore of S\u00e9lette, beyond the shallow half-mile of the M\u00e1him creek, the island of Bombay stretches south a belt about three miles broad and eleven miles long. The island of Bombay is formed by two broken ridges lying roughly parallel north-east and south-west, the western of basalt the eastern of green stone, at the\n\n---\n\n1 To name the king from his capital is a common practice among Greek writers on India. Compare Taxiles king of Taxila in the Panj\u00e1b and Palibothrus king of Patalibothra or Patna. Hamilton\u2019s Strabo, III. 91 note 2.\nhighest about 285 feet above mean sea level. Through breaks in the two ridges the low flat between them was formerly flooded at high tide, leaving, as is shown in the accompanying copy of Mr. Murphy's map, the seven islands of M\u0101him Varli and Sion on the north, of M\u0101zgaon and Bombay in the centre, and of Old Woman's island and Col\u0101ba in the south. During the last two hundred years the constant filling of small hollows, occasional large reclamations, and the building of the great Hornby (A.D. 1680 - 1780) and several smaller sea ramparts or vellards have turned the seven islands into one solid belt of land flanked by the two broken ridges, which, in the south, separated about three miles by the reef-guarded waters of Back Bay, end the one in Malab\u0101r Point and the other in Col\u0101ba. Beyond Col\u0101ba the lines of the two ridges intersecting below high-water level form the dangerous reefs which are marked by the Prongs' Lighthouse. To the north-east and north the fishing villages and the rice and salt lands of Shivri M\u0101tunga and Sion, to the north and north-west the palm groves of M\u0101him, to the west the Varli-Malab\u0101r ridge of high land given up to the scattered residences of the rich, and, in the extreme south, the point of Col\u0101ba set apart for the military, fringe and narrow the area of the city. Except in the north where the flat land is waste or is used for factories, and the Esplanade and great public buildings of the west, the city area, both in the fort and in the native town further to the north, is so packed with huge many-storied warrens that it contains four-fifths of the 820,000 people of the island. Apart from the total of Rs. 4,47,000 which its trade supplies to the Port Trust, the island yields a general revenue of about Rs. 75,90,000 and a Municipal revenue of Rs. 66,00,000, that is, a rough total revenue of about Rs. 1,46,37,000.\n\nThe high flat ledge to the east of the reservoir plateau on Bhand\u0101rw\u0101da hill commands one of the completest and most central views of Bombay and its surroundings. To the north a sprinkling of trees and patches of green garden and orchard freshen the foreground of brown roofs and yellow house fronts. Across the muddy Tank Bandar foreshore and the coal heaps of Frere Bandar stand the quarried face of Brae hill, and the Jubilee, Indo-Chinese, and National Mills clustered at the foot of the woody slopes of Golangi or Flagstaff hill. To the right the bare sides of Rowli and Antop rise behind the fishing village and rock-fort of Siwri. In the distance behind Siwri hill looms the dim tableland of Tung\u0101r (2250). Closer at hand stretching east are the woody slopes and waving outline of S\u0101lsette (1540), its central hills gathering in three main points above Veh\u0101r Tulsi and Yeur. Further east, across the north bay and mud flat of the harbour, behind the green swamps and gray salt lands of M\u0101hul or north-west Trombay, rise the knolls of the Parshik hills, and, over them, thirty miles inland, seen only in the clearest air, the lofty deep-cleft crest of M\u0101huli (2815) the guardian of T\u0101nsa Lake. At the east foot of Bhand\u0101rw\u0101da hill the half-mile belt that stretches eastwards to the harbour, with a fair scattering of plantains, cocoa-palms, tamarinds, mangoes, and pipals is thick with brown-roofed yellow-faced dwellings, from which stand out the picturesque pale-gray west fronts of two\nPortuguese churches, Notre Senhora De Rozario at the hill-foot and Gloria a few hundred yards to the south-east. Fringing the foreshore are the Peninsular and Oriental dockyard, the M\u00e1zgaon landing-pier, and the British India dockyard. Further south, close to the hill-foot, are the network of sidings and the long lines of low gray sheds that form the W\u00e1di Bandar terminus. On the left, out from acres of shed roofs, rises the Port Trust Clock Tower, and, between the tower and the harbour, are the rectangular pit of the Merewether dry dock and the broad basins of the Prince's and Victoria wet docks, a thicket of lofty masts. South, over the W\u00e1di Bandar sheds and sidings, for more than two miles stretch in strange close-packed confusion piles of many storied dwellings, their white and yellow ends and fronts crowned with peaked gables and brown-tiled hummocky roofs topped here and there by a flat view-terrace.\n\nBeyond these miles of thick-packed dwellings; on the left, at the harbour side, stand the tower of the Port Trust Moody Bay offices and the Castle Flag Staff. To the right, from the rough sea of roofs, rises, Venice-like, a notable cluster of public buildings, the light pinnacles of the Cathedral, the lofty crocket-ribbed dome of the Victoria Terminus, the peak-roofed finials of the Elphinstone College and Secretariat, the rounded summit and tiny side minarets of the huge Municipal buildings, the tall square shaft statued-drum and plumed pinnacle of the R\u00e1j\u00e1b\u00e1i clock tower (280) overtopping a confusion of lofty roofs, the steep rail-tipped roof of the short High Court tower (180), and the turrets of the Public Works Secretariat, the Post, and the Telegraph offices. To the right of the R\u00e1j\u00e1b\u00e1i tower, out of the distant low green line of Col\u00e1ba, rise the spire of the Memorial Church and the column of the Prongs Lighthouse (146). In the middle distance, to the right of the High Court, the high-pitched roof of the Police Court, the clock tower of the Crawford Market, the finial of the Gokald\u00e1s Hospital, and the lantern of St. Xavier's College show like islands in the sea of roofs and tree-tops. To the west, close at hand, are the reservoir filter-beds and gardens of the lower western top of Bhand\u00e1rw\u00e1da hill.\n\nBeyond Bhand\u00e1rw\u00e1da hill to the south-west, behind the line of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, stretches the scarped cliff of Navroji hill (192), its top and western slopes thick with houses. Further west, from the broken mass of roofs that spread to the palms of Girgaon, stand out the wide enclosure and the lofty turrets and pinnacles of the Jamsedji and Motlib\u00e1i Hospitals. Still more to the right, among the brown roofs that lead to the factories of T\u00e1rdeo and the foot of Camb\u00e1l\u00e1 hill, rise the cupola of the Synagogue, the obelisk of Byculla Church, and the smooth slender twin spires of St. Mary's Cathedral. To the north-west between the Bhand\u00e1rw\u00e1da reservoir and the gray of the Flats, the crowd of brown roofs is hidden and broken by the gardens and mango orchards of M\u00e1zgaon, and adorned by the golden-spiked gleaming white dome and minarets of His Highness Aga Khan's Tomb, and the peak-roofed tower of the Technical Institute. Further to the right across the middle distance, as far as the green belt of the Mahim palm groves, stretch the Flats bristling with forty lofty chimney stalks and laden\nwith the mighty masses of the Leopold, David, Petit, Imperial, Sun, Jacob, New Sassoon, and other huge factories.\n\nRound this great city, to the north-east east and south, stretch the broad waters of the harbour, according to the hour and the season blue golden tawny or steel gray, with its flocks of small white-winged harbour craft, and, at their moorings, lines and clusters of lading and discharging steamers, fleets of peak-proved lofty-pooped seafaring bagl\u00e1s, dhingis, and koti\u00e1s, and a sprinkling of stately square-rigged ships. Among the shipping opposite the Carnac Bandar lies the bare rocky mound of Cross Island, and about two miles south off the Apollo Bandar the small flat circle of the Middle Ground Shoal. Across the harbour the north-east is filled by the long brown back of Trombay (1000), sloping south to the point of Pir P\u00e1v. In the east rises the low greenery of Hog Island. In midwater lies the flat rocky line of Butcher's Island and behind it the woody hills of Elephanta (658), and to the south-east the separate sharp-cut crests of Little (760) and of Great (980) Karanja.\n\nInland, beyond the low broken line of the Parsik hills, the shivered cliffs and the flat-topped bluffs of the T\u00e1vli-M\u00e1ther\u00e1n range fill the whole eastern view. In this range from north to south, beginning from the left or north end of the range, are the bastions of T\u00e1vli, the Cathedral Rocks of Bh\u00e1u Malang (2300), the smaller buttresses of Mhas-M\u00e1la, the pillar of N\u00e1vra-N\u00e1vri, the castle crest of Ch\u00e1nderi, the low fortified head of Peb, the long walls of M\u00e1ther\u00e1n and Prabhal (2500), the broken pillars of Isalgadh the False Funnel and of Karn\u00e1l\u00e1 (1540) the True Funnel, and the comb of M\u00e1nikgad (1800). In the extreme east, through breaks in the M\u00e1ther\u00e1n range, looms the dim line of the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds. Behind the comb of M\u00e1nikgad to the left are the gap of the Bor Gh\u00e1t and the heights round Khand\u00e1la and in the clearest air, the more distant forts of Visapur (3550) and Lohogad (3415). To the right the knuckle tip of N\u00e1gphani or the Duke's Nose stands in front of the long plateau of S\u00e1karpath\u00e1r (3000) and the saw-toothed outline of J\u00e1mhulni, with, in clear air, more distant peaks perhaps Tung and Tikona in Bhor. South of J\u00e1mhulni the line of the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds rises in a group of noble hills of which Devgad, Morva, Visakar, Koarigad, Masagaon, and part of S\u00e1lt\u00e1r (3322) in south Poona are visible, and the rest of S\u00e1lt\u00e1r and Tel Baili also in south Poona and Bhorap in Bhor are hid by the slope of north Karanja. In the gap between the two Karanj\u00e1s stands the wooded western top of Mira Dongar the Pen hill. Further south, between the west point of Great Karanja and the Bluff in north-east Alib\u00e1g, the long hill-flanked valley of the Amba river or N\u00e1gothna creek winds twenty-six miles south into the heart of the Bhor hills. About ten miles south of the Alib\u00e1g Bluff, from a sharp cliff overhanging the Amba creek, the main range of the Alib\u00e1g hills stretches west till, near the fortified top of S\u00e1gargadh (1164), it is hid by the beacon-bearing slope of the Alib\u00e1g Bluff. To the right the crest of the Bluff sweeps south and west rising to the sacred wooded head of Kankeshvar (1261), which falls westward to the sea and the faint outlying circle of Kenery island. Behind the western spurs of Kankeshvar stands the bare block of the western S\u00e1gargadh range.\ncentering in the point of Parhur (1050). Fifteen miles south, over the low lines of the Alib\u00e1g palms, the land ends in the dim level crest of the Roha and Janjira hills. From the palm groves of Alib\u00e1g; past the low line of Henery (Underi) and the rocky knoll of Kenery (Kh\u00e1nderi), the sea spreads round the points and reefs of Col\u00e1ba across the palm-fringed curve of Back Bay till it is hid by the woody bluff of Malab\u00e1r Point which rises gently northwards to the house and palmyra-crowned crest of the Malab\u00e1r (280) and Camb\u00e1l\u00e1 (250) ridges. Northwest, across the palm-dotted curve of the Great Vellard, spreads a second vision of open sail-brightened sea, hid for a time by the woody hillock of Love Grove and again opening on either side of the rock of Martand, till it is once more lost behind the bushy crest of Varli (200), which, in a broken line, leads north, till the circle is completed in the palm groves of M\u00e1him and the leafy gardens and rice lands of Parel and M\u00e1tunga overtopped by the casuarinas of B\u00e1ndra hill and the long ridge of P\u00e1li.\n\n**Breach Candy** seems to mean the beach at the mouth of the hollow or pass, that is the hollow between Kamb\u00e1l\u00e1 ridge on the north and Malab\u00e1r ridge on the south. The use of breach for the wave-breaking or surf, the modern beach, is common among sixteenth and seventeenth century writers. Shakespeare (1585) (Twelfth Night, II. 1) writes; For some hour before you took me from the breach of the sea was my sister drowned: Sir Edward Michelburne (1604) (Kerr\u2019s Voyages, VIII. 91); At Sumatra the sea went with so violent a breach on the shore that the people could not land: Finch (1610) (Kerr\u2019s Voyages, VIII. 261); S\u2019Augustine in Madagascar may easily be found as it has breaches on either side: Davis (1620) (Voyages and Works, 118); There was a sudden storm so that our ship did drive over a breach and our boats sank at the shore. By the middle of the eighteenth century the word Breach seems in Bombay to have been locally applied to the break or gap in the rocks of the western shore through which the sea flooded the flats. So Grose (1750) (Voyage, I. 52) writes: The causeway at the Breach where the sea had so gained on the land as nearly to divide the island; And a Military Report of 1771 (Pol. Diary 14 of 1873, 40) notes that from Varli to the Breach the sea is surrounded with sharp rocks. One example of the old spelling Candy for Khind or Pass is enough: Sir James Mackintosh (1804: Life, I. 276) writes Ganesh Candy for Ganesh Khind. The absence of either a tower or a creek at Breach Candy is against Dr. Murray Mitchell\u2019s Buraj-Kh\u00e1di the Creek Tower (compare Hobson-Jobson, 767).\n\n**Butcher\u2019s Island.**\u2014See Bombay Town Materials, I, 438-439.\n\n**The Castle.**\u2014Between 1528 and 1626 the Portuguese built the Great House, the nucleus of the present Castle. According to the English navigator Davies in 1626 this Great House was at once a ware-\nhouse, a priory, and a fort. According to Hamilton (1700-1720) it was an old square house which served the Portuguese as a place of retreat till relieved by troops from other places.\n\nIn October 1626 a joint force of Dutch and English landed on Bombay and burned the Great House or Castle but withdrew without any attempt to retain possession.\n\nIn 1634 the Portuguese writer Antonio Bocarro notices that the house of the lord of the town of Bombay was well protected at his own expense. At the left hand margin of the harbour was also a platform ten paces square with two guns mounted seawards.\n\nAbout 1664, when the Portuguese allowed Mr. Cooke and his men to land on the island, Bald\u00e6us says: The harbour of Bombay is furnished with a capital Castle that can protect the anchorage. Nine years later Fryer (New Account, 63) writes: At first landing Cooke and his men found a pretty well-seated but ill-fortified house, four brass guns being the whole defence of the island. About the house or Castle was a delicate garden said to be the pleasantest in India. In 1668 the Court ordered that the Castle should be enlarged and strengthened and in the following year entrusted the work to Captains Tolderey and Smith. In 1671 their place was taken by Mr. Herman\n\n---\n\n1 See below note 3.\n2 New Account, I, 185.\n3 Bombay Town Materials, I, page 1 note 2. The details are: In 1626 the English, with the Dutch, seized the island of Bombay on the Malab\u00e1r Coast from the Portuguese, but for some unexplained reason immediately abandoned it. Among the Ships' Journals preserved in the Record Department of the India Office are: (A) From Andrew Warden's Journal in the William: 1626, October 15th.\u2014In the morning stood in and anchored and landed of the English and the Dutch some 400 men at the least and took the Fort and Castle and the town, and set fire to it and all the town, and all the houses thereabouts, the people being all run away that night and did carry away all the best commodities leaving nothing but trash. October 16th.\u2014In the morning we set sail. (B) From John Vian's Journal in the Discovery: 1626, October 13th.\u2014This 13th day we and the whole fleet both of English and Dutch went into Bombay and came to an anchor in nine fathom, one point bearing W.N.W. compass, the other S.S.W., the one three miles off, the other three leagues off; this was in the entering of the harbour. October 14th.\u2014This day we went with the whole fleet in further, near a small town or village, where there were Portugals. We anchored and rode a mile off, in six fathoms, one point compass bearing W.S.W. five miles off, the other S. by W. some five leagues off. We came so near the town with two of our ships that we drove them all away with our great ordnance, namely the Morries of the English and the Mauritius of the Dutch. In safety we landed our men on shore, who pillaged the town, and set their houses all on fire with their fort near the waterside. Yes, we stayed there the 15th day doing all the spoil that possibly we could, but we got nothing to speak of but victual. So when we had done all the harm we could, the 15th day in the evening we got our men aboard, leaving the town on fire, and the 16th day in the morning when the wind came off shore, we weighed anchor and went off to sea again. (C) From David Davies' Journal in the Discovery: 1626, October 13th.\u2014The 13th we went into the bay and rode without the stakes, as you may see in the draft following. The 14th the Morries and the Dutch ships went in near the Great House to batter against it, in which battery three of the Morries ordinance split; the same day we landed 300 men English and Dutch and burnt all their cajan houses and took the great house with two basses (the smallest kind of cannon used in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries) of brass and one saker (i.e., hawk, a denomination of cannon) of iron. The 15th all our men embarked aboard the ships being Sunday in the evening, and left the Great House which was both a warehouse, a priory, and a fort, all after burning with other good houses together with two new frigates not yet from the stocks nor fully ended; but they had carried away all their treasure and all things of any value, for all were run away before our men landed.

In December 1672 Fryer found that the shady walks of the Portuguese garden had been loaded with cannon, the bowers had been turned to ramparts, the trees rooted out, and masonry walls had taken the place of garden fences. According to Fryer the changes were chiefly carried out by Mr. Philip Gyfford (1667-1670) whom Fryer (New Account, 65) describes as raising and in a manner finishing the bastions, a work which was still but beginning by the rest. In January 1673 the French traveller Dellon describes the Castle as a very fine fort in which the English President generally resides. In the following month (February 20th, 1673) finding Bombay Fort as stark as the deli the Dutch retreated to their boats without any booty. In December 1673 within the fort were mounted 120 pieces of ordnance and in other stands twenty more, besides sixty field-pieces in their carriages. At this visit Fryer notices that a trench was being dug out of the hard rock round the Castle to moat it with the sea, and that horn works were being made. In Fryer's opinion these works were too costly ever to be carried out by the Company. At the same time they were faulty since the wall should have extended to a tank without the parade. In 1675 Fryer (New Account, 122) refers to certain unnecessary appendices to the fort being pallisadoes in mud so contrived that they were rather a means to take the fort than to defend it, which afterwards were all washed away by the rains.\n\nIn July 1676 Surat pressed on Bombay the need of completing the bastion and the parapet to the faussebraye (see above page 70; the home works on that page should be horn works). The details of the explosion in 1677 (see above page 73) prove that the north-east bastion was then complete. In 1684 a fresh bastion was added to the Castle. During the Sidi war (1689-90) the faulty position of the Castle under command of Dongri hill caused much loss and discomfort. With the magnitude, figure, and materials of the fort Hamilton (New Account, I. 185-187) found no fault. He says: It is a regular tetragon whose outside polygon is about 500 paces; it is built of a good hard stone; and it can mount above 100 pieces of cannon. In 1638 the Castle, which had been ordered to be strengthened in 1690 and again in 1695, was held to be safe against the attack of any Indian enemy (Bruce's Annals, III. 89, 182, and 275).\n\nIn 1750 Grose writes: The fortified house built on the site of the residence of the Portuguese Governor ought to have been taken down and built at Mendham's Point. The Castle is well-built with regular gradients of strong hard stone. In one of its bastions called the Tank bastion is a large cistern of water. There is also a well within the fort, but the water is not extremely good, and is liable to be dried up in the heats. A ditch had been made at great expense and flooded; and though the curtain of the wall between the bastions is very frail, the fort is one of the strongest of the Company's places.\n\nOn the 23rd September 1755 the Engineer Captain De Funck wrote: Bombay town is fortified with a Castle and other irregular walls in\n\n---\n\n1 Bombay Town Materials, II. 268-269.\n2 Grose's Voyage, I. 49-50; Bombay Town Materials, II. 293.\nform of bastions, surrounded with a wet ditch, and commanded by a hill called Dongri. Seaward this town is fortified with a Castle, and, to the right and left of the Castle, are some other walls and detached batteries. The Castle is called Bombay Castle and is situated on a low ground, about the middle part of the town, close to a bed of rocks in the sea opposite the harbour, and is formed in the figure of a trapezoid which is construed into four bastions called the Flag, Brab-tree, Tank, and Cavalier bastions. The Castle is not constructed in a manner to make a sufficient defence. Any battery by land or by water is able to ruin the wall of this fort. If this fort or Castle could be surrounded by a lower wall in form of a terrace biaisse or sloping parapet, it would be a great part stronger and able to make a defence against any attack that ever possibly could be made in this country. The interior of this Castle is large enough for lodging a proper garrison, stores, and ammunition. But the present barracks for the artillery are in a very bad condition, and have not room to contain above sixty to seventy men. Besides the infantry guard room is not sufficient for the garrison necessary for this Castle.\n\nApparently from the beginning of British management to 1755, besides Government House, the house of the Second in Council, and accommodation for the garrison, the Castle enclosure contained quarters for the Secretary's, the Treasurer's, and the Chief Accountant's offices. Captain De Funck's examination of the Castle satisfied him that the high walls of Government House were a serious menace to the safety of the fort. The walls could not stand a cannonading. They would fall and the ruins would injure the garrison and impede the working of the guns.\n\nAbout the same time Dr. Ives describes (1754) the chief fort as a regular square of very good materials provided with over 100 guns. On his return in January 1758 Dr. Ives found that since 1754 a Swedish engineer Captain De Funck had made a considerable increase to the sea fortifications.\n\nOn the 25th April 1760 the Court write to Bombay: We approve of pulling down the high buildings of the Fort House, raising batteries towards the sea for the protection of the Castle, and fortifying your piers. All these are works that admit of no delay.\n\nOne of the last additions to the Castle was in 1764 the chambers over the gateway. These consisted of a hall and closet for the Captain and a room on each side for the subalterns. This accommodation was required, because in completing the Town Walls the guard room at the Apollo Gate had been removed.\n\nIn 1775 the merchant Parsons describes Bombay Castle as a very large and strong fortification.\n\n---\n\n1 Bombay Town Materials, II, 307-311.\n2 Bombay Town Materials, I, 311, 312, 315, 327; Pub.

In December 1861 the Government of Bombay forwarded to the Secretary of State the report of a Committee on the subject of the Western Defences of the Fort of Bombay. The conclusions of the Committee were entirely approved by His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief and the Governor in Council. In a minute dated the 18th January 1862 on the Land Defences and the removal of the ramparts Lieut.-General W. R. Mansfield then Commander-in-Chief observed that the town or fort of Bombay was a hundred years ago somewhat in the same case as Genoa and Venice at the era of the Italian republics. The State was in the town itself and in the safety of the town the preservation of the State was consequently involved. The island of Bombay instead of being an isolated town exposed to piracy and other dangers with no field army from which to call for help, was now an enormous growing and commercial capital of large and flourishing provinces, studded with the stations of an army, a considerable portion of which was immediately available by railway. He thought the conclusion was inevitable that while the Government could not be too careful with regard to the Harbour Defences, all anxiety was removed with respect to any possible danger that could come from the interior. General Mansfield's conviction was that the position of the fort was either untenable or one which should not be held. He accordingly recommended the razing of the ramparts.\n\nIn a Despatch in the Military Department dated the 17th June 1862 Her Majesty's Secretary of State expressed his approval of the proposal of the Committee to remove the Western Front of the Fortifications and to turn the ground so recovered to useful and profitable account and authorized the Government of Bombay to take the steps necessary for that purpose by levelling the ramparts and by erecting other works of defence on a new and improved plan. An executive committee styled the Rampart Removal Committee was accordingly appointed by Government to carry out the measures ordered.\u00b9 The estimated expenditure on account of removing the ramparts and other works in connection therewith was Rs. 1,48,405.\u00b2 In 1865 the work of removal of the disused ramparts of the fort was completed and the Committee dissolved.\u00b3\n\nCross Island, also known as Gibbet Island, is a small rounded knoll about 80 feet above high-water level and 500 yards east of Carnac Bandar. According to one account this island received its name because on it the first Portuguese (A.D. 1507 - 1509) set a cross in sign of possession. In support of this derivation the common name of the island Signalo is quoted as proving that on it the cross was\n\n\u00b9 Gov. Res. Public Works Dept. No. 6111 dated 22nd Nov. 1862.\n\u00b2 Gov.

But in Urdu-Marathi *Shindlo* means not a signal but a harlot and this may be the origin of the common Bombay story that certain harlots who were implicated in a murder were the first offenders who were hanged on the cross or gibbet on Cross Island. Of the practice of hanging pirates and other heinous offenders in chains on Cross Island the author of *Qui Hi* (1816, page 202) has left the following:\n\nThe sails are set, they catch the wind,\nDismal the wretched fellows rung\nThat on Cross Island's gibbets hung,\nDismal the kites and crows and cranes\nShrieked to the music of the chains.\n\n**Great Western Hotel.**\u2014Of the large house on the west side of Apollo Street opposite the Dockyard enclosure now (1894) the Great Western Hotel and still known as the Old High Court the following details are available: The Collector's records show that in 1748-49 Messrs. George Criggs and Michael Rasor owned this property. Ten years later 1757-58 Mr. Criggs' interest was transferred to Mr. John Baptista. In 1771-72 the Honourable Mr. William Hornby, who was Governor from 1771 to 1784, succeeded to the whole property. To the building of the house no reference has been traced. Three causes seem to have combined to bring about the construction of what is still one of the handsomest residences on the island: First the demolition for military reasons of the original Government House, in the Castle in 1758; second the abundance of labour available in some of the cold or saving fits during which the fortifications were at a stand; and third the large ideas of Mr. William Hornby one of the ablest and most energetic of Bombay Governors. It seems doubtful whether Mr. Hornby ever lived in Hornby House. As Governor he almost certainly lived in Mr. Spencer's House, the building in Apollo Street now (1894) known as the Old Secretariat, into which the Governor moved in 1757-58 when for military reasons the Government House, that is the Fort House, in the Castle was demolished.\u00b9 Nor does Hornby House seem at first to have been used as the Second's House since in 1764 Mr. Hunter's House, on the site of the building at present occupied as the B. B. and C. I. Railway Company's offices to the north of the Cathedral, was known as the Second's House.\u00b2 It seems probable that after 1764 when Mr. Hunter's House was taken for Public Offices, the Second may have come to live at Hornby House. And that between 1764 and 1781 Hornby House was used by the Second and also as an Admiralty House when an Admiral happened to be stationed in Bombay. That Admirals lodged in the Great House between 1764 and 1781, is shown (Pub. Diary 78 of 1781, 326) in the joint report of the 19th June 1781 of the surgeons of the hospital in the Marine Yard. The four surgeons\n\n\u00b9 On the 1st March 1757 Mr. John Spencer's House was purchased by Government for the President and Governor for his town residence for Rs. 15,161-0-91. Compare above Secretariat. This house is the present (1894) Old Secretariat.\n\u00b2 Mr. Warden's Landed Tenures of Bombay 20th August 1814 paragraph 122. Bom. Gov. Sel. LXIV, 47.\n(William Tennent, James Bond, Sam. Richardson, and George Birch), agree that the hospital be moved from its site in the Marine Yard provided it can be located in the house lately occupied by the Admiral with its high dry and healthy rooms, its convenient outhouses, and its spacious accommodation fit to receive 400 sick Europeans. No action was taken on this proposal. Next year on the 25th October 1782 Government leased this house from Mr. Hornby for ten years at a monthly rent of Rs. 2000 to serve as an Admiralty House and for other public purposes.\n\nFour years later (1786), Government refer (Bombay Town Materials, II. 488 - 490) to the house as the Admiralty House rented from Mr. Hornby to which on the sale of the Baz\u00e1r Gate Court House and Town Hall to Harjivan Sirpat the Mayor's Court was transferred. Two years later (1788), much to their annoyance, the Mayor's Court was (Pub. Diary 92 of 1788, 221) turned out of Hornby House to make room for Sir Archibald Campbell and the officers of His Majesty's 71st Regiment. On this occasion Government describe (Bombay Town Materials, II. 488 - 490) the building as the Admiralty House wherein the Mayor's Court had for some time past been assembled. Four years later (1792) on the expiry of the lease the following proceedings are recorded: On the 8th June 1792 (Pub. Diary 101 of 1792, 677) the land paymaster acquainted the Government of the approaching expiration on the 25th October 1792 of the ten years' lease regarding the Hornby or Admiralty House. On the 12th June 1792 (Pub. Diary 101 of 1792, 677) Government directed that Mr. Hornby's agents be called upon to inform Government the lowest terms they would rent their Constituants' House to the Honourable Company for the space of five years. Thereupon Mr. Maister on the 14th June 1792 (Public Diary 101 of 1792, 703) wrote: Mr. Hornby is willing to renew the lease of this large house to the Honourable Company for fourteen or twenty-one years upon the same terms and conditions as they have hitherto held it. If Government are willing to rent the house only for the further space of five years he expects the same rent which is now paid, Rs. 2000 a month, and a renewal of the lease for that period. On the 19th June 1792 (Pub. Diary 101 of 1792, 703) Government referred the matter to the land paymaster.\n\nOn the 2nd July 1792 the land paymaster reported (Public Diary 102 of 1792, 764): The actual expense for the repairs to the large house in the Apollo Street the property of Mr. Hornby during the ten years of the lease (25th October 1782 to 30th April 1792) amounted to Rs. 14,838-1-59. The estimate of the clerk of the works shows that the expense that will be incurred to put the whole house and buildings in suitable and complete repair would amount to Rs. 9937-0-75. This sum includes Rs. 1533-1-79 for rebuilding the wall and making repairs to the large batty warehouse which it is well known was in a very bad condition at the time Mr. Hornby delivered it over (1782). On the 12th July 1792 the land paymaster (Pub. Diary 102 of 1792, 783) further reported that the estimate of the clerk of the works for white-washing and other necessary repairs to the large house in Apollo Street the property of Mr. Hornby, amounted to Rs. 7476-1-36. On the 6th July 1792 Government resolved (Pub. Diary 102 of 1792, 765) to intimate to Mr. Maister that the house would be delivered.\nup to him on the 25th October 1792. And on 13th July 1792 (Pub. Diary 102 of 1792, 783), after consulting the Company's Solicitor, Government directed that the repairs must be immediately carried into execution. Three months later (23rd October 1792) the following entry occurs (Pub. Diary 103 of 1792, 1220): As the lease of Mr. Hornby's large house will expire on Thursday next (the 25th October), and as we are desirous of hiring the warehouses by the year at a moderate rent, it is agreed that a committee consisting of Messrs. Morley, Stevenson, and Adamson call to their assistance some of the principal merchants, and give us their opinion what monthly rent will be equitable.\n\nOn the next day (24th October 1792) the committee submitted the following report (Pub. Diary 103 of 1792, 1224): Two warehouses near the east entrance into the house and immediately under the large hall, each Rs. 50 a month; two warehouses, one of them being at the south and the other at the north side of the front of the house, each Rs. 75 a month; two warehouses at the back part of the house, one of them being at the south and the other at the north side of it, each Rs. 65 a month; one very large warehouse situated at the back part of the compound and now (1792) called the batty warehouse, Rs. 150 a month. These details give a monthly total rent of Rs. 580. The Board then proposed (Pub. Diary 103 of 1792, 1225) to Mr. Maister, Mr. Hornby's agent, to hire the warehouses at the committee's valuation. Mr. Maister would not agree (27th October 1792) to accept the rents offered. He wrote: Considering (Pub. Diary 103 of 1792, 1225) the goodness of these warehouses and the convenience of their situation the suitable rent was Rs. 100 for each of the six warehouses under the body of the house and Rs. 200 for the large batty warehouse or in all Rs. 800 a month for one year from 1st November 1792. On receipt of Mr. Maister's terms, on the 30th October 1792, the Board observe (Pub. Diary 103 of 1792, 1226): We are of opinion from the solidity of the construction, the dryness of the warehouses, and their advantageous situation and security from fire, that they are fully worth Rs. 800 a month which is actually a monthly saving of Rs. 800 upon the rent of Rs. 2000 which the Honourable Company paid before, as the habitable apartments did not fetch more than Rs. 400 a month. From these circumstances Mr. Maister's proposal appearing reasonable, it is agreed that it be accepted and the necessary orders be issued for that purpose. The house seems to have been taken from year to year till on the 23rd April 1798 the Government recommended the Court (Pub. Dep. Letters to the Court Vol. 32 of 1797-1799, 248) to treat in England with Mr. Hornby for a long lease of his house known as the Admiralty since it might be converted into a better suite of commodious Public Officers than any other buildings at this Presidency. In reply on the 18th March 1801 (Pub. Dep. Court's Letters Vol. 15 of 1800-1803, 137-138) the Court write: Previous to our coming to a decision upon your late recommendation relative to the leasing of Mr. Hornby's House, called the Admiralty, for the purpose of its being converted into public offices, we direct that you revise the subject and communicate to us your opinion on the requisite accommodations for transacting the Company's business at your Presidency on a reduced scale in consequence of the measure recently adopted of placing the Civil and Mil-\ntary Government of the Provinces of Malab\u00e1r and K\u00e1nara under the control of the Presidency of Madras. In 1800 Government still rented the house a room being set apart to store the Admiralty furniture. In the same year (1800) this building was re-arranged so as to make it suitable for the Recorder's Court. In the negotiations between Government and Mr. Maister on behalf of Mr. Hornby, apparently Mr. John Hornby the heir of Mr. William Hornby, the house is referred to (see above pages 47-48) as the Admiralty House and again as the large house called the Admiralty House. From April 1800 Hornby House continued to be rented for the Recorder's Court. The Reference Book to the Revenue Survey Plan of 1813 shows the land as William Hornby's. In 1827-28 the rent roll shows it as transferred in that year from Mr. William Hornby's name to Mr. John Hornby's name. The property continued in Mr. John Hornby's name till 1878-79 when Mr. Arthur Hornby and the Trustees of Mr. Rustamji Jamsedji Jijibhai conveyed it to Mr. Albert Abdulla David Sassoon for Rs. 3,85,000. Since then it has remained the property of the Sassoon family. From 1800 Hornby House continued to be the Recorder's Court House till in 1824 (May 8th) the Recorder's Court became the Supreme Court and in 1862 (August 14th) the Supreme Court became the High Court. The High Court continued to use it as a Court House till in 1879 (March 1st) the new High Court on the Esplanade was completed. On the transfer of the High Court the buildings were converted into the Great Western Hotel.\n\n**Mahim Shrine.**\u2014A Government order to Mr. Aislalie, dated the 12th of November 1694, runs: These are to enorder you to permit the Moormen to come upon this island to worship at the tomb at Mahim as customary; but let none come armed at any time but persons of some considerable quality. Such persons you may permit to have their arms as also two of their servants. These orders you are to observe from your receipt hereof to the 26th instant but no longer.

About 300 yards north of the north-west corner of Elphinstone Circle, on the west side of Bohora Baz\u0101r street, immediately beyond its meeting with Gunbow Lane, stands a long low upper-storeyed building with peaked tiled roof. The street part of the ground floor is marked by a row of small shops built of wood planking. But the central entrance, the deep eaves, and the well-carved brackets show that it is a building of some age and importance. Over the square gateway hangs the sign of the Fort Printing Press and under the signboard is a plain wavy-edged panel of wood. The upper storey, under a deep eave hung on rich carved-wood brackets, has a main window over the central entrance and to the right or north a line of five windows and of four to the left or south. From Bohora street the paved entrance rises about 18 inches to the opening of the central gateway. This square cut gateway, about 12 feet high 11 feet broad and 40 feet deep, with side benches of stone and a modern wooden ladder leading to the upper storey, opens on a rough untidy paved court two feet lower than the entrance plinth, 32 feet broad from east to west, and 85 feet long from north to south. Across the worn pavement of the yard, on a plinth reached by two broad steps with a lift of about six inches each, stands the unroofed and ragged shell of a large building. At the north and the south ends of the courtyard a ten-foot broad flight of eleven steps with a lift of six inches and a tread of twelve inches, of much worn two feet square slabs of blue trap, leads to a ten-foot square landing at the back of which a wall with traces of a rich red coating of plaster rises about seventeen feet. From the landing to the right and to the left two upper flights, with a plain solid masonry balustrade about three feet high, rise, one flight of fifteen steps leading to the right to the back of the street row of buildings the other flight of eighteen steps leading left to the upper storey of the main ruin. In the flight of steps at the north end of the yard the original arrangement is unaltered: the southern flights are confused by later houses built over the staircase.\n\nThe inner or western face of the front or Bohora Baz\u0101r row of buildings is separated from the courtyard by a sloping tile-roofed veranda four feet six inches wide and two steps above the yard level. The northern half of the ground floor, lighted by iron-barred\nwindows, is used as storerooms; the southern half as a workshop for ruling account books. In the north-west corner a small room (12' \u00d7 7' \u00d7 7' high) with masonry walls and roof and a door with wrought-iron shutters seems to have been used as a safe or strong room. The upper storey is reached by the flights of masonry steps at the north and south ends of the courtyard. Along the west, originally a corridor facing the courtyard, runs a set of rooms about ten feet wide with stone-paved floors. From this row of outer rooms or partitioned corridor, with massive lintels door-posts and roof-beams, open a row of five plank-floored chambers each about 28 feet long, 22 feet broad and 11\u00bd feet high, the northmost used for oilman's stores, the second as a school, the third as a dispensary, and the fourth and fifth as a printing press. A roof loft over the upper storey is also used as a printing gallery.\n\nThe west side of the rubbish-strewn worn and battered courtyard shows that the main building, of which the roofless and ragged shell alone remains, stands on a plinth about a foot above the yard and along its eastern front was separated from the yard by a sloping tile-roofed veranda about 70 feet long and 12 feet broad, supported as the sockets show by a line of wooden pillars about twelve feet apart. The roofless shell along the inner edge of this veranda, though in several places crumbled to within a few feet of the ground, shows that the ground floor was divided into three rooms. The door (6 feet 3 inches wide) and side windows (4 feet wide) of the central room remain. The wall of the north room which is little more than a pile of loose stones shows no trace of openings; but gaps for the door and window of the south room remain. Inside of the building in the north stand a big and a little pipal and a bor tree. The centre is open, but the rest is blocked with piles of stone timber iron and other builder's lumber. The masonry of the walls is of rough undressed seabeach stones covered with inch-thick plaster. The outer walls are fairly massive; the inner partitions are so slight as to suggest that the bulk of the weight was borne by wooden pillars. The worn stairs to the north and south of the front courtyard show that they led to the upper storey of this central building. All that is left of this upper storey is in the north where the wall still stands six feet higher than the groove that marks the 14 feet ceiling of the ground rooms.\n\nTo the west of the main building stretches a worn and sloping pavement, about 25' \u00d7 50', with a ten-foot passage running along its west edge. Beyond the passage is a row of upper-storeyed rooms. On the right is a second group. And on the left over a square-cut doorway opening into Gunbow lane, is a third group with roughly ornamented pilasters. The worn plinths of this square-cut gateway suggest that it formed the main entrance to the original building. The pavement and pillar sockets to the west of the main building apparently belong to a portico about 50 feet long by 20 feet broad shading the western door and perhaps furnished with an upper-portico in front of the central upper-chamber which overlooking the lower houses in front would command a view west across the palm gardens and meadows to\nBack Bay. In the north-west corner of the west courtyard is an old stone-ringed circular well.\n\nA room in the ground floor of the house in the north-west corner opens on an open-air passage or gulley 6 feet 6 inches broad between the outer face of the north wall of the main building and a detached enclosing wall about 13 feet 6 inches high. This outer wall runs east to a stair and door which give access to the landing on the north flight of steps in the east yard. Along the south side of the north passage the wall of the main building, which shows traces of a deep Bath-red plastering, varies from about 18 feet to 23 feet in height and has two windows (6' \u00d7 4' and 6 feet from the ground) giving light to the north chamber. The outer or enclosing wall about 13 feet 6 inches high ends in a rounded coping and has its inner face thick-lined with plaster in which are set rough angular chippings of trap or basalt. From the west window of the upper room of the house which gives entrance to the passage the outer enclosing wall is seen to stretch west about 33 yards.\n\nBehind the row of dwellings that fills the west of the inner yard a six-foot passage runs south to Gunbow lane. Along the west side of this passage a row of lofty modern dwellings, standing on old plinths and with lower walls plastered and set with trap chippings, stretch west to a narrow gulley which the maps show to be the original limit of the plot of land. Along the north side of Gunbow lane at a height of about thirteen feet the original enclosing wall may be traced the rough fragments of trap on its outer face showing through layers of yellow wash. In most places the house walls stand on the top of the enclosing wall. But in one or two portions the enclosing wall remains detached with a rounded coping like the north enclosing wall.\n\nOpposite the south end of the main building a modern gate (6' \u00d7 8') in the outer enclosing wall opens from Gunbow lane. Across an open-air passage or gulley choked with lumber an inner door gives entrance to the south room of the main building. Enough of the south gulley is visible to show that in breadth and design it does not differ from the north gulley. This south gulley seems originally to have communicated with the outside by a small door a few yards east of the present gate whose earlier date is shown by the greater wearing of its dripstone. Beyond this small door the open-air gulley ends eastwards in the comparatively modern buildings that hamper the south flight of steps in the front courtyard.\n\nThis old building or enclosure is generally known as M\u00e1pla Por the gated enclosure of the M\u00e1pl\u00e1s that is of the half-Arab Musalm\u00e1ns of the Malab\u00e1r Coast, who, till well into the present century, held the bulk of the coasting or country trade of Bombay. The name of the present owner is M\u00e1pla Chaukaran Keloph Karakuti K\u00e1ka whose agent is a P\u00e1rsi Mr. Dinsha Sorsbji. Mr. Dinsha states that in 1794 Musa of Tellicherry, an ancestor of the present owner, purchased the property from one Muhammad Safi. The size of the central halls, the handsome staircases and court-yard, and still more the strange outer enclosing wall suggest\nthat the building was not intended for a private dwelling or warehouse. Though, perhaps from fear that such a confession might help to a resumption, the people interested deny any knowledge of the fact, the tradition remains that the M\u00e1pla Por was once a public building. An old porter and also the P\u00e1rsi owner of the printing press say: These buildings once were the Sark\u00e1r's and were called the Barracks. At one visit to the M\u00e1pla Por an old Musalm\u00e1n teacher said: The place is called Kot. I think Kot means killa or fort though it is true the building is in no way fortified. A young girl who was by said: It is Kort an English word not Kot. Not a fort but the place papers come from. Others agree it was a Government building and used to be called Aphis. The appearance of the shell of the building, the small number of large rooms, the paved courtyard, and still more the outer open-air passage and lofty enclosing wall favour the view that the building was a Jail and Court House.\n\nThe following extracts from the Bombay Records seem to show beyond reasonable doubt that this ruined shell is the remains of one of the earliest if not the earliest building the English erected in Bombay. Among the liberal schemes which the vigorous mind of Gerald Aungier, who was then the Chief in Surat, devised for improving Bombay, when in 1638 the town and island passed to the Company, was, in January 1671 (Surat Factory Outward Letter Book 1 of 1630-1673, 202), the building of a fair common house wherein may be appointed chambers for the Courts of Justice, warehouses and granaries for corn and ammunition, and prisons for several offenders. By a fair common house Aungier apparently meant quarters for the merchants and writers. Besides this common house Aungier wished that other quarters should be built so that all the Company's servants might be well housed. Counsels of economy from London, backed by the local Bombay opinion that existing houses would suffice, led Aungier somewhat grudgingly to countermand his instructions for building new quarters. Apparently this prohibition extended to the building of the fair common house as part of the Courts and the Jail. Between 1671 and 1673 the building which was already in progress is referred to as the Courts of Justice and the Courts of Judicature (Surat Factory Outward Letter Book 1 of 1630-1673, 217-227). The Courts for which the building was designed were the two Courts of Judicature established by Gerald Aungier in 1670. These Courts, which met regularly once a week, were an inferior Court held by a covenanted officer of the Company assisted by native officers which took cognizance of civil suits under 200 Xeraphins (Rs.140), and a superior Court, where, with the title of Judge of the Courts of Judicature, the Deputy Governor and Council sat and took cognizance of all civil and criminal cases. Except in matters of the gravest necessity the decisions of this superior Court were final and without appeal. It may be conjectured that the centre chamber of the three on the ground floor of the main building was the Court of Appeal, and that in one of the end chambers the inferior and in the other end chamber the superior Court sat in the exercise of their original jurisdiction (Compare Bruce's Annals, II. 271-272). A row of buildings facing the Baz\u00e1r was also completed at the same time of which at least the ground floor was used.\nas cells for prisoners and perhaps the loft for the guard. The buildings were probably pushed on when Aungier was in Bombay (May 1672 - May 1673). They were completed by the close of 1675. Besides accommodating the inferior and superior courts the Court House seems to have been used for the quarterly meetings of the Justices which had hitherto been held in the customs houses of Bombay and Mahim (Bombay Town Materials, III. 3). Before completion, about 1675 when a Judge was appointed, the Court of justice was accommodated in a hired house. Next year, June 1676, as the building of a hospital was declared the chief want of Bombay, the Deputy Governor suggested that the present court house might be turned into a hospital and that the Deputy Governor's house in the Castle should be bought from its owner a Portuguese lady and used as a Court House. The Surat Council approved and the house and ground were bought at Rs. 2400. At first in the opinion of the Surat Council this house was a dear pennyworth, but, after a personal meeting with the Deputy Governor, the Surat Council was satisfied. In October 1676 they wrote: We desire you to take possession of the house in the Castle without delay and to go forward fitting up the present court of judicature as a hospital. Within three months the views of the Bombay Council seem to have undergone a change. On the 24th January 1677 they wrote to the Directors that the buildings in the Castle should not be used as a Court. The Court of Judicature we have built in the Baz\u00e1r is, they add, a far more convenient place for a court being of greater ease for all sorts of people to repair thither and more fitting for prisons as prisoners may beg relief of passers (Sec. Out. L. B. 4 of 1677-1687, 6). This economical practice, which made the prisoners support themselves by begging through the bars of their cells, was long continued in England and is still in force in Goa. More than a year before the letter from Bombay (24th January 1677) was written the Court of Directors had taken Aungier to tax for excessive expenditure on Bombay buildings. On the 17th January 1676 (Surat Factory Out. Letter Book 2 of 1675-76, 25) the President replied: The out-buildings, that is the buildings outside of the Castle, for houses warehouses granary mint-house and Court of Judicature your Council judged absolutely necessary and such as you cannot be without. Yet if you shall not approve thereof your President offers to take them to his own account provided you will please to allow him reasonable rent for the time they have been employed in your service and give him leave hereafter to improve them to the best advantage. This offer of the President seems to have been accepted.\n\nAfter its completion in 1676 this building seems to have continued to be rented as a Court House till 1720. In 1720, part of the property of R\u00e1ma K\u00e1m\u00e1ti, a large house and warehouses occupying the area at the corner of Baz\u00e1r Gate street and Dv\u00e1rk\u00e1d\u00e1s' lane, about 150 to 200 yards south of the site of the old Baz\u00e1r Gate, was purchased for Rs. 6000 and the Court and Town Hall were removed to it. They continued to be held in R\u00e1ma K\u00e1m\u00e1ti's buildings till in 1786 the Court was moved to Hornby House, the present (1894) Great Western Hotel. Between 1720 when it ceased to be used by Government and 1748, Aungier's Court House in Bohora Baz\u00e1r street is entered in the Collector's records as the property of Shivji Dharamset who\nhad probably purchased it after the death of Governor Aungier in 1677. In 1748 Aungier's Court House was transferred by Shivji Dharamset to Muhammad Safi in whose name it remained till in 1803-4 it was transferred to Musa of Tellicherry, an ancestor of the present owner who had purchased it in 1794.\n\nThe great fire of February 1803 destroyed the Baz\u00e1r front or prison portion of the building, the whole of which, since the transfer of the Court House to Baz\u00e1r Gate street in 1720, had been used as a warehouse. The Honourable Mr. Jonathan Duncan, then Governor, in a Memorandum on the Fire, records (Pub. Diary 172 of 1803, 1071-1074) that during the night of the 17th February the front of the large mansion known by the name of Muhammad Safi fell. By the constant application of water to the embers the fire, beyond expectation, was prevented from taking to the next house. Otherwise the conflagration might have been considerably more destructive. The after-part of this house, he adds, which has been purchased by Musa of Tellicherry, still remains standing. It was filled with rice, sugar, and other articles, and during the forenoon of the 19th February very much threatened destruction to the surrounding buildings, especially as the compound was filled with two to three hundred planks. As the Purvoe that appeared on the part of Mammy (Musa's agent) had no means of removing the planks, all who would be at the trouble of carrying them were allowed to take them away. When the greater part of this combustible had been cleared, Mammy the aforesaid agent, who had hitherto appeared to be equally without the means or will to effect anything on his part, pretended that he had got people to remove the remaining deals. This proving not to be the case, as ascertained by Captain Brookes on the spot, the yard was soon cleared of the planks. The remaining danger of the fire was overcome by the exertions of the navy, in the Admiral's presence.\n\nThe statement of houses destroyed in the fire gives the following details: No. 358 held by Muhammad Safi with an area of 3416 square yards and a rental of Rs. 51\u00bd.\n\nThese details of the 1803 conflagration seem to shew that only the Bohora Baz\u00e1r front of the Original Jail was destroyed and that the back part of this line of buildings was saved. This agrees with the present state of the buildings the wood-work and pavement of whose western strip or partitioned corridor seem of the age of the original Court House (1677), and the fittings and wooden flooring of the inner rooms to be partly at least considerably more recent. It further appears that in 1803 the main building in the centre of the enclosure, the original Court House, was not much, if at all, damaged by fire.\n\nAfter the 1803 fire, the Bohora Baz\u00e1r front was repaired and until 1868 the enclosure continued full of warehouses and dwellings. Up to 1868 there were the present east range of upper-storied buildings divided in two by the central east gateway. From the south-east corner there ran west along Gunbow Lane a block of buildings one storey higher. And beyond a gap caused by the south wall of the central court-house stood a second group of buildings inhabited by\nJews. The west end of the square was filled with a row of buildings. And in the north-west of the square facing south was the M\u00e1pla\u2019s dwelling. A row of upper-storied buildings facing east ran parallel to the west row separated from it by a narrow lane. In the centre of the square the main block of upper-storied buildings lay north and south.\n\nThe Times of India of the 24th February 1868 describes how, about one A.M. in the night of the 23rd February 1868, a fire broke out in a dwelling in the ground floor of the buildings to the west of the main central block. From the ground floor the fire spread to the upper floor and from that passed to the main central block. Two of the godowns in the central block were filled with boxes of brandy, which, taking fire, with loud explosions spread the conflagration so rapidly as to endanger the whole neighbourhood. By three o\u2019clock in the morning, but not until the buildings on the west and south-west of the enclosure had been destroyed, two hand fire engines and one steam fire engine, under the energetic supervision of Mr. Edginton the Deputy Superintendent of Police, gained a mastery over the flames. Outside of the enclosure, the tops of some of the houses to the north caught fire but they suffered no material damage. The roofs of the ranges of buildings to the east and south-east were crowded with men who poured water so freely that the dense masses of falling sparks failed to ignite the roofs. By six o\u2019clock in the morning the fire was completely got under. During the rest of the day the upstanding portions of the burning buildings were demolished and the engines were kept at work till a late hour on the heated ruins. Besides the two central ranges the west half of the south or Gunbow lane front, the whole western row of houses, and the M\u00e1pla\u2019s residence in the north-west corner were destroyed. The only portions of the six ranges which were saved were the eastern or Bohora Baz\u00e1r face and its continuation westwards along the eastern portion of the Gunbow Lane front. The aggregate loss was estimated at several lakhs of rupees.\n\nThese details of the 1868 fire show that the present buildings of the M\u00e1pla Por belong to three periods. The front part of the east or Bohora Baz\u00e1r street and south-east or Gunbow lane range belong to the early years of the present century. The surviving portions of the original jail and court house of 1677 are the inner or western face of the east front; the shell of the main central ruin or court house; the open-air passages to the north and south; and the foundations and lower walls of the south-western gateway as well as of certain of the western buildings. The upper portions of the west half of the Gunbow Lane front, the whole of the buildings in the west of the enclosure, and the dwelling or office in the north-west corner are later than the fire of 1868. These details seem to show that the Bohora Baz\u00e1r street front was originally closed and that the central gateway was added in 1803. The original entrance seems to be the gateway at the south-west corner of the enclosure. This gateway led to the west porch and to a court-yard along whose western limit stretched the warehouses and granaries for corn and ammunition of Aungier\u2019s original design. That Aungier\u2019s fair common house ever rose on the top of these warehouses seems doubtful.\nOld Woman's Island.\u2014From very shortly after the establishment of British power in Bombay till the close of the eighteenth century the common name for Lower Colaba, that is for the part of Colaba nearest Bombay, was Old Woman's Island. The earliest reference that has been traced is Fryer's who in 1673 (New Account, 67) mentions the great Malabar Point abutting against Old Woman's Island. A rudely carved red-smearred goddess, a venerable Portuguese dame, a wrinkled fate-reading fisherwoman, an antique mother of harlots have all been invented to explain the name Old Woman's Island. The Portuguese seem to have known the island by no other name than Koluan the Koli hamlet. This, by the dropping of the initial K, Dr. Gerson Da Cunha thinks the British sailor twisted into Oluan or Old Woman. In 1750 Grose (Voyage, I, 58) notices that the origin of the name Old Woman is unknown. A report on the fisher people of Bombay in 1747 (Materials, II, 147) contrasts the rates paid by the Kolis of Moory (Mori) in Warli and by the Woomanys. This though evidently a reference to the Kolis of Colaba can hardly be a corruption of Old Woomanys. It suggests the Hindustani Omani the common Persian and Arab name (compare Briggs' Ferishta, I, 413) for the sea that washes Western India. It seems possible that as the fishers of Mazgaon fish solely within harbour limits while the Colaba fishers have their stakes in the open sea, the Colaba Kolis were known as Al Omanis the deep-sea fishers. It is somewhat against this explanation that no memory of the use of such a name remains.\n\nParel.\u2014See above Section I, page 595.\n\nShri-Gundi is called Malabar Point after the pirates of Dharmapatam, Kotta, and Porka on the Malabar Coast, who, at the beginning of British rule in Bombay, used to lie in wait for the northern fleet in the still water in the lea of the north end of Back Bay. In 1668 so exposed was the trade of Bombay to Malabar pirates and to Shivaji that three small armed ships had to be built as convoys. The name Shri Gundi apparently means the Lucky Stone. Of this lucky stone or needle rock Moore has the following: At the very extremity of Malabar Point is a cleft rock, a fancied yoni, to which numerous pilgrims resort for the purpose of regeneration by the efficacy of a passage through this sacred emblem. The yoni or hole is of considerable elevation among rocks of no easy access in the stormy season incessantly surf-buffeted. Both high and low castes have faith in this sin-expelling rock. Women as well as men pass through the opening. You descend some steps on rugged rocks. Then thrusting your hands in front you ascend head first up the hole. After the feet are lifted from their last support the ascent is very difficult, sometimes\n\n---\n\n1 Dharmapatam is four miles north of Tellicherry; Kotta or Kottakul is fifteen miles south of Tellicherry; and Porka or Purakkat is about ten miles south of Alleppli.\n2 Bruce's Annals, II, 244.\n3 See Captain Dickinson's map of 1812-1816; Hindu Pantheon, 395-397.\nit is impracticable. The baffled devotee has to be helped down again. Moore several times tried to pass. He always failed though his superiors in bulk slipped through with apparent ease. Shiv\u00e1ji about (1660-1670) when discovery was death, is said to have landed at Malab\u00e1r Point and passed through the rock, probably to free him from the haunting presence of the murdered Afzulkh\u00e1n. K\u00e1nhoji Angria (1690-1730) is said to have visited Bombay by stealth to go through the hole in the rock on Malab\u00e1r Point.\u00b9 When (1774-1780) R\u00e1ghaba or Raghub\u00e1thrao Peshwa, an exile from Poona, was living on Malab\u00e1r hill in a lofty tower since removed, he occasionally passed through the holy cleft perhaps to get rid of the ill-luck-bringing ghost of his murdered nephew N\u00e1r\u00e1yanr\u00e1o.\u00b2\n\nNear the Lucky Rock, Moore continues, are (1800-1810) the ruins of a rather elegant temple.\u00b3 It is said with probability to have been blown up with gunpowder by the Portuguese while Bombay was under their flag. Fragments of well-hewn stone are still (1810) to be seen over and around its site having a variety of images sculptured on their surface. Many of the most useful stones have been taken to help the erection in the neighbouring beautiful Br\u00e1hman village of its fine tank and temples. Moore had the site cleared. Some feet underground he found, a good deal mutilated, the same triform head which is the central sculpture in Elephanta. The head was about two feet square and eighteen inches thick. The front face is Brahma, on his right Shiv, to his left Vishnu. The stone is in the India House Museum. It is pictured at plate 81 of Moore's Pantheon.\n\nAnother stone which probably belonged to the Shri Gund\u00ed temple is a well-carved Shesh-N\u00e1r\u00e1yan, that is N\u00e1r\u00e1yan reclining guarded by the hooded snake. It is set on the ground opposite the first or highest passage that leads down to W\u00e1lkeshvar village.\n\n\u00b9 Grose's Voyage to the East Indies, I. 56-57.\n\u00b2 Compare Moore's Hindu Pantheon,
