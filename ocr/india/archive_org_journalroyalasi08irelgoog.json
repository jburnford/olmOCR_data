This arrangement will afford the means of rendering available many valuable contributions, which, notwithstanding their real interest and importance, may not entirely conform to the system on which the quarto publication is founded: and the latter may still be continued whenever the accumulation of matter on subjects more peculiar to its original design shall render any additional volume expedient.\n\nThe octavo publication is styled the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, will be edited at intervals of three months, and we may trust will become a repository for much valuable information, which, consistently with the views of the Society, will thus be communicated to the Public.

By John Edye, Esq., late Master Shipwright of His Majesty's Naval Yard at Trincomali, now in the Department of the Surveyor of the Navy.\u2014Communicated by the late Major-General Sir John Malcolm, G.C.B. K.L.S. M.R.A.S. &c. &c.\n\nRead 1st of June, 1833.\n\nThe following Paper having been referred by the Council of the Royal Asiatic Society to Sir John Malcolm, for his opinion as to its eligibility for insertion in the Printed Transactions of the Society, was returned by that distinguished and lamented individual, with a Letter of which a copy is subjoined, and which will be found to point out, in a very satisfactory manner, the practical value of Mr. Edye's communication.\n\n\"To the Secretary of the Royal Asiatic Society.\n\n\"Sir,\n\n\"Before I comply with the desire of the Council to report on Mr. Edye's Treatise on Indian Vessels, it may be useful to explain how it came into my possession.\n\n\"When on a visit to Chatham, Mr. Edye, who is now employed in His Majesty's dock-yard at that place, shewed me this manuscript; and deeming it very curious, I begged he would allow me to present it to the Royal Asiatic Society, which might, I thought, consider it worthy of a place in its Transactions; not only as it exhibited the actual state of the art of Ship-building in India, but on account of the evidence it contained of that art being at the same stage at which it now is, at a period of the most remote antiquity. Mr. Edye's manuscript appeared to me to possess more value from the remarkable...\"\nvessels of which he gives us an account, illustrated by correct drawings of their construction, are so admirably adapted to the purposes for which they are required, that, notwithstanding their superior science, Europeans have been unable, during an intercourse with India of two centuries, to suggest, or at least to bring into successful practice, one improvement. I may adduce the Masula boats, on the Coast of Coromandel, in proof of this assertion; and, to my knowledge, both talent and skill have laboured in vain to improve the shape and construction of those vessels.\n\n\"The Council having referred this paper to me, I shall shortly state its contents, and my opinion of its value.\n\n\"Mr. Edye, by a residence of five years in India as His Majesty's Master-shipwright in Ceylon, had singular opportunities of becoming perfectly informed on the subject of which he treats in this Memoir. He describes in a clear and concise manner the various vessels of the coasts of Coromandel, Malabar, and Ceylon; which he classifies as follows:\n\nCatamarans . . . . . of Ceylon, the Malabar and Coromandel coasts, &c.\nCanoes . . . . . . . of Point De Galle and the Malabar coast.\nJang\u00e1r . . . . . . . of the Malabar coast, for rivers.\nPamb\u00e1n Manch\u00e9 . Snake Boat of Cochin.\nBandar Manch\u00e9 . . Boats used to load ships and carry goods on the coast of Malabar.\nMasula Boats . . . Used chiefly at Madras in lading and discharging cargoes, and carrying passengers to and from ships in the Roads.\n\nMangalore Manch\u00e9\nCalicut Manch\u00e9\nPanyani Manch\u00e9\n\nThese are coast boats, of construction suited to the places from which they are named.\n\nPatam\u00e1r . . . . . Vessels employed in the coasting-trade from Bombay to Ceylon.\n\nArab Dow . . . . . Vessels employed in the trade between the Red Sea, the Arabian coast, the Gulph of Persia, and the Indian coasts of Cutch, Gujar\u00e1t, and Malabar. These Dows are also used in the Persian Gulph, for the purposes of war and piracy. They are always manned by Arabs.\n\nBaggalah, or Budgerow\n\nThese vessels trade from Cutch, Gujar\u00e1t, Malabar coast, to the Gulph of the coast of Arabia, and Indian vessels, and called Lascars.\nD\u014dni . . . . . . . . . A vessel used in the coasting-trade of Coromandel, from which they often carry cargoes to Ceylon and the Gulph of Man\u00e1r.\n\nBoatila Manch\u00e9 . . . Used in the Gulph of Man\u00e1r and the southern parts of the Peninsula, and trading from these to Ceylon.\n\n\"The shape and materials employed in the construction of the vessels are minutely stated by Mr. Edye; and the well-executed plans and sections of each class, by which their descriptions are illustrated, will, I am assured, attract the particular notice of the Council; to whom I have no hesitation in stating, that I deem Mr. Edye's Treatise highly valuable; and am of opinion, that while it merits attention from those engaged in the study of nautical science, it must be acceptable to antiquarians and philosophers, who seek, by comparisons of the works of man in various ages, to draw conclusions as to the progress of human art. And, assuredly, no branch of science merits more of their consideration, than that which enabled him to have intercourse with distant nations, and through such means to advance knowledge and civilization!\n\n\"I am, Sir, your obedient, humble servant,\n\n(Signed) \"John Malcolm.\"\n\nMR. EDYE'S PAPER.\n\nAmong all the numerous vessels of every class and description which traverse the ocean, there is a peculiarity of form and construction, intended to meet the various localities of the ports or seas in which they are navigated: and perhaps in no part of the globe is this principle more fully displayed than in the Indian Seas, and on the coasts of the Southern Peninsula of India, including the Island of Ceylon, where the nature and change of the seasons, the monsoons, and the navigation of the seas and rivers, are singularly well provided for, by the truly ingenious and efficient means adopted by the natives in the formation of their rude, but most useful vessels. I shall endeavour to describe these more explicitly, with the aid of Sketches and Designs, the correctness of which I have been most scrupulous to ensure.\nCATAMARANS.\n\nThe first which I shall describe, will be the Catamarans of the Island of Ceylon, which, like those of Madras, and other parts of the coasts of the Peninsula, are formed of three logs of timber, and are used by the natives for similar purposes: the timber preferred for their construction is of the dip wood, or cherne-maram (pine-tree). Their length is from twenty to twenty-five feet, and breadth two and a half to three and a half feet, secured together by means of three spreaders and cross-lashings, through small holes; the centre log being much the largest, with a curved surface at the fore-end, which tends and finishes upwards to a point. The side-logs are very similar in form; but smaller, having their sides straight, and fitted to the centre-log, as will be better seen and understood by the accompanying Sketch*.\n\nThese well-known floats are generally navigated by two men; but sometimes by one only, with the greatest skill and dexterity; as they think nothing of passing through the surf on the beach at Madras, and at other parts of the coast, while boats of the country could not live on the waves; and at sea, they are propelled through the water to a ship on the coast, when boats of the best construction and form would swamp. In the monsoons, when a sail can be got on them, a small outrigger is placed at the end of two poles, as a balance, with a bamboo mast and yard, and a mat or cotton-cloth sail, all three parts of which are connected; and when the tack and sheet of the sail are let go, it all falls fore and aft, alongside; and being light, it is easily managed. In carrying a press of sail, they are trimmed by the balance-lever, by going out on the poles, so as to keep the log on the surface of the water, and not impede its velocity, which, in a strong wind, is very great. They are frequently met with ten or fifteen miles off the southern part of the Island of Ceylon, and will convey any letter or despatch to the shore with safety: but I cannot say much about its dryness, as the man who takes it has nothing but a pocket made from the leaf of the areca-tree (A. catechu, Linn.), which is tied round his waist, and is the only article about him. These people may be considered almost amphibious, and are the persons who are employed in the pearl-fishery. They are said to remain under water for fifteen minutes; but this I have never heard from themselves, or could find to be correct, as five minutes is the greatest time that has come to my knowledge\u2020. They certainly think nothing of\n\n* See Plate I.\n\n\u2020 In an Account of the Ceylon Pearl Fisheries, by Captain James Stuart, inserted in the Trans. R. A. S. Vol. III. Part 3. the author states, from personal observation, that the longest time which the divers can remain under water is from eighty-four to eighty-seven seconds.\ngoing down to a depth of forty feet; and will bring up a rupee even, if thrown into the sea at that depth.\n\nTHE POINT-DE-GALLE CANOE,\n\nor Market Boat, is a boat formed from a single stem of d\u00fcp-wood, or pine varnish-tree. They are from eighteen to thirty feet in length; from eighteen inches to two and a half feet in breadth; and from two to three feet deep; exclusive of the wash-board, which is about ten inches broad, and sewed to the gunwale by coir-yarns, with loose coir-padding on the joints, in the same manner as the other boats used in India are sewed together, which will be more fully described hereafter. These boats are fitted with a balance-log at the end of the bamboo outrigger, having the mast, yard, and sail, secured together; and, when sailing, are managed in a similar way to the Catamaran. Vessels passing the southern part of the Island of Ceylon are generally boarded by these boats, even at the distance of twenty to twenty-five miles from shore. They will sail at the rate of ten miles an hour in strong winds, which are generally prevalent there; and, with a crew of five men, will carry a cargo of fruit, fish, and vegetables, which are the greatest luxuries to passengers, on making the land after a long voyage from England, Bengal, or Bombay. The details of these very interesting vessels will be better understood by reference to the Sketches in Plate II.*\n\nCANOE OF THE MALABAR COAST.\n\nFrom Cape Comorin to Calicut, on the western side of the Peninsula, the coast abounds with fish, which is generally taken with the hook and line by the natives of the fishing-villages, in a small canoe\u2020, the best description of which is formed from angeley-wood\u2021; but the inferior\n\n* A model of one of these curious boats is in the Museum of the Royal Asiatic Society, to which it was presented by Mrs. Perring. The Society is also in possession of a model of a boat having two outriggers, with balance-logs, used by the natives of some of the islands in the Eastern Archipelago: this model was received from H. J. Domis, Esq., F.M.R.A.S., His Netherlands' Majesty's Resident at Sourabaya, in Java. The natives of New Holland appear to use a similar contrivance, but of a more simple construction, as exhibited in a model in the Society's possession. The Rev. Richard Walter, in his account of Lord Anson's Voyage, gives a minute account, illustrated by an engraving, of what he terms \"a flying pros,\" used at the Ladronne Islands; which is the same, in most essential particulars, as the vessel described above by Mr. Edye. (Vide Walter's Account of Anson's Voyage round the World. 4to. London, 1748. p. 339.)\u2014Ed.\n\n\u2020 See Plate III. No. 1.\n\n\u2021 Anjeri\u2014Artocarpus hirsuta. (?)\nsort, of cherne-maram: they are cut out from the solid tree, and are from eight to twenty feet in length, and from one and a half to two feet in breadth; the depth being about one, or one foot and a half. They are managed with much dexterity by the natives, with a scull-paddle. On the backwater of Cochin, and on the river's mouth, they are employed in great numbers in taking the saire fish or country salmon, &c. The largest sort of boats are used for the conveyance of rice and merchandise on the numerous rivers which disembogue themselves into the back-water, to the extent of 150 miles, parallel to the sea-coast. At times, these boats are converted into the\n\nJANG\u00c1R,\n\nor Double Platform Canoe*, by placing a floor of boards across two boats, with a bamboo railing which extends from ten to twelve feet fore and aft, and sixteen feet long; and when these boats are thus formed into rafts, cattle and burdensome articles are conveyed across the rivers; as also the native regiments, with all their followers, horses, bullocks, baggage, bandies (carts), &c. It appears somewhat probable that the idea of the pontoons now in use at Chatham was taken from these vessels, as those constructed by the engineers there perfectly resemble those used by the natives in India.\n\nPAMB\u00c1N MANCH\u00c9,\n\nor Snake-Boat of Cochint\u2020, is a canoe of great length: they are used by opulent natives and Europeans, as boats for the conveyance and despatch of persons on the numerous rivers and back-water, particularly on that between Cochin, Allipey, and Quilon, which is about eighty miles southward; and on that which runs to Palipact and Trichoir; the former place being about twenty, the latter about sixty miles to the northward. These boats are from thirty to sixty feet in length, without any regard to breadth or depth, as they are worked from the solid tree. The broadest do not exceed three feet. Those of the R\u00faj\u00e1 and officers of state are very handsomely fitted up, and carved in the most fantastical manner: they are made very neat, and even splendid, with painting, gilding, &c. The largest boats are sculled by about twenty men, double-banked; and when pressed, their velocity is surprising, as much as a mile in five minutes. I have myself been sculled, in one of them, a distance of forty-eight miles in six hours. These boats are peculiarly adapted to the rivers; for it frequently occurs, that in the dry season there\n\n* See Plate III. No. 2.  \n\u2020 See Plate IV.\nare sand-banks perfectly dry, nearly a hundred yards in breadth, over which they must be drawn by the strength of the few men who are in them; the smaller size having only six rowers and a coxswain. Those natives who can afford the expense, have the cabin neatly fitted up, with venetian-blinds on the sides; but generally the cuscus, or grass-mat, is substituted. This boat is formed from the angeley-wood, which is very durable, if kept oiled.\n\nCOCHIN BANDAR-MANCHE,\n\nor Canoe of Burthen*.\u2014These canoes are cut and formed from the largest and softest timber of the forest. They are from twenty to fifty feet in length; their breadth and depth being proportioned to the full size of the tree, so as to reduce its dimensions as little as possible. They will carry about eighteen tons' burthen, and are made from three to five inches thick at the bottom; but at the top of the side, or gunwale, about one and a half to two inches, with a proportionate increase of thickness at the extreme ends, to protect the end-grain of the wood, and withstand any shock that they may meet with. At the distance of about five feet on the inside there are ribs about six inches broad, projecting about two inches from the side of the boat, for the purpose of giving support and strength to the body of the canoe. These boats may be considered valuable for the service of the port at which they are used; and notwithstanding their heavy appearance, they are very buoyant, and go very fast through the water. In one of about thirty-five feet long, with six men and a tindal (coxswain), I passed the Minden's (the admiral's ship) barge, which had twelve men on board; and in a distance of four miles to that ship's anchorage, I gained on them by time about twenty minutes, although there was a strong sea-breeze and swell against us.\n\nAt Cochin, these boats are used for the purpose of conveying various articles of burthen and water to the ships in the roads. This is well known to the homeward-bound ships from Bombay, and those bound from the Red Sea and Arabia to Calcutta; as they generally call off this port, for supplies of every sort. Two of the larger size were sent, by order of Commissioner Upton, to Trincomali, for the use of the dockyard; and after being constantly used during four years, for the purpose of carrying stones, bricks, sand, coral, &c., across the bay, they were left, when the establishment was broken up, in a sound and complete state; which circumstance may be attributed to their having had copper sheets\n\n* See Plate V.\nput on their bottoms, to protect them from the worms. The expense of each canoe was about eighteen pounds sterling; and they would convey from twelve to twenty tons, each boat.\n\nIt would be worthy of consideration, and a great service to the navy, to have one of these boats, with a native crew, attached to each ship; for the purpose of saving the seamen, and ship's-boats, from exposure to the intense heat of the sun, the bad effects of which are so very sensibly felt by Europeans at all times.\n\nTHE MADRAS MASULA MANCHE\n\nIs formed with a flat bottom, for the purpose of taking the beach in the surf, when European boats cannot approach it. These boats are beached in the third surf; and taken most completely out of the water, on the immediate receding of the swell, by natives who are at all times stationed there by the Government, and belong to the Master-Attendant's department.\n\nThe planks which form these boats are sewed together with coir-yarns, crossing the seams over a wadding of coir, which presses on the joints, and prevents leakage. By this peculiar means of security, the vessel is rendered pliable, and yields to the shock which she receives on taking the ground; whilst boats with framed timbers and planks, nailed or treenail-fastened, would be broken to pieces, from the heavy surf, that at times runs as high as from six to ten feet. The Catamaran is kept in attendance, as a life-preserved, in the event of any accident to the masula-boat, by upsetting, or in case of any of the Europeans being washed out by the sea.\n\nThe masula-boat receive their cargoes and passengers from the ships outside the surf, and land them in perfect safety, provided the crew be treated with civility\u2014otherwise, they will not fail to moisten the offender, to such a degree as to show the passengers that they are in their power, and make them objects of derision to the men on the beach. These boats are rowed by twelve men, in double banks, with bamboo paddles; that is, a board about ten inches broad and fourteen inches long, fixed at the end of a bamboo. They are steered by two tindals (coxswains); and two men are constantly kept to bale out the water; from which employment they are promoted to the paddle, or bow-oar; when they fall off, in rotation, to be a tindal or steersman*. The\n\n* The steersman gives time by a song, which is sung by all the boatmen; and according as its modulations are slow or quick, the oars are plied. These modulations are regulated by the waves, as they may be slow or rapid.\ndimensions of the masula-boat are from thirty to thirty-five feet in length, ten to eleven feet in breadth, and seven to eight feet in depth: the details of their form will be understood from the drawing*.\n\nMANGALORE MANCH\u00c9\u2020\n\nIs a flat-bottomed boat of burthen, about twenty-five to thirty-five feet long, six to seven feet broad, and four to five feet deep. It is formed to meet the river, which is very shallow and flat; and to land the cargoes of the patam\u00e1rs, which are discharged and loaded at the mouth of the rivers. These boats are sewed together similar to the masula-boat and other native vessels: they are forced along by bamboo poles; as the water is not more than from six to ten feet deep, except in the southwest monsoon, when the rapids swell, and the whole of the river is considered impassable; and at this period all the vessels are taken to the shore and laid up.\n\nCALICUT MANCH\u00c9\u2021\n\nIs a boat very similar to that of Mangalore, with the exception only of a raking stern, for the purpose of taking the beach; as the port of Calicut is open to the coast, and there is no river. These boats are propelled by the paddle and sail, and generally carry eight men: they are much employed in watering and completing the sea-stock of ships homeward-bound; also in loading ships with pepper, timber, &c., for Bombay; and in shipping the produce of the forests of Canara and Malabar, for the naval yard of the East-India Company; all of which is rafted off to vessels called dows, boatalas, patam\u00e1rs, &c., hereafter described.\n\nPANYANI MANCH\u00c9\u00a7\n\nIs a coasting boat, of about fifty feet long, ten to twelve feet broad, and five to seven feet deep. It is framed with timbers and planks; which are sewed together, as before described. The timbers are about four feet asunder; and on them, inside, some few planks are placed as bands and\n\ncession. I remember, on one occasion, when a passenger of rank shewed impatience at this noisy song, the boatmen were desired to cease; but the steersman refused compliance with the order, saying, that without his song he would not be answerable for the safety of the passenger.\u2014(Note by Sir J.Malcolm.)\n\n* See Plate VI. \u2020 See Plate VII. \u2021 See Plate VIII. \u00a7 See Plate IX.\nclamps, which are nailed to the frame. These vessels are very rudely put together; and not of much importance, either in form or construction. During the south-west monsoon, or from June to November, they are laid up at Baipur river for safety, and are only used in the fine-weather season. They carry the productions of the coco-nut tree, viz. coir*, copera\u2020, cajan\u2021, jageri\u00a7, oil, and arrac||, to Cochin and Mangalore; and, from these parts, rice, cloth, salt, &c. These vessels keep along shore, and take advantage of the sail in rowing. They have generally from eight to ten men, who are fishermen, and of the Mopila caste\u00b6.\n\nTHE PATAM\u00c1RS**\n\nAre a class of vessels which may be considered the best in India; as they sail remarkably well, and stow a good cargo. They belong principally to Bombay merchants, and carry on the whole of the coasting-trade to that port. They are grab-built; that is, with a prow stern, which is the same length as the keel; and the dimensions of the large class are seventy-six feet six inches in length, twenty-one feet six inches in breadth, eleven feet nine inches in depth, and about two hundred tons' burthen. They are planked with teak, upon jungle-wood frames; and are really very handsome vessels, being put together in the European manner, with nails, bolts, &c.: and their bottoms are sheathed with inch-board, and a layer of chunam mixed with coco-nut oil and a portion of damar (country rosin): this is a very durable substance, and a great preservative to the plank against worms.\n\nSome of the smaller class of these vessels, of about sixty tons' burthen, are sewed together with coir, as other native boats are. The small class has one, and the large class two masts, with the latteen-sail; the foremast raking forward, for the purpose of keeping the ponderous yard clear, when it is raised or lowered. The yard is slung at one-third of its length; the tack of the sail is brought to the stern-head, through a\n\n* Coir is the husk of the coco-nut (Cocos nucifera), from which rope is made.\n\u2020 Copera is the inside or fruit of the nut, from which oil is expressed.\n\u2021 Cajan is the leaf of the tree (Corypha umbraculifera), which is used for covering of houses; also for books, and various other purposes.\n\u00a7 Jageri is a kind of sugar, which is made from the toddy or juice of the Palm.\n|| Arrac is a strong spirit, distilled from the toddy taken from the top of\n\nA s of Musalmans, descendants of the first Arabian settlers on the\nof the peninsula; and who marrying the daughters of the country, ob-\nI m of Mopillai, or \"sons-in-law,\" corrupted by Europeans into\n\n\u2014ED.\nfixed block; and the sheet hauled aft at the side, as usual. The hauyard is a pendent and treble block, from the mast-head aft to midships; thus acting as a back-stay for the mast's security, together with about two pairs of shrouds. These vessels generally export salt from Bombay to the coast, and take back coir, rice, coco-nuts, copera, oil, timber, sandalwood, pepper, and various articles, the production of the coast. They are navigated with much skill, by men of the Mopila caste and other Musalm\u00e1ns; and have a crew of ten or twelve men, and a tindal, who are good pilots and navigators of the coast from Bombay to Cape Comorin; generally speaking, honest and trustworthy; and very respectful to Europeans.\n\nTHE ARAB DOW*\n\nIs a vessel of about one hundred and fifty to two hundred and fifty tons' burthen, by measurement; grab-built, with ten or twelve ports; about eighty-five feet long, from stem to stern; twenty feet nine inches broad; and eleven feet six inches deep. Of late years, this description of vessel has been built at Cochin, on the coast of Malabar, most perfectly, in the European style. These vessels have a great rise of floor; are calculated for sailing with small cargoes; and are fully prepared, by internal equipment, for defence, with decks, hatchways, ports, poop-deck, &c., as shewn by the sketch, which, it will be seen, is that of a vessel of war: many of them are sheathed, on two-and-a-half-inch plank bottoms, with one-inch board, and the preparation of chunam and oil, as before described, which is called galgal, put between the planks and sheathing-board, causing the vessel to be very dry and durable, and preventing the worm from attacking the bottom.\n\nThe worm is one of the greatest enemies in India to timber in the water, while the white-ant is as much so out of it. On the outside of the sheathing-board there is a coat of white-wash, made from the same articles as that between the sheathing and planks; which coat is renewed every season they put to sea. These vessels have generally one mast, and a latteen-sail: the yard is the length of the vessel aloft; and the mast raking forward, for the purpose of keeping this ponderous weight clear, in raising and lowering. The tack of the sail is brought to the stern-head, and sheets aft in the usual way; the hauyards lead to the taffrail, having a pendent and treble purchase-block, which becomes the back-stay, to support the mast when the sail is set: this, with three pairs of shrouds, completes the rigging; which is very simple, the whole being of coir-rope.\n\nSeveral of these vessels have been fitted as brigs, after their arrival\n\n* See Plate XI.\nin Arabia; and armed by the Arabs for commerce in the Arabian Gulf, as piratical vessels: they are too powerful for the Bombay marine-brigade generally one voyage in the season, to the advantage of the north-east monsoon to come to return with an exchange cargo. They preserves, Shir\u00e1z-wine, and horses; and take nuts, oil, timber, damar, &c., the various articles manufacture, and, from Bombay, European The trade of this part of the country is very tending from All\u00e1pey, the southernmost port to Bombay: but all the trade to Bengal is are called \"Country Traders,\" from the The Arabs are a powerful, well-grown, acute and intelligent in trade. They usually Bengal in perfect safety, and with great skill Captain Collier and his officers, of the J had the trial cruise with the Im\u00e1m of Mascara.\n\nTHE BAGGALA, or BAGGAL\n\nNavigates the Indian seas from the Gulf most ancient vessels there to be met with from stern to taffrail, is about seventy-five feet, and the depth in hold eleven feet, one hundred and fifty tons' burthen. The extraordinary equipment of these vessels is from the period of Alexander the Great: on the after-part or right-aft of the stern and have their poop-decks with a round stem abaft the centre or middle of the vessel: the proportion to their length, with a sharp rising floor rakes very little more than the stern-post. However, will be better understood by a referent These vessels are constructed with timbers nail and trenail fastened, in the most rude manner. The topside above the deck is barricadoed.\n\n* This has never happened, but when in great unsupported.\u2014(Note by Sir J. Malcolm.) See Plate XII.\nthe timbers, which run up to about eight feet from the deck; and when they have no cargo on board, this barricado is removed.\n\nThey have only one mast; with a huge yard made from two spars, the small ends lashed together; and a latteen sail, the tack of which goes to the stern-head, as in the other vessels before described: they generally trade like the Dows; and are navigated by Arabs and the people of Cutch.\n\nThis singular and rude vessel, as well as the Arab Dow, is peculiarly adapted to the coasts of Arabia and the Red Sea, which are subject to periodical winds, during which these vessels are navigated with much ease.\n\nTHE DONI *\n\nof the Coromandel coast is a huge vessel of the ark-like form, about seventy feet long, twenty feet broad, and twelve feet deep; with a flat-bottom or keel-part, which at the broadest place is seven feet; and at the fore- and after-parts of the vessel it breaks into ten inches, which is the siding of the stem and stern-post. The fore- and after-bodies are similar in form, from midships. Their light draught of water is about four feet; and when loaded, about nine feet. These rude unshapely vessels trade from Madras and the coast to the Island of Ceylon; and many of them to the Gulf of Man\u00e1r, as the water is shoal between Ceylon and the southern part of the Continent. They have only one mast, with a lug-sail; and are navigated from land to land, and coastwise, in the fine season only.\n\nIt may not be uninteresting to know the means used, by the people who navigate these vessels, to find the rate of current in the Bay of Bengal, which is very great at the change of the season or monsoon, as much as sixty miles in twenty-four hours. When they are off a port, in a calm, they throw a handful of sand or shells, and feathers, into the calm sea; and by the drifting of the feathers on the surface, and sinking of the sand or shells, a calculation of the rate of current is formed, and they anchor off the coast accordingly.\n\nThe anchor is made, in the most simple way imaginable, by lashing together three crooked branches of a tree, which are then loaded with heavy stones; and their cable is formed from coir-yarns. In fact, the whole equipment of these rude vessels, as well as their construction, is the most coarse and un-seaworthy that I have ever seen, and far behind those of any other part of India.\n\n* See Plate XIII.\nTHE BOATILA MANCH\u00c9*\n\nof the Island of Ceylon, which navigates the Gulf of Man\u00e1r, and the southern part of the Peninsula of India. This boat, which is about fifty to sixty feet in length, sixteen to eighteen feet in breadth, and eight to ten feet in depth, has more of the European form than any of the Indian-built vessels that are met with. The after-part shews the origin to be of Portuguese construction, as it is very similar to that of many of the boats still in use by the people of that country; which are said to be of the same shape as the vessel in which Vasco de Gama sailed to India.\n\nThey have a deck fore and aft; and are built with all sorts of jungle-wood, in a very rough manner, and fastened with nails and bolts. They are equipped with one mast, which inclines forward, and a square lug-sail; also a small bowsprit, at about the angle of 45\u00b0, with a sort of jib fore-sail, one pair of shrouds, and a back-stay, which completes the rigging. These vessels carry on the trade of the island across the Gulf. The exports are, rice, tobacco, &c.; and the imports, cloth.

II.\u2014Remarks on the School System of the Hind\u00fas. By Captain Henry Harkness, Secretary to the Royal Asiatic Society, late Secretary to the College of Fort St. George, &c. &c.\n\nThe following remarks refer more particularly to the Southern Peninsula of India; but they may perhaps be considered to apply equally, with regard to her ancient institutions of this nature, to India in general; as the Southern Peninsula has undergone, comparatively, but little change from foreign conquest and domination.\n\nThe system of education throughout the peninsula being nearly the same, whatever may be the language or shade of difference in the people of any particular part or nation, an exposition of that which is followed by one portion of its inhabitants may, with some allowances, which a few observations will explain, be considered as applicable to the whole. I shall therefore select the Tamil, or the School of that nation or people of the South whose vernacular language is the Tamil.\n\nIn almost every village, the schoolmaster is a member of the community. A manie and pizhakadai, or house and back-yard, are given to him by the village. He is allowed to exact fees from his scholars, which, with the presents that custom has established as due to him from the parents, at particular periods and on particular occasions, form the sources of his emolument.\n\nThe school is open to every S\u00fadra and Br\u00e1hmana boy* of the village; but not to boys of inferior or stranger tribes, unless by the sufferance of the community, and generally on the payment of a small monthly stipend, or the performance of some particular service, by the parents of the boys so admitted.\n\nThe hours of attendance at school are from sun-rise to sun-set; allowing one hour at mid-day, for refreshment or repose.\n\nA boy is first taken to school when he has attained his fifth year. The period of his quitting it is uncertain; but to enter him as a votary of Sarasvati, the Goddess of Learning, is considered a duty too sacred to be neglected, even by the poorest of the S\u00fadra tribes.\n\nThe sounds of the vowels and consonants, first separately and then combined, being taught, to which considerable attention is paid in order to ensure a just pronunciation, the boy is instructed to write or draw, in a bed of sand, the letter or sign representing these sounds; and thus, by a reciprocity of action between sign and sound, to fix them both in his memory.\n\n* The four tribes or castes are, the Br\u00e1hmans, Kshatriyas, Vaisyas, and S\u00fadras. All without this pale are considered impure; and among these are included Europeans, and all other foreigners.\nWe may suppose a class of ten boys seated in a palm-book in his hand, on the leaves of which the alphabet are engraved; and with a bed of sand before them, of about half an inch in depth. The master, having a similar bed of sand before him, gives out the sign, smooths the sand by rubbing his hand over it, the same again; and continues this repetition until he is able to draw the letter as well, or nearly so, as the boy goes on to the next letter; and in the same manner the alphabet, and all the various combinations.\n\nThe boys are now transferred to what may be called the or that in which the little treatises on Ethics, Logic, and Dr. John, is to be found in the Asiatic Researches. These series of Maxims, intended to infuse a moral sentiment, to bend the mind to an observance of the laws of society. They are in metre, and in the learned dialect of India, with an interpretation from the master or monitor. By the aid of the rhythm, the aphorism is fixed in the memory, while its analytical meaning is left for the period.\n\nThe two first parts of Arithmetic are now introduced, and Grain Measure; the former commencing with the unit. These the boy acquires much more easily than letters, with the help of the bed of sand; and when he commences to learn the use of the stylus, he writes with an iron pen. To the acquirement of these moral lessons, in which the religion of the country is less inculcated, and to the prosecution of the sciences, lead him through Multiplication, Subtraction, Addition of Numbers, and Fractions, his time at this period is employed.\n\nWe must now suppose him to have attained the age of nine years, or between this and twelve, many leave their parents are so poor as to require the aid of the master. In cases where the master is a S\u00fadra, all the children seldom have an opportunity of acquiring further knowledge; they are now put under the care of a Br\u00e1hman, to whom they are sent, and to prosecute the studies appropriate to their age. The boys, however, are too poor to allow of their being educated.\nto the purposes of education; and with the little they have acquired, and without learning more of the Sanscrit than to repeat in that language a few phrases necessary to them in the performance of their religious ceremonies, they either assist their parents in their avocations, or seek some other employment by which to gain a livelihood. It does occur, in some cases, that Br\u00e1hmana boys have not this degree of education given them, but the instances are very rare; for if an orphan, and though his parents may have been the only Br\u00e1hmans in the village, or strangers in it, he is sure to find, unless perhaps in times of great calamity, such as war, pestilence, or famine, some among the inferior tribe, or S\u00fadras, who will consider it a duty to afford him this degree of instruction. It is also worthy of remark, that all instruction from one Br\u00e1hman to another in the Sanscrit, or through the medium of that language, is gratuitous. Of the other Br\u00e1hmana boys whose necessities have not this controul over them, some pursue their studies with a view to public employment, and to general intercourse with the world; others with a view to the priesthood, or to scientific and metaphysical attainments;\u2014the former being now distinguished by the term Lowkika; the latter, by that of Vaidika.*\n\nTo return to our school. From Arithmetic, the boy is taught to read, and, as far as his memory will serve him, to learn by heart two vocabularies of synonyms; and then to read and analyse the P\u00far\u00e1nas, or other metrical versions of fabulous history, or of praises to their several deities; and, last of all, Grammar, Prosody, and metrical composition. The following are the fees exacted by the masters of the Tamil Schools.\n\n1st, Pr\u00e1doshas.\u2014The thirteenth and fourteenth days of the new and of the waning moon are said to be unpropitious to learning; and, therefore, that they ought to be kept as days of relaxation. Custom has however, in some measure, got the better of this rule. On the thirteenth day, an examination in writing takes place, which usually lasts till four o'clock, when the boys are allowed to leave school; and, as they have the remainder of the evening to themselves, the fee the master exacts on these occasions is called a pr\u00e1dosha, a Sanscrit term for 'evening.' The value of these pr\u00e1doshas, which are intended as a remuneration to the master for his extra labours, and of which of course there will be two in each lunar month, is estimated at about one penny.\n\n2d, Pazhamp\u00e1dam.\u2014On the fourteenth day, an examination takes place of the lessons the boys have been taught during the preceding part of each fortnight; for which the master exacts the pazhamp\u00e1dam, or 'old-lesson fee,' which is in amount about the same as the preceding.\n\n3d, Yennai, or Oil.\u2014On every Saturday, the boy takes, for the use of\n\n*vkika; lit. \"a man of the world:\" Vaidika, \"a man of learning or science.\"\nthe master, a small measure of oil, of about half-pence.\n\n4th, *Vir\u00e1tis*.\u2014These are made of the leaves or dried leaves, beaten into cakes, and dry fuel; and every boy is expected to bring monthly value of which will be about a p\n\n5th, *Olais*.\u2014These are the palm-leaves written with an iron pen, and which are sum allowed monthly for them is about a\n\n6th, *Vidumurai*, Relief or Play-days.\u2014the master on these, for the loss of the passes from one stage to another in his education interest of the former.\n\nThe monthly rate of these fees from estimated as follows:\u2014\n\n*Pr\u00e1doshas*, or evening fees . . . . . . . . . .\n*Pazhamp\u00e1dams*, or old-lesson ditto . . . . . . . . .\n*Yennai*, or oil ditto . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n*Vir\u00e1tis*, or fuel ditto . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n*Olais*, or palm-leaves' ditto . . . . . . . . . .\n*Vidumurai*, or play-days' ditto . . . . . . . . .\n\nThese are either paid in kind; or a compensation by the parents or friends of the boys.\n\nThe following are the presents which are given to the master:\u2014\n\n1st, On entering the school, a rupee, or\n2d, On commencing any new book, about this present to the master in the morning; he presents him with a quantity of sweetmeats, which master distributes among his scholars, and day to play. The morning present is, of course, to carry on the boy through the different stages, the afternoon one, to excite the boys to enter.\n\n3d, On commencing Arithmetic, a rupee, or\n4th, On commencing to learn to write\n5th, On commencing any of the *P\u00far\u00e1n*\n6th, For the *Dusserah* Festival, the same\n7th, For the several other festivals durin\n8th, On days of festivity in the boy's family, from a half to one rupee generally, on each occasion.\n\n9th, On a marriage, or any particular occasion of rejoicing in the master's family, from a rupee to a rupee and a half.\n\n10th, On the boy's finishing his education, and quitting the school, the same.\n\nThe estimated amount of the presents and of the fees for each year, on account of each boy, will be from fifteen to sixteen shillings; the total cost of his education, inclusive of the occasional presents, if he remain at school for eight years, will be about seven pounds; and the whole of the emoluments of the schoolmaster, supposing him to have a school of twenty-five boys for eight years, will be something less than twenty-two pounds per annum.\n\nThis, however, is, on the whole, too favourable a view of the condition of a village schoolmaster. Where the inhabitants are generally wealthy, the amount of the presents will often far exceed what has been mentioned; but, on the contrary, where they are poor, it will decrease in a much greater proportion; and sometimes even the monthly fees are not paid, so that many masters do not realise annually a third of this amount.\n\nIt will be observed, that, throughout this system, memory is, except in a few instances, the only power of the mind that is brought into action; that the whole of the superstructure is, in a scientific point of view, a sort of airy fabric; that Grammar, the basis from which it ought to rise, is left to be learned at a period when few have an opportunity of acquiring it; that the principle of analysis is pursued almost to the entire exclusion of that of synthesis; and that the whole being in metre, or song, its general tendency is to give the mind a light and imaginative turn, and to leave its better energies unexercised and dormant.\n\nThe First Parts, or as far as the Moral Lessons of Auvaiyar, are most esteemed by the natives generally: but, of late years, the incompetency of the schoolmasters has been such, that few are able to instruct their scholars in the meaning of these phrases, and the only object almost of their acquirement is therefore defeated. Of this, the Hind\u00fas are fully sensible; and they would gladly have availed themselves of a system which a former Government of Madras was about to establish, for the better education of their children. But, the much-lamented Governor died; and Education, among the Hind\u00fas of the Southern Peninsula of India, was destined to know that it had lost a friend.\nART. III.\u2014Dissertation on the River Indus. By the late Captain James McMurdo, of the Hon. East-India Company's Military Service on the Bombay Establishment.\u2014Communicated by Lieut. Colonel Edward Frederick, M.R.A.S., Commissary-General of Bombay, &c. &c.\n\nThe following, from Colonel Frederick, bears such honourable testimony to the character and merits of the much-lamented author of the accompanying Dissertation, that the Council deems it highly deserving of being recorded.\n\n\"To the Secretary of the Royal Asiatic Society.\n\n\"Sir,\n\n\"Bombay, Sept. 20, 1833.\n\n\"The original of the accompanying Manuscript fell into my hands some weeks since; and in justice to the lamented and able individual who had been engaged on the spot for a series of years in its preparation, I deem it requisite to submit this portion of his labours to the judgment of the Society, and to promote, in as far as it rests with me, their publicity.\n\n\"If the subject, and its mode of treatment, appear of the same value in the estimation of the Society that they do in mine, I should hope that the Dissertation will find an appropriate place in the Annual Transactions.\n\n\"Captain McMurdo, whose character and talents could receive no additional lustre from any testimony that a sincere feeling of friendship would willingly accord, has been dead some years: this remembrance of him, therefore, can do no more than revive a pleasing reminiscence and gratification to his relatives and friends, the latter of whom were both numerous and deeply attached to him. As to the interest his literary attempts may excite in the world at large, I must of course leave to the taste of the public to determine; and as far as I am myself concerned, I can only add, that I have not risked an alteration, curtailment, or addition, in any part.\n\n\"There is one merit, however, his labours possess in an eminent degree, that never, I should conceive, fails to fix the value of a literary work as connected with the accuracy of its facts and relations, which form its ground-work. In this view, any production of Captain McMurdo's would ensure the esteem of his friends, from their conviction that his moral feeling would prevent him hazarding any thing that had not received the strongest confirmation in his own mind; the tone of which was governed by the nicest delicacy of sentiment, and most rigid adherence to the authenticity of the occurrences and events related. He mis-\nsaid, in his assertions of historical accounts, to have adopted the principle of Herodotus\u2014of advancing as a fact only what he had seen, and relating as tradition what had been mentioned to him by others.\n\n\"I have two other Papers in my possession: one of which is a Description of the River Indus, which the Geographical Society here have prepared for publication; and a History of Sindh. This latter I shall do myself the pleasure to forward, by an early opportunity.\n\n\"In order that the Paper I now transmit may appear to the Society in the light it deserves, I beg to add, that I have compared the writing of the original with Captain McMurdo's signature and hand-writing in other documents, and feel perfectly convinced of their similarity.\n\n\"I have the honour to remain,\n\n\"Sir,\n\n\"Your obedient servant,\n\n(Signed) \"Ed.

It is necessary to premise, that, in advancing any opinion on the subject, I shall be guided entirely by such lights as have been occasionally discovered in the native histories of the times, and in the course of a laborious and protracted investigation, conducted chiefly by means of natives well acquainted with the country through which the River Indus flows. I must however candidly confess my conviction, that the state of this stream, even so late as twenty-five years ago, cannot be correctly ascertained; and that its ancient course is involved in an obscurity, that no conclusions drawn, either from records of an early date, or from modern observation, will ever succeed in entirely dispelling. In the course of my remarks, I feel that I shall be compelled to differ in opinion with able and learned writers; in whose theory of the ancient Indus, if I should appear not on all occasions to concur, yet, as my own sentiments will, I trust, be found stated without presumption, I indulge a hope of standing acquitted of any intention to enter the lists with such talent as has been employed on this subject, or of invidiously attacking a system, which, if not absolutely correct, displays a degree of ingenuity and research, far beyond what could have been expected from writers who had never visited India, or at least those parts connected in any\nway with this river; and whose sources of information must, from the little intercourse that Europeans have ever had with Sindh, have been no less obscure than limited.\n\nThe River Indus is known, in the earliest of the Sacred Hind\u00fa writings, by the name of Sindh or Sindh\u00fa, a term applied, in the same language, to the ocean; and the river may have received the appellation, either from its size, or perhaps, metaphorically, from the abundance of every necessary of life produced by its periodical floods. The country, on the same authority, is called Sindh\u00fades, or the country of Sindh\u00fa; but whether the river took its name from the former, or that of the country had its rise in the latter, it is impossible to determine. I am not prepared to assert that the term Sindh\u00fa originally attached to the river, higher up in its course than where the junction of the several tributaries form one stream; indeed, I am inclined to suppose otherwise: for although, at the period of the Muhammedan conquest, and perhaps long prior to the commencement of the era of Isl\u00e1m, the territories of the sovereigns of Alt\u00f3r extended nearly to the confines of Kashmir, yet it is probable that their original sovereignty was Sindh\u00fades; which, from the situation of the two capitals, and other large towns in their dominions, would appear to indicate the country lying south of Mult\u00e1n; an opinion corroborated by prevalent tradition, and indeed by the understanding of the present generation, that Sindh, or Sindh\u00fades Proper, includes a small portion of the southern part of Sindh, chiefly on the eastern bank of the Indus. When the Arabs entered the province, we find that the proper name Sindh was very much out of use, and that the same channel of the river took names from the different cities, towns, and even villages, beneath which it chanced to flow. This practice, which had perhaps obtained for centuries in all the varieties to which it is naturally subject, and which is still prevalent, is the principal cause of the confused mixture of names of rivers, which are constantly floating on the mind of the investigator, and involving him in a maze of difficulty, which he finds it utterly impossible to unravel, and the varieties of which he cannot satisfactorily reconcile.\n\nThe peculiar nature of this river, the lowness of its banks in many places, the height to which its waters rise above the level of the surrounding country in others, the great declination from the north which is generally allowed to be a characteristic of the Indus, are circumstances which, as the soil is loose and sandy, combine to expose its channels to great and frequent changes: nor does this apply alone to the delta, as in other large streams; for I believe I shall be able to shew, in the sequel, that such material alterations have from time to time occurred in the courses\nof the Indus far above the delta, as at present understood, as must be acknowledged to render it a matter of the greatest difficulty, if not absolutely impossible, to reconcile the ancient and modern streams.\n\nIn the course of my reading, and verbal inquiry while compiling the History of Sindh, I was struck by the great difference between the inhabited part of the country as it existed at the time of the Arab invasion, twelve centuries ago, and as it stood at the time of the Arghur conquest, or indeed as it is at the present day. In the battle which was fought under the walls of Alor, and which decided the fate of Sindh, historians relate*, that when the troops of Rao Dahir fled in confusion, they rushed in numbers to the river and were drowned, and that the body of the prince was discovered in a ravine leading to the bed of the river. We also learn from the same sources\u2020, that Alor was situated on a stream of the Indus that was navigable to the sea. B\u0101hmandb\u0101d (the Br\u0101hma\u1e47a of the Hind\u016bs), according to the last-quoted author, was situated on a stream of the Indus called P\u0101tan B\u0101hman, afterwards known by the name of the Loh\u0101nna Deri\u0101. Both the authors now quoted, agree in stating, that, until some years after the Arab conquest, the district of Thatta was by no means well peopled, or productive; and that it was originally an uninhabited sand desert, or covered with the sea. The rich and fertile tracts of Sindh, the consequences of abundance of water, were then the districts included in the ancient Dirak, or modern Chachg\u0101m and Badban divisions, a range of country bordering on the desert, and now indebted for a scanty supply of water to artificial canals.\n\nThe foregoing facts first led me to suspect that a great body of the waters of this vast river found their way to the sea by a more eastern course than that which is at present followed by the main stream; and the inquiries and investigations which succeeded, although they added further conviction to my mind, were nevertheless attended with so many contrarieties to be reconciled, and so much confusion to be cleared up, that although I have frequently thought the different points sufficiently illustrated for my own conception, yet their succinctness, on committing them to paper, has proved far below my expectations. Such as they are, however, I venture to present them to the notice of those who are better able to do justice to a subject of such intricacy and interest.\n\nThe channel, which I suppose the Indus to have occupied at the above-mentioned early period, is still to be seen. It lies to the eastward, and parallel to the present stream, at a distance of between sixty and eighty miles. This channel is now known by the name of the Pur\u0101na Deri\u0101, or \"ancient river;\" and on its banks, or their vicinity, are to be traced the remains of the ancient and celebrated cities of Alor,\n\n* M. \u00c1s\u0101m. \u2020 Tohfat al Gir\u0101m; T\u0101rikh-i-T\u0101hir\u012b.\nART. II.\u2014Remarks on the School System of the Hind\u00fas. By Captain Henry Harkness, Secretary to the Royal Asiatic Society, late Secretary to the College of Fort St. George, &c. &c.\n\nThe following remarks refer more particularly to the Southern Peninsula of India; but they may perhaps be considered to apply equally, with regard to her ancient institutions of this nature, to India in general; as the Southern Peninsula has undergone, comparatively, but little change from foreign conquest and domination.\n\nThe system of education throughout the peninsula being nearly the same, whatever may be the language or shade of difference in the people of any particular part or nation, an exposition of that which is followed by one portion of its inhabitants may, with some allowances, which a few observations will explain, be considered as applicable to the whole. I shall therefore select the Tamil, or the School of that nation or people of the South whose vernacular language is the Tamil.\n\nIn almost every village, the schoolmaster is a member of the community. A manie and pizhakadai, or house and back-yard, are given to him by the village. He is allowed to exact fees from his scholars, which, with the presents that custom has established as due to him from the parents, at particular periods and on particular occasions, form the sources of his emolument.\n\nThe school is open to every S\u00fadra and Br\u00e1hmana boy* of the village; but not to boys of inferior or stranger tribes, unless by the sufferance of the community, and generally on the payment of a small monthly stipend, or the performance of some particular service, by the parents of the boys so admitted.\n\nThe hours of attendance at school are from sun-rise to sun-set; allowing one hour at mid-day, for refreshment or repose.\n\nA boy is first taken to school when he has attained his fifth year. The period of his quitting it is uncertain; but to enter him as a votary of Sarasvati, the Goddess of Learning, is considered a duty too sacred to be neglected, even by the poorest of the S\u00fadra tribes.\n\nThe sounds of the vowels and consonants, first separately and then combined, being taught, to which considerable attention is paid in order to ensure a just pronunciation, the boy is instructed to write or draw, in a bed of sand, the letter or sign representing these sounds; and thus, by a reciprocity of action between sign and sound, to fix them both in his memory.\n\n* The four tribes or castes are, the Br\u00e1hmans, Kshatriyas, Vaisyas, and S\u00fadras. All without this pale are considered impure; and among these are included Europeans, and all other foreigners.\nbetween her and Pann\u00fa the son of a chieftain of Makr\u00e1n*, who came from the neighbouring country to ascertain if fame spoke truth of her charms. He became her slave; but the cruelty of his father brought both to an untimely end.\n\nIt matters little whether this love-story is a plain fact, or whether it is embellished by Asiatic fancy or superstition. One thing we may fairly take as truth; that is, that the wildest fiction could hardly have brought a stream from B\u0101hmana to Bhamb\u00f3r, if it did not exist; particularly when we reflect, that, for the principal part of the romance, the river in its actual situation, if Bhamb\u00f3r was not mentioned, would have done equally well. The washerman, whose name is recorded, is said to have been a man of considerable wealth; and that he had a great number of workmen in his service, who, when employed on the river, found the basket in which the child was: it may be inferred from this, that the river at Bhamb\u00f3r was of fresh water; which corresponds with the history of the Indus, the waters of which are fresh to the very lowest parts of the delta\u2020.\n\nFrom what has been already adduced, it appears certain that there has been some remarkable change in the course of the Indus; and it remains for me to shew on what grounds I assume the P\u016br\u0101n to have been the former channel of this river.\n\nThat a material change took place, is positively stated by several authors\u2021; and although they attribute it to means by which it could scarcely have been effected, yet\u2014as we are aware of the superstition of the Asiatic, the desire inherent in him to set down to the score of divine interference, circumstances by no means beyond the efforts of mankind, or at least the common course of nature\u2014the objections made to the mode in which it is said to have been brought about can by no means be considered as tending to invalidate the fact of an alteration in the stream of the river. M\u012br T\u0101hir relates, that during the government of Dill\u016b R\u0101j\u00e1 at Al\u00f3r, his tyranny reduced his subjects to a state of abject wretchedness. The duties which he levied on merchandise passing down the river at Al\u00f3r amounted to one-half their value, independent of the valuable articles which he in general forced from the merchant. On one occasion, a Muhammedan merchant of great respectability, named Saif al Mulk, with his wife Badi\u2019 al Jam\u00e1l, was proceeding down the river to embark at Diwal, on a pilgrimage to the city of Mecca.\n\n* He is stated to have been a Muhammedan of the tribe of Air\u00ed. This tribe is still numerous in Sindh.\u2014May they not be, from their situation, the Arrie, or the Oriti, of the Greeks?\n\u2020 Bhamb\u00f3r is now forty miles from the sea.\n\u2021 Tohfat al Gir\u00e1m, and T\u00e1rikh-i-T\u00e1hiri.\nIn those days, the Mehr\u00e1n (Indus) flowed past the vicinity of the city of A'l\u00f3r; and Dill\u00fa R\u00e1s\u00ed, hearing of the beauty of the traveller's wife, determined to seize her, as she passed the town. The merchant, finding his voyage thus interrupted, prayed to God for assistance; and employed stone-cutters to cut through a mountain which approached to the bank of the river, and built a strong rampart on the opposite side; which having effected, he passed through with his boats. From this time, the Mehr\u00e1n, deserting its ancient course, pursued the channel it at present occupies, and, notwithstanding every exertion, the city of A'l\u00f3r was deserted. Saif al Mulk and his wife returned; and, with two sons, were, at their death, interred between the Der\u00e1 Gh\u00e1zi Kh\u00e1n and S\u00edta-p\u00fara, where their tombs are still worshipped, near the fort of Ratt\u00e1h, a place of great antiquity.\n\nThe T\u00e1rikh-i-T\u00e1hir\u00ed states the same event to have taken place, and from the same cause; and adds, that the river from that time \"took a course by Bhak\u00edr and Sehw\u00e1n; and, by its desertion of the A'l\u00f3r channel, that city, and between nine hundred and a thousand towns and villages, were rendered uninhabitable; and Dill\u00fa R\u00e1s\u00ed compelled to change his residence to Dill\u00f3r,\" the present Abp\u00far, near B\u00e1hmana. Such is the account given by these historians of an event of vast importance to a whole country; and however sceptical we may be as to the manner in which it was effected, the truth of the fact is corroborated by legends and tradition, which, with the evidence that may be drawn from what I have already mentioned, ought to be sufficient to substantiate it to most minds. Another argument, however, and to my mind one of great weight in favour of the ancient channel in question, is, that the capitals A'l\u00f3r, B\u00e1hmana, and Wag\u00e9hk\u00f3t\u2014the two former of undoubted antiquity\u2014were situated in the neighbourhood of the P\u00far\u00e1n, and far from any river or fertile country at the present time. Now, I do not conceive it likely that the two principal cities in the empire would have been built in a desert: on the contrary, it is natural that they should have been founded on the banks of a river which nature pointed out as the source of wealth and comfort to their inhabitants.\n\nThat there is no mistake in the supposed site of A'l\u00f3r, I think I may venture to assume. It is a parganah in the present Sirk\u00e1r of Bhak\u00edr*, which city was built from its ruins; and the town or ruins of A'l\u00f3r are as familiar to the natives of the country, as Bhak\u00edr itself is. That B\u00e1hmana, B\u00e1hbina, B\u00e1hban\u00e1, or Br\u00e1hman\u00e1b\u00e1d, as it is variously written by Persian historians, was situated on the L\u00f3h\u00e1nn\u00e1 Deri\u00e1, also called the B\u00e1hmanaw\u00e1, is certified by the remains of the city still to be\n\n* M\u00edn Ma\u00e1sam.\nseen, and by the universal testimony of the\ndent that this ancient city is erroneously so\nthe result of my inquiries on the subject,\nremains of the ancient K\u00e1llak\u00f3t, or perhaps\nto the mistake*. Br\u00e1hman\u00e1b\u00e1d, and B\nwhere I have met with their names, have\nferent places: and as to the site of B\u00e1h\nman\u00e1b\u00e1d\u2020 was overwhelmed by an earth\ndesert, for the sins of Dill\u00fa R\u00e1j\u00e1, and, no\npillar left, to mark where it stood.\n\nThe period at which this change in the\ndispute: for though all accounts agree in\nthe time of Dill\u00fa R\u00e1j\u00e1, yet there is much\nauthors with regard to the period when this\nstates him to have been a descendant of\nanother says that he was a S\u00famr\u00e1\u00a7. The\nthe year in which he reigned, but, from\nhistory, it is most probable that he lived\nMuhammedan era. Both historians also\nhad two sons, Dill\u00fa and Ch\u00e1t\u00e1; the first\nthe sovereignty, the latter visited Mecca;\nhis return, in A.H.140, to Sindh, endea\nmorals: he failed, however; and Dill\u00fa\nhis wife, Ch\u00e1t\u00e1 left his territory, and r\ntomb was afterwards revered. It will ha\nthese times, that I have placed Dill\u00fa R\u00e1j\u00e1\nsecond century of the Hegira; and my rea\nwise detailed||.\n\nIt appears, from the preceding detail\nIndus, to the sea at the port of Diwa\nP\u00far\u00e1n river; and that it was not until a\nsecond century of the Hejira, and the lat\nChristian era, that the channel by Bhak\u00edn\n\n* I have heard natives of Thatta, when a\ntuated, say, that it was to the westward of,\npositive that this is an error, as the country\nMuhammedan era.\n\n\u2020 Tohf\u00e1t al Gir\u00e1m.\n\n\u2021 Tohf\u00e1t al Gir\u00e1m.\n\n\u00a7 M\u00edr.\n\n|| Although some doubts certainly remain i\nnevertheless say, that there is more evidence\nthan for any other account of Dill\u00fa R\u00e1j\u00e1.\nfrom the P\u00far\u00e1n, pursued a course westerly as far as the modern K'ho-\nd\u00e1b\u00e1d, or perhaps between that place and H\u00e1lakandi; where, joining\nthe present channel, it crossed that course; and fell into the sea at\nDibal, after passing the ancient Bhamb\u00f3r*, the ruins of which city are\nto be seen about twenty miles on the road from Thatta to Kar\u00e1cht\u00ed.\nAlthough I cannot satisfactorily establish the exact spot where this\nbranch separates from the channel at present forming the river, yet that\nit ran to the westward of Thatta is mentioned in the Tabk\u00e1t-i-Akbar\u00ed,\nan historical work of some repute; and, indeed, this is generally allowed\nto be the case: however doubtful this may be, it is a well-established\nfact, that at Gag\u00e1h, between Kar\u00e1cht\u00ed and Thatta, and where the ruins\nof Bhamb\u00f3r are still to be seen, is a creek terminating in a sandy\nchannel\u2020, communicating with the sea, which the tradition of the\ncountry, known to all, asserts to have been a mouth of the Indus. A\nreference to M. de la Rochette's map will shew a similar branch to\nthis, actually crossing the present channel at H\u00e1lakandi, and passing the\nwestward to Dibal: on this branch he has placed S\u00e1ras\u00e1n.\n\nBhamb\u00f3r was a city, the seat of a chieftain named Bhambo R\u00e1j\u00e1\u2021,\nwho lived about the end of the tenth century. That it was a town of con-\nsiderable note, and very populous, we learn from an author who states\nthat the S\u00e1k\u00eda Parganah\u00a7 was peopled from Bhamb\u00f3r when that city\nand its surrounding country were deserted from a failure in the river,\nwhich, now passing close to Thatta (still to the west however), fell into\nthe sea, near L\u00e1ri Bandar. Independently of the testimony already ad-\nduced of Bhamb\u00f3r having been on the bank of a branch of the Indus,\nwe have that of the Tohfat al Gir\u00e1m, and the ancient legends and\nballads of Sindh, to a circumstance from which we may infer that the\nL\u00f3h\u00e1nn\u00e1 Deri\u00e1 did actually flow past the city in question. The cir-\ncumstance to which I allude, is that of the female infant of an inhabi-\ntant of a town on that branch having been floated to Bhamb\u00f3r in a\nchest or basket, where it was saved by some washermen, and carried to\ntheir master, under whose care it was reared, and afterwards gave rise\nto one of the most popular ballads in the Sindhi language. It appears\nthat the parents of the child wished to destroy it; but being saved as\nalready described, in a few years she displayed a degree of personal\nbeauty far beyond the common standard, and received, in consequence,\nthe name of Susi, or \"the Moon.\" The legends relate an attachment\n\nriver, which gave the name to the stream.\u2014A'gham is by some supposed to have\nbeen A'bpur, which is comparatively a modern name.\n\n* Or Bhambor\u00e1.\u2014I believe that this city did not exist until the first Dibal\nwas deserted.\n\n\u2020 Mr. Maxfield's Journal. \u2021 Tohfat al Gir\u00e1m. \u00a7 Mir T\u00e1hir.\nrank of a city. The name, by the same authority, is a corruption of Bakar, \"the dawn;\" which was bestowed upon it by Sayyid Muhammed Maki, of sacred memory. I have never, in the course of my researches, found Bhakir called Almansura, which name is attributed to it by the Ayin Akbari*; but even this would prove its Arabic origin.\n\nSehw\u00e1n is undoubtedly a place of vast antiquity; perhaps more so than either Al\u00f3r or B\u00e1hmana. According to the Tohfat al Gir\u00e1m, it is L\u00edst\u00e1n Saiw\u00e1n\u2020 and Sehw\u00e1n, and modernly Sewist\u00e1n: the orthography I have chosen, appears, however, to be the most ancient, for the city takes its name from its founder, R\u00e1ja Sehw\u00e1n, who is stated in history to be a descendant of Sindh, the fabulous author of the country and people. At all events, R\u00e1ja Sehw\u00e1n must have lived at a very early period. This city had its fortifications erected by one of the Samma Jams, was occupied afterwards by the Arghuns when it became subject to Bhakir, was the seat of an independent government in the time of Akbar, and returned to its subordinate state on the rise of the Kalh\u00f3ras.\u2014I have already started a doubt of the river having originally passed the town; on which subject more shall be said in the end.\n\nHyder\u00e1b\u00e1d, the ancient Ner\u00fank\u00f3t; or Ner\u00fan Kafiri, as it was distinguished by the zealous Muhammedans. It is impossible to fix any period for the rise of this town: like Sehw\u00e1n, it would appear to have been a fedaalty of Al\u00f3r; the chieftain, who was suspected of treachery by the R\u00e1ja, was removed, under the plea of serving in the presence, on the advance of the Arabs, but afterwards hastened to the Muhammedan army, and surrendered the fort. The Sag\u00e1ra river originally ran to the westward of this place.\n\nBr\u00e1hman\u00e1b\u00e1d, or B\u00e1hmana, was, as I have said, situated on the L\u00f3h\u00e1na Deri\u00e1, at a short distance from where it separates from the P\u00far\u00e1n.\n\nAghamk\u00f3t, called also K\u00edll\u00e1k\u00f3t, lies about seven miles to the westward of Thatta: it is not mentioned until long after the Arab conquest.\n\nThatta is a modern town, founded by one of the latest of the Samma dynasty; near the site of S\u00e1moi, or S\u00e1mo\u00ednagar, which was their capital, and which was peopled at the time the Sundr\u00e1 Parganah was\n\n* The Aj\u00e1ib al Mukhl\u00edk\u00e1t, a book of considerable worth, says, that Nasirp\u00fara was built on the site of Al Mansura, which brings it near to Br\u00e1hman\u00e1b\u00e1d. According to D'Anville, Nasirp\u00fara was the seat of government of Firoze Sh\u00e1n's Lieutenant, in A.D. 1339; and Bhakir and Lakhar, with the country between those cities and Nasirp\u00fara were subject to him.\n\n\u2020 Dr. Vincent appears to me to consider Sewi and Sehw\u00e1n as the same; and, in consequence, has difficulties in his subject that would not otherwise occur. Sewi is a district, town, and province, north-west of Bhakir. Sehw\u00e1n is never called Sewi.\nCAPT. MCMURDO ON THE RIVER INDUS.\n\nDays, the Mehr\u00e1n (Indus) flowed past the vicinity of the town; and Dill\u00fa R\u00e1j\u00e1, hearing of the beauty of the traveller's daughter, determined to seize her, as she passed the town. The merchant, however, in his voyage thus interrupted, prayed to God for assistance; and sent stone-cutters to cut through a mountain which approached to the mouth of the river, and built a strong rampart on the opposite side; having effected, he passed through with his boats. From this time the Mehr\u00e1n, deserting its ancient course, pursued the channel it at present occupies, and, notwithstanding every exertion, the city of Al\u00f3r was deserted. Saif al Mulk and his wife returned; and, with two sons, died at their death, interred between the Der\u00e1 Gh\u00e1zi Kh\u00e1n and S\u00edta, where their tombs are still worshipped, near the fort of Ratt\u00e1h, of great antiquity.\n\nThe T\u00e1rikh-i-T\u00e1hir\u00ed states the same event to have taken place, and gives the same cause; and adds, that the river from that time \"took a new course by Bhak\u00edr and Sehw\u00e1n;\" and, by its desertion of the Al\u00f3r channel, the city, and between nine hundred and a thousand towns and villages, became rendered uninhabitable; and Dill\u00fa R\u00e1j\u00e1 compelled to change his residence to Dill\u00f3r,\" the present Abp\u00far, near B\u00e1hmana. Such is the account given by these historians of an event of vast importance to a whole country; and however sceptical we may be as to the manner in which it was effected, the truth of the fact is corroborated by legends and tradition, which, with the evidence that may be drawn from what I have already mentioned, ought to be sufficient to substantiate it to most minds. Another argument, however, and to my mind one of great weight in favour of the ancient channel in question, is, that the capitals Il\u00f3r, B\u00e1hmana, and Wagchkh\u00e9t\u2014the two former of undoubted antiquity\u2014were situated in the neighbourhood of the P\u00far\u00e1n, and far from any river or fertile country at the present time. Now, I do not conceive it likely that the two principal cities in the empire would have been built in a desert: on the contrary, it is natural that they should have been founded on the banks of a river which nature pointed out as the source of wealth and comfort to their inhabitants.\n\nThat there is no mistake in the supposed site of Al\u00f3r, I think I may venture to assume. It is a parganah in the present Sirk\u00e1r of Bhak\u00edr*, which city was built from its ruins; and the town or ruins of Al\u00f3r are as familiar to the natives of the country, as Bhak\u00edr itself is. That B\u00e1hmana, B\u00e1hhina, B\u00e1hman\u00e1, or Br\u00e1hman\u00e1b\u00e1d, as it is variously written by Persian historians, was situated on the L\u00f3h\u00e1nn\u00e1 Der\u00eda, also called the B\u00e1hmanaw\u00e1, is certified by the remains of the city still to be\n\n* M\u00edn Ma\u00e1sam.\ncentury; and was the possession of a chief descended from Alexander\u2020. It was situated far from B\u00e1hmana, in the parganah now.\n\nHaving thus adduced the grounds for regard to the river Indus are drawn, I shall make general remarks on the subject; noticing European writers on the ancient state of India to convey an idea of how and where they opined, and the reasons for that difference.\n\nI have already stated my reasons for supposing that it did not originally pass Bhakar and Sehw\u00e1n, but was a secondary stream that did so. It is said by historians, that after the fall of Ner\u00fank\u00f3t, Alexander advanced to Sehw\u00e1n, which he received an order from his uncle, at Bhar, against D\u00e1hir direct, and to cross the Indus to the neighbourhood of Ner\u00fank\u00f3t\u2021, and advancing on the capital. This expression shows that Sehw\u00e1n had not been on the main road, and know that Ner\u00fank\u00f3t was not far from there military stores were conveyed from D\u00edv\u00e1na place, in boats up the S\u00e1g\u00e1ra branch. The precise spot were the Arabs crossed the Indus from which a great deal might be drawn. places in the neighbourhood of this spot, there are now no traces of such towns, there was a dispute in the Arab army as to meet R\u00e1j\u00e1 D\u00e1hir at his capital, or laying siege. I should therefore infer, that it was near the Arabs crossed the Indus: but the want of army attributed to Muhammed Ben K\u00e1sim previous information we have of the expedition by a fleet as far up the S\u00e1g\u00e1ra river, the army must have crossed the stream in\n\nA reference to my sketch of the ancients:\n\n* Tohfat al Gir\u00e1m.\n\n\u2020 It appears from Arrian, that Alexander P\u00e1tala: may not these Agris be their descendants?\u2021 Mir Ma\u00e1sam says, that he crossed near modern names, in speaking of ancient places, who mentions, that Muhammed Ben K\u00e1sim afterwards, that Thatta was peopled and founded centuries after the Arab conquest.\n\n* Tohfat al Gir\u00e1m.\nArabs were originally on the same side of the river with Al\u00f3r; but as the country between Schu\u00e1n and that capital appears to have been uninhabited, it is probable that Al\u00f3r could not be approached in that direction. This would lead to the march of the army in the vicinity of the river: and as it is said that Muhammed was blamed by his officers for passing Br\u00e1hman\u00e1b\u00e1d, it is likely that it lay nearly on his route. It follows, in that case, that the L\u00f3h\u00e1nn\u00e1 Deri\u00e1 was to be crossed by the army; but why the fleet should not have been employed, it is hard to say, unless the vessels were of too large a size, or unless the R\u00e1j\u00e1 occupied positions on the river which prevented their passing.\n\nFor the sake of perspicuity, I shall here trace the Indus from Bhak\u00edr to the sea, in company with Dr. Vincent, who has, in a very able manner, followed Arrian and other Greek writers down the whole course of the river, and disposed of the chieftains and people in situations as nearly to truth as, perhaps, was possibly to be done at the present great distance of time.\n\nTHE SOGDI BHAK\u00cdR.\n\nThe author above quoted, places the Sogdi at Bhak\u00edr, which, according to D'Anville, was the capital of that race of men. If Asiatic authority is to be depended on, I have already shewn that the city of Bhak\u00edr was not in existence more than twelve hundred years ago, and that it is of Muhammedan origin. I have, on the same authority, shewn that the branch of the Indus did not pass Bhak\u00edr until the deserton of Al\u00f3r, which was the cause of the peopling of the former city. That the Sogdi were, however, in the vicinity of that place, I think extremely probable; and there is good reason to believe that their territory extended on the east bank of the Indus, to a considerable distance. I have little doubt but that the people now spoken of, are the same as the S\u00f3dh\u00e1s, a race of R\u00e1j\u00e1p\u00fats, at present occupying the habitable tracts of the desert between Sindh and Gujar\u00e1t, but who were assuredly chieftains in Sindh, and of Amerk\u00f3t and its dependent country, not many centuries ago; whilst there is reason, from traditionary accounts, to believe that they were anciently sovereigns of a much more extensive country to the northward, even of Al\u00f3r itself. This would bring the Sogdi and the S\u00f3dh\u00e1s nearly in the same situation, and correspond with Dr. Vincent's account, making the capital to the north of Al\u00f3r, between that place and M\u00falt\u00e1n.\n\n\"It would have been a fortunate circumstance,\" says Dr. Vincent, \"if any of the historians had mentioned an island here, or in any part of the Indus between the junction of the Acesines and Thatta; but their silence is unanimous. It will appear, however, that we have something more than conjecture to direct us for other names, Bekier, Sekier, and\ncarrying arms must act like his brethren in arms. A boy, whose wife has been seduced, may employ the arm of his grown-up brother or cousin, to avenge him. But if he have none such, he, as well as the learned Brahman, may appeal to the prince, who, through his courts of justice, comes forward to avenge the wrong (such is the sentiment here), and to wipe out the stain with blood;\u2014death, whether by law or extra-judicially, being the doom of all adulterers with the wives of Parbattiah. Brahmins, indeed, by a law superior to all laws, may not be done to death by sentence of a court of justice. But no one will care to question the Parbattiah who, with his own hand, destroys an adulterer, Brahman though that adulterer be. If the law be required to judge a Brahman for this crime, the sentence is, to be degraded from his caste, and banished for ever, with every mark of infamy. If a Parbattiah marry into a tribe such as the Newar, which claims no privilege of licensed revenge, he may not, in regard to such wife, exercise the privilege.\n\nBut must not a Parbattiah, before he proceed to avenge himself, prove the fact, and the identity of the offender, in a court of justice? No! To appeal to a court would afford a warning to the delinquents to escape, and so foil him. He may pursue his revenge without a thought of the magistrate; he may watch his opportunity for years, till he can safely execute his design; and when he has, at last, found it, he may use it to the adulterer's destruction. But he may not spare the adulteress; he must cut off her nose, and drive her with ignominy from his house, her caste, and station, for ever gone. If the wife have notoriously sinned with many, the husband may not destroy any but the first seducer: and though the husband need prove nothing beforehand, he must be prepared with legal proof afterwards, in case the wife should deny the fact, and summon him before the courts (no other person can), for murder and mutilation.\n\nAnd what is deemed legal proof in this case? The wife's confession, made in the presence of two witnesses. But who is to warrant us that the confession is true? This, it must be confessed, is an awkward question. By the law of Nep\u00e1l, the husband's power over his wife is absolute. He may beat her; lock her up; starve her ad libitum, so long as he endanger not her life or limbs: and that he will do all this, when his whole soul is bent upon procuring the necessary evidence of her frailty, is too probable. But still, her honour, and her beauty, are dear to a woman; and every Parbattiah knows that once the terrible avowal once made, she becomes in an instant a widow and infamous outcast. There is little real danger that any woman should be false to herself, by conf...\nI apprehend, that, as has been imagined, she could be won to become the tool of some petty malice of her husband, or of the covert political spleen of the Durb\u00e1r. There are, indeed, some married Br\u00e1hmans among the soldiery of Nep\u00e1l; and the wife of a Br\u00e1hman may not be mutilated. But in proportion as the station of a Br\u00e1hmani is higher than that of all others, so must its prerogatives be dearer to her; and all these she must lose, if she confess. She must be driven from her home by her husband, and degraded and banished the kingdom by the state. But there is certainly a contingent hazard to our followers, arising out of the circumstance of the adultery, if she have sinned with many, being required to name her first lover; for since she must, in every court, suffer the full penalties of her crime, it may well be supposed, that, under various circumstances, she might be led to name, as her first paramour, one of our Sip\u00e1his, instead of a country fellow. This however seems to me a vague and barely possible contingency.\n\nPROCEDURE.\n\nThe proofs and procedure before the Nep\u00e1l tribunals will fall more naturally under consideration, when we proceed to the next case. Suffice it here to say, that if, when the husband would cut off his wife's nose, or afterwards, the wife should hurry to a court of justice, and deny her guilt, the husband must be brought up to answer. In ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, the husband's answer consists in simply producing the two witnesses to his wife's confession of guilt. She, of course, affirms that the confession was extorted by unwarrantable cruelty towards her: and if she can support such a plea (it is hard to do so, for the husband's legal power covers a multitude of sins) in a manner satisfactory to the court, and if the husband have no counter-evidence to this plea, nor any circumstantial or general evidence of the guilt which he affirms, he may be condemned to death. But, in the vast majority of cases, his two witnesses to the confession, with such circumstantial evidence as the case, if a true bill, can hardly want, will suffice for his justification.\n\nINTERCOURSE BETWEEN A HIND\u00da AND A NON-HIND\u00da\u2014THE LAW.\n\nHe who may give water to a pure Hind\u00fa to drink, is within the pale of Hinduism: he whose water may not be drunk by a pure Hind\u00fa, is an outcast, an unutterably vile creature, whose intimate contact with one within the pale is foul contamination, communicable to the pure by the slightest and most necessary intercourse held with them, and, through them, to all others.

MCMURDO ON THE RIVER INDUS.\n\nThe author above quoted, places the Sogdi at Bhakir, which, according to D'Anville, was the capital of that race of men. If Asiatic authority is to be depended on, I have already shewn that the city of Bhakir was not in existence more than twelve hundred years ago, and that it is of Muhammedan origin. I have, on the same authority, shewn that the branch of the Indus did not pass Bhakir until the deserton of Alor, which was the cause of the peopling of the former city. That the Sogdi were, however, in the vicinity of that place, I think extremely probable; and there is good reason to believe that their territory extended on the east bank of the Indus, to a considerable distance. I have little doubt but that the people now spoken of, are the same as the Sodhas, a race of Rajaputs, at present occupying the habitable tracts of the desert between Sindh and Gujar\u00e1t, but who were assuredly chieftains in Sindh, and of Amerkot and its dependent country, not many centuries ago; whilst there is reason, from traditionary accounts, to believe that they were anciently sovereigns of a much more extensive country to the northward, even of Alor itself. This would bring the Sogdi and the Sodhas nearly in the same situation, and correspond with Dr. Vincent's account, making the capital to the north of Alor, between that place and Mult\u00e1n.\n\n\"It would have been a fortunate circumstance,\" says Dr. Vincent, \"if any of the historians had mentioned an island here, or in any part of the Indus between the junction of the Acesines and Thatta; but their silence is unanimous.

Muscanus revolted, which caused Python to be despatched conquered his country, and returned to Muscanus along with him in chains. circumstance, that Alexander's fleet had proceeded distance from Muscanus's capital. On Sambus, the fleet does not appear to have been and it is probable that Alexander, after having Br\u0101hmans, despatched Python; and returned where he waited the return of that officer down the river; and then hastened his voyage of the flight of the king of that country. for Alexander to reach P\u0101tt\u0101la from Br\u0101hm\u0101nabad as one reason why Muscanus should supposing that chieftain had been at Schw\u0101na had nearly two hundred miles to proceed as alluded to, before he could reach the P\u0101tt\u0101la. Muscanus is placed at Ator, which is nearly in P\u0101tt\u0101la is allowed to be at the ancient della, the distance of Alexander reduced to little more than one hundred miles, somewhat less than one hundred and fifty miles\u2014a distance not very disproportionate to the Alexander had before proceeded below Muscanus will be by no means extraordinary.\n\nIn other respects, Br\u0101hm\u0101nabad seems comparison with P\u0101tt\u0101la. It is said that to the desert before Alexander arrived. stand the sandy desert, which I should pres\nAt Sewi I should place Oxycanus. Arrian says, that \"Alexander having erected and garrisoned a fort in Musicanus's capital, he proceeded, with his archers and Agrians, and all the troops of horse which he had on board his navy, to attack a neighbouring prince called Oxycanus.\" Now, as Craterus, with the greatest part of the army, had been already ferried over to the left (or eastern) bank of the river, it must follow that Oxycanus resided on the west bank, else why take troops from his navy, where the army of Craterus would have answered the purpose? The position of Sewi, with reference to Alor, corresponds sufficiently with those of Arrian's two chiefs; and unless some ancient city and government should be proved to have existed between Sehw\u00e1n and Bhakir, I can see no other place so appropriate for Oxycanus as Sewi; an idea in which I am, in some degree, supported by Dr. Vincent, who says, that if Sewi and Sehw\u00e1n could be proved to be different places, he should certainly assert that Musicanus had been the chief of one, and Oxycanus that of the other.\n\nAt Sehw\u00e1n I should place Sambus. It may be supposed that this chieftain had met Alexander in the realm of the Sogdi; for, considering the terms on which Musicanus and he were, it could not consistently have been in the territories of the latter that Sambus had been appointed \"Satrap of the mountains.\" The position of Sehw\u00e1n, situated on a branch of the Lakhi mountains, must naturally have given its chief great influence among the tribes who inhabited them; and it was natural that he should be appointed their chief. The great antiquity attributed to the city of Sehw\u00e1n, and the circumstance of its being supposed to have been founded by a descendant of Sindh, whose name it took, are inducements to assimilate Sehw\u00e1n with the Sindomana of Sambus, more especially as no other city can be discovered at all answering to the name or situation. The foregoing arrangement of the sovereignties, with which Alexander met on his voyage down the Indus, would afford sufficient grounds for estimating their wealth and resources at the high standard of the Greek writers; whereas, if Oxycanus, Musicanus, and Sambus, are all huddled in between Sehw\u00e1n and the mountains, I must confess I cannot perceive where their populous territory could possibly lie.\n\nWe now come to a part of the subject which should have been clearer and better understood at the present time than any thing that relates to Alexander's voyage down the river: on the contrary, however, although great and various talent has been employed in its illustration, the site of P\u00e1ltala, and the ancient state of the delta, is at present (and, I fear, doomed still to continue) in as great obscurity as any other part of Alexander's passage down the Indus.\n\nDr. Vincent is of opinion, that the ancient Br\u00e1hman\u00e1b\u00e1d may be\nhave attempted to delineate it, it will be seen that between B\u0101hmana and the ocean is not more than a branch than it is from Thatta to the mouth of the river; this proceeds from the circumstance of the river having been recovered from the ocean, which is known by historians; and the truth of which is confirmed by the country, and the extensive lands recovered, which are still continually increasing.\n\nPtolemy mentions the western branch of the river Sagapa; and one of the ancients, the eastern branch, and according to his geography of the river Sagapa to have divided into two branches, much farther than it has emptied itself by seven mouths, which are considered as branches of the river. The theory I adopted, I had formed long before I had recourse to ancient geographers; but let my plan of the geography of Ptolemy, and a remarkable resemblance in the names of the rivers, the more striking, from the names of the rivers near to each other. That the S\u00e1g\u00f3ra branch of Ptolemy, appears, from the delineation of the map, to admit of little doubt\u2020; and that the Lakpat river, which is still known by the name of Lakpat Bandar, from the mouth of Jambus, covered with water, forming Cutch into an island, supplied, in some measure, by the torrents streaming down the side of the Lakhi\u00a7 mountains; which, for want of\n\n* I am at a loss to discover who gave this name, or where observe it in a map of the ancient world, by Cutch, where Sagapa is the name given to the western branch.\n\n\u2020 It is certain, that the S\u00e1g\u00f3ra branch was not always known, and had been deserted.\n\n\u2021 B\u00e1r\u00e1 is the Indian name of a roadstead, or place of safety, and signifies \"to the seaward.\"\n\n\u00a7 This range of hills is called by Neigator, and others, the Chig\u016b range; but the Chig\u016b is a sandy bank, which runs parallel to it, so as to form the shore.\nremarked, that the great desert approaches closer to the P\u00far\u00e1n opposite B\u00e1hmana, than anywhere else; that the town itself was afterwards deserted in consequence of the influx of sand from that tract; and that all the country in the same longitude with P\u00e1tt\u00e1la bears every feature of the great sandy desert; a circumstance which will account for there being no wells in the country, as is mentioned by Arrian. This account of a desert does not agree well with the lower delta. Supposing P\u00e1tt\u00e1la to have been at Thatta, it would be difficult to discover the desert here alluded to; for, had it been on the west bank, the people would have been exposed to the attacks of the Greeks, who marched along it; and a reference to the state of this supposed delta will shew that the desert could not have been to the eastward of it, unless at such a distance from it as would appear inconsistent.\n\nAnother circumstance noticed by Arrian is, the march of a heavy and light armed force of foot and horse \"through the Island of P\u00e1tt\u00e1la, that they might meet the fleet on the other side.\" Supposing P\u00e1tt\u00e1la to have been at the spot supposed by Dr. Vincent, may I ask, what could have been the object of marching nine thousand men from Thatta to L\u00e1hri Bandar, where the nature of the country, intersected by nall\u00e1s and marshes, must have been extremely inconvenient, if not absolutely impracticable, to their advance? It is, besides, very difficult to suppose for a moment that there could be any country or district, between Thatta and L\u00e1hri Bandar, of sufficient importance to require the march of such a force through it: and on referring to the sketch of that delta, and the positions of Thatta and L\u00e1hri, where the troops were to join the fleet, the expression of Arrian (if Mr. Rooke is correct), \"through the Island of P\u00e1tt\u00e1la, that they might meet the fleet on the other side,\" will appear very ill applied.\n\nThe principal objection which I can discover to the supposition of B\u00e1hmana being the ancient P\u00e1tt\u00e1la, is the distance at which it stands from the sea-coast. It does not, however, appear at all certain, in any of the ancient accounts that I have seen, how far P\u00e1tt\u00e1la was from the ocean: for although a mere perusal of Arrian would induce a belief, that when Alexander sailed down the right branch of the river, he took his departure from P\u00e1tt\u00e1la; yet, from the circumstance of \"Hephestion's having been despatched to build a fort in the city,\" it may be inferred that Alexander himself was not at the city, but probably had advanced a considerable distance in pursuit of the king or his people, and might have embarked on his voyage down the right branch, considerably below P\u00e1tt\u00e1la. On a reference, however, to the plan* of the ancient river, as I\n\n* It is to be regretted that this and other plans by Capt.

Each flood inundates islands; and when it subsides, others are formed, varying in size and position: and so uncertain is every thing, that the site of L\u0101hri Bandar is seldom two years the same.\n\nSuch are the arguments that I have been able to discover in favour of this new theory of the river Indus. That every conjecture on the subject of the foregoing pages must be unsatisfactory and vague, I am perfectly aware; and I do not therefore presume to expect that deference should be paid to my opinion, in preference to those of more able and learned men. I conceive, however, that enough has been said to excite a spirit of inquiry in those who have abilities and opportunity to pursue the research; and that the old beaten tract which every writer appears hitherto to have considered himself as unwarranted in deserting, having in one instance been quitted, and new ideas broached, a free scope will thus be allowed for the exercise of ingenuity and judgment, in the future investigation of this subject.\n\nIt may, perhaps, occur to the reader, that the S\u00famr\u00e1s inhabited the country through which the P\u00far\u00e1n once flowed, long after that river was deserted by the stream: and it may be proper to notice, that the P\u00far\u00e1n still received a considerable quantity of water from the new channel, when the latter was flooded; a supply was afterwards furnished to it through the small Attok*, as it is called; and at the same time an annual supply found its way through the L\u00f3h\u00e1nn\u00e1 Deri\u00e1, directly in the opposite direction to what it formerly had done; a course which it still follows in an inferior degree, as well as that through the Phitt\u00e1 Deri\u00e1, respecting which it may now be necessary to say a few words.\n\nThe Phitt\u00e1 (or \"destroyed\") channel, it will be seen, divides from the present river, not far from where the L\u00f3h\u00e1nn\u00e1 Deri\u00e1 joins it; and pursues\n\n* From A'l\u00f3r to L\u00f3heri, or L\u00f3herk\u00f3t, was formerly a nall\u00e1, according to the expression of the country.

I am inclined to this latter opinion; for when the people of A'l\u00f3r awoke Dillu R\u00e1j\u00e1 with intelligence of the river under the town being dry, he \"desired them to look in the nall\u00e1\"; but they replied, that it was needless going to search the nall\u00e1, when the river itself was dry.\"\n\nA bridge was built over the nall\u00e1, by Ghol\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h K\u00e1lh\u00f3ra, who gave it the name of the Deri\u00e1 attok, in imitation of the celebrated town and pass of that name.

The Moslems, usually laid aside their most offensive maxims:\nIn those days, the Mehr\u00e1n (Judus) flowed past the vicinity of the city of Al\u00f3r; and Dill\u00fa R\u00e1j\u00e1, hearing of the beauty of the traveller\u2019s wife, determined to seize her, as she passed the town. The merchant, finding his voyage thus interrupted, prayed to God for assistance; and employed stone-cutters to cut through a mountain which approached to the bank of the river, and built a strong rampart on the opposite side; which having effected, he passed through with his boats. From this time, the Mehr\u00e1n, deserting its ancient course, pursued the channel it at present occupies, and, notwithstanding every exertion, the city of Al\u00f3r was deserted. Saif al Mulk and his wife returned; and, with two sons, were, at their death, interred between the Der\u00e1 Gh\u00e1z\u00ed Kh\u00e1n and S\u00edtap\u00fara, where their tombs are still worshipped, near the fort of Ratt\u00e1h, a place of great antiquity.\n\nThe T\u00e1rikh-i-T\u00e1hir\u00ed states the same event to have taken place, and from the same cause; and adds, that the river from that time \u201ctook a course by Bhak\u00edr and Sehw\u00e1n; and, by its desertion of the Al\u00f3r channel, that city, and between nine hundred and a thousand towns and villages, were rendered uninhabitable; and Dill\u00fa R\u00e1j\u00e1 compelled to change his residence to Dill\u00f3r,\u201d the present Abp\u00far, near B\u00e1hmana. Such is the account given by these historians of an event of vast importance to a whole country; and however sceptical we may be as to the manner in which it was effected, the truth of the fact is corroborated by legends and tradition, which, with the evidence that may be drawn from what I have already mentioned, ought to be sufficient to substantiate it to most minds. Another argument, however, and to my mind one of great weight in favour of the ancient channel in question, is, that the capitals Al\u00f3r, B\u00e1hmana, and Wag\u00e9hk\u00e9t\u2014the two former of undoubted antiquity\u2014were situated in the neighbourhood of the P\u00far\u00e1n, and far from any river or fertile country at the present time. Now, I do not conceive it likely that the two principal cities in the empire would have been built in a desert: on the contrary, it is natural that they should have been founded on the banks of a river which nature pointed out as the source of wealth and comfort to their inhabitants.\n\nThat there is no mistake in the supposed site of Al\u00f3r, I think I may venture to assume. It is a parganah in the present S\u00edrk\u00e1r of Bhak\u00edr*, which city was built from its ruins; and the town or ruins of Al\u00f3r are as familiar to the natives of the country, as Bhak\u00edr itself is. That B\u00e1hmana, B\u00e1hbina, B\u00e1hnb\u00e1n\u00e1, or Brdhmand\u00e1b\u00e1d, as it is variously written by Persian historians, was situated on the L\u00f3h\u00e1nn\u00e1 Der\u00eda, also called the B\u00e1hmanaw\u00e1, is certified by the remains of the city still to be\n\n* M\u00edr Ma\u00e1sam.\nmany respects, would only make them more punctilious and obstinate in regard to those few which it is so much our interest and duty to get compromised, if we can, with reference to our followers. Unfortunately, these few topics are the salient points of Hind\u00faism; are precisely those points which it is the pride and glory of this state to maintain from the throne and judgment-seat, as the chief features of the public law; because, nowhere else throughout India can they be maintained in the same public and authentic manner, or any otherwise than by the domestic tribunals of the people. The distinction between Hind\u00fas on the one hand, and, on the other, outcasts of their own race, as well as all strangers indiscriminately, it is the especial duty of the judges of the land to ponder upon day and night, to pursue it through all its practical consequences, as infinitely diversified by the ceremonial observances created to guard and perpetuate it; and to visit, with the utmost vengeance of the penal code, every act by which this cardinal distinction is knowingly and essentially violated.\n\nOf all these acts, the most severely regarded is, intercourse between sexes of such parties; because of its leading directly to the confusion of all castes, of the greatness of the temptation, and of the strong inducement to concealment: and the concealment is deemed almost as bad as the crime itself; for the Hind\u00fa agent or subject will, of course, proceed, till detected, to communicate as usual with his or her relations; who again will communicate with theirs, until the foul contamination has reached the ends of the city and kingdom, and imposed upon all (besides the sin) the necessity of submitting themselves to a variety of tedious and expensive purificatory processes, pending the fulfilment of which all their pursuits of business or pleasure are necessarily suspended, and themselves rendered, for the time, outcasts. This, to be sure, is a great and real evil, deserving of severe repressive measures. But is not the evil self-created? True: but so we may not argue at Kat\u2019mandu. The law of caste is the corner-stone of Hind\u00faism. Hence the innumerable ceremonial observances, penetrating into every act of life, which have been erected to perpetuate this law; and hence the dreadful inflictions with which the breach of it is visited. Of all breaches of it, intercourse between a Hind\u00fa and an outcast of different sexes is the most enormous; but it is not, by many, the only one deemed worthy of punishment by mutilation or death. The codes of Menu and other Hind\u00fa sages are full of these strange enormities; but it is in Nep\u00e1l alone (for reasons already stated) that the sword of public justice is now wielded to realize them. It is in Nep\u00e1l alone, of all Hind\u00fa states, that two-thirds of the time of the judges is employed in the discussion of cases better fitted for the confessional, or the tribunal of public opinion, or some domestic\ncourt, such as the Panchayat of brethren or fellow-craftsmen, than for a King's Court of Justice. Not such, however, is the opinion of the Nepalese; who while they are forcing confession from young men and young women, by dint of scolding and whipping, in order to visit them afterwards with ridiculous penances or savage punishments, instead of discharging such functions with a sigh or a smile, glorify themselves in that they are thus maintaining the holy will of Brahma, enforcing from the judgment-seat those sacred institutes which elsewhere the magistrate (shame upon him!) neglects through fear, or despises as an infidel.\n\nWhen the banner of Hind\u00faism dropped from the hands of the Mahattas in 1817, they solemnly conjured the Nepalese to take it up, and wave it proudly, till it could be again unfurled in the plains by the expulsion of the vile Feringis, and the subjection of the insolent followers of Islam. But surely the British Government, so justly famous for its liberality, cannot be fairly subjected to insinuations such as this? So it may seem: but let any one turn over the pages of Menu, observe the conspicuous station assigned to the public magistrate as a censor morum under the immensely extensive and complicate system of morals there laid down, and remember, that whilst it is the Hind\u00fa magistrate's first duty to enforce them, to the British magistrate they are and have been a dead letter: let him look to the variety of dreadful inflictions assigned to violations of the law of caste, and remember, that whilst their literal fulfilment is the Hind\u00fa magistrate's most sacred obligation, British magistrates shrink with horror and disgust at the very thought of them: and he will be better prepared to appreciate and make allowance for the sentiments of Hind\u00fa sovereigns and Hind\u00fa magistrates. The Hind\u00fa sovereigns dare not, and we will not, obey the sacred mandate. But, in Nep\u00e1l, it is the pride and glory of the magistrate to obey it, literally, blindly, unbiassed by foreign example, unawed by foreign power.\n\nAn eminent old Bichari, or Judge of the Chief Court of Katmandu, to whom I am indebted for an excellent sketch of the judicial system of Nep\u00e1l, after answering all my questions on the subject, concluded with some voluntary observations of his own, from which I extract the following passage:\n\n\"Below, let man and woman commit what sin they will, there is no punishment provided, no expiatory right enjoined*. Hence Hind\u00faism is destroyed; the customs are Muhammedan; the distinctions of caste are obliterated. Here, on the contrary, all those distinctions are religiously preserved by the public courts of justice, which punish according\n\n* It is the exclusive duty of one of the highest functionaries of this government (the Dharanadikari) to prescribe the fitting penance and purificatory rites for each violation of the ceremonial law of purity.\nto caste, and never destroy the life of a Br\u00e1hman. If a female of the sacred order go astray, and her paramour be not a Br\u00e1hman, he is capitally punished; but if he be a Br\u00e1hman, he is degraded from his rank, and banished. If a female of the soldier tribes be seduced, the husband, with his own hand, kills the seducer, and cuts off the nose of the female, and expels her from his house. Then the Br\u00e1hmana or soldier husband must perform the purificatory rites enjoined, after which he is restored to his caste. Below, the S\u00e1stras are things to talk of: here, they are acted up to.\"\n\nI have, by the above remarks, endeavoured to convey an idea of the sort of feeling relative to them which prevails in Nep\u00e1l. It will serve, I hope, as a sort of apology for the Nep\u00e1lese; but will, I fear, also serve to demonstrate the small probability there exists of our inducing the Durb\u00e1r to waive in our favour so cherished a point of religion, and, I may add, of policy; for they are well aware of the effect of this rigour, in tending to facilitate the restricted intercourse between the Nep\u00e1lese and our followers, a restriction which they seek to maintain with Chinese pertinacity. Besides, the S\u00e1stras are holy things, and frail as holy; and no Hind\u00fa of tolerable shrewdness will submit a single text of them, if he can avoid it, to the calm, free glance of European intellect.\n\nHaving already given the most abundant materials* for judging of the general tenor of the judicial proceedings and of the laws of Nep\u00e1l, it will not be necessary (or possible), in this paper, to do more than briefly apply them, as regards that intercourse between a Hind\u00fa and a non-Hind\u00fa, at present under discussion.\n\nThe customary law or licence which permits the injured husband in Nep\u00e1l to be his own avenger, is confined to the Parbatiahs, the principal divisions of whom are the Br\u00e1hmans, the Kh\u00e1s, the Magars, and the Gurungs. The New\u00e1rs, Murmis, Kachar Bhoteahs, Kirantis\u2020, and other inhabitants of Nep\u00e1l, possess no such privilege. They must seek redress from the courts of justice; which, guiding themselves by the custom of these tribes prior to the conquest, award to the injured husband a small pecuniary compensation, which the injurer is compelled to pay.\n\nNothing further, therefore, need at present be said of them. In regard to the Parbatiahs, every injured husband has the option, if he please, of appealing to the courts, instead of using his own sword: but any one, save a learned Br\u00e1hman or a helpless boy, who should do so, would be covered with eternal disgrace. A Br\u00e1hman who follows his holy calling cannot, consistently with usage, play the avenger; but a Brahman\n\n* In allusion to other Papers by Mr. Hodgson.\u2014Ed.\n\u2020 I hope, ere long, to be able to furnish some curious and interesting particulars of the history, character, and manners of these peculiar races.\nexpensive but the lowest must segregate themselves from society till these ties are completed. But there are many sorts of contact between a Hindu and a non-Hindu, or outcast, the sin of which is inseparable, and the penalty death. Such a intercourse between the sexes, that by a primary law the lives and members of Brahmins, and the lives of women, are sacred. Subject to the modification of the primary laws, the minor vengeances of the caste are reserved for this continuous sin. When so offending are taken in death. Women have their noses elongated, are rendered impotent, if they have caused a loss, and are banished the kingdom.\n\nA male outcast, even the intercourse under any circumstances, with a pure Hindu female, and whether the female be the seducer or the seduced, is liable, also, to extreme outrage, or a woman, is subjected to die; and the female a thousand assassins and an outrage: unless of the sacred order, when she goes in secret. If a common female gives herself off for one of a pure caste, and have commerce with a Hindu, she shall have her nose cut off; and he if he wishes to do so sooner as he discovers it, shall be subjected to death by justice and purification; but if he have committed sacrilege, even with a female, he shall be emasculated, and made an outcast. If a Hindu, in one of lower degree, but still a pure, have commerce with a Brahmani, he shall suffer death; otherwise as a prostitute, and then he shall go free.\n\nIf Hindu have commerce with a Kh\u00e2ni, she having been a widow at that time, he shall die. If she were a maid, and shall be heavily fined: if a wanton, he shall go free.\n\nHowever low, where water will pass from hand to hand, are cases of life or limb, from such commerce with any others than a Hindu female.

By Captain Henry Harkness, Secretary to the Royal Asiatic Society, late Secretary to the College of Fort St. George, &c. &c.\n\nThe following remarks refer more particularly to the Southern Peninsula of India; but they may perhaps be considered to apply equally, with regard to her ancient institutions of this nature, to India in general; as the Southern Peninsula has undergone, comparatively, but little change from foreign conquest and domination.\n\nThe system of education throughout the peninsula being nearly the same, whatever may be the language or shade of difference in the people of any particular part or nation, an exposition of that which is followed by one portion of its inhabitants may, with some allowances, which a few observations will explain, be considered as applicable to the whole. I shall therefore select the Tamil, or the School of that nation or people of the South whose vernacular language is the Tamil.\n\nIn almost every village, the schoolmaster is a member of the community. A manie and pizhakadai, or house and back-yard, are given to him by the village. He is allowed to exact fees from his scholars, which, with the presents that custom has established as due to him from the parents, at particular periods and on particular occasions, form the sources of his emolument.\n\nThe school is open to every S\u00fadra and Br\u00e1hmana boy* of the village; but not to boys of inferior or stranger tribes, unless by the sufferance of the community, and generally on the payment of a small monthly stipend, or the performance of some particular service, by the parents of the boys so admitted.\n\nThe hours of attendance at school are from sun-rise to sun-set; allowing one hour at mid-day, for refreshment or repose.\n\nA boy is first taken to school when he has attained his fifth year. The period of his quitting it is uncertain; but to enter him as a votary of Sarasvati, the Goddess of Learning, is considered a duty too sacred to be neglected, even by the poorest of the S\u00fadra tribes.\n\nThe sounds of the vowels and consonants, first separately and then combined, being taught, to which considerable attention is paid in order to ensure a just pronunciation, the boy is instructed to write or draw, in a bed of sand, the letter or sign representing these sounds; and thus, by a reciprocity of action between sign and sound, to fix them both in his memory.\n\n* The four tribes or castes are, the Br\u00e1hmans, Kshatriyas, Vaisyas, and S\u00fadras. All without this pale are considered impure; and among these are included Europeans, and all other foreigners.\nof the korah*: but all this is done in the full eye, and in an open tribunal; and though innocence, its by far more common effect with respect to ourselves, the mere present pending the trial of one of our followers least abuse, in regard to him.

At all events, deep dishonour, heavy, are his certain portion; and if it should be malice, he shall surely suffer the doom he has accused, be it greater or be it less. Informers have evidently no personal interest in the retainers of the Durb\u00e1r, or of the Minister, under a Hind\u00fa government, to bring under breaches of the law of caste, and of the crimes they may chance to discover, are, of course, informers; but they are liable, like ordinary men, of seeing their credit in society ruined, in event of purification by ordeal, with its consequent fines. Ordeals, however, whether for proving or clearing of the accuser, are rare, extraordinary admitted where there is sufficient testimony whatever quantity of testimony be adduced, must still be had.

V.\u2014Description of Ancient Chinese Vases; with Inscriptions illustrative of the History of the Shang Dynasty of Chinese Sovereigns, who reigned from about 1756 to 1112 B.C.* Translated from the Original Work, entitled P\u014d-koo-too, by Peter Perring Thoms, Esq.\n\nRead 16 June, 1832.\n\nPREFACE.\n\nThe accompanying illustrations, with their descriptions, have been taken from an ancient Chinese work, entitled, \u535a\u53e4\u5716 P\u014d-koo-too, which extends to sixteen large Chinese volumes, and contains several hundred plates of sacred vases, jugs, bottles, &c., &c., of the Shang, Chow, and Han dynasties, comprehending about 1784 years. The compilers of this work were doubtless at considerable trouble and expense; for they state that they examined most of the vases, &c., themselves, and that such as did not come under their notice were copied from works of unquestionable authority.\n\nFrom the appearance of the work, and the number of plates it contains, all classed and arranged according to the several periods to which the vessels are supposed to have belonged, it resembles the description of some public Museum, rather than that of the collections of private individuals. Though the Chinese have not had a national institution where ancient relics might be deposited, their history clearly proves that under every dynasty persons of eminence have collected, at considerable expense, objects of interest for their rarity or value. Confucius mentions, in his Chun-tsew, or History of the kingdom of Loo (B.C. 2142 to 1756), that the Minister Lin-tsze, on the founder of the Hea dynasty possessing himself of the empire, made great exertions to obtain whatever was rare and valuable from its antiquity: and it is also recorded of the ambitious Minister Tung-ch\u014d (A.D. 200) that, on his being appointed governor of the new city Mei-too, he sent persons in various directions throughout the empire, at a great expense, to procure vases and whatever was esteemed curious: the historian states that he thus obtained some vases that were deemed highly valuable. Approaching our own times, it is well known that Yuen-yuen, the late Viceroy of Canton, had collected an extensive museum of whatever was considered\n\n* According to the Chronology of P. Gaubil, this Dynasty commenced B.C. 1766, and terminated B.C. 1132. The Chronology as arranged by Dr. Morrison is that followed in this paper.\nThere is no positive testimony, and particularly directed to\nnot clearly urged upon the and coins, and commemo-\nacknowledgment, the published a few years before\nwere he refuse' of these inscriptions, however\npartly be rem- supplies the defective characters,\nbutting the c original significations of the same\nattempt to very dissimilar. But, however much Chinese\nmust be indebted to the industry and literary researches\nwhich were doubtless very great, and to those of the\nwork under consideration, they are\nindebted to the violent acts of various despots than\nmore indebted to the literati. The tyrant Tsin-ch\u00e9 Hwang-te, who built the\ngreat wall of China, intent on establishing a new era, and unwilling\nthat the ancients should afford a model for his government, ordered that\nall memorials of antiquity should be destroyed, and that all documents and\nbooks should be consigned to the flames. Those of the literati who\npertinaciously adhered to former usages were either imprisoned or\nburied alive; then it was that the sacred vases of the Hca, Shang, and\nChou dynasties, which had been transmitted from father to son, with\nbooks of every description, were concealed by those who set a value\non them, till after the death of the tyrant, when they were dug up,\nand highly esteemed. At one period of Chinese history, a custom seems\nto have prevailed of interring, with the dead, honorary vases, which\nreposed with them for ages, till the civil wars about A.D. 200, when\nthe graves of the ancient monarchs and eminent statesmen were dug up,\nand their ashes dispersed: many of these ancient relics were then dis-\ncovered; and, a new order of things having been established, they have\nbeen preserved to the present period.\n\nAccording to the celebrated historian Choo-foo-tsz\u00e9, Fuch-he, the\nfirst sovereign of China, began to reign about A.M. 635, and was suc-\nceeded by Shun-sung, and Hwang-te, including a period of 630 years:\nthey were succeeded by the \"Five Emperors,\" who are said to have\nreigned 395 years; near the close of which period, according to the\nChinese, the Deluge took place; and it is remarkable that this event is\nstated to have occurred within a few years of the time mentioned by Moses.\nAt the termination of the period assigned to the \"Five Emperors\" com-\nmenced the Hca dynasty, which lasted 412 years. The events spoken of,\nand the period assigned to these latter sovereigns, are allowed to be\nconsistent with the life of man in this early age: and hence authentic\nhistory is thought by some Chinese writers to commence with the Hca\ndynasty. On the decline of the Hca family, Ching-tang, a person of\nhad recourse to arms; and having distinguished himself by\nsaid, in his assertions of historical accounts, to have adopted the principle of Herodotus\u2014of advancing as a fact only what he had seen, and relating as tradition what had been mentioned to him by others.\n\n\"I have two other Papers in my possession: one of which is a Description of the River Indus, which the Geographical Society here have prepared for publication; and a History of Sindh. This latter I shall do myself the pleasure to forward, by an early opportunity.\n\n\"In order that the Paper I now transmit may appear to the Society in the light it deserves, I beg to add, that I have compared the writing of the original with Captain McMurdo's signature and hand-writing in other documents, and feel perfectly convinced of their similarity.\n\n\"I have the honour to remain,\n\n\"Sir,\n\n\"Your obedient servant,\n\n(Signed) \"Ed. Frederick.\"\n\nCAPTAIN MC MURDO'S PAPER.\n\nBefore I proceed to a description of the River Indus as it at present exists, I shall endeavour to throw some light upon the nature and courses of this noble stream, as they have stood at different periods in its ancient history. It is necessary to premise, that, in advancing any opinion on the subject, I shall be guided entirely by such lights as have been occasionally discovered in the native histories of the times, and in the course of a laborious and protracted investigation, conducted chiefly by means of natives well acquainted with the country through which the River Indus flows. I must however candidly confess my conviction, that the state of this stream, even so late as twenty-five years ago, cannot be correctly ascertained; and that its ancient course is involved in an obscurity, that no conclusions drawn, either from records of an early date, or from modern observation, will ever succeed in entirely dispelling. In the course of my remarks, I feel that I shall be compelled to differ in opinion with able and learned writers; in whose theory of the ancient Indus, if I should appear not on all occasions to concur, yet, as my own sentiments will, I trust, be found stated without presumption, I indulge a hope of standing acquitted of any intention to enter the lists with such talent as has been employed on this subject, or of invidiously attacking a system, which, if not absolutely correct, displays a degree of ingenuity and research, far beyond what could have been expected from writers who had never visited India, or at least those parts connected in any\nway with the river, and whose sources of information must, from the\nlittle intercourse that Europeans have ever had with Sindhi, have been\nno less obscure than limited.\n\nThe River Indus is known in the earliest of the Sacred Hind\u00fa\nwritings by the name of Sindh or Sindh\u00fa, a term applied, in the same\nlanguage, to the ocean; and the river may have received the appellation,\neither from its size, or perhaps metaphorically, from the abundance of\nevery necessary of life produced by its periodical floods. The country,\non the same authority, is called Sindh\u00fadesa, or the country of Sindh\u00fa;\nbut whether the river took its name from the former, or that of the\ncountry had its rise in the latter, it is impossible to determine. I am\nnot prepared to assert that the term Sindh\u00fa originally attached to the\nriver, higher up in its course than where the junction of the several tri-\nbutaries form one stream; indeed, I am inclined to suppose otherwise:\nfor although, at the period of the Muhammedan conquest, and perhaps\nlong prior to the commencement of the era of Islam, the territories of\nthe sovereigns of Afganistan extended nearly to the confines of Kashmir, yet\nit is probable that their original sovereignty was Sindh\u00fadesa; which,\nfrom the situation of the two capitals, and other large towns in their\ndominions, would appear to indicate the country lying south of Mult\u00e1n;\nan opinion corroborated by prevalent tradition, and indeed by the un-\nderstanding of the present generation, that Sindh, or Sindh\u00fadesa Proper,\nincludes a small portion of the southern part of Sindh, chiefly on the\neastern bank of the Indus. When the Arabs entered the province, we\nfind that the proper name Sindh was very much out of use, and that the\nsame channel of the river took names from the different cities, towns,\nand even villages, beneath which it chanced to flow. This practice,\nwhich had perhaps obtained for centuries in all the varieties to which it\nis naturally subject, and which is still prevalent, is the principal cause\nof the confused mixture of names of rivers, which are constantly floating\non the mind of the investigator, and involving him in a maze of diffi-\nculty, which he finds it utterly impossible to unravel, and the varieties of\nwhich he cannot satisfactorily reconcile.\n\nThe peculiar nature of this river, the lowness of its banks in many\nplaces, the height to which its waters rise above the level of the surround-\ning country in others, the great declination from the north which is gene-\nrally allowed to be a characteristic of the Indus, are circumstances which,\nas the soil is loose and sandy, combine to expose its channels to great\nand frequent changes: nor does this apply alone to the delta, as in other\nlarge streams; for I believe I shall be able to shew, in the sequel, that\nsuch material alterations have from time to time occurred in the courses\nof the Indus far above the delta, as at present understood, as must be acknowledged to render it a matter of the greatest difficulty, if not absolutely impossible, to reconcile the ancient and modern streams.\n\nIn the course of my reading, and verbal inquiry while compiling the History of Sindh, I was struck by the great difference between the inhabited part of the country as it existed at the time of the Arab invasion, twelve centuries ago, and as it stood at the time of the Arghur conquest, or indeed as it is at the present day. In the battle which was fought under the walls of Alor, and which decided the fate of Sindh, historians relate*, that when the troops of Rao Dahir fled in confusion, they rushed in numbers to the river and were drowned, and that the body of the prince was discovered in a ravine leading to the bed of the river. We also learn from the same sources\u2020, that Alor was situated on a stream of the Indus that was navigable to the sea. Bahanabad (the Brahmana of the Hind\u00fas), according to the last-quoted author, was situated on a stream of the Indus called Patan Bahan, afterwards known by the name of the Lohanna Deria. Both the authors now quoted, agree in stating, that, until some years after the Arab conquest, the district of Thatta was by no means well peopled, or productive; and that it was originally an uninhabited sand desert, or covered with the sea. The rich and fertile tracts of Sindh, the consequences of abundance of water, were then the districts included in the ancient Dirak, or modern Chachgam and Badban divisions, a range of country bordering on the desert, and now indebted for a scanty supply of water to artificial canals.\n\nThe foregoing facts first led me to suspect that a great body of the waters of this vast river found their way to the sea by a more eastern course than that which is at present followed by the main stream; and the inquiries and investigations which succeeded, although they added further conviction to my mind, were nevertheless attended with so many contrarieties to be reconciled, and so much confusion to be cleared up, that although I have frequently thought the different points sufficiently illustrated for my own conception, yet their succinctness, on committing them to paper, has proved far below my expectations. Such as they are, however, I venture to present them to the notice of those who are better able to do justice to a subject of such intricacy and interest.\n\nThe channel, which I suppose the Indus to have occupied at the above-mentioned early period, is still to be seen. It lies to the eastward, and parallel to the present stream, at a distance of between sixty and eighty miles. This channel is now known by the name of the Purana Deria, or \"ancient river;\" and on its banks, or their vicinity, are to be traced the remains of the ancient and celebrated cities of Alor,\n\n* Mir Maasam. \u2020 Tohfat al Giram; T\u00e1rikh-i-T\u00e1hir\u00ed\nB\u00e1hmana, Abp\u00far, and Wagehk\u00f3t, the capital of the S\u00famr\u00e1hs. I have not found it practicable to trace, with the precision I could wish, the exact spot where the P\u00far\u00e1na channel separates from the present stream. That it was above Bhak\u00edr is certain; and several accounts that I have had, state that it is at a place now called Syyed Ganj Bakhsh, about forty miles above the former city. I suppose, therefore, that the P\u00far\u00e1n passed to the eastward of the modern town of Bhak\u00edr, perhaps twenty miles, and flowed to Al\u00f3r; from whence it pursued its course south to the neighbourhood of B\u00e1hmana; which town was situated, as will be seen by a reference to the map, a few miles to the westward of the river, upon a branch called (formerly) the \"L\u00f3h\u00e1nn\u00e1 Deri\u00e1,\" or the L\u00f3h\u00e1nn\u00e1 river, but now generally known by the name of the B\u00e1hmanaw\u00e1, or \"the canal of B\u00e1hmana.\"\n\nIn the latitude of this latter town, and about twenty miles east from it, a division took place in the P\u00far\u00e1n: one branch, still retaining the name, travelled south, and, fertilizing the now sterile districts bordering on the great desert, passing through the J\u00f3ne and Badban Parganah, fell into the present river, near Allah Bandar, where, spreading itself over the flat country, it found its way into the sea, through the Lakpat river; which I conceive to have been, as it is at this moment, the easternmost branch of the Indus. That this branch formed a lake near its mouth, is mentioned by Arri\u00e1n; and the name of N\u00e1r\u00e1yana Sirowar*, which, with K\u00f3ti\u015bwara, is situated on this river, about twenty miles s.w. of Lakpat Bandar, proves that a lake of some kind did actually exist in that quarter. These two places are extremely ancient; and are mentioned in the Hind\u00fa P\u00far\u00e1nas, as places of worship\u2020. I shall have occasion hereafter to return to this part of the subject; but it may not be superfluous to remark, that the remains of a lake, or of the waters of the Indus having spread themselves to an uncommon extent, are evident in the marshy ground lying between Allah Bandar and Lakpat on the north and south, and the present delta of the river and the Runn or marsh lands to the north of Cutch on the east and west. For the present, it will be proper to return to the division of the P\u00far\u00e1n, and, for the sake of perspicuity, trace the westernmost branch of the Indus.\n\nThis stream, at one period called the L\u00f3h\u00e1nn\u00e1 Deri\u00e1\u2021, separating\n\n* The lake of N\u00e1r\u00e1yana.\n\u2020 There is still a small tank or piece of water at N\u00e1r\u00e1yana Sirowar, in which the Hind\u00fas bathe, to purify themselves of their sins: there is also a town surrounded by a wall belonging to Cutch. K\u00f3ti\u015bwara is a Pagoda or Hind\u00fa Temple, and a small village on the bank of the river, one mile from N\u00e1r\u00e1yana Sirowar. The water is salt.\n\u2021 Ayhamk\u00f3t, or Ayham, L\u00f3h\u00e1nn\u00e1's city, is said to have been situated on this river,\nfrom the P\u00far\u00e1n, pursued a course westerly as far as the modern K'ho-d\u00e1b\u00e1d, or perhaps between that place and H\u00e1lkandi; where, joining the present channel, it crossed that course; and fell into the sea at Dibal, after passing the ancient Bhamb\u00f3r*, the ruins of which city are to be seen about twenty miles on the road from T'hatta to Kar\u00e1tch\u00e9. Although I cannot satisfactorily establish the exact spot where this branch separates from the channel at present forming the river, yet that it ran to the westward of T'hatta is mentioned in the Tabk\u00e1l-i-Akbar\u00ed, an historical work of some repute; and, indeed, this is generally allowed to be the case: however doubtful this may be, it is a well-established fact, that at Gag\u00e1h, between Kar\u00e1tch\u00e9 and T'hatta, and where the ruins of Bhamb\u00f3r are still to be seen, is a creek terminating in a sandy channel \u2020, communicating with the sea, which the tradition of the country, known to all, asserts to have been a mouth of the Indus. A reference to M. de la Rochette's map will shew a similar branch to this, actually crossing the present channel at H\u00e1lkandi, and passing the westward to Dibal: on this branch he has placed S\u00e1ras\u00e1n.\n\nBhamb\u00f3r was a city, the seat of a chieftain named Bhambo R\u00e1j\u00e1\u2021, who lived about the end of the tenth century. That it was a town of considerable note, and very populous, we learn from an author who states that the S\u00e1ki\u00e1 Parganah \u00a7 was peopled from Bhamb\u00f3r when that city and its surrounding country were deserted from a failure in the river, which, now passing close to T'hatta (still to the west however), fell into the sea, near L\u00e1ri Bandar. Independently of the testimony already adduced of Bhamb\u00f3r having been on the bank of a branch of the Indus, we have that of the Tohfat al Gir\u00e1m, and the ancient legends and ballads of Sindh, to a circumstance from which we may infer that the Loh\u00e1nn\u00e1 Deri\u00e1 did actually flow past the city in question. The circumstance to which I allude, is that of the female infant of an inhabitant of a town on that branch having been floated to Bhamb\u00f3r in a chest or basket, where it was saved by some washermen, and carried to their master, under whose care it was reared, and afterwards gave rise to one of the most popular ballads in the Sindhi language. It appears that the parents of the child wished to destroy it; but being saved as already described, in a few years she displayed a degree of personal beauty far beyond the common standard, and received, in consequence, the name of Susi, or \"the Moon.\" The legends relate an attachment\n\nriver, which gave the name to the stream.\u2014A'gham is by some supposed to have been A'bpur, which is comparatively a modern name.\n\n* Or Bhambor\u00e1.\u2014I believe that this city did not exist until the first Dibal was deserted.\n\n\u2020 Mr. Maxfield's Journal. \u2021 Tohfat al Gir\u00e1m. \u00a7 M\u00edr T\u00e1hir.\nThis beautiful vase measured, in height, four inches two-tenths; its ears, one inch in height, and one inch two-tenths broad. Its internal depth was two inches and eight-tenths; at the mouth, three inches and eight-tenths; at the base, two inches two-tenths. It contained rather more than a quart, and weighed nearly two pounds. The inscription on the body is Tsz\u00e9, \"a son.\" One authority affirms, that it belongs to the Shang dynasty; and hence often found in tombs. Another states, that it implied that the vase was given from son to son, and from grandson to grandchild. As the date is not known, it is concluded, from the form, that it may be anterior to the Chow dynasty, which claimed descent from the Heaou-t\u00e9en ornament, or Egyptian scroll, as it has been explained under Vase II., is composed of the vase, leaving a third for the inscription.\nIn those days, the Mehr\u00e1n (Indus) flowed past the vicinity of the city of Al\u00f3r; and Dill\u00fa R\u00e1j\u00e1, hearing of the beauty of the traveller's wife, determined to seize her, as she passed the town. The merchant, finding his voyage thus interrupted, prayed to God for assistance; and employed stone-cutters to cut through a mountain which approached to the bank of the river, and built a strong rampart on the opposite side; which having effected, he passed through with his boats. From this time, the Mehr\u00e1n, deserting its ancient course, pursued the channel it at present occupies, and, notwithstanding every exertion, the city of Al\u00f3r was deserted. Saif al Mulk and his wife returned; and, with two sons, were, at their death, interred between the Der\u00e1 Gh\u00e1zi Kh\u00e1n and S\u00edtap\u00fara, where their tombs are still worshipped, near the fort of Ratt\u00e1h, a place of great antiquity.\n\nThe T\u00e1rikh-i-T\u00e1hir\u00ed states the same event to have taken place, and from the same cause; and adds, that the river from that time \"took a course by Bhak\u00edr and Sehw\u00e1n;\" and, by its desertion of the Al\u00f3r channel, that city, and between nine hundred and a thousand towns and villages, were rendered uninhabitable; and Dill\u00fa R\u00e1j\u00e1 compelled to change his residence to Dill\u00f3r,\" the present Abp\u00far, near B\u00e1hmana. Such is the account given by these historians of an event of vast importance to a whole country; and however sceptical we may be as to the manner in which it was effected, the truth of the fact is corroborated by legends and tradition, which, with the evidence that may be drawn from what I have already mentioned, ought to be sufficient to substantiate it to most minds. Another argument, however, and to my mind one of great weight in favour of the ancient channel in question, is, that the capitals Al\u00f3r, B\u00e1hmana, and Wag\u00e9hk\u00f3l\u2014the two former of undoubted antiquity\u2014were situated in the neighbourhood of the P\u00far\u00e1n, and far from any river or fertile country at the present time. Now, I do not conceive it likely that the two principal cities in the empire would have been built in a desert: on the contrary, it is natural that they should have been founded on the banks of a river which nature pointed out as the source of wealth and comfort to their inhabitants.\n\nThat there is no mistake in the supposed site of Al\u00f3r, I think I may venture to assume. It is a parganah in the present Sirk\u00e1r of Bhak\u00edr*, which city was built from its ruins; and the town or ruins of Al\u00f3r are as familiar to the natives of the country, as Bhak\u00edr itself is. That B\u00e1hmana, B\u00e1hbina, B\u00e1hnb\u00e1n\u00e1, or Br\u00e1hman\u00e1b\u00e1d, as it is variously written by Persian historians, was situated on the L\u00f3h\u00e1nn\u00e1 Deri\u00e1, also called the B\u00e1hmanaw\u00e1, is certified by the remains of the city still to be\n\n* M\u00edr Ma\u00e1sam.\nexhibit only a single character each, it is thought to the Hea or Shang dynasties, doubtless not to exceed them. Hence their age cannot be less than the time when the patriarch Joseph was born.\n\nDuring the reign of Ching-tang, there was at the close of which the historian records, that the sacred mulberry-grove, where, after praying, he himself:\u2014\"Have I (the emperor) incautiously deprived my people? Have I deprived my people of their revenue on my palaces? Have I added concubines? in consequence of being emperor, as though they were the grass of the field to sycophants?\" It is stated, that before his examination of himself, a heavy rain fell over a Hence it is conjectured, that a new vase was made event.\n\nV1.\n\nThis vase measured in height five Chinese inches; ears were one inch and two-tenths in height.\nA golden vase, that measured six Chinese inches and four-tenths in height; its ears one inch and two-tenths, and the same in breadth; its internal depth, three inches and three-tenths. In front, at top, it measured five inches and five-tenths; in width, four inches and one-tenth. At the bottom, in front, five inches and six-tenths; at the bottom, in width, four inches and two-tenths. It contained rather more than an English quart. It weighed five Chinese pounds and nine ounces; and had four feet, with the above inscription. The square is the character \u4e9e, having a dragon within. Below it are the two characters \u7236\u4e01 Foo-ting.\n\nThe P'o-koo-too says, that \u4e9e should here be understood as a house, temple, or a niche for an idol; and that Foo-ting is a general term for vases of this dynasty. The Teih-koo-chae \u7a4d\u53e4\u9f4b by Yuen-yuen, the late Viceroy of Canton, the learned work on ancient inscriptions, before mentioned, says that this vase is now in the possession of Wang-she, in Keang-nan; and that there are a great many vases extant\n\nFrom the Sung dynasty, and downwards, it has been affirmed, that \u4e9e was anciently an ornament\nbelong to the Shang dynasty. The ears, rim, and feet of this vase are plain; and two-thirds of it are ornamented in the Haou-fien and Luy-wan style of relief.\u2014See Vases II. & IV.\n\nXI.\n\nThis vase measured, in height, five Chinese inches and one-tenth; its ears, one inch and two-tenths; and in width, one inch and four-tenths: its internal depth, three inches and three-tenths: its circumference, at the mouth, five inches; round the centre, five inches and five-tenths. It contained about a quart; and weighed two Chinese pounds and six ounces. It had three feet, with an inscription of a youth grasping a weapon, with the characters \u7236\u5df1 Foo-ke. Of the dynasties Hia, Shang, and Chow, Shang was the period in which the deities were mostly revered; and when sacrificing, great reverence was observed.\u2014The hieroglyphic form of the character was not then confined exclusively to vessels, such as we have been describing, as it is found also on vessels containing fragrant wine: all inscriptions in which \u5b50 Tsze are placed, imply the exertions of the utmost effort in discharging the duties of the situation that a person fills. During reigns of the early sovereigns, sons, when waiting on their parents at meals, were required to use the \u58fa hu-an, or ornamented knife, and carve, and hand round to them food. At each period in life they were taught particular\nceremonies. At a certain age, and on special occasions, the youths, on entering the presence of their parents, were required to hold a kind of spear or battle-axe; and, when able to attend to agriculture, they bore before them the ploughshare. Such conduct, it is observed, was considered the height of filial respect. 'If thus respectful to parents, how much more did it become them to be so when worshipping the gods!'\n\nIt is supposed that \u7236\u5df1 Foo-ke alludes to \u96cd\u5df1 Yung-ke, who reigned about 1627 B.C. It was his custom to sacrifice three times a year. In consequence of the nobles refusing to repair to his court, he resigned the throne; and his brother \u592a\u620a Tae-woo, who succeeded him, is supposed to have made use of this vase when worshipping in the temple of his ancestors. Of Tae-woo it is recorded, that he was a virtuous sovereign; that in his government he imitated the ancient worthies\u2014that he nourished his people, and was revered by all the nobles of the surrounding states or principalities; of whom, on one occasion, no fewer than seventy-six attended at his court.\n\nXII.\n\nThis vase measured, in height, five Chinese inches and nine-tenths: its ears were one inch and four-tenths high, and one inch and five-tenths\nbelong to the Shang dynasty. The ears, rim, plain; and two-thirds of it are ornamented in the Luy-wan style of relief.\u2014See Vases II. & IV.\n\nThis vase measured, in height, five Chinese inches; in diameter, three inches; in width, two inches; in depth, one inch and two-tenths; and in width, its internal depth, three inches and three-tenths; round the mouth, five inches; round the centre, five inches; contained about a quart; and weighed two ounces. It had three feet, with an inscription on each, and a handle on the side. It was a weapon, with the characters \u7236\u5df1 Foo-kai.\n\nShang, and Chow, Shang was the period when the ancestors were mostly revered; and when sacrificing, great reverence was paid to them. The hieroglyphic form of the character was not unlike that of the present day. It was used in connection with tripods, such as we have been describing, and other vessels for containing fragrant wine: all inscriptions, whether on tripods or vessels, which are combined, imply the exertions of the utmost reverence for the duties of the situation that a person fills. In ancient times, the sovereigns, sons, when waiting on their parents, were accustomed to take the \u9e7f hwan, or ornamented knife, as a sign of respect to their sires. At each period in life the\nand is what the good man carefully avoids: hence the propriety of engraving it on a vase. By some it is thought to be a person's name; for during the thirteenth year of Chow-kung, there was a \u516c\u5b6b Kung-chae, and a \u516c\u5b6b Kung-tsun-chae, and others. Hence we may presume that the family name of Chae existed under the Shang dynasty.\n\nXIV.\n\nThis vase measured, in height, six Chinese inches and one-tenth; its ears were one inch in height, and in breadth one inch and two-tenths. Its internal depth, three inches and six-tenths. Its circumference, at the mouth, five inches and three-tenths; round the centre, five inches and six-tenths. It had three legs, and weighed four Chinese pounds and a-half.\n\nGan-wan-gan, in explanation of the inscription upon this vase, says, that the ancient form of Ping \u79c9 \"to grasp hold of,\" is composed of the ancient form of \u7c73 \"grain,\" and \u53c8 Yew \"the hand.\" But he was unable to give any meaning to \u79c9\u4ef2 Ping-chung, the two centre characters of the inscription. Yuen-yuen, the late viceroy of Canton, who\nbroad. Its internal depth was three inches and five inches and six-tenths. It weighed five Chinese pounds and two ounces, and had an inscription of three characters.\n\nThe inscription consists of an upright lance, called Foo-kwei. Besides this vase, there is a bronze tripod, with a lance or spear; a tripod, with a lance laid diagonally across it, kind of wine-cup, having a lance depicted on it, called Foo-kwei.\n\nThis vase measured, in height, nine Chinese inches; its ears two inches in height, and one inch in diameter. Its internal depth, six inches and three-tenths; around the mouth, eight inches and six-tenths; around the body, seven-tenths. It contained about five English pints, fourteen Chinese pounds and two ounces. The inscription is a hieroglyphic representation of a scorpion; from the common seal form, it is concluded that the sting of a scorpion, however small, is...\ntion of two hands, offering or rendering assistance. In three corners of\nthe square the character Ting occurs repeated. Foo-ke\u00e4 near the centre,\nand Yi\u00e4, on the left side of the standard. Kwei occurs under the first Ting. In this brief inscription there are\nno fewer than four astronomical characters. The character Foo \"father,\" indicates this vase to have been sacred to the head of a family,\nand not intended for the use of the sons during the father's life.\n\nThe characters which are applied to the nine standards are derived\nfrom Ke, which is the modern form of the hieroglyphical character\nfor standard. The standard of a Choo-how, or Duke, was called\nKe; a Keun-le, or General, Ke; a Koo-leang, Chen; the\nhigher officers of state Yu; those of the secondary rank, who had\none or more dragons depicted on their standards, Chaou, &c. &c.\nThe offering of any thing with both hands indicates veneration for the\nthing offered, or the person to whom it was offered. The She-king\nremarks, that \"all officers, when sacrificing, appear in their state dress;\nand the virtues of the sages, in venerating their ancestors, cannot be\nexcelled.\"\n\nThe Chinese have ten astronomical characters; and twelve characters for\nthe divisions of the day. The inscriptions on vases, &c., during the Shang\ndynasty were brief, the day only being mentioned; but during the Chow\ndynasty the hour has been given. In remote antiquity, the days were\ndistinguished into Jow-jih, \"soft day,\" and Kang-jih \"hard\nday.\" Other writers have designated them Yin and Yang,\n\"male and female\" days, synonymous with lucky and unlucky days.\nMarriage sacrifices, and those offered on other domestic occasions,\nwere presented on a Jow-jih, or \"soft day;\" those on military, or\nsimilar occasions, were invariably offered on a Kang-jih, or \"hard\nday.\" Probably to this custom may be traced the present felicitous\nand infelicitous days, days which are considered proper or improper for\nsacrifices, &c. This vase having the character Ke\u00e4, it was made\nuse of on a Kang-jih, \"hard day;\" consequently on a military occasion.\nIts workmanship being exquisite, it is supposed to have been made during\nthe tranquil period of the Shang dynasty.\nhad successfully explained many ancient inscriptions, side characters, which the compilers of the P\u014d-ka cipher, are \u7532 Chwang and \u4e59 Peen; and \u4ef2 Chung, but \u76ee M\u00fch, \u201cthe eye;\u201d which, \u679c \u201ca vase.\u201d Hence the inscription is Ping' probable.\n\nXV.\n\nThis vase, in height, measured five Chinese inches; its ears were one inch and one-tenth in height, three-tenths. Its internal depth was two inches; circumference, at top, four inches and nine-tenths; inches and two-tenths. It weighed three Chinese pounds, and had three feet, with an inscription of eight characters, the character A.\n\nJ\u014d \u82e5 the highest character, is supposed That beneath it, on the left, represents an eye power. The third character, on the right, is a\nThis vase measured, in height, five Chinese inches and five-tenths; its ears were one inch in height, in breadth one inch and four-tenths. Its internal depth, three inches and five-tenths; its circumference, at the neck, five inches and two-tenths; the centre, five inches.

They sacrificed to heaven on a circular eminence; and to earth on a square eminence; remote from the capital. To the sun, in the royal palace; to the moon, in the Ya-ming palace (Ya-ming signifies a bright night); to the stars, in the Yew-yung palace. Each deity or spirit had a place set apart, in which it was worshipped, and where its influence was solicited. The offerings were of such things as were produced at those particular periods of the year when the sacrifice was made.\n\nOf the jugs of the Chow dynasty that have been handed down, there are two; one with the sun and stars depicted on it, and another with the moon and stars. The above vase having a moon and fish depicted on it, it is supposed that a fish was the offering made use of when worshipping the moon. The She-king, in reference to sacrificing to the moon, has these lines:\u2014\nThe characters on the box are measured in length, five inches each and two inches wide, and appear three inches and two inches high. The box is made out of wood, inlaid with ivory, and is the bottom, in front, five inches square. I was unable to determine its date or purpose and could not make any description. The characters on the box appeared to be the name of a person's name, but I am unsure of what it signifies on the top most when it is not mentioned. There is another box with a similar appearance belonging to the\nA golden vase, that measured six Chinese inches and four-tenths in height; its ears one inch and two-tenths, and the same in breadth; its internal depth, three inches and three-tenths. In front, at top, it measured five inches and five-tenths; in width, four inches and one-tenth. At the bottom, in front, five inches and six-tenths; at the bottom, in width, four inches and two-tenths. It contained rather more than an English quart. It weighed five Chinese pounds and nine ounces; and had four feet, with the above inscription. The square is the character \u4e9e A, having a dragon within. Below it are the two characters \u7236\u4e01 Foo-ting.\n\nThe P\u00f3-koo-too says, that \u4e9e should here be understood as a house, temple, or a niche for an idol; and that Foo-ting is a general term for vases of this dynasty. The Tseih-koo-chae \u7a4d\u53e4\u9f4b by Yuen-yuen, the late Viceroy of Canton, the learned work on ancient inscriptions, before mentioned, says that this vase is now in the possession of Wang-she, at Han-chow, in Keang-nan; and that there are a great many vases extant with the inscription \u4e9e A. From the Sung dynasty, and downwards, it has been generally affirmed, that \u4e9e was anciently an ornament\nof temples. Ts\u00e9en-h\u00e9en-che says, that writing \u88dd is writing \u7e61 Fuh, \"to embroider.\" The Viceroy co Foo the same, signifying \"to embroider or any thing denominated \u7e61 Fuh was embroide Foo, \"a battle-axe;\" and that \u4e9e is formed of back to back, and should be written \u5f13, which class of characters denominated \u6703\u610f Huuy import.

It weighed four Chinese pounds and one ounce, having four feet, with an inscription of eleven characters. The first character contains the name \u53ec\u592b Chaou-foo, which is followed by \u5ba4 shih, \"a house,\" which on vases is understood in the sense of \u5edf Maou, a \"temple.\" Hence it is inferred that this was a vessel used by the Chaou family, when worshipping in the temple of their ancestors.\n\nThis vase measured, in height, five Chinese inches and seven-tenths; its ears, one inch and one-tenth; one inch and three-tenths in breadth; its internal depth, three inches; its circumference, at the top, five inches; round the centre, five inches and two-tenths. It weighed three Chinese pounds and one ounce; and had three feet. The inscription consisted of three characters; one of which represents the growth of grain, with the characters \u7236\u5df2 Foo-ke. This inscription is not thought to be very perspicuous, though there might have been an assignable reason for it; and it is deemed sufficiently conclusive to warrant its being assigned to the Shang dynasty. The compiler of the Po-koo-too possessed a wine cup, on which is engraved a figure holding a lance, which is also supposed to\nbelong to the Shang dynasty. The ears, rim, and plain; and two-thirds of it are ornamented in Luy-wan style of relief.\u2014See Vases II. & IV.\n\nThis vase measured, in height, five Chinese inches; in its ears, one inch and two-tenths; and in width, or its internal depth, three inches and three-tenths; at the mouth, five inches; round the centre, five inches contained about a quart; and weighed two ounces.

It has been well observed: \"Whoever were the first planters of India, it could not have been planted till long after Persia and Elam had been sufficiently cultivated, and a considerable number of ages after Assyria and the countries adjoining Ararat had been planted. This is so apparent, both from Scripture and the nature of things, that it will not admit of a dispute.\"*\n\nIs it not reasonable to suppose, that Noah and his family would remain for many years at no very great distance from the spot where they first settled? Who built the splendid cities of Babel and Nineveh? did not Ashur, and probably the other sons of Noah?\u2020 Who were the first to study astrology, as a guide to find out the good or evil supposed to be produced by the heavenly bodies? Who were the first to propitiate them, in reference to their salutary or malignant influences on the destinies of men? Does not the mind immediately revert to the builders and occupiers of Babylon; to their dispersion over the earth; and the consequent carrying away of their superstitions, though then veiled in different languages? If, then, \"India was peopled after Persia and Elam, and many ages after Assyria,\" from whom did she receive her leading deities and theological institutes? Is it not natural to suppose, from one of the above? And from whom so likely as the Assyrians?\n\nThe Jews worshipped the Assyrian deity, Succoth-benoth, under the name of Ashtoreth or Astarte; and it is said\u2021, that this \"god or goddess was both masculine and feminine.\" The Siva of India is both male and female; his right side being of the former, and his left of the latter sex \u00a7; and his wife assumed both appearances, as circumstances might require.\n\n\"The Babylonians called Succoth-benoth, Mylitta, signifying Mother.\" The wife of Siva, and she only (as far as I know), is called Mata, or \"Mother.\"\n\nAmongst the Assyrians, \"the daughters or women once in their lives had to make a sacrifice of virtue to that goddess, Succoth-benoth.\"\u00b6 And Lempiere says of her: \"A surname of Venus, among the Assyrians, in whose temples all the women were obliged to prostitute them-\n\n* Universal History, vol.

They have their origin, it is well known, in the great desire which possesses the minds of these people to preserve animal life; and though it is comprehensible to a native of Europe why aged cows and horses are preserved, from the circumstance of their having done their owners some service, still there can be no stronger instance of human caprice than to nurture a noxious and offensive mass of vermin, which every other race but themselves are anxious to extirpate and destroy. The great body of Hind\u00fas do not protect and preserve animal life as the Banians do; but it is a very common practice among them to feed with regularity pigeons, and even the fish in rivers. I have seen too, at Anj\u00e1r, in Cutch, an establishment of rats, conjectured to exceed five thousand in number, which were kept in a temple, and daily fed with flour, which was procured by a tax on the inhabitants of the town!!\n\n(Signed) Alex R. Burnes.\n\nSurat, June 1823.\nART. IX.\u2014Abstract of a Notice of the Circassian\n\nA German, named Charles Tausch, who resides in an official capacity at Psihiad, near the Po\u2014\n\nCommunicated by Henry Drummond, Esq.\n\nRead 11th of July, 1829.\n\nCircassia is a country as yet unknown to Europe; reason alone, it is supposed to be an inhospitable country; opinion deprives its inhabitants of intercourse with whom they might receive the benefits of civilization. The eastern borders of the Black Sea, between the territories of coast is only frequented by the Turks, who are but little refining their manners and diffusing among them the arts; and it is not therefore surprising that the Circassians, themselves, should still exist in the state of barbarism which they inherited from their ancestors.\n\nFrom their political and commercial connexions, they are acquainted with the Russians and Turks; and with these nations widely different, which incline them unfavourably towards one, and favourably towards the other. Their relations of power date from time immemorial; and many reciprocal advantages always bound them together in friendship.\n\nThe task of regenerating this people, which must be done in a state of comparative barbarism, by gentle means, is more difficult and more worthy of ambition than that of subduing Circassia is as yet an untouched field to labour on; and in extent. Character, manners, customs, and religion, are those of a legislator; and the task promises to secure for us a place in history by the side of restoration. In order to conceive all that is necessary, we must enter into the characteristic peculiarities which distinguish the Circassians.\n\nThose objects that first meet the eye of infancy stand as stations which form the basis of the character of the future man. He accomplishes the rest. The Circassian first sees the world in the midst of arms. All he sees and all he hears is in war; and, as his ideas expand, he naturally feels a spirit of emulation along the path of those whose exploits are so like the warrior-nations of antiquity, he not only learns to restrain his courage in war, but he is ignorant of the nature of its operations, by discipline, so as to secure their safety. Temerity makes him despise danger; and this is all that is formidable.\nAs the principal source of the industry of the Circassians consists in the spoil taken in their predatory excursions, the education which they receive is adapted to this kind of profession. It rarely happens that a boy receives his education beneath the paternal roof: the right of educating him is in the nation; and it is deputed to the first of those who hasten to claim the title of his Allik. This employment, honoured by the confidence reposed in it, is never without competitors; and if more than one present themselves at the same time, umpires determine the period during which each of them is to have the care of the child. The Allik takes away the infant, and entrusts him to nurses: as soon as he can leave their care, his education commences. When he is perfectly accomplished in all military exercises; when he can manage the most intractable horse; when he can sustain hunger and fatigue, and encounter the enemy; he is restored, armed and in triumph, to his parents.\n\nThe father may then freely indulge in his affection, or in the pride which gives birth to it. Custom ceases to debar him from seeing his son, or hearing his voice: in a word, he is no longer ashamed of being his father. The Allik is liberally recompensed for his care, and his family ever remains intimately connected with that of his pupil.\n\nThis warlike spirit is at once the principle and the consequence of the manners and character of the Circassians. It is kept up by the dissensions to which it gives birth among the various tribes; and these dissensions give a colour of right to robbery, whether by fraud or violence. The reprisals which follow, augment the sources of animosity; revenge and avarice produce incursions; and custom constitutes brigandism an honourable profession, in which all are eager to distinguish themselves. The greatest insult which can be offered to a young Circassian, is to tell him that he has not yet carried off a head of cattle.\n\nIn order to ascertain the cause, which, by separating Circassia into different bodies, mostly inimical to each other, would appear at first sight to have reduced it to a state of anarchy, it will be necessary to commence as near the origin of events as the uncertainty of the track will permit.\n\nIt would be useless in this country to seek for any record of its history. Some romances, which celebrate the deeds of their heroes, are the only literary memorials which they possess. As to their traditions, they are completely blended with fable, of which all the Eastern nations are eager admirers. With such slender materials, all that we can rely upon with tolerable certainty will not carry us to a date anterior to the accounts handed down by the fathers of the last generation to their yet existing children; as of facts to which they, or at the utmost their fathers,\nwere eye-witnesses. In this short space of time, Circassians have undergone a considerable revolution; and this knowledge of the history of their country. It was princes named Sahu and Gh\u00e9ian; whose descendants, by their numbers and their courage, they usually the whole country.\n\nThe jealousy, however, natural to an equal division rise to dissension between the two families; and each establish its own supremacy upon the ruin of the other, a contest which was constantly waged to decide the superiority to both parties, from their continual and reciprocal hostility, which broke out in the midst of these events, added considerable period to those of civil war. By these family of Sahu became extinct, and that of Gh\u00e9ian. There yet remains some remnants of the latter, but no power. New chiefs arose upon the ruins of those two number was constantly increasing, as usually happens disorder; when the most powerful arranged among themselves of the soil; and Circassia was then separated into so many of which the chiefs took the title of prince. The body now composed of ten of these states or tribes, who the names of\u2014\n\n1. Notka\u00eftshs.  \n2. Shapsoughs.  \n3. Abatzaikhs.  \n4. Psedoughs.  \n5. Oubighs.  \n6. Hatiok.  \n7. Kemkons.  \n8. Abazes.  \n9. Benelma.  \n10. Koubert.\n\nThe circumstances which create disunion among them, however hinder them from uniting to oppose a common enemy to the general interest of their independence, at which threatens it from without, they lay aside all to defend their country, as their common mother. When danger is removed, their quarrels resume their ordinary subjects of animosity belong to the character of the be extinguished till the light of civilization effects a manners. As long as the Circassians despise the produce and consider robbery and plunder as glorious exploits will be esteemed the only means of furnishing employment. The people whom they reciprocally cursions are likewise the principal article of barter,\nthan as a sign representing a certain value, these payments are made in cattle, hardware, provisions, slaves, and arms. It is, however, always difficult for the murderer to collect the amount of the fine to which he is condemned, without the assistance of his friends and relatives. The same custom awards an indemnity to the relations of one who has been accidentally killed. The elders, in this case, trace the origin of the accident, and regulate the penalty according to the greater or less degree of criminality to be attached to him who has been the cause of it. Such a rule, in an enlightened country, would open an unlimited field to the sophistry of law; but there, where custom needs no exposition, common sense suffices to preclude any thing like perplexity. For instance, a sportsman, in shooting at a fox, scatters a flock of geese, who, by their noisy flight, alarm a horse, which, in his course, overthrows and kills a man:\u2014the sportsman would be adjudged to indemnify the relations of the deceased, if the circumstance which connects him with the affair is known: if not, it would be the owner of the geese, or him to whom the horse belongs, if he cannot prove that there was a prior cause, in his own justification. The same principle is acted upon in all other cases of injury.\n\nHowever, as the majority of cases which arise are not always divested of obscurity, arbitrators are, in such instances, chosen by the parties, to reconcile them, or to decide equitably. This strict justice, which upholds discipline, and causes good understanding to be respected, is only enforced in reference to any particular tribe and its connexions; its severity is relaxed towards those with whom no engagement has been contracted: in such instances, other customs are acted upon, which clash with these arrangements.\n\nIt has already been remarked, that robbery, and in general all acts of hostility, so far from being thought crimes, are applauded as highly praiseworthy: for this reason, there is nothing criminal or punishable in the profession of freebooters. But the crime which is never pardoned, is an infraction of the oath taken not to injure those with whom a treaty exists. It follows, that the Circassians acknowledge no other social law than that which is founded upon compact; and that where this does not exist, they recognise no other right than that of the strongest.\n\nHowever, as all which holds with voluntary agreements is generally admitted and respected in the country, in many instances, before coming to blows, they try the effect of arbitration. In this case, an equal number of arbitrators, taken from each tribe of the contending parties, assemble at the spot selected for holding the conference. They are respectively placed at a certain distance from each other, in order to be secured against surprise; and horsemen bear the proposals from one side to the\nother, until either an agreement has been entered into, or its accomplishment has been demonstrated to be impracticable.\n\nHospitality is a virtue held in great estimation among the Circassians: its rights are there sacred; but to attempt to enjoy them, it is necessary to be declared their friend, and to choose a protector among them. This condition is not difficult to fulfil; as it is only requisite to present a trifling gift to the person selected, who is always flattered by the preference. He becomes the Konak (host) of his visitor; and while, on the one hand, he is answerable to his countrymen for the conduct of his guest, on the other he is surety for the security both of the person and property of the latter. From the moment a person is provided with this safeguard, he is welcomed with cordiality, and even with an eagerness which proves that they would willingly be useful to him.\n\nNotwithstanding the spirit of brigandism which animates the Circassians, they have much inclination to mildness. They are very susceptible of friendship; but a haughtiness which arises from their education, and the Turks have rendered habitual to them, requires that advances be made first by those who would secure their good-will. By their self-love with a little flattery and a trifling present, a stranger may insinuate himself into their affection, and then any advantage obtained of them which may be desired.\n\nThe same method of adoption, and the same ceremonies, are found among many Indian tribes. The woman presents her son who is adopted. The stranger naturalised in this manner, wishes to fix his residence in the country, would find no obstacle to marrying there. In this case, he would be instantly allied to a great number of families, and be treated with great consideration; for the degrees of relationship are there very much extended; and the obligation which those ties enforce, of having only one interest, gives the united power of many families to an individual who belongs to one.\n\nBut if the Circassians shew much kindness, and perform all the duties of hospitality towards him who comes among them under the protection of one of their countrymen, they consider themselves entirely unfettered by similar obligations towards those with whom they have no such connexion. From their principle, of only respecting what they have promised, they consider as enemies all those who have not acquired a right to their friendship by obtaining a Konak. They are otherwise subject to the laws of war, and consequently to him who seizes them.\n\nShips which are wrecked on their coast, and even those which lie within reach of their vessels without being able either to repulse or avoid their attacks, are counted good prizes; and the crews, made captive, share the fate of other slaves: but if it happens that they are heard of, they may\neasily be ransomed; and it is unusual for the ransom of a man to be fixed higher than from 18l. to 24l.; at least, if he is not known to be a person of rank.\n\nAlthough the Circassians differ but little in their manners from each other, a favourable shade of character may nevertheless be observed among the Notkaitche. This tribe, which is in alliance with that of the Shapsoughs, the most formidable in the Caucasus, extends from the port of Ghelendik to the bounds of the Albania, occupying the coasts of the Black Sea for that space. The inhabitants are more gentle and more comfortable than the others, and their territory is better cultivated.\n\nBesides the division of lands of which we have spoken, this country is divided between two chiefs, named Kersigh and Soupaoke, whose families are at this time very numerous. The first is divided into forty-nine branches, and the second into twenty-six; and all those of the name take the title of prince.\n\nIn order to trace the origin of the religious belief of the Circassians, we ought probably to presume that the ancient inhabitants of the Caucasus were idolaters; and that Christians, brought into the country by circumstances of which we have no knowledge, attempted to convert them, but that they did not complete their work. There is even a common opinion which attributes this attempt at their conversion to some Crusaders, who escaped from the misfortunes of their expeditions in the Holy Land. However, it appears more likely that the honour of this Christian zeal belongs to the Genoese, who, from the time that they ruled in the Black Sea, had establishments in Circassia. Vestiges of ancient remains, which may yet be recognised as having been churches, sustain this opinion; and the appellation of Genoese, which is not unknown to the Circassians, notwithstanding the ages which have elapsed since their connexion, furnishes a tolerably sufficient proof in its favour. Following up this idea, it will be seen that the progress of Christianity not having been general in the country, nor its principles well settled, it is not surprising, that when the Circassians found themselves without instructors, they should have retrograded towards their original system, and that the confusion of ceremonies has given rise to the religion which they profess at the present time.\n\nThey acknowledge a Supreme Being, a Mother of God, and several celestial powers of a secondary order, whom they call Apostles. They believe in the immortality of the soul, and that in a future state it is situated according to the deeds done in the body; but, little concerned at this prospect, all their endeavours are directed to the acquisition of temporal benefits. The forests are their temples; and a cross placed before a tree consecrates an altar, before which they offer sacrifice. One\nof the elders of the community officiates as minister: standing by the side of the cross, habited in a mantle of Bure (a travelling cloak, commonly used by the Tartars and Circassians, in the manner of a Dalmatique), and bareheaded, he commences the ceremony by a propitiatory sacrifice.\n\nThe victim usually brought to him is a sheep or a goat; but on occasions of great solemnity it is an ox: he then takes a taper, which is at the foot of the altar, and burns a few hairs from the animal, at each place where it is to be struck; pours a little bouza* on its head; and, after a short prayer of consecration, it is immolated. The head of the victim is sacred to the deity: they fix it on a pole at some distance from the altar. The skin belongs to the officiating priest who supplies the taper; (the animal is purchased by the community jointly;) and the remainder is dressed, during the service, for the repast of the assembly.\n\nSeveral youths, for the most part slaves of the elder who officiates as priest, afford him their assistance. They stand behind him, with cups of bouza and slices of bread. As soon as the sacrifice is completed, the priest takes a piece of bread in one hand, and a cup in the other: he raises them towards heaven, and invokes the Supreme Being to be favourable to them: he blesses the two viands; and presents them to the eldest of the company, who eats them. The assistants supply him with another cup, and a fresh piece of bread; and he supplicates the Mother of God, repeating the same ceremonial as he presents them to another of the eldest persons present. It is thus continued, addressing a separate prayer to each of their Apostles, whom they thus reverence in succession. Before concluding the duty, the minister announces the day for holding the next festival, which he appoints at his discretion. It ought to take place once a week, either on Saturday, Sunday, Monday, or Tuesday; never on any other day.\n\nHe also proclaims articles which may have been lost or found; but the latter are seldom heard of. After this, the repast is spread: it consists, besides the animal sacrificed, of other meat brought by each family assisting at the ceremony, as well as pastaf\u2020 and liquor.\n\nIf we attentively examine the nature of these ceremonies, we cannot mistake the diversity of their origin. In some, we perceive traces of an idolatrous people, who sprinkled their altars with the blood of sacrifices; and in others we recognise a feeble imitation of the mysteries of Christianity, but which are so jumbled together as to have given birth to a new religion, a worthy production of ignorance.\n\n* Liquor which is prepared by fermenting millet flour in water.\n\u2020 Pasta is millet boiled to a paste: the common drink is bouza, but those tribes that have vines substitute wine, and even brandy.\nBesides these weekly f\u00eates, the Circassians celebrate several others. That of Mercime, or the \"Mother of God,\" is held in the month of September: it is not known why she is called \"Mother of God,\" for her history has no connexion either with the title or the subject. Mercime is, simply, the Patroness of Bees. The Circassians say, that the thunder, in anger, exterminated the whole of these industrious insects; while Mercime concealed one in the sleeve of her chemise, which reproduced the species. Such is the fable; and all the homage paid to her consists in regaling, on her holiday, with meats and liquor prepared from honey. Towards the spring they keep the feast of their Saint, Sozerise. The Circassians represent him to have been a great navigator, to whom the winds and waves were subject. He is particularly reverenced among those residing near the borders of the sea; and it is in the temples of those sacred woods nearest the coast that they recommend themselves to his protection. Each family preserves, for this holiday, a dry pear-tree, in the yard of its house, which no one touches but on this day. This tree is emblematical of Sozerise: it is plunged in water; it is bathed: they fix a new cheese to the highest branch; and they ornament the rest, in addition, with tapers collected from the company assembled. When the pear-tree is decorated in this manner, several persons take it up, to bring it into the house; and the remainder of the party wait for it before the door, to receive it, and compliment it upon its happy arrival. Its entry into the house is preceded by a sacrifice, and all the preparations for a great festival. They regale themselves, during three days, by praying to Sozerise, every now and then, to prevent the winds and waves from doing mischief. When this time has elapsed, they divide the cheese among the attendants; and return the tree to the same place, all the company attending it, and wishing it a happy voyage; and it is then left in its corner, till the following year.\n\nThe Circassians are also much devoted to three Goddesses: these were three sisters, who, since their epoch, have made the reign of Astr\u00e6a flourish in the country. They preside over domestic harmony and neighbourly kindness, and they cover the traveller with their protecting wings. Whoever changes his residence, sacrifices to them on arriving at his new abode, and before departing on a journey.\n\nThe similarity between these three Goddesses, and the Household Gods and Guardian Angels of other nations, is a new proof of the medley which composes the mythology of the Circassians.\n\nTowards the end of October, they keep the Commemoration of the Dead. This periodical remembrance is separately performed by each family; and they recommend each of the deceased individually to the protection of their Saints, in order that they may not want for anything in the abodes of the departed.\nA few days afterwards comes the Feast of Thunder: they return it thanks for the rain which it has procured, and for having refreshed and purified the air during the heats of summer. The thunder is much reverenced by the Circassians, and they consider it as a distinguished favour of Heaven to be struck with a thunderbolt.\n\nThe new year, nearly at the same time as ours, and the resuming of the labours of the field which follows it, are also two holidays; but their most solemn feast-day is at Easter: the ceremonials which accompany it, and the time at which it is celebrated (at the latter end of March), cannot leave any doubt as to its origin.\n\nThe month of March has hardly commenced before they begin to abstain from eating eggs. They neither hire, nor lend, nor borrow, nor receive anything: they even do not take fire from a neighbour. The custom which requires each person to pass it at home, renders it very dull, by preventing the meeting of relations and friends, if they all celebrate it on the same day. For this reason each village chooses a different one. At break of day, it is announced by the discharge of firearms. The neighbours then run, and assemble at the sacred wood, to commence the ceremony by the ordinary duties of religion. But on this occasion the number of victims immolated is in proportion to the number of the congregation, and the splendour of the feast: they add to it all the eggs saved during their Lent, that is, during all the month of March. The feast is terminated by firing at a mark, which is an egg; and the skins of the animals sacrificed are the prizes of skill. The next day it is recommenced in another village of the same canton.\n\nThe other Saints of the Circassians are Naokatash, Shuska, Telers, Femish, and Mesite; and each has a day consecrated to him. It is only in the feasts and sacrifices that the Circassians eat meat; or on extraordinary occasions, when they have strangers residing with them. In the latter case, they diversify their cookery by a quantity of ragouts; but they use no other seasoning than salt, milk, honey, and pimenta.\n\nTheir meals are served in the same manner as those of the Turks, upon small round tables; and the dishes follow each other with tolerable rapidity. The stranger eats alone; and the master of the house with all his family, the females excepted, stand respectfully round the table. The guest does the honours of the table, by presenting first to one, and then to another, portions from what is set before him. The removes pass to the master of the house; from him again to his family; and what remains is eaten by the slaves: each table is thus disposed of. The women eat in separate apartments; and they are ashamed if a man surprises them employed. Like the Turks, they use wooden spoons only, and their supply the places of forks. Slaves attend with the requisites\nfor washing before and after the repast. They never sit down to table without invoking the name of God. Except on these occasions, the Circassians practise a rigid sobriety. They subsist only on boiled millet with a little salt. As soon as it is half boiled, they draw off the water, which they drink as broth; and the grain is constantly stirred with a spatula till it is of the consistence of a thick paste: it is then poured on a table to cool; and thus is produced the pasta, their common bread. They sometimes make it of wheat flour, especially for great solemnities and religious ceremonies.\n\nAlthough bouza is the ordinary drink of the country, yet in those districts where vines are grown they make both wine and brandy, of which the Circassians are very fond. Those who are Muhammedans make no scruple of violating the law of their Prophet, which prohibits the use of the juice of the vine.\n\nThe sobriety to which the Circassians in general are habituated is of great advantage to them in military expeditions. A horseman is equipped for several days with a little bag of boiled millet, which he fixes to his saddle. It is undoubtedly to this sobriety, also, that the Circassians are indebted for the enjoyment of hale longevity, and that diseases are rare among them. Were it not for the plague and the small-pox, which commit dreadful ravages there, the population would be proportionably larger than elsewhere. Their connexion with the Turks exposes them constantly to the infliction of the first of these scourges, and they use no precaution to secure themselves from it. It is not that the Circassians resign themselves, like the Turks, to the doctrine of fatalism, but that their ignorance prevents them from finding remedies. This is the more surprising, as they might advantageously employ the same as those of which they avail themselves against the small-pox. As soon as any person is attacked by it, they place him in a separate hut; and those only who have already experienced this malady are allowed to approach him. The persons in care of the sick are of this description, and are shut up with him. The relations go into mourning; that is, they cease from all labour; they neither wash their hands nor face; they do not cut their nails, nor change their clothes\u2014during all the time that the sick person is in danger. When he is perfectly recovered, they celebrate his cure by a sacrifice and rejoicings.\n\nPhysicians are not wanting in the country; there are both Turks and Circassians: the first, ignorant as they are everywhere, combine the grossest superstition with unskilfulness: they have no other remedies than verses of the Kor\u00e2n, to apply to the deceased. The Circassians pursue a more reasonable plan: they use herbs, butter, wax, honey, and bleeding. They employ the latter, especially, for affections of the head: they\nmake an incision with a cutting-iron in the painful part, and stop the bleeding with nettles or cotton. They are particularly successful in curing wounds, for which they only use vegetable substances; but the ceremonial which accompanies the treatment of the wounded is somewhat curious.\n\nThe patient is laid in a separate room: they place at the foot of his bed a ploughshare, a hammer, and a cup of water, in which he places a new-laid egg. The people who come to visit him, when entering, strike three blows of the hammer upon the ploughshare; and dipping their fingers in the water, they sprinkle him with it, at the same time praying that God will speedily restore him to health: they then range themselves round the chamber.\n\nHe who accidentally seats himself in the place of the physician pays him a forfeit; and these little presents are the principal emoluments of the son of Esculapius. It is usual to pass the whole night in the apartment of the invalid: the relations and friends take their supper with them, which, among other things, often consists of a sheep or a goat. Towards evening, the young people of both sexes repair to this assembly, with a flute, and an instrument much resembling a lute. The boys place themselves on one side of the chamber, and the girls on the other: they commence with a warlike song, of which the accompanying words are in praise of valour: the girls then dance around. The instrumentalists then play for some time; and they conclude, before supper, with the recital of some fable.\u2014As soon as supper is removed, they play at different trifling games; and the last is that of fastening a packthread to the ceiling, and tying to the end of it a kind of flat cake or biscuit, which the young people throw to one another, and try to catch with their teeth; so that frequently the game does not end without some of them being broken.\n\nThus the first night is spent, without any one venturing to go to sleep, for which he would be reproached. The sick person does not appear to be at all incommoded by the noise; whether he fears to expose his weakness, whether the warlike songs re-animate his courage, or whether, in short, the scene of gaiety before him acts as a soother of his pain: certain it is, that he appears insensible to it, and that the show of hardiness which he makes does not in the least prejudice his recovery.\n\nBut if sports and smiles surround the brave to soothe his wounds, his death is honoured by all which the most affecting sorrow can exhibit. The tears and cries of the women who are in the house announce his decease, and the tidings are soon spread in the vicinity. The friends and neighbours of the mother or wife of the warrior, whose last terminated his career go to mingle their sighs with...\nfamily. The intention of these visits is not to bring consolation, but to weep together; and they mingle tears with the praises of the deceased.\n\nThe corpse is next washed; the hair is shaved off; it is entirely clothed anew, and is laid upon a mat on the ground. Upon another mat, by its side, there is a new cushion, on which all the clothes are piled. His arms are displayed, in the form of a trophy, at the entrance to the yard, to indicate a house of mourning: it is on passing this boundary that the visitors begin to make their lamentations heard. The men, however, are not so noisy in the expression of their grief: they come with reddened eyes, but covered with one hand; and with the other they violently strike the breast. They throw themselves on their knees, upon the mat which is by the side of the corpse; and they remain in this posture, sighing and beating themselves, till they are relieved, by being told, \"It is enough:\" they are then furnished with water to wash their hands and face, and they proceed to pay their compliments of condolence to the inmates of the house. Custom requires that the dead should be interred within twenty-four hours from the time of decease. Whilst they are performing expiatory sacrifices in the house, of which the meats serve for the entertainment which forms part of the ceremony, several young people go to prepare the grave; when all is ready, the funeral cavalcade moves towards the burial-ground. The elders are at its head, reciting prayers; and the bier follows immediately after, surrounded by the relations, friends, and neighbours of the deceased. The women close the procession, with a handkerchief, of which they hold an end in each hand, and swing it from side to side, exhibiting all the signs of the deepest woe. The wife, mother, and the nearest relations, tear their hair, scratch their faces, and perform other acts of despair, of which they for a long time retain the marks.\n\nAfter the interment, they place upon the grave part of the meat of the victims, as well as pasta and bouza, which is left for passengers; who, when availing themselves of it, bestow a thousand blessings on the departed. Those persons who accompanied the procession return to the relations of the deceased, where a repast awaits them; and the ceremony is terminated by firing at a mark, for which the prizes are the skins of the victims. The memory of the deceased is preserved in a tale which contains his biography; and which descends to posterity, if his exploits are worthy of it. These romances are the only fragments, as has been before observed, which the Circassians retain of their history.\n\nIt is however in the following year, at the anniversary f\u00eate, that the relations of the dead display all the pomp which is in their power: for this ceremony they prepare several pieces of net-work of nuts, to represent coats of mail and helmets, which the relations and friends put on.\nThe number of victims immolated on this occasion seems to fifty; and besides this great quantity of meat prepared, each family adds some dish to it.\n\nOn the day of the anniversary, which is announced beforehand, they assemble upon the consecrated ground, vast space, sprinkled with tomb-stones. The clothes of the deceased are placed upon the grave, as well as several of different colours; and if the relations are rich, they send of mail, horses, and slaves. The whole is surrounded by the feast, and destined to those who carry off the prizes.\n\nThe f\u00eate is opened by a triple discharge of all the firearms to those whose deaths are celebrated, and the women Next, four or six of the nearest relations march round times, leading their horses, newly caparisoned: they offer from their ears, which they offer as a libation to the words: \"It is for thee.\" Each of them then takes a piece they display like a flag, throw themselves on their horses at full speed. All the other horsemen hold themselves pursue them, in order to capture the pieces of cloth; consider it a point of honour not to allow them to be taken them, to present, in their turns, to the women who attend.\n\nA new trial is afterwards performed for each individual horseback or on foot; and the skins of the victims are for shooting either with fire-arms or with bows and arrows.\n\nThe day passes between these games and feasting may freely take his share; and a part is sent to those not been able to attend the f\u00eate.\n\nIn these exhibitions, a degree of gallantry towards the observed; for those who carry off the prizes only come present to the females. Indeed, on all occasions, the much consideration for them. If a horseman falls in with the same road, he alights, and requests her to mount; accompanies her on foot as far as their path lies together not allowed to be in idleness: they are obliged to share with the slaves. To the latter is allotted the field-works are charged with the household affairs. Even wealthy the number of their servants, are freed from the drudgery do not cease to be well occupied in all the matters required. They not only work for their own family, but for others want of their assistance: these give them the materials require, but do not even thank them for their labour, considered to belong to the republic. They exhibi\nintelligence in their works: the trimmings of dresses and shoes, in\ntrees of gold and silver thread, are of the greatest delicacy; and, in\ncarefully examining their performance, we are surprised to see the most\nminute details attended to with much skill and care.\n\nFor the rest, the Circassian women, far from being subjected to the\ngeneral rule of the East, which separates them from the society of men,\nenjoy unrestrained liberty, and they do not abuse it. The laws of chastity\nare known and respected in this country. It is undoubtedly from an\nexcessive delicacy towards these laws that custom prohibits young\nmarried people from being found together in a company, especially in\nthe presence of their elders. If it accidentally happens that they meet,\neven among their nearest relations, and the wife is surprised by the\nchance arrival of the husband, the other women conceal her, by ranging\nthemselves before her, and withdraw her in this manner. If it is the\nhusband who is in this predicament, he escapes by the window. In\ngeneral, the Circassian women are tolerably pretty, but their beauty does\nnot deserve the reputation which it has obtained. Their figure is slight\nand thin, and this appearance is also common to the men. They acquire\nit by their habit of binding themselves tightly from their earliest infancy\u2014\nthe boys with a belt; the girls with a corset of morocco-leather, sewed\nupon the body, which they do not change till it is torn, and do not\nfinally leave off till their marriage: the husband removes it on the first\nnight of the nuptials, by cutting it off with his dagger. The sober and\ntemperate habits of the Circassians, however, contribute not a little to\nthis spareness of form; for those women who go into the Turkish harems\nbecome much fatter.\n\nThe Circassians, on their marriage, pay a dowry to the parents of the\ngirl: it consists of cattle, arms, horses, slaves, and other things, accord-\ning to the condition of the parties. If they are of the first rank, a coat\nof mail, worth usually from 2000 to 3000 piastres, always forms part of\nthe price.\n\nWhen two persons wish to unite, the young man causes the girl to be\ndemanded of her parents: if they agree, his father goes to settle the\ndowry; of which half is always paid at the time of the marriage, and the\nother half at a time agreed upon. These preliminaries being first settled\nby the parents, the lover meets his fair one by night: he waits for her\nwith some young people, and they carry her off: they usually conduct\nher to the wife of a mutual friend of the two families.\n\nThe parents of the girl go, next morning, to seek her of those of the\nintended hus...\nthey demand the consent of the former to the union. The father of the person claimed then demands the dowry; and that of the young man offers him the half directly, and the rest at a certain term already arranged between themselves: but custom requires that they should not agree upon any thing in public, but refer their dispute to arbitrators, who, as may readily be supposed, decide in the manner previously settled by the parties.\n\nThe day following they celebrate the nuptials. All the relations and friends assemble, and divide themselves in two parties; of which one proceeds to the neighbour where the bride is remaining, and the other accompanies the intended husband to claim her. The first party waits for these in good order, to prevent them carrying her away; and they are all armed with sticks. A sham-fight ensues; during which the fair one appears at the door, between two others, who cry \"Victory,\" as the bridegroom carries her off. All the company then follow the conqueror home in triumph; where they find awaiting them good cheer, music and dancing.\n\nThis festivity lasts for five or six days; but the bridegroom takes no part in it, for the reason already mentioned, that custom prohibits young married persons from being found together in company. He therefore keeps himself concealed during the day in the neighbourhood; and at night, his friends come and take him from the place of his retreat, and conduct him to the chamber of his wife; but at day-break he again disappears. He secretes himself in this manner for nearly two months, especially avoiding falling in with the elders.\n\nThe same sense of shame exhibits itself in him each time of his becoming a father; but the wife does not share it. From the moment that they announce it to him, he leaves his house; and during many days he dares not shew himself at home, except at night. They do not perform any religious act towards the child: the women who attend on the occasion, give it a name; and if it is a boy, the Allik takes him away.\n\nThe Circassians are not destitute of capacity for the mechanic arts, if they were but less disinclined to work. This may be observed in many of their productions, in which that good taste is apparent which indicates talent. But this talent is wasted by indolence, and the want of instructors for its developement: it is, however, manifest in the objects of their luxury. The mounting of their arms, the temper of their steel, and their work in gold, equal every expectation. They have, in particular, a method of staining silver, which is inimitable. Ornaments of this metal, with which they enrich their arms, are finished in the best style; and generally, in every thing connected with their equipments, they do not yield to good European workmen.\nTheir dress resembles that of the ancient French knights; but they have in front, and on each side of the coat, a fluted pocket, containing from ten to twelve wooden cases, which serve them as cartridge-boxes. These are again covered with green or red morocco-leather, and, by throwing out the chest, gives a manly elegance to the figure. They are all horsemen; and their arms consist of a curved sabre without the guard, a dagger, a pistol, and an Albanian musket, or a bow. When they enter a house, they hang their arms against the wall, keeping only the dagger. They charge their pieces with ball; and they fire with the musket supported at the end, on two rods of about four feet in length, which they fix in the ground, in a slanting position. The Turks furnish them with cannon and fire-arms; but many of them are found in the country inscribed with the name of Lazzaro Lazzarini, formerly an armourer of Venice.\n\nNearly all the princes have a coat of mail, with steel armlets, which secure the hands and arms from the elbow downwards, and which they use as shields to turn off sabre cuts. Their head is covered with a steel helmet, attached to the coat of mail; and the whole forms a hood, which allows nothing to be seen but that part of the face between the eyebrows and the mouth. They procure these arms from the Persians; but since their frontier has been separated by the conquests of Russia, it is very difficult to get them, and the price is considerably augmented. They look upon coats of mail as the principal articles of riches in a family. It is natural for a warlike people to think highly of the beauty of their weapons; and thus they constitute the ambition and the luxury of the Circassians.\n\nAs to the other parts of the costume, they do not think so much of it, although they are not strangers to the custom of sacrificing at the shrine of fashion. They frequently vary the ornaments, and the cut of their clothes, as well as the shape of their caps; in which they follow, as elsewhere, the taste of some of the most elegant of the young people. But they always preserve long sleeves; because, after the example of the ancient Persians, it is proper to stand with the arms hanging down, and the hands covered, in the presence of those who command respect.\n\nExcept in the articles of clothing, of which we have spoken, the Circassians do not exhibit any industry, but in very rude forms. Agriculture is with them absolutely in its infancy, and they derive but very little benefit from rural economy. It is within a very short time that a few windmills have been erected, but the use of them is by no means general; the greater part still reduce their grain to flour in the same manner as they any idea of using leaven for baking bread.\n\nWe have heard that the Circassians have not yet adopted the use of iron, and that, consequently, they are not strangers to the primitive methods of warfare.\nit appears, indeed, that in the latter art their taste is more refined than that of other Oriental nations. At the commencement of the year 1824, the son of the Prince Mehemet Jeh\u00e1ndar Ogloou, the present head of the Soupaoke family, came to spend some days at Kerlech with a Russian agent employed in Circassia: this young Circassian, named Karpolet, aged about nineteen years, was taken to a house where a person was performing on the piano forte. He was charmed with the melody of the instrument; and when he was asked which of all the pieces that he had heard played he was most pleased with, he gave the preference to that which was decidedly the best.\n\nNature in Circassia is very bountiful: fruits of all kinds grow there almost spontaneously, and without culture. In the southern part, the vine produces very fine grapes, without any care. They are left to dry upon the tree for the winter; and wine is also made of them, which is kept in earthen vases. The country is well wooded, and the dimension of the trees testifies their age. The fir, the oak, the walnut, the box, the juniper, and cherry trees, are abundant; and they are of the finest quality and size.\n\nThe immense forests with which this country is covered might be rendered available to a considerable trade in wood, for building, &c., and be a source of riches to the inhabitants. But, in order that the Circassians may profit by all the gifts which nature has bestowed upon them, they must be taught to develope them by art, and to feel the necessity for labour.\n\nThis change in their habits can only be accomplished by an intercourse with civilized nations, who can teach them all that they require, to enjoy life. Industry alone gives birth to new wants; which, in proportion as they are satisfied, extend their circle from real to imaginary, and pave the way for the arts, which form the basis of civilization. These people have, undeniably, all the requisite disposition for treading in the steps of any enlightened power which would lead them in such a path. The greatest difficulty is, to eradicate those suspicions which prevent them from taking the first step: were this obstacle overcome, there are not many others to hinder the communication of that knowledge which regenerates barbarian man.\nART. X.\u2014Analysis of the Mir\u00e1t-i-Ahm\u00e1d\u00ed, a Political and Statistical History of the Province of Gujar\u00e1t, translated from the Persian by James Bird, Esq. M.R.A.S., F.R.G.S.\n\nThe large province of Gujar\u00e1t, or Guzar\u00e1t, including the peninsula of Katiau\u00e1r, extends from Banu\u00e1rah to Dwarka, or, from east to west, about two hundred and ninety miles; and from B\u00edrgaon, in Jal\u00f3r, to Dam\u00e1n, or, from north to south, about three hundred miles. It is watered by several considerable rivers; among which the Narbada and the Mahi were known to Ptolemy. This, which is one of the most productive districts of India, supplies the greater part of the commercial articles exported from the port of Bombay: these are cotton, opium, saltpetre, indigo, tobacco, grain, and gold-cloths.\n\nGujar\u00e1t possesses some of the most remarkable antique remains, whether of Hind\u00fa or Muhammedan architecture, that can be seen in India; and the strange variety of sects, castes, and customs, there existing, cannot be found in any other district of this country. Its inhabitants, who speak a dialect named after the province, have been successively ruled by their R\u00e1j\u00e1s, a race of independent Muhammedan princes, and the members of the imperial house of Delhi. During the government of the latter, many innovations were made in the mode of administering the affairs of the province. To the revenue and police regulations, then introduced by Akbar, Jeh\u00e1ng\u00edr, Sh\u00e1h Jeh\u00e1n, and A'rangz\u00edb, we are indebted for most of that knowledge which enabled us to apply, to Gujar\u00e1t, a revenue system, that, amidst the numerous failures which have elsewhere followed experiments on this subject, still works better than the generality, and maintains this province in a flourishing condition. A detailed account of these renewed measures will afford useful information to all who are interested in the good government of a country, so important to the crown of England, as India has now become.\n\nA history of the ancient condition of Gujar\u00e1t, and accounts of the singular tribes and customs existing here, were desiderata, which the learned in Europe have long expected to see supplied. Their wishes will soon be gratified, by the publication of Part I. of the work that appears at the head of this article, and of which we intend here to give a short analysis. It has been put to the press by the Oriental Translation Fund, and is now in a state of forwardness. The translation which has been completed to the end of the Emperor Akbar's reign, is preceded by an historical introduction; in which the translator has illustrated the constitution of Hind\u00fa society, and the state of India, at the time it was first invaded by the Muhammedans in any great...\nthe names of individual Raj\u00e1s and families, reigning are here and there correctly inserted in the lists of yet little satisfactory historical information can be looked is the inconsistency of accounts, and the contradictory they rest, that, though these may allay the cravings o search of information to supply a void, they are scarce confidence of historians.\n\nThe Mir\u00e1t-i-Ahmad\u00ed was compiled between the and 1762, by Mu\u1e25ammad Ali Kh\u00e1n, the revenue-min vice; and commences its statistical information with soil and productions of Gujar\u00e1t; its Sirkars and ports, cial dynasty of Muhammedan princes; the amount of lections, and of sums realized from other sources; and distribution of military retainers. It then mentions the city of Patan, anciently called Anhilw\u00e1rah, the oom of Gujar\u00e1t; the three royal races of R\u00e1jp\u00fat Solankhi, and Baghil\u00e1h, who successively ruled it; an Islamism, by the conquest of the country, in the re king of Delhi, Sultan Alla-ud-d\u00edn. Soon after the Solankhi tribe, Mahmud of Ghazn\u00ed invaded Gujar Soman\u00e1th. The Mir\u00e1t-i-Ahmad\u00ed gives a brief transactions; but details at length, in the Appendix, which the champion of Isl\u00e1m overturned, on this occasion of adoration destroyed by Mahm\u00fad at Soman\u00e1th was an idol, but a linga; and the authority of the Mir\u00e1t matter, is supported by that of the Habib-as-s\u00edr, whic it was a single piece of rough stone.\n\nIn its account of the provincial dynasty of Muham Mir\u00e1t-i-Ahmad\u00ed has borrowed largely from the Mi history of Gujar\u00e1t written many years previous to the the time when Akbar subdued the province, and unite of Delhi.\n\nThe several changes in the revenue management that were introduced from this period; the contests from the death of Ak\u00e1ngz\u00edb, in A.D. 1707, to the defeat by Ahm\u00e1d Sh\u00e1h Abd\u00e1l\u00ed, in A.D. 1761, are next detailed terials supplied for a luminous view of the Mogul system of those Mahratta transactions not generally known ends with the settlement, at Baroda, of D\u00e1ma\u00ed G\u00e1\u00edkw of B\u00e1la\u00ed B\u00e1j\u00ed R\u00e1o, after the battle of Panipat.\n\nIn the Appendix, the author gives a full accoun of Hind\u00fas and Muhammedans, the different par\nremarkable places of religious resort, and the principal towns of the province. In fine, the *Mir\u00e1l-i-Ahmad\u00ed* is the most complete Muhammedan history of one of the most interesting and flourishing of our possessions in India, and throws much additional light on the revenue administration of the whole of that country. When completed, the work will form four octavo volumes.\n\n---\n\n**ART.

(Printed at the S\u00e1straprak\u00e1s\u00e1 Press.)**\n\nThis work, as far as our knowledge extends, is the first attempt made by a native of India to produce an elementary treatise on an intricate subject of Hind\u00fa Law, modelled after the European plan of a Catechism, written in the form of questions and answers, in the vernacular language of Bengal, with quotations in Sanskrit, from books of established authority, adduced in support of the principles advanced. The greater part of the volume is occupied by a succinct view of the law of Inheritance, according to the system of J\u00edm\u00fatav\u00e1h\u00e1na, the author of the *D\u00e1yabh\u00e1g\u00e1*, compared with that of Vijn\u00e1nesvara, the writer of the *Mit\u00e1khshar\u00e1*. Subjoined, is a short treatise on Adoption, likewise in the form of questions and answers. The following translation of a few passages will give a more precise idea of the plan of the work:\n\n\"7th Question.\u2014If the father is very old, so as to be unable to attend to business\u2014have the sons a right to divide the property or not?\n\n\"Answer.\u2014If the father be unequal to the discharge of business, and aged, the eldest son, or any son that is qualified, may be authorised by him to discharge affairs in his stead: but the learned declare, that the sons have no right of their own to make a partition.\"\n\nProofs.\u20141. \"During their father's life-time, the sons have no authority to acquire, alienate, or mortgage property: but if the father be infirm, away from home, or labouring under illness, the eldest son may take care of the affairs.\"\u2014\n\n2. \"If the father is unable, the eldest son should discharge business in his stead; or, with his (the eldest son's) assent, the next younger brother, if he be conversant with business. But as long as the father does not wish it, partition of the property does not take place. If he is old, or disordered in his mind, or diseased, the eldest son should, like a father, guard the goods of the rest\"; for the property is the support of the family. They are not independent while their father\n\n*In translating this passage of *Sankha* and *Likhita*, which is likewise quoted in the *D\u00e1yabh\u00e1g\u00e1* (p. 41. Svo. edit.), we have ventured slightly to deviate from the division of the sentences adopted by Mr. Colebrooke; see Hind\u00fa Law of Inheritance, p. 19.*\nis living, and while their mother survives.\"\u20143. \"Brothers are advised to live together while their parents survive. After their death, their religious merit is amplified, if they live separate.\"\u2014H\u0101r\u012bt. S\u0101\u1e45kh\u0101 and Likhita. Vya\u015ba.\n\n\"26th Question.\u2014May a brother, without the consent of the co-heirs, alienate land, or other property, belonging to them in common?\n\n\"Answer.\u2014The alienation by gift, sale, &c. of immoveables which are common property, becomes valid only by the concurrence of all the co-heirs. A gift, or other transfer, made by a single parcerne, without the concurrence of the co-heirs, is invalid. Thus is it declared by the author of the Mit\u0101kshar\u0101.\"\n\nProof.\u2014The passage of Manu: \"With respect to immoveable property, there is no distinction between separated and unseparated brothers; for one has no authority over the whole, to alienate it by donation, mortgage, or sale:\" and the following remark in the Mit\u0101kshar\u0101, \"As the property belongs in common to the unseparated brothers, a single one of them has no authority over it, and the concurrence of all is therefore indispensably requisite.\"\n\n\"Question.\u2014How stands this rule according to J\u012bmutavahana?\n\n\"Answer.\u2014Any gift, or other alienation, of common immoveable property, made by one coparcener, without the concurrence of the rest, is void, being unsupported by written law, and at variance with established usage. But if limited to his own share, it is valid. This is the decision of J\u012bmutavahana.\"\n\nProofs.\u20141. \"A single co-heir is not permitted, without the concurrence of the rest, to alienate, by sale or gift, any immoveable property, nor the entire property, that belongs in common to the family.\"\u20142. \"Whenever many persons, that have separate duties and separate transactions, and differing in their business and character, are sprung from one progenitor, if they do not agree as to their affairs, and dispose of their respective shares by donation or sale, they are at liberty to do so; for they are masters of their own property.\"\u2014Vya\u015ba. Narada.\n\nThe treatise on Adoption commences at page 114, with the following queries:\n\n\"1st Query.\u2014In failure of a legitimate son (Aurasa), may a man of this present age adopt as his own any one of the descriptions of sons enumerated by Manu, e.g. the K\u1e63etraja, or 'wife's son,' and the rest?\n\n\"Answer.\u2014Of the sons enumerated by Manu, namely, the K\u1e63etraja and the rest, none but the Dattaka, or 'son given,' can be adopted by men of the present or Kali age. This is the declared opinion of persons conversant with theology and other sciences.\"\n\nProof.\u2014\"Sons that were formerly made in various ways by holy men cannot now be procured by men destitute of power in the present age. Others, besides\n\n\u2022 Because every one of them, by establishing a separate household, will of his own accord perform the same oblations, and other religious ceremonies, incumbent on householders, which previously were performed by the brothers in common.\n\n\u2020 Mit\u0101kshar\u0101, Vyavah\u0101ra-adhy\u0101ya, p. 174. 8vo. edit. See Colebrooke's Hindu Law of Inheritance, p. 275; where the passage here attributed to Manu is ascribed to Vrihaspati.\n\n\u2021 Manu, ix. 169.\nthe Datta, or 'son given,' and the Aurasa, or 'legitimate son,' are not comprehended under the designation of sons: any other kind of son is accordingly forbidden by Saunaka for the Kali age.\" Thus Vrihaspati declares.\n\nPart of the passage here quoted is inserted by Kulluka, in his gloss on Manu, ix. 68.\n\nThe Sanskrit expression in the original for 'others besides the Datta and Aurasa' is Dattaurasetaresham. The word itara, 'other,' here retains its own pronominal inflexion, as standing in a compound, not a Dwandva; for in Dwandva compositions, all pronominal adjectives (sarva, &c.), take the termination of common adjectives ending in a. Ex. Yajnavalkya, book i. dist. 1.\n\nvarn\u00e1rametar\u00e1n\u00e1m no br\u00fahi dharm\u00e1na\u015beshatah\n\n\"Explain to us fully the duties of the castes, the orders, and the rest.\" This remark is expressed by Panini, in an aphorism (I. I. 31), which is referred to by Vijnanesvara, in his commentary on the passage just quoted.\n\n\"2d Query.\u2014Is it an indispensably cogent precept, that a man destitute of male progeny must adopt a Dattaka? or is it left optional?\n\nAnswer.\u2014To insure deliverance from the hell named Put, for the sake of affection and love, on account of the oblation of the funeral cake and water, and for the honour of their names, men of all castes should, in failure of a legitimate son, always adopt a Dattaka, as a substitute for a real son. Such is the opinion of all persons conversant with the codes of law. Otherwise, guilt is incurred; and through the neglect of this precept, by omitting to discharge his debt, celestial bliss cannot, according to the ordinance, be enjoyed by the father in a future state.\"\n\nProofs.\u20141. \"A man who is without male offspring should always take care to adopt a substituted son, on account of the oblation of the funeral cake, and the pouring of water.\"\u2014Atreya.\n\n2. \"By a man who is destitute of male children, a son who is duly qualified must with care be adopted, on account of the oblation of the funeral cake and water, and for the honour of his name.\"\u2014Manu.\n\n3. \"A Br\u00e1hman, as soon as he is born, is under a threefold debt: he owes holy study to the primeval sages, sacrifices to the gods, and offspring to his ancestors. That man only is free from debt, who is father of a son, a performer of sacrifices, and a student of scripture.\"\u2014Upanishad.\n\nThe belief that the continuance of deceased ancestors in a state of happiness after death depends on the regular performance of funeral rites by an uninterrupted line of male descendants appears to be one of the most deep-rooted and most essential points of the religious faith of the Hind\u00fas: it, in fact, forms the basis of their legal institutions concerning marriage, family affairs, and the distinction of property. In accord with the precepts fo\nallegorizing etymologies and playful allusions to the primary signification of important words, observable in the most ancient works of the Sanskrit literature, the word 'putra', or puttra, has been interpreted according to the dogma just stated, and originally signifying \"a son from hell.\" This derivation of the word putra is supported by passages, not of treatises on law only, but likewise in other works, wherever the mutual ties of parental affection are spoken of. An exceedingly strange manifestation of this supposed to imply, occurs in the first book of the Mahabharata, where the ascetic saint Jaratkaru, the only male survivor of his race, is described as accidentally arriving, on a pilgrimage, at a cavernous cave, in which he beholds, with dismay, his fellow men deprived of their heavenly abode, and just then sinking into dark subterranean regions, in consequence of his neglect of domestic and family duties.\n\nThe three debts mentioned in the passage from the Mahabharata, discharge of which becomes incumbent upon a Brahmana at the time of his birth, are frequently alluded to. Passages from the Vedanta Sutra, perfectly similar to that given by our author, are cited by him. The gloss on Manu, iii. 45; by Ramanakrishna Tirtha, in his commentary on the Vedantasara, p. 11. ed. Calc.; by Viswanatha, in his commentary on the Nyaya-Sutras of Gotama, iv. 59; and by the commentator to the Dattaka-Mimansa, p. 1. ed. Calc.\n\n* From put, \"Hell,\" and the verbal root trai, \"To save,\" the diphthong ai of the latter element to have been shortened into ei, principle according to which the root gai, \"To sing,\" is shortened into gaya, and the derivation s\u0101magya, \"Who chants the Sama-veda.\" According to the native grammarians, the alleged derivation of putra is thus:\u2014putas tr\u0101yate, iti putrah, analogous to that of s\u0101magya, s\u0101magya.\n\n\u2020 T\u0101n abrav\u012bt sa dr\u0101shtv\u0101 tu Jaratkaru\u1e25 pit\u0101mah\u0101\u1e25 ke bhavanto 'valambante garte 'smin vai adhomukha\u1e25.\n\nPitara \u0101chu\u1e25:\n\nY\u0101y\u0101var\u0101 n\u0101ma vayam rishayah s'ansilavata\u1e25,\nSant\u0101nasya kshayat, brahman, adho gachchh\u0101ma na.\n\n\"Jaratkaru, beholding them, thus addressed the deceased ancestors: 'Are you hanging in this cavern, with your heads foremost?'...

XII.\u2014Biographical Sketch of the late Captain James McMurdo. By James Bird, Esq., M.R.A.S., F.R.G.S. &c. &c.\n\nRead 5th April, 1834.\n\nIn presenting to the Royal Asiatic Society the late Captain McMurdo's account of Sindh*, embracing the government, productions, and commerce of that country, with the customs and manners of its people, I am entrusted with the pleasing duty of briefly sketching the biography of its estimable author, and of stating in what manner I obtained authority for publishing the statistical information here communicated.\n\nIn an article written by Dr. McAdam, and published in the Third Volume of the Transactions of the Literary Society of Bombay, the character of Capt. McMurdo has been so happily delineated, by an intimate friend, as to leave little room for addition or improvement. To that gentleman I am indebted for this permission to bring before the public the posthumous Paper now presented; and he who has eulogized so warmly, but so faithfully, the character of one whom he knew intimately and ardently admired, will feel satisfied, I doubt not, that the labours of his friend, and their value, cannot be better made known, or appreciated, than under the auspices of this Society.\n\nThe subject of this Memoir was the youngest of four sons; who, by their father, Major McMurdo, of the Dumfriesshire Militia, were encouraged to devote their services to the interests of their country. Their parent had, in early life, followed the profession of arms; and, after having supported the interests of India against the Turks, was employed in the war of North America. His children, led by a father's example, embraced the military profession; and the youngest, was sent out as a cadet.\n\n* This Journal.\naction; and which, when proper objects were placed by late ambition, soon enabled him to attract notice and The military service of the East-India Company is of wherein frequent occasions for acting on the resources happen to individuals, placed on detached duty from a solitary out-post, or engaged in putting down public affected disturbers of the peace. In such situations natural energy, once roused, is followed by exertion, a knowledge of Oriental languages, or in acquiring for military activity and decision. His first small encouragement, or rewarded by some pecuniary advancement, lead to greater things; and, to the credit of the men be it said, few fail in obtaining recompence. Superior and brilliant talents are not so much with successful career, under such circumstances, as that printing industry of mind, which, though it may not equal of some more gifted spirits, is generally more useful and more conducive to the public weal. The conviction will encourage all, who go to India, to avoid habits are there destructive of health and happiness; and to objects of ambition, that have secured, for many, both Happily, our author, on first arriving in that country Mentor, in the person of the late General Alexander dent at Baroda, and by him was encouraged to study and Persian. The depressing influence of a warm apt to produce indolence and indifference; and young have been told by his associates, not exempt from when not met by high-minded resolution and determi lead to time mis-spent or talent mis-applied. He rose, to the difficulties of his situation; and, having mas languages, was first employed on the Staff of Sir J when sent against the Mauritius. By this officer he was to the Governor-General the despatches of this island and after the objects of the expedition had been accom returned to India in 1812; when our author was ap Kach affairs. He was now engaged in conducting which were, at this time, carried on with Fat'h Mu usurped the power of that state. Soon afterwards he sion to the coasts of Makran, Sindh, and Kach, with the pirates, who infested that quarter, to abandon their at this time his mind was attentively directed to Sindh, and the resources and productions of the of the river Indus. Several small Tracts, in\nparganahs and towns of Sindh, the different tribes of inhabitants, and\nthe productions of its soil, were written, about this period, for his infor-\nmation; and their contents, having been subsequently compared with\nthe results of other inquiries, were incorporated in his History of Sindh;\nof which the statistical account of the country, and his observations on\nthe Indus, form the Introduction. The Persian Tracts, of which I speak,\ncame into my possession through the kindness of Mr. Norris, now\nChief Secretary at Bombay, who purchased them after the author's death.\nThey appear to have been compiled, with considerable care, by men\nlong resident in the country; and among the manuscripts given me by\nthat gentleman, and used by Capt. McMurdo, there is a History of\nSindh*, by M\u00edr Ma\u00e1sam, written in the reign of Akb\u00e1r. The Persian\nauthor of this chronological and geographical work was a native of\nBhakar, and the well-known and able associate of Niz\u00e1m-ud-d\u00edn,\nAhmed Bakshi, who compiled the excellent general history of India,\ncalled the Tabk\u00e1t-i-Akb\u00e1ri.\n\nSubsequent to the mission of which I speak, Capt. McMurdo was, in\n1814, appointed Government Agent on the Jhalawar frontier, a district\nnear the Runn, then suffering from the effects of famine, and the depre-\ndations of the banditti from P\u00e1rkar and W\u00e1g\u00e1r. Here he collected the\ninformation regarding the districts and inhabitants of K\u00e1ltiaw\u00e1r, which\nwas published in the Transactions of the Literary Society of Bombay.\n\nTwo years after this time, or in A.D. 1816, a small force was sent into\nKach, in order to compel the rulers of that country to desist from\ngiving shelter to the banditti who infested the north-western frontier of\nthe Bombay territories, or that of our allies. Our author was sent to\nconduct the political business of the expedition; and having done this\nsuccessfully, so as to restore peace and order to the country, was\nappointed Resident at the court of the R\u00e1o of Kach.\n\nHis exertions were now redoubled, to acquire information on the\nhistory and geography of Sindh; and considerable sums were expended\nby him in obtaining rare Persian works on this subject. Some of the\nmore valuable of these were not to be found after his death, which hap-\npened in the thirty-fifth year of his age, on the 28th of April 1820, before\nhe had obtained the full reward of his services, by acquiring that fame to\nwhich his labours are so justly entitled. The books that were missing\nhad been probably purloined by some of his Muhammedan followers;\nas Capt. McMurdo, when attacked with cholera, of which he died, was\nabsent from his European friends, in the unfrequented district of W\u00e1g\u00e1r.\n\nThe two of his statistical or geographical Papers have been made\n\n* Of the Oriental Translation Fund have taken measures for\na of this Work; which will be a valuable addition to our\nry.\u2014Ed.\npublic; one of which was on K\u00e1ttiau\u00e1r, and the other were inserted in the Transactions of the Literary Society. Besides these, he completed a Memoir on the Indus*, and of Sindh, and its history from the earliest times. His opinion of the first of these subjects have been well stated in the book I have already made reference; and, as they appear to be of one who possessed much knowledge and cautious investigation, in Dr. McAdam's words. \"His attention,\" says he, attracted to the river Indus. His favourite view in this appeared to be, to refute those who, from etymologic analogies, have endeavoured to establish the locality of places in ancient history. How far he would have succeeded is impossible to say; but there is little doubt that he would have some places, to which Dr. Vincent ascribes very high antiquity of comparatively modern origin; while, from the geological evidence, would have shewn to have taken place, within the last century, in the course of the river as it approaches the southern coast, established the unsatisfactory nature of all inquiries into the situation of such places as are mentioned by ancient writers. A short account of this river, written prior, as would have given an enlarged view of its various changes, from Bhakar to the mouth, is told, that \"it was drawn up from the information of the coasting-trade, and, in one or two instances, from personal observation.\" But, with that caution and diffidence, characteristic of his disposition, he afterwards remarks, that \"it is proper to state, although they correspond with the actual state of the river this last year, may be found to differ materially at the present year shall have subsided.\"\n\nIn his history of Sindh, after briefly quoting the Muhammedan historians who notice the settlement of a Greek colony in the country, he proceeds to detail its first conquest by the soldiers of Islam, under the Khalifa (A.D. 712). The Muhammedans, on this occasion, invaded the country by Muhammed-bin-K\u00e1sim, who took it by storm at K\u00f3t; when the reigning R\u00e1j\u00e1, Dahir-Sinha, was killed. The Persian history of M\u00edr Ma\u00e1sam, before quoted, gives a full account of this conquest; and Captain McMurdo, in compiling his work, has used the materials judiciously. An account of the origin of the people who usurped the power in Sindh, next follows; but it appears that he has not pursued the subject with his usual felicity of research; for, in his ignorance as to whence they came, has erred widely.\n\nNeither he nor Ferishta appear to have been aware that they came into Sindh from Serumenrai, a city of Arabia Felix.\n\n* Inserted in the present Number of the Journal, p.\nin A.H. 218 (A.D. 833), by the Kh\u00e1lif Mut\u00e1sam Billah, eighth of\nthe Abassides. His Turkish and Tartar slaves had become troublesome\nto the inhabitants of B\u00e1ghd\u00e1d, and for them was founded Serumenrai,\nor Saumrah; from whence, in A.D. 842, the Kh\u00e1lif Wath\u00e9k sent a\nperson to examine and report on the rampart of Majuj and Yajuj. Such\nwere the ancestors of the S\u00famr\u00e1s of Sindh, who came into the country\nwith Tam\u00edn Ans\u00e1ri, when appointed to its government. To them suc-\nceeded the Summas, or dynasty of Jams, regarding whom our author\nhas not added much to our knowledge beyond that which may be\ngathered from Ferishta. They obtained power about the beginning\nof the fourteenth century, and lost it about the beginning of the\nsixteenth. The families of K\u00e1lhora, and the present T\u00e1lpur\u00e1s, were\nthe next native sovereigns of Sindh; and, in detailing their history, our\nauthor travels over almost untrodden ground.\n\nSuch are the labours of one who, through the greater part of his\ncareer in India, was actively in the field with military detachments,\nor busied in political discussions. He has left no mean memorial of\nhis industry; and those who imitate his example may be proud to\nemulate, if they cannot surpass, his excellence. However small or\nunimportant may appear the information, in regard to India, which\nindividuals have occasional opportunities of collecting, it is still adding\nto our knowledge of a great and interesting country, where there is yet\na wide field for literary and scientific research; though much has been\nalready effected through the exertions of public-spirited associations,\nsuch as have been lately formed in that quarter. Many, such as Captain\nMcMurdo, and particularly the junior members of that profession of\nwhich he was so great an ornament, only require that their minds be\ndirected in the proper channel to worthy subjects for their industry. The\nlittle Tract, containing the desiderata required in regard to India, and\npublished by this Society, is not sufficiently well known in that country;\nand no better method for directing the attention of the East-India Com-\npany's servants to the history, geography, statistics, and resources of that\nquarter of the globe, could be adopted, than that of giving it a more\nextensive circulation.\n\nIf called on to look at Captain McMurdo's private life, we find him\nto have been contented, cheerful, and serene; beloved in public; and the\ngeneral adviser and friend of the native population, among whom he\nresided. Generous to an extent that, in the East, is deemed an indi-\ncation of a great mind or nobleness of disposition, he was held in great\nesteem by all the nevva and was on all occasions chosen the arbiter of\ntheir disputes, and cou ellor in all difficulties.

For this purpose, after my return from Germany, I visited Temeswar, in Lower Hungary; where, from the 20th of October to the 1st of November 1819, I was occupied with this language, and also a journey to Agram, in Croatia, for the acquirement of the Slavonic dialects.\n\nAmong other liberal pursuits, my favourite studies were Geography, and History. Although my ecclesiastical studies had prepared me for an honourable employment in my native country, my inclination for the studies before mentioned induced me to seek a field for their further cultivation. As my parents were not able to spare me for an honourable employment in my native country, and to come towards the East; and, by some means procuring subsistence, to devote my whole life to researches which may be afterwards useful in general to the learned world, and, in particular, may illustrate some obscure facts in a language as I could not hope to obtain, for this purpose, an...\nport, I did not ask for it. I obtained a printed Hungarian passport at Novo Enyed, to come on some pretended business to Bucharest in Valachia; and having caused it to be signed by the General commanding in Hermannstadt, on the last day of November 1819, passing the frontier mountains, I entered Valachia. My intention in going to Bucharest was, after acquiring some knowledge of the Turkish language, to proceed to Constantinople.\n\nThere was no opportunity for my instruction; nor could I procure any means to go direct to Constantinople: therefore, on the 1st of January 1820, I left Bucharest, and, passing the Danube by Rutchuk on the 3d, I travelled with some Bulgarians, who, having brought cotton from Macedonia to that place, returned with unladen horses. After travelling eight days, in rapid marches, we reached S\u00f3phia, the capital of Bulgaria; whence, with other Bulgarians, I came in five days to Philippopolis in Romania or Thrace. I now wished to proceed by Adrianople to Constantinople; but the plague in that place forced me to descend to Enos, on the coast of the Archipelago. Leaving that place on the 7th of February, I passed, in a Greek ship, by Chios and Rhodes; and on the last day of the month I arrived at Alexandria in Egypt. My plan was, to stop for a certain time either at Alexandria or in Cairo, and to improve myself in the Arabic, with which I was acquainted in Europe; but on a sudden irruption of the plague, I left Egypt; and proceeding in a Syrian ship, I came to Larnica in Cyprus; thence to Sidon, Bairuth, and then, in another vessel, to Tripoli and Ladakia; whence, travelling on foot, on the 13th of April, 1820, I reached Aleppo in Syria. On the 19th of May 1820, I left Aleppo, and travelling with different caravans from various places, in an Asiatic dress, on foot, by Urfa and Alardin, to M\u00fasal; whence proceeding by water on a raft, I reached B\u00e1ghd\u00e1d on the 22d of July 1820. Hence, in August, I addressed a letter, written in Latin, to Mr. Rich, the English Resident, (who was at that time in K\u00fard\u00edst\u00e1n, about eight days' journey from B\u00e1ghd\u00e1d,) giving him intelligence of my arrival, and begging his protection. His Secretary, Mr. Bellino, assisted me with a dress, and with some money, through his friend Mr. Antony Swobada, a native of Hungary, with whom I was then lodging, and to whom I was also recommended from Aleppo. I left B\u00e1ghd\u00e1d on the 4th of September 1820; and travelling in European costume, on horseback, with a caravan, passing by Kerm\u00e1nsh\u00e1h (where, in the service of Muhammed Ali M\u00edrza, the eldest son of Fateh Ali Sh\u00e1h, King of Persia, were several European Military Officers) and Hamud\u00e1n, on the 14th of October, 1820, I arrived at Tehr\u00e1n, the present capital of Persia.\n\nOn my arrival, I found no Europeans in Tehr\u00e1n; but in the English Residency a Persian servant received me with kindness, gave me lodging, and such things as I required.

On the 8th of November\n1820, in a letter written in English to Mr. Henry Willock, I represented to him my return from Tauris (or Tabriz), I represented to him my acquainting him with my circumstances and intentions, and his assistance from him also. I am infinitely indebted to Messrs. George Willock, for their kind reception and generous departure. By their complaisance, I sojourned four months in the capital of Persia, became acquainted, grammatically, with the language, improved a little in English, perused several disquisitions which were the purposes I had in view, and examined many silvery coins of the Parthian dynasty. When I left Tebr\u00e1n, I left also my Persian dress, and took the Persian. I deposited here all my papers; among others, my testimonial from the University of Transylvania, my passport from Transylvania, and a certificate in Slavonic, attesting my progress in that language. I gave also to these gentlemen a letter written in Hungarian, addressed to Novo Enyed in Transylvania, signed by Joseph Korats, Professor of Mathematics and Physics, with the following request, in case I should die or perish on my road to India, that it should be transmitted.\u2014Mr. Willock favoured me with Johnson\u2019s miniature; and I travelled hereafter as an Armenian.\n\nThe 1st of March, 1821, I bade adieu to my noble benefactor, and on the 18th of April, arrived at Meshed, in Khorasan. On my way, I heard of like disturbances in the neighbouring country, it was the season when I could leave that place to proceed with security. On the 18th of November I safely reached Bokhara; but, affrighted by exaggerated reports of the approach of a numerous Russian army, I remained there for residence of five days, I left Bokhara, where I had intended to remain for the winter; and with a caravan I came to Balkh, Kalun, and Herat. On the 6th of January 1822, I arrived at Kabul.\n\nAs that was not a place for my purpose, and being informed that two European gentlemen were with Mullah Khan, between Kabul and Peshawar, and at the same time having opportunity to travel securely with a caravan, I left Kabul on the 15th of January, and came towards Peshawar. At Dika, on the 1st of January, I met two French gentlemen, Messrs. Allard and Lefebvre, whom afterwards I accompanied to Lahore; because it was the proper season to go to Kashmir, and to cross the mountains to Amritsar. I arrived at Lahore on the 11th of March 1822; and on the 14th of the same month, I left it; and, going by Amritsar and Jullundur, I arrived at Kashmir on the 17th of April, where I stopped (waiting for the proper season and companions) till the 9th of May; when leaving Kashmir and travelling with four other persons, on the 9th June I\n\n*Now Sir Henry Willock, K.L.S.*\nthe capital of Lad\u00e1kh: but I ascertained that the road to go to Yarkand was very difficult, expensive, and dangerous for a Christian; therefore, after a sojourn of twenty-five days, I resolved to return to Lahore.\n\nI was on my return near the frontier of Kashm\u00edr, when, on the 16th of July 1822, I was agreeably surprised to find Mr. Moorcroft at Himb\u00e1p. He was alone: I acquainted him with all my circumstances and designs, and, by his permission, remained with him. I accompanied him on his return to L\u00e9h, where we arrived on the 26th of August. In September, after Mr. Trebeck's arrival from Pit\u00fa, Mr. Moorcroft gave me to peruse the large volume of the \"Alphabetum Tibetanum,\" wherein I found much respecting Tibet and the Tibetan literature; and being desirous to be acquainted with the structure of this curious tongue (at the departure of Mr. Moorcroft from L\u00e9h, to proceed to Kashmir, in the last days of September), I begged leave to remain with Mr. Trebeck, who obtained for me the conversation and instruction of an intelligent person, who was well acquainted with the Tibetan and Persian languages; and by this means I obtained considerable insight into the Tibetan.\n\nAt Mr. Moorcroft's request, before his departure, I translated into Latin a letter written in the Russian character and language (procured by M\u00edr Izzat All\u00e1h, of Dehl\u00ed, the companion of Mr. Moorcroft), dated Petersburg, the 17th of January 1820, and addressed to the Chief Prince of the Panj\u00e1b, Ranaj\u00edt Sing; which, as Mr. Moorcroft informed me, after his arrival at Kashmir, he sent to Calcutta.\n\nDuring the winter in Kashmir, after my return with Mr. Trebeck, considering what I had read and learned on the Tibetan language, I became desirous to apply myself to it, and to learn it grammatically, so as to penetrate into those numerous and highly interesting volumes which are to be found in every large monastery. I communicated my ideas respecting this matter to Mr. Moorcroft; who, after mature consideration, gave me his approbation, favoured me with money for my necessary subsistence, and permitted me to return to Lad\u00e1kh: nay, he recommended me to the chief officer at L\u00e9h, and to the Lama of Yanglaia Zanskar. Being prepared for the journey, I left Kashmir on the 2d of May 1823, after having passed there five months with Mr. Moorcroft.\n\nAfter my return to Lad\u00e1kh, I arrived at L\u00e9h on the 1st of June 1823, and delivered Mr. Moorcroft's and M\u00edr Izzat All\u00e1h's letters and presents to the Kal\u00fan. This prime minister recommended me in a letter to the Lama of Yanglaia; gave me a passport; and favoured me with eight men of trust. Leaving L\u00e9h, travelling in a south-westerly direction, I...\nJune 1823, to the 22d of October 1824, I sojourned in most south-western province of Lad\u00e1kh), where I applied Tibetan literature, assisted by the L\u00e1ma.\n\nDuring my residence in Zansk\u00e1r, by the able and intelligent man, I learned the language grammatically acquainted with many literary treasures shut up in twenty large printed volumes, which are the basis of all T and religion: these volumes, divided into two classes, containing other subdivisions, are all taken from India were translated into Tibetan. I caused to be copied these immense works and treatises, in the same order the printed indices. Each work or treatise begins with Sanskrit and Tibetan, and ends with the names of the authors, and place where the author wrote, or the transformed. As there are several collections of Sanskrit and among my other Tibetan writings, I brought with me largest, taken out of one of the above-mentioned volumes of one hundred and fifty-four leaves, every page of six lines.\n\nAs I could not remain longer in that country with myself, I left it; having agreed with the L\u00e1ma to pass 1824-5 with him at S\u00fatt\u00e1mp\u00far in K\u00fat\u00fa (whereto his wives of two chiefs of Sal\u00fab, commonly descend for whom he was desirous to visit there,) and to arrange materials for a vocabulary in Tibetan and English. detained by some business, and was prevented leaving Z\n\nAs the winter was daily approaching, by his count my march, to pass the snowy mountains before the pass obstructed by any heavy fall of snow; and I arrived at K\u00fat\u00fa, without any danger; and from thence passing by and Bil\u00e1sp\u00fa, on the 26th of November of the last Sabath\u00fa. On my arrival, I expected the L\u00e1ma would about ten days: he came not; and at present I have join me, as the pass in the Himal\u00e1ya is now closed again.\n\nAt my first entrance to the British Indian territory persuaded I should be received as a friend by the Govern I supposed that my name, my purpose, and engagement after Tibetan literature, were well known, in consequence croft's introduction; to whom, before my return to half of April 1823, when I was in Kashm\u00edr, on his writing me to the Secretary of the Asiatic Society in requesting him also to forward me some compendious stated subjects, I promised, by my hand-writing in the s\nI would stand faithful to my engagement to study, and to be diligent in my researches.\n\nI think I have given an intelligible account of my history and past proceedings. Now, in the following points, viz. respecting my objects and plans for the future, as also the length to which I purpose to carry my travels and researches, I beg leave to add, the civilized and learned world is indebted to Great Britain in many respects for useful discoveries, inventions, and improvements in arts and sciences: but there is yet in Asia a vast terra incognita of Oriental literature. If the Asiatic Society of Calcutta would engage for the illuminating the map of this terra incognita, (as in the last four years of my travelling in Asia I depended for my necessary subsistence entirely upon British generosity,) I shall be happy if I can serve that Honourable Society with the first sketches of my research. If this should not meet with the approbation of Government, I beg to be allowed to return to Mr. Moorcroft, to whose liberality and kindness I am at present entirely indebted for my subsistence; or, if it pleases the Governor-General of India, that I shall be permitted to remain under your protection until my patron\u2019s return from his present tour to B\u00f4kh\u00e2ra.\n\nAfter my arrival at this place, notwithstanding the kind reception and civil treatment with which I was honoured, I passed my time (although not without doubt of a favourable answer to your report, yet) with great tranquillity, till the 23d instant; when, on your communication of the Government\u2019s resolution on the report of my arrival, I was deeply affected, and not a little troubled in mind; fearing that I was likely to be frustrated in my plans. I have now endeavoured to recollect and to arrange my ideas, as well as my knowledge of the English language will admit; and I humbly beseech you to receive these sincere accounts of my circumstances, and that you will be pleased to forward them, for the better information and satisfaction of his Excellency the Governor-General in Council, and with my humblest acknowledgments for his Lordship\u2019s regard respecting the manner in which I should be treated.\n\nI beg to apologise for my tardiness in writing, for the rudeness of my calligraphy, and for any unpolite expressions which I may have used.\n\n(Signed) Alexander Csoma K\u00f6r\u00f6si.\n\nSob\u00e1\u0161, Jan. 28th, 1825.\n\n[Since the above date, M.

XIV.\u2014Notice of the Circumstances attending the Assassination of Professor Schultz, while visiting Kurdistan in the Year 1829: in a Letter from Major Sir Henry Willock, K.L.S. M.R.A.S. &c. &c. to Captain Harkness, Secretary R.A.S.\n\nRead March 15th, 1834.\n\nI am possessed of particulars relating to the untimely end of a very zealous traveller in Persia, a native of Hesse; who was murdered in Kurdistan, during the autumn of 1829. He has not lived to reap the fruit of his exertions, neither have his notes and observations yet met the public eye.\n\nThe deceased has strong claims on the commiseration and sympathy of the Royal Asiatic Society; inasmuch as he was a fellow-labourer in the desire to promulgate a better knowledge of Asia to his brethren in Europe; and, with this view, I shall offer no apology for directing attention to the merits of a distinguished foreigner, who has established a title to public respect and consideration.\n\nM. Schultz was deputed by the French Government to make scientific researches in Persia, and to examine the antiquities of the country. He reached Tabriz in the beginning of 1829; and remained there eight months, to improve his acquaintance with the habits of the people, and his knowledge of the Persian and Turkish languages.\n\nLearned, and particularly well versed in the ancient history of the East, he was a person eminently qualified for the execution of the duties he had undertaken.\n\nHis zeal led him to visit unfrequented countries; and the danger which necessarily attends such enterprises gave additional excitement to this great impulse of his mind.\n\nThe quarter of Kurdistan lying south of Aromea is, perhaps, as little known as the most remote and inaccessible parts of Asia; and was, therefore, an object of peculiar interest with Professor Schultz. He was strongly advised, by such of his English friends whose experience enabled them duly to appreciate the danger and difficulty of the undertaking, to relinquish his favourite scheme of penetrating into this unexplored region; and, at all events, not to prosecute such an intention, unless it were sanctioned by the approbation of the Governor of Aromea.\n\nAskar Khan (formerly ambassador to France during the reign of Napoleon) happened to be the officiating authority on that part of the Persian frontier; and he strongly urged Professor Schultz not to trust himself amongst a people over whom the Prince Royal had no control; and distinctly stated, that he considered it dangerous for his safety.\nUnfortunately, such sentiments rather tended to kindle, than to allay the Professor's zeal.\n\nM. Schultz quitted the Persian frontier, in the month of November, 1829, never to return.\n\nAlb\u00e1gh, a mountainous district of K\u00fard\u00edst\u00e1n, borders, to the north, on the Persian province of Aromea; and is connected, to the south and south-west, with Diarbekr and V\u00e1n. The predominant population of this range are Muhammedan K\u00fards, of the S\u00fani sect. Amongst them are settled a considerable family of Christians, of the Nestorian creed, governed by a spiritual and temporal Chief of their own persuasion, who assumes the title of Malik. With this interesting colony, which is tributary and subject to the Kh\u00e1n of the H\u00edrk\u00ed and H\u00edrk\u00e1ri K\u00fards, M. Schultz commenced; but the notes and observations he made on this tour were lost, and have never been recovered. These K\u00fards, profiting by the natural defences and difficult approach of their country, have remained independent, alternately shewing the semblance of a recognition of sovereignty to the Persians or Turks, as symptoms of attack have been manifested by either of these Powers. The Kh\u00e1n has but a limited general sway over the population; who, jealous of any encroachment on their liberty, regard him rather as an elder, than as an absolute prince.\n\nThe watchful habits of a community surrounded by powerful neighbours, together with a certain hardihood which generally characterizes mountaineers, have stamped on this people the imputation of ferocity, and which the late act proves was not unmerited. However, as their necessities lead them to the disposal of the produce of their soil, and to the exchange of commodities, at Aromea; and therefore impose a certain degree of restraint on their conduct, and induce them to a respectful observance of such suggestions on the part of the Prince Royal of Persia as do not infringe on their independence; Professor Schultz imagined that a recommendation from His Royal Highness, with which he was provided, would ensure his safety, and probably obtain civilities and attentions from the Chief.\n\nTwo non-commissioned officers of the regular army of Abb\u00e1s Mi\u0301rza, natives of Aromea, formed a part of the suite of M. Schultz. They had on many occasions visited the country, and served as guides. Thus he appeared as travelling under the particular patronage and protection of His Royal Highness; but, unhappily, the very precautions which the Professor took to secure good treatment occasioned his destruction.\n\nBarbarous and savage nations cannot be brought to comprehend that men in easy circumstances quit the comfort and luxuries of their homes, to encounter fatigue, hardship, and danger, in the acquirement of novel information: and as M. Schultz's inquiries aimed at a knowledge of the resources of the country, and led him to an examination of the ores\nand the natural properties of the soil; it was conceived that his investigations were made with sinister intent, at the instigation of the Prince Royal; and the Professor's motives being thus misinterpreted, shy and suspicious people considered that their own security might be compromised by a communication to the Persians of the knowledge he had acquired.\n\nThe Kurdish Chief received M. Schultz with great hospitality at his residence, at Jezail Malik, the capital of the district. He professed to encourage and assist his researches, and at the same time planned his destruction.\n\nThe dangers of the road were magnified; and, on the plea of his honour as a distinguished guest, an escort was appointed for his safety who too faithfully executed the secret orders they had received to murder him.\n\nThe deed was effected in a retired spot, to which he had been invited under the pretence of seeing some interesting remains of antiquity. The Professor was slain in the back, and his followers were also killed. The baggage, from which he had been designedly separated, went, by a direct route, to a fortress called Boos Kala, where such of his servants as accompanied it were put to death. Amongst the victims were the officers of the Prince Royal. The party thus sacrificed consisted of seven or eight persons.\n\nSome Armenian peasants, who were employed to inter the bodies, communicated the intelligence to a priest of their own persuasion on the Persian frontier; and thus we were made acquainted with these melancholy details.\n\nM. Schultz, on leaving Armenia, had sent his baggage to Salmas, a district of Persia, lying west of the lake of Aromeni; by which route it was his intention to have returned from Kurdistan.\n\nThere is every reason to suppose that the papers and notes of M. Schultz, taken previously to his excursion into Kurdistan, have been saved.\n\nThe Prince Royal of Persia, on being informed of the fate of the Professor, immediately sent a threatening message to the Khan of Albagh; who restored the horses and arms of the deceased, and stated that he had been killed by robbers. It was the professed intention of his Royal Highness to have avenged the murder in the summer of 1830. The appearance of plague and pestilence in the province of Azerbaijan, and subsequent political occurrences of importance, prevented the execution of his design.\n\nAccordingly to the direction of Count Guilleminot, the effects of Professor Schultz were sent, by the British Authority at Tabriz, to the French Embassy at Constantinople.\nART. XV.\u2014Biographical Sketches of Dekkan Poets; being Memoirs of the Lives of several eminent Bards, both ancient and modern, who have flourished in different Provinces of the Indian Peninsula; compiled from Authentic Documents, by Cavelly Venkata Ramaswami, late Head Translator and Pundit in the Literary and Antiquarian Department, Calcutta. 8vo. Calcutta, 1829. pp.xx. and 164.\n\nThe work of which the title is copied above at full length, is a specimen of the class which this department of the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society was designed to make more extensively known. It has of late years become not unusual for natives of India to publish literary works in the English language; and the practice would, it is thought, become much more common, were greater extension given to the\u2014at present\u2014very limited sphere in which they are known. In the hope of promoting an object so desirable, in every point of view, as the cultivation of the English language among the natives of the immense possessions in the East subjected to British sway, and to encourage the publication in that language, by themselves, of their literary labours in every department, it has been determined to devote a space in this Journal, in which analyses of such works shall be inserted, and their existence and nature thus become speedily and widely understood.\n\nThe materials for these biographical sketches were procured, as the author states in his dedication to Lord William Bentinck, while he was in the service of the late Colonel Mackenzie, when that officer was engaged in investigating the history and antiquities of Southern India*. They are introduced by a preface, which commences as follows:\u2014\n\n\"According to Aristotle, all poetry consists in imitation; and if we allow the remarks of Hermogenes to be true, that whatever is delightful to the senses produces the beautiful, we could not pitch on a spot of the world more abundant in natural objects to excite poetic effusions, than the Peninsula of India, where the face of nature is furnished with features that strike the imagination with scenes, the most sublime, imposing, and delightful, so as to raise all human powers of fancy to an elevation that exalts them to the very sublime and beautiful: there have, consequently, been several very eminent bards, who have flourished at different periods in India.\"\n\nThe author proceeds to observe, that, according to Hind\u00fa accounts, the ancient legislators, Menu and others, have included poets among the Sapta Anga, or \"seven appendages\" requisite to the courts of all legal monarchs; and it is also affirmed, that poetry is innate, and not to\n\n* See page 162.\nbe acquired: astrologers assert, that mankind obtain the fortunate influence of the planets Jupiter and Venus.\n\nThe ancient kings of the north of India were great poets; although in the remote ages, here referred to, poems were artificially constructed than in later times, when the greater poets caused these effusions to be less esteemed by patrons taught to expect such panegyrics as a matter of course. This practice was kept up by the princes of the lunar race, and others, until the solar and lunar races became extinct in Nanda; whose fall is commemorated in the drama Rakshasa, or \"The Signet of Rakshasa,\" a minister of Candra which has been translated by Professor Wilson*.\n\nThe arts and sciences were introduced into the Deccan north of India, at a very early period; and Sanskrit poetry flourished in various provinces, until the vernacular dialects generally employed for productions of that nature; while verse, in Sanskrit, implying, \"that poems in the language (Sanskrit) were, like the wild cows, very rare, and only found in forests and mountains; while those in the vernacular language were hogs, to be found at every door.\"\n\nThe author proceeds to notice the principal poets who wrote in the Telugu, Mahratta, and other dialects of the Sanskrit in the Southern Peninsula; and then concludes his Introduction\u2014\u201cThe manner in which I have executed the task I have left to leave an enlightened public to judge; well knowing that I do not expect well-turned periods, or elegance of diction, from a native. Some typographical errors will be found in the work, my harassed state of mind has prevented me correcting; but I shall rely on the indulgence of the public towards a native who has not merit approbation.\u201d\n\n\"Bhaskar Achari.\n\nWas a Brahmin astronomer, and inhabitant of Bedar in Nizam's dominions.

Boriah was deputed by his master to collect information useful for the office; and the sagacity and diligence he displayed, to collect materials, and in making researches, obtained the unqualified approbation of his employer; and the result of his labours was such as materially to promote the interest of the Hon. Company. The service was very arduous, for Boriah had to traverse dreary woods and lofty mountains about Srisale. While on this survey, Colonel Mackenzie was appointed Engineer to the expedition against Manilla, and Boriah was obliged to return to his home, While on the way from Hyderabad to Madras, he kept a correct journal, and wrote some poems in Sanskrit and Telugu: he likewise collected a great many literary materials, to elucidate the history of India. While at Ellore, he displayed his skill in mechanism, and knowledge in the arts and sciences; and obtained the admiration of his townsfolks, who highly esteemed him on account of his sweet temper and unimpeachable character. When his employer returned to the Peninsula from the expedition, Boriah accompanied him to the survey they had been formerly employed upon.\n\n\"In the year 1798, Boriah accompanied his master in the campaign against Tippu Sultan; and kept a poetical journal of the route till he reached Gadewa, a petty zemindary in the Nizam's dominions. It happened once, that his employer's official papers were plundered by marauders of that zemindary, and Boriah was deputed to recover them. In endeavouring to do this, he was confined in prison, and denied food by the zemindar, and very harshly treated at first; but owing to his conciliatory behaviour, and some affecting poetry that he composed, he was able to soften the obdurate heart of that chieftain, so that he not only regained his master's property, but received, besides, some presents on his own account. After this he joined Colonel Mackenzie, whom he accompanied to Seringapatam: he was present at the storming and capture of that fortress, and described all the incidents attending it in animated versification: the planting of the British colours on the ramparts was excellently described. Boriah was well rewarded by his master for this performance. Colonel Mackenzie was, shortly after the fall of Tippu Sultan, appointed as superintendant of the Mysore survey; and Boriah attended his master to Chittledroog, by the route of Bangalore, Nijagall, and Sira. He was eminently useful in making arrangements to procure useful information connected with the service, so as to promote con-\n\"The foregoing poem of the Vasoo Charitra was made by the contemporaries of Bhattu Murti; and became a model for those who composed in the Telugu language. Bhattu Murti was rewarded by Terumala Raya for this and other works that he wrote at the command of that monarch; so that he passed his life in peace and happiness, until his death, which happened at his sixtieth year of his age.\"\n\n\"AGASTYAR.\n\n\"This was a celebrated Tamul poet. The learned men of the south of India are in doubt whether he is to be identified with the celebrated Agastya Mahamuni, or is some other person of the Sudra caste. He wrote a Tamul grammar, the first of its kind that was ever written, and called it Agastya-Vyakarana. It consists of five modes of Yalakanum, viz. Yaluttu, Chollu, Kollu, and Alankaru: he also composed several other works on mythology, philosophy, medicine, alchemy, and on religious matters, including a formula of prayers. The remote age in which Agastya lived caused the materials to compile his biography to be very scanty; but we give more heed than due to the legendary accounts respecting him.\"\n\n\"AVAYAR.\n\n\"This poetess was the daughter of a Brahmin named Adi, and a woman named Adi, of a low tribe. According to some accounts, she and her brothers and sisters (namely, three males and four females) were the issues of Brahma and Saraswati, when they were sent through different countries; and left by those deities to various individuals, who brought them up, and in whose families they were admitted. Avayar excelled all her brothers in learning, although she was brought up by a Panakar (a songster). She was contemporary with Kamban, the author of the Ramayana; and she employed her elegant pen on various subjects, such as astronomy, medicine, and geography; her works of this description are much admired. Avayar remained a virgin all her life, and died much admired for her talents in poetry, and arts and sciences.\"\n\n\"KAPILAR.\n\n\"This was one of the brothers of the before-mentioned Teruvallor is mentioned as his birth-place, which was in the country. He was brought up a Brahmin; and was educated in the Tamul language, which he very soon became master of.\"\nNEW PUBLICATIONS.\n\nIllustrations of the Sacred Scriptures, collected from the Customs, Manners, Rites, Superstitions, Traditions, Parabolical and Proverbial Forms of Speech, Climate, Works of Art, and Literature of the Hind\u00fas, during a Residence in the East of nearly Fourteen Years. By the Rev. Joseph Roberts, C.M. R.A.S. &c. &c.\n\nThis work is intended to supply what has long been felt as an important desideratum in Biblical Literature; for, notwithstanding the excellent works formerly compiled with similar views to the present, the improved and widely-extended state of our knowledge of the natives of the East, and the various countries which they inhabit, furnishes ample ground for an accurate and attentive observer to produce a body of additional Illustrations of the Scriptures,\" which will be not inferior to those which have preceded them, either in interest or instruction.\n\nThe plan adopted by Mr. Roberts, is that of arranging his materials in the order of the books, chapters, and verses of the Bible; thus furnishing satisfactory explanations of very many difficult and obscure passages of the Sacred Writings: and from Mr. Roberts's opportunities of observation during the period he has been engaged as a Missionary in Ceylon, there is every reason to believe that the work will be ably and satisfactorily executed.\n\nEssay on the Architecture of the Hind\u00fas.

From this subject he reverts to the directions for building temples of different degrees of extent and richness; and concludes by explaining the mode of manufacturing chunam, the celebrated cement used throughout India.\neducated at a private school at Ellore, until ten years of age, and began to study Sanskrit poetry; and possessed such talent that in the course of five or six months he was enabled to compose himself, which were much admired for their elegance. His brothers held situations of confidence and trust in the service, Boriah was determined to qualify himself for such an office, and consequently began to study the Persian language, also the Hindustani; and had for a tutor the venerable Jagerdar of the village of Cotture, which is situated near Ellore: he soon perfected himself in those languages. At fourteen years of age, he went to a school kept by a Mr. Masulipatam; after leaving which, he was so fortunate as to obtain the patronage and friendship of Colonel Pearce, who commanded the Native Infantry at Ellore. During his leisure hours, he studied poetry and grammar, and particularly the works of Attalure Papiah. Boriah was apprenticed in the office of paymaster at Masulipatam, and in a short time got well acquainted with the whole details of the office; and was deputed several times to detachments at Ongole, Mangala, Condapelly, &c. He was employed by Mr. Dent, as a writer at Masulipatam; being recalled by his old employer, he returned to Masulipatam, where he was engaged as a head writer, at the request of his friend Narainappa, head translator to Lieut. Mackenzie of the Corps of Engineers, afterwards Surveyor-General of India, who was then employed in Nizam's dominions. This officer, in a letter to Sir Alexander Grant, makes honorable mention of the subject of this biography, as seen from the following extracts from the letter in question:\n\n\"...connection then formed with one person, a native, and lamented V.C.

C. Haughton's Bengali and Sanscrit Dictionary, from the East India Company; a volume of the Kahgyar, Bhotea MS., and a slab, with a mantra of the Buddhists engraved on it, from Mr. B. H. Hodgson; the seventeenth volume of the Asiatic Researches, from the Asiatic Society of Calcutta; the two first volumes of the text, and five first parts of the plates, of the magnificent work on the Antiquities of Egypt and Nubia, now publishing by Professor Rosellini, under the auspices of the Grand Duke of Tuscany, presented by the editor; the official Papers on the Affairs of the East India Company, 8 vols. 4to., and several charts of the Indian seas, from Sir A. Johnston: &c. &c. &c.\n\nThe principal donations to the Museum were, 1, a model of the Hind\u00fa temple at Trivalore, in the kingdom of Tanjore, beautifully carved in wood, presented by John Hodgson, Esq.; the model measures about 3 feet 2 inches by 2 feet 5 inches, and contains nearly seventy different buildings. 2. A model of the Parsi burial-place or cemetery, erected on the island of Bombay by Framji Cowasji Sett, in memory of his daughter Dinbhoi. It was built in 1832, by a young Parsi engineer, Sorabji Dhunjibhoy, who also made the model, and executed the illustrative drawings which accompany it. This cemetery is similar in its construction to those hitherto in use, of which an excellent description is contained in the Appendix to Major Moor's \"Narrative of the Operations of Little's Detachment,\" with one exception, viz. that a flight of steps has been introduced within the outer wall, on the left of the entrance, with a chain attached, to facilitate the escape of any persons who might be enclosed in the tomb while yet alive. This innovation was firmly resisted by the priests, but the erection being effected during the night, and being therefore ascribed to supernatural agency, it was suffered to remain. The model and the drawings were presented, in the name of the artist, by Wm. Newnham, Esq., member of council at Bombay.\n\nLieut. Colonel William Henry Sykes, of the Bombay establishment, Thomas Newnham, Esq., of the Madras civil service, and Samuel Cartwright, Esq., were severally balloted for, and elected resident members of the Society.\n\nThe reading of a communication from Brian H.

When the Maharata chief was captured at Harihar, by the detachment under Sir Arthur Wellesley in 1800, Boriah wrote a poem on that occasion; after this he composed a piece of a hundred stanzas on a prophet, whose holy man's name into increased celebrity. Another poem written by Boriah, intitled 'Sreranga R\u00e1j\u00e1 Charitu,' gives a genealogy of the Srirangapatam sovereigns, from the time of Umattore, giving a description of the ancient ruins of Srirangapatam where the Yadava princes ruled and became powerful.\n\nWhen the army broke up from before Seringapatam, he marched about with the army through different parts of the ceded districts and Mysore. His services were highly noticed by Gen. Campbell, Col. Munro, and other officers of distinction, as well as by the Mysore dewan. By the instruction of his master, Boriah acquired perfect knowledge of mathematics, astronomy, geography, and other sciences, both according to European and Hindu methods; and his memory was so excellent that he soon acquired a proficiency in different native languages, and could draw very neatly, and constructed maps that were excellent copies of those made by his master.\n\n\"He discovered various ancient coins; and made facsimiles of inscriptions in different obsolete characters. When he deciphered some Kanada characters, inscribed on a tablet found at Dodar, and deposited in the Museum of the Asiatic Society, his master was greatly gratified, and put his name on it.\n\n\"Colonel Mackenzie having been ordered by the Governor General St. George to return to Madras on public business, Boriah accompanied him in 1801; and was employed two years at that Presidency translating books and valuable manuscripts and documents. In the sixth year of his age, Boriah was unfortunately attacked by fever which terminated in his premature death in 1803. His memory is still preserved by a monument to be erected to his memory, with a suitable inscription, near the sea-shore, which is still standing. At the age of twelve he married the younger sister of Venkatachellum, zemindar of the same district, and left issue an only daughter; and died universally lamented on account of his public and private virtues.\"\nremarks by stating, that it appears to him that there is scarcely one point from which it can be inferred that the western branch, below Tatta, was the one down which Alexander passed, and that his three days' march was to the westward.\n\nThe reading of the paper being concluded, Lieutenant Burnes, who was accidentally present at the meeting, and whose name had been mentioned by Mr. Pottinger, begged to be allowed to make a few remarks in explanation of his reasons for dissenting from the conclusion of Lieut. Pottinger as to the branch of the Indus navigated by Alexander's fleet; which reasons he founded on the text of Arrian, who expressly declares that Nearchus sailed out of the western branch and not the eastern, and the fact that the topography of the country, near that mouth, answered to the accounts of both Arrian and Curtius. With reference to Lieut. Pottinger's hypothesis, that the three days' march of Alexander was to the eastward of the eastern branch of the Indus, and in Cutch, Lieut. Burnes urged the improbability of such a circumstance, since Arrian expressly states that Alexander undertook that march to search for water and dig wells for his fleet, which was to sail west and not east: if he had dug wells in Cutch, therefore, they would have been useless.\n\nThe ground on which Lieut. Pottinger founded his doubt as to the identity of Pattala with Tatta, Lieut. Burnes submitted, was no proof against the identity, since the Greeks had overrated the extent of the base of the delta by 700 stadia; and Arrian had stated that the Indus divided into two great branches at Pattala, which was the fact with regard to the modern Tatta. Both Dr. Vincent and Major Rennell were in favour of the identity of the two places, and Lieut. Burnes himself had seen the remains of two great cities in the immediate neighborhood of Tatta.\n\nOn the motion of Sir Graves Haughton, it was resolved that Lieut. Burnes be requested to reduce his observations to writing, that they might be appended to Lieut. Pottinger's essay; and after thanks had been voted to that gentleman for his communication, the meeting adjourned.\n\nSATURDAY, JANUARY 18TH, 1834.\n\nThe Right Honourable Sir Alexander Johnston, Vice-President, took the chair at this meeting; among the donations laid before the members were the following:\n\nFrom the Rev. J. Hobart Caunter, a copy of the Oriental Annual for 1834. From Henry O'Brien, Esq., a copy of his Essay on the Round Towers of Ireland. From Professor Ewald, the second volume of his Grammatica Critica Lingua Arabica. From Professor Neumann, his Pilgerfahrten Buddhistischer Priester von China nach Indien. From Thos.

Pottinger's observations principally was the eastern or western branch of the stream of the river, and that by which the fleet sailed down the western branch of the river when he used the expression \"three days' journey\" meant to the westward; and he proceeds to state this opinion erroneous, among which may be mentioned which is so high and steep as to prevent the passage between the fleet and the shore for a considerable absence of any flat shore, in which wells could have been done by Alexander, for the use of his forces.\n\nthe estuary of the eastern branch of the Indus is the slightest resemblance to that described by the historians of a large city, now existing, near Shahapar, near Hyderabad, and called Hingler, in the neighbourhood of a forsaken channel of a large stream, which, according to formerly the bed of the Indus or one of its branches, and the course supposed by Lieut. Pottinger, would have enabled him to have reached Cutch without the necessity of navigating in its whole length; a point which has puzzled all writers. Lieut. Pottinger further doubts the identity of the present place said to have been visited by Alexander, on the ground of the sea not agreeing with that mentioned by the ancients.\nPROCEEDINGS\n\nOF THE\n\nROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY.\n\nSATURDAY, DECEMBER 7TH, 1833.\n\nThe first general meeting of this Society for the present Session was held this day; the Right Honourable Sir Alexander Johnston, Vice-President, in the chair.\n\nThe various donations to the Library and Museum of the Society, received during the vacation, were laid on the table; among them were Professor Wilson's Sanscrit Dictionary, from the author; Sir G. C. Haughton's Bengali and Sanscrit Dictionary, from the East India Company; a volume of the Kahgyur, Bhotea MS., and a slab, with a mantra of the Budd'hists engraved on it, from Mr. B. H. Hodgson; the seventeenth volume of the Asiatic Researches, from the Asiatic Society of Calcutta; the two first volumes of the text, and five first parts of the plates, of the magnificent work on the Antiquities of Egypt and Nubia, now publishing by Professor Rosellini, under the auspices of the Grand Duke of Tuscany, presented by the editor; the official Papers on the Affairs of the East India Company, 8 vols. 4to.; and several charts of the Indian seas, from Sir A. Johnston: &c. &c. &c.\n\nThe principal donations to the Museum were, 1, a model of the Hind\u00fa temple at Trivalore, in the kingdom of Tanjore, beautifully carved in wood, presented by John Hodgson, Esq.; the model measures about 3 feet 2 inches by 2 feet 5 inches, and contains nearly seventy different buildings. 2. A model of the Parsi burial-place or cemetery, erected on the island of Bombay by Framji Cowasji Sett, in memory of his daughter Dimbhoy. It was built in 1832, by a young Parsi engineer, Sorabji Dhunjibhoy, who also made the model, and executed the illustrative drawings which accompany it. This cemetery is similar in its construction to those hitherto in use, of which an excellent description is contained in the Appendix to Major Moor's \"Narrative of the Operations of Little's Detachment,\" with one exception, viz. that a flight of steps has been introduced within the outer wall, on the left of the entrance, with a chain attached, to facilitate the escape of any persons who might be enclosed in the tomb while yet alive. This innovation was firmly resisted by the priests, but the erection being effected during the night, and being therefore ascribed to supernatural agency, it was suffered to remain. The model and the drawings were presented, in the name of the artist, by Wm. Newnham, Esq., member of council at Bombay.\n\nLieut. Colonel William Henry Sykes, of the Bombay establishment, Thomas Newnham, Esq., of the Madras civil service, and Samuel Cartwright, Esq., were severally balloted for, and elected resident members of the Society.\n\nThe reading of a communication from Brian H. Hodgson, Esq., on the law of adultery in Nep\u00e1l, was commenced*.\n\n* This paper is inserted in the present Number of the Journal; see p. 45.\nSATURDAY, JANUARY 4TH, 1834.\n\nA general meeting of the Society was held this day; Col. Burne in the chair.\n\nVarious donations were laid on the table, among which may be mentioned the following:\n\nFrom the Rev. Robert Yuille, missionary at Selenginsk, in Tartary, a manuscript spelling-book and lexicon of the Tibetan language, called \"Names,\" with the explanation in Mongolian. From Thomas Snow, Esq., a descriptive letter-press to Gould's Century of Himalayan Birds. From Mr. Franklin, a copy of his translation of the tale called \"Camarip.\" From the Rev. Dr. Morrison, four numbers of the \"Evangelist Sinica.\" From John Davidson, Esq., a copy of his \"Observations generally.\" From Cavell Vencata Lutchmiah, of Madras, a copy of the \"Sati,\" or \"Chandi Pat,\" an extract of the \"Marcandeya Purana,\" translated into English by Cavell Vencata Ramaswami. From Professor J. Smith, a copy of his French version of the Chinese drama, called the \"Orphan of Zhao.\" From Sir Grenville Temple, Bart., a Phenician grave-stone, found near the village called Maghrawah, in Tunis. From Babu Radhacanta Das, a copy of the third volume of his Encyclopedia or Lexicon, in Sanskrit language.\n\nThe reading of Mr. B. H. Hodgson's Remarks on the Law and Customs of Nepaul, in cases of adultery and of sexual commerce between a man and an outcast, was resumed and concluded.\n\nThanks were ordered to be returned to Mr. Hodgson for his communication.\n\nThe next communication read was an essay, by Lieut. W. P. Pottinger, on the Present State of the River Indus, and on the route of Alexander.\n\nLieut. Pottinger's observations principally refer to the question whether the eastern or western branch of the Indus, which was formed by the confluence of two streams, was the river by which the Macedonian conqueror passed through India. He commences with a sketch of the present course of the river, and its various branches. He then adverters to the common opinion, that Alexander's fleet sailed down the western branch of the Indus; that Arrighi, when he used the expression \"three days' journey to the east,\" meant to the westward; and he proceeds to state his reasons why this opinion is erroneous, among which may be mentioned the nature of the country, which is so high and steep as to prevent the possibility of any communication between the fleet and the shore for a considerable part of the distance. The absence of any flat shore, in which wells could have been dug, and water obtained, has been done by Alexander, for the use of his forces. The author concludes that the estuary of the eastern branch of the Indus is the only one which bears any slightest resemblance to that described by the historian; and that the ruins of a large city, now existing, near Shahapour, on the road from Hyderabad, and called Hingar, in the neighbourhood of which is a forsaken channel of a large stream, which, according to the information given by the natives, was formerly the bed of the Indus or one of its branches, and which, if the course supposed by Lieut. Pottinger, would have enabled Alexander to have reached Cutch without the necessity of navigating the river in its whole length; a point which has puzzled all writers before him. Lieut. Pottinger further doubts the identity of the present Tuthar, said to have been visited by Alexander, on the ground of its distance not agreeing with that mentioned by the ancients; and he\nsubsistence were derived from the plunder of their victims, which is all brought to their head-quarters. They are sworn to a fair division, to secrecy, and to mutual fidelity; they never rob until they have deprived their victims of life; they never use open force, and never leave the smallest traces of their crime, for, as their murders are effected by strangulation, no traces of blood are left, and the bodies are entirely defaced or deeply buried. So well contrived are their plans, and so true have they proved in general to their compact, that there are but few instances of the conviction of P'hanisgars in a court of justice.\n\nMr. Stevenson next describes the various plans adopted by these systematic murderers to attain their ends, and states that, by the avowal of one of the Phansigars above alluded to, they had murdered sixteen individuals in a fortnight's expedition. The booty they obtain is sometimes so trifling as not to exceed one or two rupees, or even the cloth forming the dress of the individual.\n\nThe denomination of Sh\u00fadgarshid appears to be derived from the Canarese terms Sh\u00eddgar, 'a burning or burial-ground,' and sh\u00edd, 'proficient' or 'ready,' denoting the practice of this tribe to prowl about cemeteries for the purpose of collecting certain pieces of human bone, with which they are generally supposed to work charms and incantations. The name by which they are more generally known, however, in the Dekkan and other parts of the country, is Garodi, 'juggler,' and this is the designation of the caste in the Vij\u00f1aneshvara S\u00e1stra. They are looked upon with much awe by the people, and the fear of exciting their displeasure secures a ready compliance with their demand for alms; but this is not their only means of subsistence, as they are notorious for kidnapping children, and also for an abominable traffic in the sale of sinews extracted from the breasts, wrists and ankles of females, which are supposed to be amulets preventive of all kinds of evil; but, in order to possess due efficacy, they must have been obtained from a woman who has recently been confined. In illustration of this practice, Mr. Stevenson details a case of the murder of a young female, who had been confined for the first time about ten days, which occurred at Sholapur, a few years ago. The paper is concluded by a few observations on the deities to whom the Sh\u00fadgarshids pay reverence.\n\nThe thanks of the Society were ordered to be returned to Mr. Stevenson for his communication.\n\nThe reading of some Observations on the Mineralogy of the Western half of Cutch, by Alexander Henderson, Esq., was commenced.\n\nThe author premises that the portion of Cutch, described in his paper, may be said to have its ranges of hills, two in number, distinct from those of the eastern half, which includes Wajir. The southern range is nearly continuous, running from within a mile or two of Anjar through the centre of Cutch to near N\u00e1riyansir, where it joins the northern range, which is a succession of higher hills unconnected together, giving to that part of the country a rugged and inhospitable character.\n\nThe hills of the southern range do not average more than 600 feet in height; resting generally on a base of clay-slate running into sandstone slate, over which is a bed of red or yellow sandstone, acquiring a black colour on exposure to the air. There are one or two small ranges between Mandav\u00ed and Anjar, and some others farther west, composed of trap-rock. The general dip of the slate, in this range, is to the south, giving the hills abrupt northern faces with sides gently sloping to the south. This slope has, in some instances, followed the direction of the strata so exactly, as to assume the appearance of artificial paving: there is no table-land in this range. The northern range is also generally composed of clay-slate, resting upon beds of argillaceous clay and bituminous shale, over which limestone and trap-rock are occasionally met with, but less of the red sandstone than in the southern range; the dip of the slate\n\n* An ample account of the P'hanisgars and Thugs is inserted in the Asiatic Researches, Vol. xiii. p. 250.\nLieut. Colonel Richard Lacy Evans, C.B., was proposed, and, as a member of the Madras Auxiliary Society, immediately balloted for and elected a resident member of the Society. David Urquhart, Esq. was also balloted for and elected a resident member.\n\nThe papers read at this meeting were an Account of the Ruins of the Temple of Somnat'h, by Lieutenant Burnes; and some remarks on the Hind\u00fa System of Education prevailing in the Southern Peninsula*, by Captain Henry Harkness, secretary to the Society.\n\nThe town of Pattan is situated on the coast of Gujar\u00e1t, in N. lat. 20\u00b0 54', and about forty miles above the Portuguese settlement of Di\u00fa. Its antiquity is unquestioned, and the inhabitants recount with literal accuracy, the facts recorded in history relative to the storming of the holy temple, by Mahm\u00fad of Ghazni, particularly his dashing the idol to pieces with his mace, and discovering the hidden cause of the anxiety of the priests to prevent its destruction\u2020. The pious Hind\u00fa does not deny the fate which befell his god, but he consoles himself with the idea, that the deity retired into the sea on the approach of the invader, and has ever since remained there. The temple was converted into a mosque, but is now neglected both by Hind\u00fa and Muhammedan, and is converted to the meanest of purposes; it stands on a rising ground, to the north-west of the town, and close to the sea, from which it is only divided by the walls of the town, and is visible at a distance of twenty-five miles. Unlike Hind\u00fa temples in general, it consists of three domes; the two external domes are diminutive, but the central one has an elevation of more than thirty feet, and is above forty feet in diameter; the arches are constructed in a similar manner to those of most Hind\u00fa buildings, by projecting courses of stone, gradually approaching until they close at the top; but the Muhammedans have converted these rude attempts into more perfect forms. There are no inscriptions to be discovered on the temple of Somnat'h, but Colonel Tod has given the translation of one still to be seen, relating to the kings of Nehrwala or Pattan. The town itself is almost uninhabited, and would be quite deserted, but for a modern Hind\u00fa temple, founded by the munificence of Alia Blye, the celebrated wife of Holkar, and the vicinity of a place of Hind\u00fa pilgrimage. The date of Lieut. Burnes's visit was October, 1830.\n\nThanks were ordered to be returned to Lieut. Burnes and Captain Harkness for their respective communications.\n\nSATURDAY, FEBRUARY 4TH, 1834.\n\nA general meeting of the Society was held this day; the Right Honourable Sir Alexander Johnston, V.P., in the chair.\n\nA paper, containing an Account of the P'hangsars, or Gang-robbers, and of the Shulgarshid, an Association of jugglers and fortune-tellers, by James Arthur Robert Stevenson, Esq. of the Madras civil service, was read.\n\nThe particulars respecting the P'hangsars, furnished by Mr. Stevenson in this paper, were the result of an examination of part of a large gang, inhabiting a village not far from Bijap\u00far. This troop consisted of about sixty males, mostly having families and habitations in D\u00fadgi, which they considered as their head-quarters; they were under the direction of two naigs, or chiefs, and were also responsible to the patell, or head of the village, for the payment of a regular tribute, as the price of his connivance and protection. The greater portion of the gang were Muhammedans, but there were among them R\u00e1jputs and other castes: their ostensible employment was agriculture, but their only means of\n\n* Inserted in the present Number of the Journal, p. 15.\n\u2020 This supposed fact is clearly disproved in Professor Wilson's paper on the Hind\u00fa Sects, As.

The name by which they are more generally known, however, in the Dekkan and other parts of the country, is Gar\u00f3di, 'juggler,' and this is the designation of the caste in the Vij\u00f1anesvara S\u00e1stra.

The highest hills are in this range, but they are stated not to exceed 1,200 feet in height; there are few appearances of table-land, but some of their summits are conical and surmounted by a peak, which in some instances proved to be columnar basalt. The structure of some of the highest hills is nearly the same, masses of white sandstone resting on clay-alate, over which was found whinstone containing much iron, and, apparently deposited in the sides of this, masses of calcareous sandstone were occasionally met with.\n\nThe streams in this part of Cutch are, with few exceptions, strongly impregnated with saline matters, but principally with rock-salt and alum; even the wells are often brackish, and the principal supply of fresh-water is derived from tanks; salt-marshes are frequent all over the northern part of Cutch, and some of them are said to be influenced at times by the tides.\n\nAfter some remarks on the soil and general appearance of the country, Mr. Henderson proceeds to describe the stratified rocks; at which part the further reading of the paper was postponed till a future meeting.\n\nSATURDAY, FEBRUARY 15TH, 1834.\n\nThe Right Honourable Sir Alexander Johnston, V.P., took the chair at the meeting this day; various donations were laid upon the table, among them were the following:\n\nFrom Captain Harkness, secretary to the Society, a beautifully-executed drawing, by a native artist, of the Seringum pagoda, coloured; and a massive chased silver necklace, worn by the inhabitants of the Nilagiri Hills. From H.J. Domis, Esq., his Notes on Java, printed at Sourabaya, parts 4, 5, 6, and 7; and a Sourabaya Almanack; also a curious ancient Javanese coin, of white copper, with the representation of Adam and Eve; specimens of these coins are given in the plates to Marsden's Numismata Orientalia, and described, part ii. p. 811. From Captain Melville Grindlay, an original painting, in oil, of a Byr\u00e2g\u00ee, or Hind\u00fb devotee. From Capt. Harkness, in the name of Visvambra S\u00eestri, a series of works for the assistance of native students in acquiring the Sanscrit language; and a similar series for the Tamil, in the name of Tir\u00fb Vencatach\u00e2la M\u00fbdeliar. From Wm. C. Taylor, Esq., a complete set of the Foreign Quarterly Review, from the commencement. On the presentation of this work, the Right Hon. Chairman drew the attention of the meeting to many valuable papers on Oriental subjects contained in it; some of which were understood to be the production of the gentleman just named. Sir Alexander also presented, from Mr. Auber, of the East India House, a copy of his work on China, recently published; and from himself, a series of papers, connected with several cases heard in appeal from India before the Privy Council.\n\nThanks were ordered to be returned to the respective donors.\n\nJames Bird, Esq., surgeon on the Bombay establishment, being proposed for election as a resident member, was, in conformity with Article XI. of the Society's regulations, applying to members of the Bombay Branch Society, immediately balloted for and elected.\n\nMr. Bird commenced reading his Historical Introduction to his translation of the Mir\u00e2t i Ahmad\u00ee, a Muhammedan History of Gujar\u00e2t, illustrating the constitution of Hind\u00fb society and the state of India, from the end of the tenth to the beginning of the thirteenth century.\n\nThis disquisition opens with some remarks on the origin of the Hind\u00fbs south of the Nerbada river. The author observes that no work deserving the name of history can be said to exist amongst the Hind\u00fbs, nor does he except from this statement the R\u00fbj\u00e2 Taringini, of which a translation was published by Professor Wilson in the Asiatic Researches. In the absence of historical records, the utility of Sanscrit grants and Muhammedan annals is recognised, for the\n\nto state that this is not given as the result of accurate measurement.\nPROCEEDINGS\n\nof\n\nTHE ANNIVERSARY MEETING\n\nof\n\nTHE ROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY,\n\nHELD ON SATURDAY, THE 10TH OF MAY, 1834.\n\nThe Eleventh Anniversary Meeting of the Royal Asiatic Society was held this day at one o'clock: the Right Honourable Charles Watkins Williams Wynn, M.P., President, in the chair.\n\nAmong the members and visitors present, were His Excellency M. Tricoupi, the Grecian ambassador; the Right Hon. Charles Grant, M.P., President of the Board of Control; the Right Hon. Sir Alexander Johnston, V.P. R.A.S.; the Right Hon. Henry Ellis; Sir George Thomas Staunton, Bart., M.P. V.P. R.A.S.; Sir Charles Wilkins, K.H., LL.D.; Major Sir Henry Willock, K.L.S., &c. &c.\n\nThe Minutes of the last General Meeting were read and confirmed.\n\nThe Report of the Council on the Society's proceedings, since the last Anniversary, was read. (See p. iii.)\n\nThe reading of the Council's report being concluded, the report of the auditors, as to their examination of the Society's accounts for the year 1833, and on the present state of its funds, was read by David Pollock, Esq. (See p. xiv.)\n\nSir George Thomas Staunton, Bart., in moving \"that the thanks of the Society be given to the auditors for their services, and that their report, together with that of the council, be received and printed,\" observed that when the qualifications of the gentlemen appointed to act as auditors were considered, there could be no question as to the propriety of the motion. It was gratifying to reflect on the very satisfactory state in which the Society appeared to be, after an existence of eleven years, notwithstanding the great variety of similar institutions, which, though doing honour to this metropolis by their foundation, might naturally be expected to divert the attention of literary men from one so peculiar in its object as this. This result, he thought, was in a great measure to be attributed to the great and zealous attention which had been paid to its interests and proceedings by the president, and those gentlemen who had successively filled the office of secretary to the Society. Sir George concluded by submitting the motion, which was seconded by Louis Hayes Petit, Esq., F.R.S., and carried unanimously.\n\nMr. D. Pollock returned thanks on behalf of the auditors, and expressed their pleasure at being able to make so favourable a report of the state of the Society's financial affairs.\n\nThe Right Hon.

This leads to a sketch of the state of India at that epoch, and its distribution amongst its Hind\u00fa rulers, of whom the Rajp\u00fats occupy a large share of attention. The decline of the Gaznevide dynasty is then traced, and the rise of the house of Gh\u00f3r, whose contests with the celebrated and chivalric Hind\u00fa sovereign, Prithi R\u00e1j\u00e1, are detailed at length. The extension of the Mo\u00e9lem conquests to the borders of China and Hind\u00fast\u00e1n are described, and the narrative concludes with the death of Mahommed Gh\u00f3ri, and the establishment of the Delhi empire.\n\nThe thanks of the Society were unanimously voted to Mr. Bird for his very interesting communication, which will, we believe, be speedily put to press, with the translation to which it is prefixed, under the auspices of the Oriental Translation Committee.\n\nThe reading of Mr. Henderson's Observations on the Mineralogy of the western half of Cutch was resumed and concluded.\n\nThe rocks in this part of Cutch seem to be all of the transition or secondary formation, nor did the author hear of any primitive rocks in the other extremity of the country. Clay-slate appears to be that on which the others rest, and is consequently very abundant. The best limestone is found at the western extremity of the country, where it is almost the only rock; it is found in several places in the form of coarse marble, and near Lakpat in that of marle on a bed of shells, from which excellent lime may be obtained. Sandstone is very plentiful; it is generally found resting on the clay-slate, forming beds of great thickness; it is for the most part remarkable for its softness. Rock-salt occurs in veins among the sandstone; but though the author thinks it probable that large beds of it may exist, in similar situations, he did not meet with any instance of its having been discovered. Cutch has a great supply of coal, probably at no great depth from the surface; it has been found, in small quantities, at several places, particularly in the bed of a river about six miles N. E. from Bh\u00faj, at about twenty-five feet depth. But few ores of metal have as yet been discovered in Cutch; those of iron and copper only are specifically described. The paper concludes with a notice of the saline minerals, including an account of the manufacture of alum.\n\nThanks were ordered to be returned to the author of this paper.\n\nA letter addressed by Sir Henry Willock, K.L.S., to Captain Harkness, secretary to the Society, containing some particulars of the assassination of Dr. Schulz, was read*.\n\nThanks were returned to Sir Henry Willock for his communication, and the meeting adjourned to the 6th of April.\n\nSATURDAY, APRIL 5TH, 1834.\n\nA general meeting of the Society was held this day; the Right Honourable Charles W. Williams Wynn, M.P., President, in the chair.\n\nAmong the donations laid on the table at this meeting were the following, viz.:\n\nFrom Professor Eug\u00e8ne Burnouf, F.M.R.A.S., a copy of his Commentaire sur le Ya\u00e7na, one of the Zend manuscripts. From George Frere, Esq., the San-huo-che, or \"History of the Three Kingdoms;\" and other works in Chinese. From the Royal Society, the Philosophical Transactions for 1833. From the Rev. Dr. Morrison, the Chinese Repository, several numbers, and various tracts in Chinese. From J. H. Astell, Esq., Gutzlaff's New Chinese Magazine, Nos. 1 and 2. From H. J. Domis, Esq., F.M.R.A.S., a specimen\n\n* Inserted in the present Number of the Journal, see p. 134.\nIt became known that these writers had not noticed the existence of any such practice at that time; and observed that it was through the unremitting exertions of Sir Alexander that the government of India was at last induced to exert its authority in the suppression of the practice, and it was not a little singular that the same distinguished politician who was subsequently seen attending the meetings of the Hindu Councils, was watching with intense interest the decision of that high tribunal. An appeal made by a small number of his bigoted followers against the orders of the local government, enforcing the abolition of the practice, was dismissed. Sir Alexander next dwelt on the pernicious influence of a belief in astrology, as exhibited in its effects on all the circumstances of ordinary life in India, where instances of its power on the minds of otherwise well-meaning and respectable individuals were of constant occurrence; a very striking case was divulged in a case recently brought before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. A young man, possessed of considerable property, had consulted an astrologer as to whether he should have any direct heirs to his wealth, and was assured that it was quite impossible; under the influence of this assurance he absconded, and an individual, in no way connected with his family, as his heir, and the case having been brought before the local courts, it was decided that from the circumstances of the party having acted under a delusion in the art of astrology must be set aside, and the property restored to the true heir. This decision, Sir Alexander stated, was lately appealed against to the Privy Council, but was eventually confirmed. Another instance was mentioned by Sir Alexander as having come within his own knowledge in Ceylon; a woman, of highly respectable character, was tried before him on a charge of having murdered her infant child; and it clearly appeared that she had been induced to expose it in a wood, whence it had been carried off by some wild animals, by the prediction of the village astrologer, that if it lived it would bring misfortune on the family. From this circumstance the life of the mother was spared, and it is believed that she may be still living. Sir Alexander stated that he availed himself of the opportunity to desire the jurymen, who were all natives of Ceylon, to furnish him with all the information they could procure on the subject of astrology, as connected with its influence on the manners and customs of the people, and he thus became possessed of the documents subsequently published by the late Mr. Upham in his History of Bulhun. As contrasting with the preceding, Sir Alexander noticed some laws deserving of encouragement from the government, and pointed out the advantages which would result from a more extensive dissemination of their principles amongst the native population; the moral aphorisms of Auveiyar, the Tamil poetess, were adduced as instances, which, as exemplifying the rules of Hind\u00fa legislation, were, without reference to the source from whence they were derived, deserving of the support of the government. We are now in possession, Sir Alexander remarked, of accounts of the constitutions of three pure Hind\u00fa sovereignties: one, an Exposition of the Laws of Nep\u00e1l, by Mr. Brian H. Hodgson; another, on those of the Southern Peninsula, by the late Mr. F. W. Ellis; and the third, on those of the Kandyan Kingdom, by the late Sir John D'Oly.\n\nFinally, the committee had deemed it important to investigate the nature of the oaths made use of judicially in the courts of justice in India. It was a general opinion, Sir Alexander observed, that the natives of that country were peculiarly addicted to perjury; but, from his own experience and observation, he was convinced that as much gross and wilful perjury was committed among the lower orders of society in other countries as in India; the origin of the impression alluded to, he considered, would be found in the fact of our being for the most part ignorant of what were the oaths really considered binding by the Hind\u00fas themselves. The result of his inquiries had shown that in Hind\u00fast\u00e1n proper, not less than one hundred and thirty various forms of oaths were used in the examination of native witnesses, only two of which, it appeared, really considered binding on their consciences; one of these was\u2014\nfather was caused to place his hand on the head of his son, and imprecat the vengeance of the Deity on the latter, if he himself gave false evidence; the other was merely the converse of this, viz. the son laying his hand on the head of his parent, and using the same form. Where the obligation was really felt to be binding, Sir Alexander remarked that he thought there would be found as few instances of wilful perjury as in any other country.\n\nSir Alexander then urged the great desirableness of obtaining such information as had been referred to, as preparing those whose duty it would hereafter become, to consider and establish a code of laws for India, to examine attentively, and decide with correctness on the various suggestions which would be offered to them on the subject: one, of which the importance could only be adequately estimated when it was remembered that, according to the principles thus to be deduced and laid down, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council would hereafter have to be guided in its decisions on all questions coming before it in appeal from our Indian territories, involving, as they frequently do, property to an immense amount, and interests exceedingly complicated in their nature.\n\nSir Alexander now proceeded to explain the proceedings of the committee as referable to the second head, viz. the intercourse between Europe and India by means of steam-navigation. He mentioned, in the first instance, the various records existing in Constantinople, and other eastern cities, relative to the routes formerly pursued by merchants, &c., in traversing the countries lying between the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean; also the assistance which was likely to be derived in prosecuting its inquiries from Mr. D. Urquhart, author of the valuable work on the Resources of Turkey, at present residing at Constantinople; and from Capt. J. E. Alexander, who was engaged on an expedition, in the course of which he would visit the old Portuguese settlements on the eastern coast of Africa. Sir Alexander stated that, in order to facilitate Captain Alexander's enterprise, he had, through the medium of his relative, Admiral Napier, secured the countenance and assistance of the Portuguese government to be extended towards him; and that he might be enabled to command the support of the officers of that power in its African dominions, the local rank of Colonel in the Portuguese service would be conferred upon him. Sir Alexander next referred to the account furnished by Mr. Edye, late master-shipwright of the dock-yard at Trincomali, and now in the department of the surveyor of the navy, of all the different kinds of vessels used by the natives of Ceylon and the coasts of the Southern Peninsula of India, for navigating the adjacent seas; in which their singularly effective adaptation to the peculiar circumstances of season and climate to which they were outfitted were clearly pointed out. Two other papers, Sir Alexander stated, were in preparation by Mr. Edye for the Society; viz. one on the various natural products of the countries above mentioned, which may be applicable to naval purposes, the other descriptive of some proposed improvements in the backwater of Cochin, and other water-communications of a similar character, so as to effect an extension of their navigability.\n\nIn the third place, Sir Alexander proceeded to show in what manner the opening of the trade with China would facilitate the operations of the Society. He reminded the meeting of the many important inventions attributable to the Chinese, such as the magnet, gunpowder, printing, at least in the mode which we call stereotyping, which were generally considered to have been known to them long before the Europeans were acquainted with those subjects: from these it might be calculated what important advantages were open to the literary pursuits of Europeans in connexion with China. Under this impression it had been resolved to request Lord Napier to establish an Auxiliary Society at Canton, and the committee had had the advantage of the assistance of Sir George Staunton in drawing up the necessary instructions for that purpose, while, on the spot, Lord Napier would meet with the able co-operation of such men as Morrison, Davis, Gutzlaff, and others; the committee at home, again, were secure of the powerful aid of Sir George Staunton, whose works on\nof India, to show that those writers had not noticed the existence of any such custom at that time; and observed that it was through the unremitting exertions of Ram Mohun Roy that the government of India was at last induced to exert its authority for the suppression of the practice, and it was not a little singular that the same distinguished philanthropist was subsequently seen attending the meeting of the Privy Council here, watching with intense interest the decision of that high tribunal on an appeal made by a small number of his bigoted countrymen against the orders of the local government, enforcing the abolition of the rite of Sati burning. Sir Alexander next dwelt on the pernicious influence of a belief in astrology, as exhibited in its effects on all the circumstances of ordinary life in India, where instances of its power on the minds of otherwise well-informed and respectable individuals were of constant occurrence: a very striking one was developed in a case recently brought before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. A young man, possessed of considerable property, had consulted an astrologer, as to whether he should have any direct heirs to his wealth, and was assured that it was quite impossible: under the influence of this assurance he absolutely adopted an individual, in no way connected with his family, as his heir; and the case having been brought before the local courts, it was decided that, from the circumstances of the party having acted under a delusion, the act of adoption must be set aside, and the property restored to the heirs at law. This decision, Sir Alexander stated, was lately appealed against to the Privy council, but was eventually confirmed. Another instance was mentioned by Sir Alexander as having come within his own knowledge in Ceylon; a woman, of highly respectable character, was tried before him on a charge of having murdered her infant child; and it clearly appeared that she had been induced to expose it in a wood, whence it had been carried off by some wild animal, by the prediction of the village astrologer, that if it lived it would bring misfortune on the family.

As contrasting with the preceding, Sir Alexander noticed some laws deserving of encouragement from the government, and pointed out the advantages which would result from a more extensive dissemination of their principles amongst the native population: the moral aphorisms of Aurveiyar, the Tamil poetess, were adduced as instances, which, as exemplifying the rules of Hind\u00fa legislation, were, without reference to the source from whence they were derived, deserving of the support of the government.

It was a general opinion, Sir Alexander observed, that the natives of that country were peculiarly addicted to perjury; but, from his own experience and observation, he was convinced that as much gross and wilful perjury was committed among the lower orders of society in other countries as in India: the origin of the impression alluded to, he considered, would be found in the fact of our being for the most part ignorant of what were the oaths really considered binding by the Hind\u00fas themselves. The result of his inquiries had shown that in Hind\u00fast\u00e1n Proper, not less than one hundred and thirty various forms of oaths were employed in the examination of native witnesses, only two of which, it appeared, were really considered binding on their consciences: one of these was, when a\nbe favourable to the operations of the Society. In this way also, the permitting Europeans to settle in the British territories in India, would tend to benefit the Society; and when the difficulty of formerly exciting the slightest interest in the affairs of India was considered, the present altered feeling afforded well-grounded hopes of success in the pursuit. Sir Alexander also noticed the establishment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, for hearing appeals, as having originated, so far as its connexion with India was concerned, in this Society. His attention having been drawn to the necessity of such a Court, by the discovery that an appeal by the R\u00e1ja of Ramnad had been lying over for twenty-seven years, owing to the want of some person whose duty it should be to take charge of such cases. Sir Alexander then detailed the constitution of the Judicial Committee, and pointed out the obligations which the members of it were under to acquaint themselves thoroughly with the subjects on which they were called upon to decide; and its advantages in inciting barristers, students, and others, to devote their attention to matters connected with the administration of our eastern empire. From the apathy with which such questions were usually viewed, it had been found useless to prepare reports of the statements and adjudications of these appeals, but an arrangement had been made by the government, which would cause such reports to be regularly prepared and published. As far as they went, Sir Alexander observed, that even the slight notices of the cases heard, contained in the Court Circular, were of use, inasmuch as many persons thus became aware of them, who would not be inclined to read more ample details.\n\nFrom this subject Sir Alexander passed to the projected publication of a Quarterly Journal, expatiating on the advantages it would offer as a medium of extensively circulating whatever information might be communicated to it, an advantage which would not even be limited by the circulation of the Journal itself, as from the connexion of the publisher employed by the Society with the Saturday Magazine, it was fair to suppose that any fact or observation of general interest would be copied from the former into the latter, and thus secure a circulation of 70,000 or 80,000 copies: this would naturally prove a great inducement to young officers and others, whose names would be made generally known in connexion with habits of intelligence and observation. The beneficial effects of a greater circulation would also, it was expected, be secured for the publications of the Oriental Translation Fund, by means of an arrangement just entered into with Mr. Bentley, and thus some very important results would be obtained. Sir Alexander stated, that he had ascertained that the three works connected with India, which had attained the greatest circulation, were the Journal of Bishop Heber, the Life of Sir Thomas Munro, and the Oriental Annual; and he pointed out the causes to which this superior attraction might be ascribed, and the classes of persons likely to be most interested in them. The works written by ladies had also tended to draw more general notice towards the East, especially those by Mrs. Graham, Mrs. Lushington, Mrs. Meer Hassan Ali, and Mrs. Belnos. Sir Alexander then drew a comparison of the state of the East as to civilization at present with what it was four centuries ago; mentioning the curious fact, that a short time back, in the city of Cairo, a procession took place of fifty Muhammedan medical students, headed by their European instructor in his national costume, returning from receiving the rewards conferred by their ruler, for their proficiency in surgery and anatomy, displayed in actual dissections of the human body. At Damascus also, a city once esteemed so sacred that no Frank was permitted to enter it, the British Consul-General in Syria had lately attended on some public occasion, when he was received with every demonstration of honour and respect. Constantinople itself might now be considered the advance-guard of European civilization in its progress towards the East, an object which all the changes that had lately occurred would tend to promote. Even the influence of the Russians, their examinations of the coasts of the Black Sea, their college at Pekin, to which it was now considered an honour to be appointed, and the establishment of a British Consul\nvarious subjects connected with Chinese literature, politics, and morals, were by no means so well known and appreciated as from their importance and value they deserved to be. Sir Alexander observed, that he had been told by the grandson of the celebrated Montesquieu, that the only subject on which that distinguished writer felt at a loss, when preparing his admirable work, was the system of Chinese jurisprudence, of which the labours of Sir George Staunton had subsequently furnished an ample and satisfactory view.\n\nHaving thus reviewed the principal operations of the committee, Sir Alexander pointed out some of the additional means and facilities, which circumstances had placed at its disposal since the last Anniversary. Commencing with China, he again adverted to the new Branch Society, about to be formed at Canton; and the Anglo-Chinese college, at Malacca; in Bengal, the Asiatic Society had concentrated its resources to the publication of a monthly Journal, which among other matters of interest would, it was understood, contain in progressive portions, the whole of the late Dr. Buchanan Hamilton's valuable Statistical Reports on the various districts under the Bengal Presidency; and Sir Alexander expressed his hope that the Survey of the Dekkan by Colonel Sykes, before mentioned, would in the same way be included in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society. Sir Alexander next alluded to the recent institution of a literary Society, among the learned natives at Madras, mentioning the circumstances which led to its foundation by Cavelly Venkata Lutchmiah, who had been Colonel Mackenzie's chief assistant in his researches into the antiquities and history of Southern India; it was expected that these would be followed up by this Society, which already consisted of more than two hundred individuals. The Bombay Branch R.A.S., and Geographical Society, were next instanced; and Sir Alexander then alluded to the auxiliaries, which would be set on foot by Captain Alexander in the Portuguese settlements, from whence the intercourse, formerly carried on with India, had chiefly taken its rise. In Egypt appearances were highly gratifying as related to the Society's operations, the Pasha having sanctioned the formation of an auxiliary Society there, and authorised it to collect and transmit any information which might be considered necessary: an individual had also been despatched, under His Highness's patronage, by Mr. Briggs, on a scientific mission into Syria, and he was provided with instructions to further the Society's views in every way. At Constantinople, again, it had an active correspondent in Mr. Urquhart, who had opened communications with various communities of Armenians, amounting to between 400,000 and 500,000 persons, from which much insight into their ancient history and institutions might be looked for. Sir Alexander also adverted to the establishment of the official Turkish newspaper, entitled the Moniteur Ottoman, as presenting a great moral engine of civilization among the people of that extensive empire; the circulation of that Journal, Sir Alexander mentioned, is at present about 4700, but it is calculated that it will shortly be not much under 20,000. Sir Alexander then noticed the attendance of M. Tricoupi, the Grecian Minister, at this meeting, in connexion with the foundation of a Branch Royal Asiatic Society at Corfu, by Lord Nugent. M. Tricoupi, he observed, had been an intimate acquaintance of that friend to the improvement of Greece, the late Lord Guilford, and he felt assured that the measures of the Society in that quarter would have his cordial support.\n\nIn conclusion, Sir Alexander took a general view of existing circumstances, favourable to the attainment of the Society's objects. Of the propriety of opening the trade with China to British subjects in general, Sir Alexander remarked, the Society was not called on to express its opinion; it was sufficient for it to be assured, that the circumstance must tend to increase the interest of the Society's exertions. The spirit of speculation would be excited, manufacturers from the great centres of industry in this country would pour forth their productions into markets hitherto shut against them; and although the effects might be severely felt by some, too sanguine in their expectations as to the results, still the experiment must excite general interest, and that interest will\nbe favourable to the operations of the Society. In this way also, the permitting Europeans to settle in the British territories in India, would tend to benefit the Society; and when the difficulty of formerly exciting the slightest interest in the affairs of India was considered, the present altered feeling afforded well-grounded hopes of success in the pursuit. Sir Alexander also noticed the establishment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, for hearing appeals, as having originated, so far as its connexion with India was concerned, in this Society. His attention having been drawn to the necessity of such a Court, by the discovery that an appeal by the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Ramnad had been lying over for twenty-seven years, owing to the want of some person whose duty it should be to take charge of such cases. Sir Alexander then detailed the constitution of the Judicial Committee, and pointed out the obligations which the members of it were under to acquaint themselves thoroughly with the subjects on which they were called upon to decide; and its advantages in inciting barristers, students, and others, to devote their attention to matters connected with the administration of our eastern empire. From the apathy with which such questions were usually viewed, it had been found useless to prepare reports of the statements and adjudications of these appeals, but an arrangement had been made by the government, which would cause such reports to be regularly prepared and published. As far as they went, Sir Alexander observed, that even the slight notices of the cases heard, contained in the Court Circular, were of use, inasmuch as many persons thus became aware of them, who would not be inclined to read more ample details.\n\nFrom this subject Sir Alexander passed to the projected publication of a Quarterly Journal, expatiating on the advantages it would offer as a medium of extensively circulating whatever information might be communicated to it, an advantage which would not even be limited by the circulation of the Journal itself, as from the connexion of the publisher employed by the Society with the Saturday Magazine, it was fair to suppose that any fact or observation of general interest would be copied from the former into the latter, and thus secure a circulation of 70,000 or 80,000 copies: this would naturally prove a great inducement to young officers and others, whose names would be made generally known in connexion with habits of intelligence and observation.

At Damascus also, a city once esteemed so sacred that no Frank was permitted to enter it, the British Consul-General in Syria had lately to attend on some public occasion, when he was received with every demonstration of honour and respect. Constantinople itself might now be considered the advance-guard of European civilization in its progress towards the East, an object which all the changes that had lately occurred would tend to promote. Even the influence of the Russians, their examinations of the coasts of the Black Sea, their college at Pekin, to which it was now considered an honour to be appointed, and the establishment of a British Consul\nat Trebisond, whatever their political objects might be, must inevitably con-\nduce to the spreading of civilization throughout the East. In conclusion, Sir\nAlexander expressed his conviction that the President of the Board of Control\nwould feel it to be his duty to support the operations of the Society, considering\nthe importance of the means at its disposal for promoting the welfare and\nprosperity of the people of India.\n\nThe Right Hon. Charles Grant, President of the Board of Control, rose to\nmove, \"That the thanks of the meeting be presented to the Right Hon. Sir\nA. Johnston, for his able Report, and that he be requested to reduce his obser-\nvations to writing, for the purpose of being printed together with the Report;\"\nand observed that the merits of the motion were so obvious that he could\nnot doubt its success. When the general interest displayed by Sir Alexander\nin furthering the objects of the Society, and the early and active share he took\nin its formation, were considered, it must be felt that however deep might be\nthe debt of gratitude due to others, it was peculiarly so to him, and that when\nrecording the names of those who have proved themselves zealous and constant\nfriends to the Society, it cannot forget to assign him a place among the most\ndistinguished. The right hon. member of parliament expressed the gratification he\nwould feel in being present at such an occasion as this meeting, though he had to\nregret that it was the first time he had ever had that pleasure; he trusted,\nhowever, that he might be allowed to make up by his mature homage, for any\nwant in his personal relations. It was impossible, he observed, for any man,\nunversed in the resources of the nation, not to feel an interest in the success\nof the Society, and he was sure that, even could he wish it,\nto serve the cause of the race and the civilisations of India and its inhab-\nitants, which he was labouring hard in education; this he conceived\nto lead to its greatest success. India had seen the first association of\nEuropeans in the purpose of diffusing a knowledge of its history, literature,\nand antiquities, in fact, assuming the organisation of our Society, some\nyears ago, as a body of young, able, excellent and able men\nwere engaged in gathering and collecting all the information they\ncould obtain from every quarter, and in the gathering case of society\nwere engaged in the same manner, but in addition to the above, they\nwere engaged in the task of making a translation of a thousand\nyears of Hindu literature into English, and in the course of their researches in one\nof the most difficult languages of the world, they came across, and when\nthey had completed their work, they found that the numerous branches\nof Hindu literature were so vast and so numerous, that it seemed almost\nimpossible to bring them all together. They had been engaged in this\nwork for many years, and had accomplished it, and now they were\nready to present it to the world.\nthey haughtily characterized as barbarians\u2014but that holier interest which springs from an anxiety to further the progress of civilization and refinement among all nations. This reflexion, the right honourable gentleman remarked, called forth all those classical associations which connected the Ganges and the Indus with the Ilissus, and the name of India with the exploits of Bacchus and of Alexander.\n\nIf the Society, Mr. Grant proceeded to observe, was only composed of Europeans and Christians, its design would still be incomplete and unsatisfactory, but it admitted the natives of the East to a participation in its proceedings, it united them with itself, and thus not only secured a great advantage, but marked its measures with a character of peculiar interest: in proof of this, he might refer to the works now on the table, one of which was the production of a Hind\u00fa. If the Society had only aimed at exciting an interest in favour of literature and science, in the minds of the natives of the East, it would have done much, but by blending them with its own body, it has secured their effective co-operation in the work, and incited them to follow it up among themselves. In conclusion, Mr. Grant adverted to the loss which the Society had sustained by the death of so many valuable members; and this, though a source of deep regret, yet carried with it some slight degree of consolation: it was something, he observed, to be able to say, that such men as these had once belonged to the Society\u2014it was not every institution which could boast of having enrolled such names as those alluded to, in its ranks, and it was no small proof of the extent and stability of the Society, that it was able to bear the loss of such men.\n\nThe motion, having been seconded by Major Sir Henry Willock, K.L.S., &c., was put and carried unanimously.\n\nThe Right Hon. the President then rose, and submitted from the Council, several additions to and alterations of, the Regulations of the Society, rendered expedient by various circumstances: they are as follows:\n\nAdd after Art. VI.\u2014Any person, not residing within the British Islands, who may be considered likely to communicate valuable information to the Society, is eligible for election as a Corresponding Member.\n\nIn Art.

The Council shall appoint a Committee of Papers, to which all papers communicated to the Society shall be referred for examination; and it shall report to the Council, from time to time, such as it may deem eligible for publication.\u201d\n\nAfter Art. XLIV. add the following:\u2014\u201cAny person elected as a Resident Member of the Society, who shall proceed to the Cape of Good Hope, or any place to the eastward thereof, shall not be called on to continue the payment of his annual subscription, but his rights and privileges, as a member of the Society, shall remain in abeyance, with liberty to resume them on re-commencing the payment of his annual subscription, or paying the regulated composition in lieu thereof.\u201d\n\nAfter Art. XLVII. add the following:\u2014\u201cThe publications of the Society shall not be forwarded to any member whose subscription for the current year remains unpaid; and, The Secretary shall apply, by letter, to all members whose subscriptions shall be in arrear at the Anniversary Meeting of the Society.\u201d\nIn Art.

LXVII.\u2014\"But no stranger shall be allowed the use of the Library without the permission of the Council.\"\n\nThese propositions having been severally put from the chair, and agreed to, the President observed, that at the late hour at which they had arrived, he would not feel warranted in detainning the members by any lengthened remarks of his own, especially after the able addresses with which they had already been favoured. He was happy in having it in his power to congratulate the meeting on the improvement in the prospects of the Society; at the same time, he had to express his regret at the absence of the actual founder of this Society; whether present or absent, however, it must be a source of great gratification to that eminent individual to hear of the high rank attained by a Society, of which he had laid the foundation; it was satisfactory also to know, that his merits, standing foremost as he did in the ranks of Oriental scholars, had been recognised by the Royal Patron of the Society, and that the offer of the distinction so justly conferred on Sir Charles Wilkins and Sir Graves Haughton, had been in the first instance made to him; and was only declined on the ground of his advanced age, and the feeble state of his health. The President stated, that His Majesty had invariably felt great interest in the success of the Society, and that the honours awarded to the two distinguished scholars above named, might be considered a direct recognition of the importance of its objects. The Right Hon. Gentleman proceeded to advert to the subject of uniting the natives with the Society, in the prosecution of its views; and called the attention of the meeting to the Essay on Hind\u00fa Architecture, by R\u00e1m R\u00e1z; the arrival of which, had excited so much interest among the architects of this country, at the last anniversary. The author of this work, and another celebrated native of India, R\u00e1m Mohan Roy, were unfortunately both deceased since that time. Their examples proved the desirableness of promoting the cultivation of their mental powers among the natives, and diffusing a general taste for English literature in India; it was interesting to observe what had already been done in this way, and to examine the publications by natives in India of late years, contained in the Society's Library. It would, in fact, otherwise be impossible to carry on researches into the history, manners, antiquities, &c., of India, to the extent that is desirable. What can Europeans, engaged as they are in official and public avocations, do in the promotion of such investigations? We shall not, said the Right Hon. Gentleman, be in possession of all the knowledge on these subjects we require, until the natives are enabled and persuaded to join in the search, and communicate the results themselves. He concluded, by expressing his pleasure at seeing so large an attendance of the members, and his hope to be surrounded by an equally numerous party at the dinner in the evening.\n\nIt was moved by Richard Horseman Solly, Esq., F.R.S., and seconded by Isaac Lyon Goldsmid, Esq.,\u2014That the thanks of the meeting be returned to the Council for its services during the past year. Mr. Goldsmid, in seconding the motion, expressed his astonishment, that the efforts of the Society were so little appreciated in general; professing the peculiar faith he did, he felt warmly interested in every thing connected with the East, and although the present was the first meeting at which he had ever attended, he could not help saying, how much he was gratified with the views and proceedings of the Society.\n\nCaptain Gowan observed, that although for the propriety of the motion, he considered it would be advisable that the President of the Society should always be the President of the meeting. He had, in fact, always understood that...\nand he wished to draw the attention of the Council to the subject. He wished to be understood as not referring to the President of the Society in his individual capacity, or as wishing in any way to detract from the merit of the services that gentleman might have rendered to the Society, but simply to express his opinion that great advantages would be secured to the Society by the change.\n\nThe Right Hon. President, in putting the question, said that, agreeing generally in the view taken by the honourable and gallant member who had just spoken, he had felt it to be his duty, on retiring from office as President of the Board of Control, to tender the resignation of the Presidency of this Society, but that the Council had not thought fit to accept that offer. He could only say that he should be extremely happy to resign, either now or at any time when he might be called on so to do, in favour of his Right Hon. friend (Mr. Grant), or any other gentleman who might be selected by the Society. He would, however, take the opportunity of stating that his late Majesty, King George IV., was so convinced of the importance of this Society being connected with the government, that he directed a clause to be inserted in the Charter, enacting that the President of the Board of Control, for the time being, should always be a Vice-Patron of the Society. There had been several Vice-Patrons nominated by the Society, among whom might be mentioned the Dukes of York and Sussex, Prince Leopold, and the Marquesses of Hastings and Wellesley; but the President of the Board of Control was invariably the ex-officio Vice-Patron of the Society. Sensible as he was of the great advantages of the Society at the time of its formation, he was most willing to place himself at its head, and devoted to its progress all the time and attention he could spare from his official duties: he now, however, thought it might be more conducive to the interests of the Institution, if it possessed a more direct communication with the government through its President, and that therefore it might be advisable to place the President of the Board of Control in the chair.\n\nMr. C. Grant would not enter into the question of the propriety of uniting the two offices alluded to, though he conceived there were some considerations affecting it, which ought to make the Society pause as to its adoption. He would only state that so long as his Right Hon. friend continued to hold the office which he did, with the support and applause of the Society, he certainly would on no account accept a nomination to the chair. Indeed, he was of opinion that if he was only capable of feeling an ex-officio interest in the success of the Society, he was by no means a fit person to place in that high station.\n\nThe question was then put, and carried unanimously.\n\nMr. D. Pollock, in moving a vote of thanks to the Right Hon. the President, remarked that it would undoubtedly be thought proper, before proceeding to elect the new officers, to thank those who were going out for their services: and he had not anticipated the necessity of doing more than calling their attention to the motion he was about to propose. After what had fallen from the honourable member behind, him however, he thought he must have gone somewhat wider into the question, but from this task he had been spared by the discussion which had ensued, and the temperate and ingenuous manner in which the proposal had been disclaimed by the Right Hon. President of the Board of Control. He might refer to eleven years of superintendence of the Society's affairs on the part of their Right Hon. President, but after what had passed he was convinced that it was only needful for him to submit the motion, viz. \"That the thanks of this meeting be presented to the Right Hon. the President, for the uniform interest he has shown for the welfare of the Society, and the ability with which he has presided over it.\"\n\nSir George Staunton, Bart., in seconding the motion, said that in his opinion the prosperity of the Society was in a great measure attributable to its having\nhad only one President since its institution, while the constitution of the Society was so admirably contrived, that it secured all the benefits which could be derived from having the President of the Board of Control ex-officio President of the Society.\n\nCaptain Gowar said that, notwithstanding what had passed, he still retained his opinion that the offices ought to be united; he might give offence by stating his view of the subject so boldly and openly, but so that he was indifferent; he knew that his idea of the subject was supported by many members of the Society, even some of those who were now present, though they might not like to come forward as he had done and say so. He again disclaimed any intention of maliciously referring to the right honourable gentleman who at present filled the chair; indeed, being unaware of the extent of the services rendered to the Society by him, he could not possibly entertain any wish to depreciate them.\n\nThe motion was then put by Mr. Pollock, and carried unanimously.\n\nMr. Wyss, in acknowledging the vote, observed that there was great inconvenience in instituting personal comparisons between two individuals who were both present on the occasion, and his remarks would therefore necessarily be brief. He was bound to say, however, that he had great doubts of the expediency of making the President's chair of the Society an ex-officio appointment as a general rule; the present instance, however, stood as a peculiar case. It was well known that the Presidency of the Board of Control was a political office, liable to be newly assigned with every change of ministry, and it might happen that a person would be appointed who had not previously paid any attention to the subjects which were intrusted to his charge; he would thus, as it were, have his business to learn while discharging the duties of his office, and could hardly be expected to possess the necessary leisure to devote a proper degree of attention to the interests of the Society. With respect to the individual now filling the office, however, the case was widely different; for he might be said to possess an hereditary connexion with India, and to have devoted all his life to a cultivation of the relations which bound him to it. The Society could not therefore, perhaps, do better than select that gentleman for its head; but, as a general rule, he must again observe he did not think its adoption would be found advisable. The right honourable gentleman concluded by expressing his thanks for the honour which the Society had conferred upon him.\n\nSir Henry Willock, K.L.S., proposed a vote of thanks to Henry Thomas Collettoke, Esq., Director of the Society, for his kindness in allowing his name still to appear in its list of officers, with an expression of regret at his continued indisposition; which being seconded by James Alexander, Esq., was carried unanimously.\n\nThe thanks of the Society were returned to the Vice-Presidents, on the motion of Collins Rogers, Esq., M.D., seconded by John Cotton, Esq.\n\nThe thanks of the Society were moved to the Treasurer, James Alexander, Esq., by Richard Taylor, Esq., K.L.S., who expressed his satisfaction at the prosperous state of the funds, and the general progress of the Society, of which he was an original member. As such, he wished, though not relative to the present question, to say that he dissented in toto from his honourable and gallant friend as to the propriety of joining the offices of the President of the Board of Control and of this Society. He thought such an arrangement would make the latter a sort of political appendage to the former, and he hoped that the gallant other would not find a single seconder among the members present, to a proposition which would in effect deprive the Society of one of its chartered rights, viz. the annual choice of its President and other officers.\n\nCaptain Gowar explained that he had no intention of depriving the Society of its President, or to compel it to have an ex-officio President, if it should\nbe desirable to make another selection: he wished to have it adopted as a general rule, retaining the power of removing the President whenever it might be thought necessary.\n\nThe motion being seconded by Lieut.-Colonel William Henry Sykes, F.R.S., was unanimously agreed to.\n\nMr. Alexander, in returning thanks, assured the meeting of his desire to promote the interests of the Society, and strongly urged on the members present the necessity of using their utmost exertions to increase the annual income of the Society, observing that a society like this should be able at once to discharge every demand against it, but this could not be expected until a large surplus on its annual income was permanently secured.\n\nIt was then moved by the Right Honourable Sir Alexander Johnston, V.P. R.A.S., and seconded by David Pollock, Esq.; that the thanks of the Society be presented to Captain Harkness, Secretary to the Society, for his services during the past year.\n\nSir Alexander, in moving this resolution, remarked, that Captain Harkness presented an instance of the great talents displayed by many officers of the Company's service, in investigating the history and antiquities of the country in which they were placed, and acquiring a knowledge of the various languages which have once flourished, or are still spoken there. In this respect, Captain Harkness might be considered the worthy successor to the late Colonel Mackenzie; and Sir Alexander expressed his hope, that Captain Harkness might be enabled to make some use of the collection formed by Colonel Mackenzie, the value of which, no one knew better how to appreciate than himself, and which no one was so well qualified to take charge of, and make known to the public at large.\n\nCaptain Gowan said, that fully appreciating as he did the value and importance of the Mackenzie Collection, and being fully convinced, that no one but the present Secretary to the Society, was adequate to the task of reducing it to order, and publishing the information which it contained; he begged to urge on the Council, the necessity of making a formal application to the Court of Directors, to secure its concurrence in some arrangement, by which that gentleman might be enabled to prolong his stay in this country, and secure the valuable records and documents of the Mackenzie Collection from that oblivion and speedy decay, to which they were otherwise inevitably destined.\n\nThe Right Hon. the President and Sir A. Johnston, explained that the course suggested by the gallant officer, had been already adopted by the Council, through the medium of the President, but that no reply had as yet been received from the Court of Directors to the communication addressed to it on the subject.\n\nThe motion having been put and carried unanimously, Captain Harkness expressed his acknowledgments for the honour done him by the Society.\n\nThe thanks of the Society were then returned to Sir Graves Haughton, Librarian; on the motion of John Shakespear, Esq., seconded by Colonel William Miles.\n\nMr. I. L. Goldsmid proposed a vote of thanks to the Right Hon. Charles Grant, Official Vice-Patron of the Society, for his attendance this day, and his general attention to Indian affairs. He alluded to him particularly, as the author of the Bill, which removed all distinctions in civil rights among the natives subjected to British authority in India, and placed all on the same broad basis of freedom. Whatever, observed Mr. Goldsmid, his country might do here for him, he was grateful to the Right Hon. Gentleman for the benefits he\nhad conferred on his co-religionists in India, and for that, he considered him deserving an expression of thanks on the part of the Society.\n\nSir Alexander Johnston seconded the motion.\n\nCaptain Gowan inquired what was the particular measure introduced by Mr. Grant, alluded to by the mover.\n\nMr. Goldsmid explained, that it was the Indian Jury Bill.\n\nCaptain Gowan then said, that he entirely approved of the motion, and rejoiced at the extinction of that iniquitous system which had so long prevailed in the British territories of India, by which natives of the highest respectability, character and talent, were precluded from enjoying those rights to which they were entitled; while persons of the lowest class and most worthless character were privileged to possess the same rights, merely because they professed to be Christians. He was pleased at the appellation of representatives of the people of India, which had been bestowed on them by the right honourable gentleman; he was proud that they had been recognised in that character, and he trusted that they would prove themselves worthy of the designation. The honourable member concluded by expressing his satisfaction that the Society was considered not to restrict itself to subjects of antiquities and literature alone, but was open to the reception of questions affecting the moral and social improvement of the people of our Indian empire.\n\nThe President then put the question, which was unanimously agreed to.\n\nMr. Grant returned thanks.\n\nSir Henry Willock and Charles Elliott, Esq., having been nominated scrutineers, the meeting proceeded to ballot for the Council and Officers for the ensuing year. On the termination of the ballot: the President announced that the list of officers remained as before, with the exception of Sir Graves Haughton being substituted for Colonel Tod as Librarian. The following gentlemen were declared elected into the Council; viz. Sir Robert Harry Inglis, Bart., W. Butterworth Bayley, Esq., Lieut.-Colonel Colebrooke, Charles Elliott, Esq., Richard Jenkins, Esq., Louis Hayes Petit, Esq., David Pollock, Esq., and Professor Wilson, in the place of the Earl of Caledon, Right Hon. Henry Ellis; Right Hon. Holt Mackenzie, the Hon. R. H. Clive, Richard Clarke, Esq., Lieut.-Colonel Doyle, Lieut.-Colonel Tod, and H. St. G.

XVI.\u2014A Memoir of the Primitive Church of Malay\u00e1la, or of the Syrian Christians of the Apostle Thomas, from its first rise to the present time, by Captain Charles Swanston, of the Honourable East India Company's Military Service on the Madras Establishment.\u2014Communicated by the Madras Literary Society and Auxiliary Royal Asiatic Society.\n\nRead 5th of January, 1833, &c.\n\nCHAPTER THE FIRST.\n\nFROM THE ARRIVAL OF THE APOSTLE THOMAS TO THE FIRST APPEARANCE OF THE PORTUGUESE IN INDIA, A.D. 1502.\n\nThe Syrian or primitive church of Malay\u00e1la Christians acknowledges Saint Thomas for its founder; and from the earliest dawn of Christianity in India, the tomb of that apostle has been as much venerated in the East as the tomb of Saint Peter was at Rome. This is not asserted on the authority of any obscure tradition, but unites in its favour all the proofs which can warrant its correctness: the accumulated testimonies of the first ages of the church; of Saint Jerome; of Saint John, surnamed Chrysostom; Athanasius, and Eusebius.*\n\nCosmos, surnamed the Indian navigator (Indicopleustes), one of the first travellers who has given any account of the Christians of India, states, that in A.D. 522, Christianity was successfully preached in India. \"The pepper coast of Malabar, and the isles of the ocean, Socotora, and Ceylon, were peopled with an increasing multitude of Christians; and the bishops and clergy of those sequestered regions derived their ordination from the Catholic of Babylon.\" At the end of the ninth century, the shrine of St. Thomas was devoutly visited\n\n* St. Jerome of Palestine, A.D. 370; John, surnamed Chrysostom, patriarch of Constantinople, A.D. 403; Athanasius, patriarch of Alexandria, A.D. 326; Eusebius, bishop of Cesarea, A.D. 338.\nIn a short period of time, the seed cultivated by the apostle flourished and multiplied a hundred-fold. The religion of the apostle spread to Cranganor; to Parur,* a city of the interior; to the celebrated city on the same coast; and into many of the states of that part of India. The converted Hind\u00fas, among whom was particularly a few head Br\u00e1hmans of the families of Changambatta, Pally, C\u00e1lycoungal, Coirc\u00e1re, Colic\u00e1re, C\u00e1dad\u00far, V\u00e9llik\u00e1re, of Mottalottil, united themselves with the Jews; churches were formed, and the language of Syria was adopted in the celebration of public worship.\n\nSt. Thomas, after having given laws and a government to the infant churches, departed from Malabar and travelled along the coast of Coromandel. Mail\u00e1pur, a rich and great city, was at this period the residence of a king, besides being a place of great importance and one much resorted to by the followers of Br\u00e1hmans or Brahmans, who stirred up the multitude, the followers of their religion, and in their fury they stoned the apostle to death; while the Br\u00e1hmans, perceiving in him some remains of life, pierced him through with a lance. St. Thomas thus received, as the price of his Master, and of his devotedness to the faith, the honour of martyrdom.\n\n* At Parur, there is now standing an ancient Syrian church, supposed to be the oldest in Malabar. It is called the church of St. Thomas the Apostle. The church of Neranum, tradition also refers to apostolic times.\n\n\u2020 Baldeus, the Dutch minister, traveller, and historian, says, \"near the sea shore of Conlang (Quilon), stands a stone pillar, erected (as the inhabitants report) by St. Thomas: I saw this pillar in 1662.\"\n\n\u2021 About the year 64 of the Christian era, the division of time into ages, or patriarchal ages, was introduced by the Br\u00e1hmans. They were founded upon computed conjunctions of Saturn with the sun, and were nine in number, earliest commencing with the year 4,225 before Christ. The object assumed to have been the assertion of a claim to an antiquity beyond the Mosaic account; the knowledge of which had, just previously to this mode of computation, reached India.\n\n\u00a7 A.D. 1688\u20131723, Hamilton, in his curious account of the East, gives the following history of the death of St. Thomas, which agrees in every particular with the tradition preserved by the Christians of the present day.\n\n\"There is a little dry rock on the land called the 'Little Mount.'\"\nThe church of Mail\u00e1plur, which the apostle had founded, flourished long; it had its bishops, its priests, and its government, like the other apostolic churches; but, eventually, the neighbouring Hind\u00fa princes, instigated by the Br\u00e1hmans, who were ever jealous of its prosperity, attacked the city, and having rendered themselves masters of it, and of the provinces depending on it, the Christians became exposed to the most violent persecutions, and were destroyed with fire and sword. To escape from the cruelties of these princes, the greater part, with their bishops and priests, fled towards Cape Comorin, which separates the two coasts, and, passing thence towards the north, sought refuge in the mountains among their brethren, whom St. Thomas had instructed on the coast of Malabar. They spread themselves over the countries of Travanc\u00f3r, Quilon, and Crangan\u00f3r, and in the lands belonging to the Zamorin.\n\nTowards the end of the second century of the Christian era, a misfortune more to be dreaded than the persecutions of the Br\u00e1hmans afflicted the church of India; for divisions which arose in her own bosom weakened the purity of the faith and the vigour of the primitive discipline. About this period the great fame of the Alexandrian school was spread over the Christian world; its reputation had even penetrated into India, and those Christians who groaned under the apostle designed to have hid himself till the fury of the pagan priests, his persecutors, had blown over.\n\n\"There was a cave in that rock for his purpose, but not one drop of water to drink; so St. Thomas cleft the rock with his hand, and commanded water to come into the cleft, which command it readily obeyed; and ever since there is water in that cleft, both sweet and clear. When I saw it there were not above three gallons in it. He stayed there three days, but his enemies had account of his place of refuge and were resolved to sacrifice him, and in great numbers were approaching the mount. When he saw them coming he left his cave, and came down in order to seek shelter somewhere else; and, at the foot of the mount, as a testimony that he had been there, he stamped with his bare foot on a very hard stone, and left the print of it, which remains there to this day a witness against those persecuting priests. The print of his foot is about sixteen inches long, and, in proportion, narrower at the heel and broader at the toes than the feet now in use among us. He, fleeing for his life to another larger mount, about two miles from the little one, was overtaken on the top of it before he was sheltered, and then they ran him through with a lance; and in the same place where he was killed he lies buried.\n\n\"When the Portuguese first settled there, they built a church over the cave and well on the Little Mount, and also one over his grave on the great one; where the lance that killed the apostle is still kept as a relic. In that church there is a stone tinctured with the apostle's blood, that cannot be washed out. I have been at both mounts, and have seen those wonderful pieces of antiquity.\"\n\nMail\u00e1plur was by the Portuguese A.D. 1547, when they founded an episcopal church; the name of St. Thom\u00e9; A.D. 1551, they built the church on\nHeaven, that alone which assured to man the happiness he was destined by his Creator. The Christians of S... were the first who resigned themselves to these seducing appearances. This credulous and primitive people pers... selves, that Christians who had braved the perils and dangers of the great sea, and undergone the fatigues and privations of their laborious voyage, to extend the empire of their religion, were otherwise than just and beneficent men.\n\nAt their first interview, the Christians of Malabar did not resemble rather than the difference between their faith and the subjects of Rome; and expecting most important benefits from an alliance with their Christian brethren, their representatives instructed for them the protection of the Christian king, and that they might be received as faithful subjects of the king.\n\nThese deputies presented to Vasco de Gama, on his arrival at Cochin, A.D. 1502, a gilt baton of wood, the ends of which were adorned with silver and surmounted with three hand-bells. They said, \"the sceptre of their kings who had reigned over them last of whom had died at an epoch not much antecedent to the coming of the Portuguese.\" They informed De Gama that they had received the Gospel from Saint Thomas; that they lived in spiritual communion with the patriarch of Antioch; and that their bishops derived their authority from him.\n\n\"The difference of their character and colour attested the origin of a foreign race. In arms and arts they were found to be superior to the natives of the country. Their soldiers preceded the Nairs, and their hereditary privileges were yet respected by the greatest fear of the princes of the country. They acknowledged the Portuguese sovereign, but they were governed even in temporal affairs by the Bishop of Angamal\u00e9. He still asserted his ancient title of metropolitan of India, but his real jurisdiction was exercised in 1503, when he was intrusted with the care of two hundred thousand souls. The Portuguese admiral declared himself their zealous friend, and assured them that his master Don Emanuel only made war for the advancement of the Christian religion and the destruction of infidelity; and promised to defend them against the oppressions of their enemies. These flattering, but perfidious statements, excited among the Christians of Saint Thomas the liveliest joy; but after a while tears soon succeeded to their first transports.\n\nLa Croze describes the state of the Syrians a few years before the first arrival of the Portuguese, in the following language: \"The...\"\nand beloved and respected by the Christians of St. Thomas. It is stated that he built many churches throughout the country; established seminaries for the education of the clergy; and founded a town in the neighbourhood of the city of Crangan\u00f3r, in which he planted the foreign colony of Christians, and called it Mah\u00e1d\u00e9vap\u00e1tam. Assisted by the teachers from Syria, he introduced the Syro-Chaldaic ritual; and from his influence with the Perumal princes, he obtained the great and extensive privileges which were uninterruptedly enjoyed for succeeding centuries by the Christians of Malabar. The Gospel made successively new conquests: churches multiplied: the virtues of the people were rewarded by the favours of the sovereigns of the country; and the Christians of St. Thomas were raised to an equality with the superior castes.\n\nThe privilege of being independent of the Hind\u00fa rulers and judges of the country, except in criminal cases, was insured to them. The right to rule over the church of Malay\u00e1l\u00e1 was vested in the families out of which the apostle Thomas had ordained priests. From those families only were to be chosen such as were to have jurisdiction and to be archdeacons. Their bishops were acknowledged as the natural judges of all civil and ecclesiastical causes, and their authority was extended to all temporal as well as spiritual matters.\n\nThese grants, immunities, and privileges, were engraved on plates of mixed metal, six in number, in different languages now unknown. On one, the nail-headed or Persepolitan character, has been made use of; while the character of the writing on one of the others is supposed to have no affinity with any existing character known in Hind\u00fast\u00e1n.*\n\n* About three hundred years ago, the tablets on which are engraved the rights of nobility, and other privileges, granted by the princes of a former age to the Syrian Christians, were deposited by the Bishop of Angamal\u00e9 in the hands of the Portuguese at Cochin, and were lost, to the extreme regret of the whole nation. After the loss of those tablets, the Christians could produce nothing in support of their claims to nobility, except what was handed down by tradition; and it was even doubted whether such grants had ever existed, till the arrival of Colonel Macaulay (now Lieutenant-General Colin Macaulay) as British resident in Travancore, who directed an immediate search to be made for the lost tablets, and was fortunate enough to discover them, in the year 1806, to the great joy of the Syrian church. The inscription on the largest plate is thirteen inches in length, and about four inches broad. The plates are written on both sides.\n\nThe cuneiform or nail-headed character is on the plate reputed to be the oldest, and the grant on this plate is witnessed by four signatures engraved in an old Hebrew character, resembling the alphabet called Palmyrene. These plates are referred to in the Asiatic Journal, it is stated by Mr. St. Thomas arrived in India in A.D. 52; and themselves\nAfter the death of Mar Thomas the church became unsettled, owing to mutual animosity amongst his descendants. Discord and insubordination took possession of the people. They split into factions\u2014communities ceased to acknowledge the authority of their lawful bishops\u2014priests usurped the authority of their prelates\u2014laymen of their priests; and anarchy and schism reigned throughout the church of Malabar. All communication with their Syrian patriarch was obliterated, the seed of the Gospel was quickly eradicated, and the coast of Malabar was on the brink of losing all traces of the language and religion of Syria, when they were saved by the zeal of the Nestorian missionaries; who, overleaping the limits which had confined the ambition and curiosity both of the Greeks and Persians in the fifth century, diffused the doctrines of their church from China to Jerusalem and Cyprus.\n\nIn the year 825, a merchant named Job conducted into Malabar, from Babylon, two Syrian ecclesiastics, Mar Saul and Mar Ambrose, sent by the Nestorian patriarch to rule over the church of St. Thomas. They landed at Quilon, and were received by the Christians inhabiting that city with joy and affection.\n\nThese prelates governed the church in Travanc\u00f3r for many years, and were highly respected by the Nair princes of the kingdom, as well as by the Br\u00e1hmans and nobles of the country. From the former, they obtained a yearly revenue for the support of their church; they were permitted to build churches wherever they pleased, and to convert to Christianity whoever wished to embrace it. The privileges granted by the Perumal princes, were renewed, and engraven on plates of copper, in the language of Malabar, of Canara, of Visianagar, and in Tamil. The Christians added these two ecclesiastics to the number of their saints, made mention of them in their ritual, and erected several churches to their memory.*\n\nThese prelates were followed by a succession of teachers from Syria, who ruled over the church, and spread the blessings of the Gospel with zeal, integrity, and honour; receiving such only to the communion as could approach with unblemished character, and rejecting all who could not appear with hands undefiled, and with minds thoroughly convinced of the abominations of the worship of Brahm\u00e1. The\n\n* The Archbishop Menezes, who held them to be Nestorians, erased their names from the prayer-book, and changed the titles of the churches. Two of these churches are to this day to be seen at Quilon and Ralay-Conlan.\n\nin the year 69. Doubts are there expressed as to the existence of any such grant as that mentioned above; as a copy, purporting to be made from it, proved, on examination by Mr. Whish, to be word for word the same as that of the Jews.\u2014Ed.\ndecency of manners, the skill in the liberal arts, the theological learning of the Syrian bishops, inspired esteem. Their rank, their immunities, their domestic jurisdiction, protected by the princes of the country, gained them respect. The learning and strict attachment to truth of the Christians recommended them to the first employments in the country: they were enriched by holding lucrative offices in the collection of the revenue, and their merit sometimes raised them to the command of districts. In war their fidelity and high character were declared most worthy of trust; and the strength of a pagan prince was now estimated by the number of Christians he could rank among the warriors of his kingdom.\n\nThis succession of prosperity rendered the Christians bold and ambitious. Become powerful, they shook off the yoke of the Hind\u00fa princes, and elected a king of their own religion. Baliarte was the first raised to the throne; and he took upon himself the title of \"king of the Christians of St. Thomas.\" This state of independence was not of long duration. One of these Christian kings, not having any children, adopted for his son one of the children of the chief of Udamper, according to the custom of the country. At his death, this adopted son succeeded him in full sovereignty over the Christians of St. Thomas. By a similar adoption they passed afterwards under the jurisdiction of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Cochin, who at first respected their rights, but finished by persecuting them through hatred of their religion.\n\nThe vigorous age of the church had passed away; and its subsequent history presents a continued scene of ruin and misfortune. Encompassed on all sides by the enemies of their religion, and bowed under the yoke of the Hind\u00fa princes who had succeeded to their own kings, they still continued for a lapse of ages, under the government of Syrian bishops, to adhere, for the most part, to the religion of their fathers; and on the arrival of the Portuguese in India in A.D. 1500, they fancied they beheld in that nation messengers sent from Heaven to break their chains and to re-establish the Christian kingdom in Malabar.\n\nCHAPTER THE SECOND.\n\nFROM THE FIRST APPEARANCE OF THE PORTUGUESE, A.D. 1502, TO THE SYNOD OF UDIAMPER, A.D. 1599.\n\nThe Portuguese presented themselves as a friendly nation, that had come to offer to the people of India an advantageous and reciprocal commerce; and to make known to them the only religion avowed of\nHeaven, that alone which assured to man the happiness for which he was destined by his Creator. The Christians of Saint Thomas were the first who resigned themselves to these seducing and deceitful appearances. This credulous and primitive people persuaded themselves, that Christians who had braved the perils and dangers of the great sea, and undergone the fatigues and privations of a long and laborious voyage, to extend the empire of their religion, could not be otherwise than just and beneficent men.\n\nAt their first interview, the Christians of Malabar observed the resemblance rather than the difference between their faith and that of the subjects of Rome; and expecting most important benefits from an alliance with their Christian brethren, their representatives were instructed to solicit for them the protection of the Christian strangers, and that they might be received as faithful subjects of the Portuguese king.\n\nThese deputies presented to Vasco de Gama, on his first visit to Cochin, A.D. 1502, a gilt baton of wood, the ends of which were adorned with silver and surmounted with three hand-bells. \"It was,\" they said, \"the sceptre of their kings who had reigned over them, the last of whom had died at an epoch not much antecedent to the arrival of the Portuguese.\" They informed De Gama that they had received the Gospel from Saint Thomas; that they lived in spiritual submission to the patriarch of Antioch; and that their bishops derived their authority from him.\n\n\"The difference of their character and colour attested the mixture of a foreign race. In arms and arts they were found to excel the natives of the country. Their soldiers preceded the Nairs or nobles, and their hereditary privileges were yet respected by the gratitude or fear of the princes of the country. They acknowledged a Hind\u00fa sovereign, but they were governed even in temporal affairs by the Bishop of Angamal\u00e9. He still asserted his ancient title of Metropolitan of India, but his real jurisdiction was exercised in 1500 churches, and he was intrusted with the care of two hundred thousand souls.\"\n\nThe Portuguese admiral declared himself their zealous protector; assured them that his master Don Emanuel only made war for the advancement of the Christian religion and the destruction of infidelity; and promised to defend them against the oppression of their enemies. These flattering, but perfidious statements, excited amongst the Christians of Saint Thomas the liveliest joy; but anguish and tears soon succeeded to their first transports.\n\nLa Croze describes the state of the Syrians a few years after the first arrival of the Portuguese, in the following language: \"The authority\nof the Syrian bishops extends to all temporal and spiritual matters. They are the natural judges of all the civil and ecclesiastical causes within their diocese. In virtue of their privileges, which are never contested, the pagan princes and judges have no concern with them, excepting in criminal causes. The Syrians, besides the fixed tribute which they pay to their princes, are required only to furnish a certain number of troops during their wars, which are neither frequent nor of long duration. The diocese of the Syrian bishop contains, at present, more than 1500 churches, and as many towns and villages. This great number must continue to augment; as the priests are not engaged to celibacy, and as there are no monks or nuns amongst them.\n\n\"The men always walk armed; some with fusees, of which they know perfectly well the use; others with spears; but the greatest number carry only a naked sword in the right hand, and a shield in the left. They are carefully instructed in the use of arms, from their eighth to their twenty-fifth year, and are excellent hunters and warriors. The more Christians a pagan prince has in his kingdom, the more he is feared and esteemed. It is on this account, as well as on that of their fidelity and strict attachment to truth in every thing, that the princes cherish and countenance them so much. In virtue of privileges granted by Sharen Permaul, former emperor of Malabar, the Syrian Christians take precedence of the Nairs, who are the nobility of the country; and they are second in rank only to the brahmins, for whom the kings themselves manifest an extraordinary veneration. The Christians, pursuant to the laws of the country, are the protectors of the silversmiths, brassfounders, carpenters, and smiths. The pagans, who cultivate the palm-trees, form a militia under the Christians.\n\n\"If a pagan of any of these tribes should receive an insult, he has immediately recourse to the Christians, who procure a suitable satisfaction. The Christians depend directly on the prince or his minister, and not on the provincial governors. If any thing is demanded from them contrary to their privileges, the whole unite immediately for general defence. If a pagan strikes one of the Christians, he is put to death on the spot, or forced himself to bear to the church of the place an offering of a gold or silver hand, according to the quality of the person affronted.\n\n\"In order to preserve their nobility, the Christians never touch a person of inferior caste, not even a Nair. In the roads or streets, they cry out from a distance, in order to receive a nod from passengers; and if any one, even a Nair, salutes them with a mark of respect, they are entitled to be treated as nobles, who are the nobility and...\"\nanimosity and discord amongst these unhappy Christians, who early felt the effects of their imperious counsels. In the year 1545, a warm dispute arose amongst the people about the creation of a new Metropolitan\u2014Mar Thomas being proposed by one party, and Mar Abraham earnestly desired by the other. The latter, to support his pretensions the more effectually, repaired to Rome, and was consecrated Archbishop of Angamal\u00e9 by Pope Pius V., whose jurisdiction he had acknowledged, and to whose commands he had promised unlimited submission and obedience. Mar Abraham, upon his return to his own country, received briefs from the Pope, addressed to the Viceroy and to the prelates in India, ordering them to acknowledge and to receive him in quality of Metropolitan of the Christians in Malabar.\n\nFrom this time, A.D. 1567, these unhappy people were divided into two factions, and were involved in constant difficulties and trouble by the jarring sentiments and perpetual quarrels of their bishops.\n\nMar Abraham arrived at Goa, from Rome, a short time after the departure of Mar Thomas from Cochin, he having been seized by the Portuguese and despatched as a criminal to Portugal; from whence he was sent to Rome, where he soon finished his days, the victim of the superstition of the Portuguese and of the cruelty of Pope Pius V.\n\nMar Abraham no sooner reached Goa, than he was immediately thrown into prison and confined in the convent of the Dominicans; he had, however, the good fortune to make his escape and reach his church in safety, where he was received with the greatest transports of joy and universal rejoicing. Withdrawing himself into the most retired places in his diocese, to avoid the evil intentions of the Portuguese priesthood, he enjoyed in quiet the prerogatives of his station, never approaching the churches bordering on Cochin.\n\nAbout this period, A.D. 1579, there came into Malabar a Syrian named Mar Symeon, ordained by the patriarch at Mousul to succeed Mar Abraham, who established himself at Carturte, one of the principal towns of the Christians in the country, and was acknowledged by them as their legitimate prelate. A fresh schism, in consequence, broke out in the church, and disorders and troubles were caused by this concurrence between the two prelates, which continued till Mar Symeon was persuaded by some Cordeliers to make a voyage to Rome and obtain the briefs of God's Vicegerent on earth, as the only means of insuring the safety of his person, and of maintaining himself in his dignity.\n\nConfiding in his counsellors, believing himself safe, and never doubting their good faith, he went to Goa, and thence to Portugal;\ncordial allies of the Portuguese, but the inquisitors soon discovered in the Christians of Saint Thomas the unpardonable guilt of heresy and schism. Instead of owning themselves the subjects of the Roman pontiff, the spiritual and temporal monarch of the globe, they adhered, like their ancestors, to the communion of the Nestorian patriarch of Babylon;\" a vague appellation, which has been successively applied to the royal seat of Seleucia, of Ctesiphon, and of Bagdad.*\n\nThe Jesuits laboured in vain, by artifice and moderation, in a matter of so great moment and importance, to reduce them to the obedience of the Roman pontiff. They founded colleges and schools in various places, for the instruction of the youth of the nation in the rites of the Latin church, and in the Syrian tongue.\u2020 These establishments were of some utility, but did not produce all the benefits that were at first hoped from them. The Syrian Christians, instructed by the Jesuits, and ordained as priests, durst not preach against their ancient prelates; and, from the fear of being considered as apostates by their parents, continued to maintain their ancient opinions, and to make mention of the patriarchs of Babylon in their liturgy.\n\nThe Portuguese bishops, and the monks, as well as the Viceroy of Goa, having, at last, discovered the inutility of all the preceding labours, had recourse to the inquisition of Goa and the penal laws, whose terrors (which they employed so freely in the propagation of their faith) contributed much more than their arguments and exhortations to engage the Christians of Saint Thomas to depart from the religious doctrines, discipline, and worship of their ancestors, and to embrace the popish communion.\n\nThe ambitious views of the Jesuits sowed the pestilential seeds of\n\n* \"In the fifth century there were created five superior rulers of the church, who were distinguished from the rest by the title of Patriarch, viz. those of Rome, Constantinople, Antioch, Alexandria, and Palestine.

But this addition is unworthy of credit. At the head of the Asiatic Christians is the Patriarch of Antioch, who resided in the monastery of Saint Ananias, situated near the city of Mardin. But, owing to the great extent of the government of this prelate, he has a colleague who is called Maphrian, or Primate of the East. This primate resides in the monastery of Saint Matthew, in the neighbourhood of Mousul.

The title of stranger in country and in colour, as well as in religion, could not save him from the horrors of that formidable tribunal, which condemned every Christian to be burnt from the moment he did not consent to admit even the most trifling tenets of the communion of Rome. Toleration has never been the characteristic of the Latin church, and indulgence to heretics has seldom been the virtue of its pontiffs.\n\nThe misfortunes of this priest assured to his competitor, Mar Abraham, the possession of his bishopric, though not undisturbed, till his death, which happened in the year 1597.\n\nThe Portuguese, having failed in every endeavour to secure the person of this metropolitan by craft and intrigue, had recourse to the Pope, Clement VIII., who issued a brief to Don Alexes de Menezes, archbishop of Goa, ordering him to make the strictest inquiry into the life, manners, and doctrine of Mar Abraham; and, in case he was found culpable, to have him seized and conducted to Goa.\n\nAfter a short correspondence, in which the rival prelates disguised their hatred in the hollow language of respect and charity, the Archbishop of Goa denounced to the people the damnable errors of the Metropolitan of Angamal\u00e9. Mar Abraham persisted, like his predecessors, in disclaiming the jurisdiction, and disobeying the summons of his enemies. They hastened his trial, and at the head of an Italian Synod, Menezes, as his accuser, presided in the seat of judgment, weighed the merits of the cause, and degraded the heretic from his episcopal and ecclesiastical dignity, for his contumacious refusal to attend the summons of the Synod; and instantly resolved to bestow on the flock of Saint Thomas the blessing of a faithful Jesuit Shepherd. But as Mar Abraham lived very retired in his church at Angamal\u00e9, where the Portuguese had not access, and being, besides, so extremely infirm, from great age, as to be unable to leave his house, the archbishop could not obtain possession of his person.\n\nHowever, as he had been informed that the aged priest and the Christians of his church had addressed the Patriarch of Mousul to ask of him a successor, it was his first care to interrupt all correspondence with the Nestorian metropolitan; and to forbid the Portuguese, at Ormus, under pain of the censures of the church, to permit to pass into India any priest or bishops of Chaldea, of Persia, or of Armenia.\nAt the same time, he directed a search to be made in every part of the coast of Malabar and of Coromandel, of all the Armenians and Syrians who might resort there under the pretext of trade. Experience having taught the Portuguese that Syrian missions had succeeded in entering Malabar in the disguise of mendicants or merchants.\n\nMar Abraham dying, left the government of his church to Mar George, his archdeacon, an ecclesiastic much beloved and respected by all, who was supported in his new dignity by his numerous relations, and who had been regularly ordained, and held not his authority either from the Pope or Patriarch of Mousul, Don Alexes de Menezes, but with the aid of the secular arm\u2014the power of the Portuguese\u2014now sufficient for his purpose\u2014to invade their tranquil churches by force and violence, oblige this unhappy and reluctant people to embrace the religion of Rome, and to acknowledge the Pope's jurisdiction; against both of which acts they had always manifested the utmost abhorrence.\n\nHowever, to deprive George of the authority which had hitherto been so amply devolved on him, in order to give it to a stranger, was to alienate the minds of the Christians, and rendered unnecessary trials that were then meditated to reduce them to the obedience of the Pope, and to withdraw them from the jurisdiction of the Patriarch.\n\nGeorge was, therefore, summoned to appear at Cochin; but he was ever averse to comply with the mandate of an Italian priest, and after consideration of what had passed, and of the dangers that threatened himself and church, he resolved to obey. To ensure the safety of this person, he assembled the chief soldiers of his nation, by whom he was accompanied to Cochin, with 3000 of their followers completely armed.\n\nAt this meeting between the two primates of the East, he found the presence of the Portuguese governor of Cochin, surrounded by armed soldiers, a synod of the Catholic, or rather the church of the Christians of Saint Thomas, was demanded, as a remedy that could appease or decide their ecclesiastical quarrels.\n\nCHAPTER THE THIRD.\n\nFROM THE SYNOD OF UDIAMPER, A.D. 1599, TO THE EXPULSION OF THE CHRISTIANS, A.D. 1665.\n\nDiamper, or Udiamper, a town near Cochin, was chosen as the place, and the 20th day of June, 1599, for the day of meeting, letters of summons were immediately despatched to each Catanar, or\nand deacon in the diocese. This occasioned some delay, of which Menezes became impatient, and which he stigmatised as voluntary and culpable.\n\nGeorge did not, however, yield without a long and severe struggle, and not till he observed that he was deserted by the King of Cochin, who had been gained over by the Portuguese, with a bribe of 30,000 ducats in gold, to assist Menezes with 50,000 musketeers in his arrogant and violent proceedings.\n\nMenezes announced the opening of the synod at which he presided, attended by the orders of his church, by the Governor of Cochin, the civil and military authorities of the garrison, and a strong band of Portuguese soldiers; and he consummated the pious work of the re-union by vigorously enacting the doctrine and discipline of the Roman church.\n\nThe Syrian Christians were accused of marrying wives, of acknowledging only two sacraments, baptism and the Lord's Supper,\u2014of neither invoking saints, nor worshipping images, nor believing in purgatory, and having only two orders in their church, priest and deacon. The memories of Theodore and Nestorius were condemned; a new baptism and a new ordination were inflicted; and they were not only required to renounce the particular opinions that separated them from the Latin church, and to acknowledge the Roman pontiff as Christ's sole vicegerent upon earth, but that several customs, rites, and institutions, which had been handed down to them from their ancestors, and which were perfectly innocent in their nature and tendency, should be abolished. In a word, Don Alexes de Menezes would be satisfied with nothing less than a minute and entire conformity of the religious rites and opinions of the Christians of Saint Thomas with the doctrine and worship of the church of Rome. The acts of this synod, which brought the church of Malabar under the dominion of the pope, of the primate, and of the Jesuits, were signed by George, 150 Cutanars, and 660 other ecclesiastics and deputies, amidst the curses and anathemas, the shouts and execrations, of the surrounding multitude, which trembled with horror at abandoning the religion of their ancestors for a new baptism, and for what they considered idolatry.\n\nThe wary prelate was saluted by his followers as the champion of the church, and her (or rather his) victory was celebrated at Goa, Cochin, and the other Portuguese settlements in the East, by Te Deums, hymns, songs, and processions.\n\nAfter ed, Menezes went on a visitation through the diocese, Christians, sowing dissension where he\ncould not persuade, fulminating the thunders of excom-\n\nwhere his more subtle Machiavelism failed to convince,\n\nthe finishing stroke to his violence and brutality by ord-\n\nbook and record in the possession of the Christians to be\n\nup and burnt; and whilst they were burning he headed a\n\nwhich marched round the flames, chanting hymns in hon-\n\nvictory gained by the blessed Virgin over heretics\u2014an act of\n\nof a bigoted priest, whose zeal is greater for the interests of\n\nthan the improvement of its members.*\n\nAt Angamal\u00e9, the ancient see of the metropolitan, the\n\nthe church were committed to the flames by this unrelenti-\n\nof the popish faith; a loss that is ever to be deplored, as\n\npresumed that authentic accounts of this venerable church\n\nthat place. MENEZES, by destroying them, wished to cut off\n\nevery proof of the dependence which this church believed\n\nto the Syrian church of Babylon, from whence it had in\n\nreceived the truth of the Gospel.\n\nIn all these violent and persecuting proceedings of MENEZES\n\nwas guided and governed by the Jesuits.

The prelate, in consequence, excommunicated him. This\n\nwas the thunder of the excommunication, which was much feared among\n\nChristians, or whether, for the sake of an example, recourse was had\n\nmeans, but which Christian charity will not permit the supposition of\n\nappear; but this poor Catandar, this presumed culprit, fell sick, and died\n\nafter contrite and receiving absolution.

In the year 1563, when Don Francisco Garcia, a prelate of great age, was Archbishop of Crangan\u00f3r, and during the war with Portugal and Spain, when the court of Rome had refused to acknowledge the independency of Portugal, or even to accept its nomination of the bishops of India, the Christians to the north of Cochin and in the interior of Travanc\u00f3r, who had only yielded to Rome an outward shew of submission, and were worn out with the spirit of persecution and domination, the avarice and tyranny of the government of the Jesuits, resolved to shake off the yoke they could no longer bear.\n\nAfter many fruitless complaints, they assembled in the ancient church of Alangh\u00e1t; renounced, with an oath sworn on the Bible, all obedience to the Jesuit prelate; and, electing one of their archdeacons, named Thomas of P\u00e1lakommatta, a near relation to their preceding archdeacon George, as their chief, they invested him with the episcopal authority, and had him consecrated by twelve priests, agreeably to the ancient usage of their church.\n\n\"The Jesuits were incapable of defending the power which they had abused, the arms of 40,000 Christians were pointed against their falling tyrants, and the Indian archdeacon assumed the character of metropolitan, under the name of Mar Thomas, till a fresh supply of Syrian missionaries could be obtained from the Patriarch of Antioch or Babylon.\" But, unable to communicate with their patriarch, the watchful jealousy of the Jesuits rendering every attempt unavailing, they addressed letters to the Coptic patriarch then residing at Grand Cairo, who despatched to them a Syrian bishop named Attila, holding the government of the Christians at Damascus, to take charge of their church. Attila, or as he is called in the Malabar manuscripts, Mar Ignatius, repaired first to Mousul, and there received from the Nestorian patriarch his letters of appointment. Travelling as a mendicant from that city, he reached Surat; and thence, having assumed the habit of a pilgrim, he went to Mail\u00e1pur, in the hope of being able, from the coast of Coromandel, to make his way to his diocese; all communication between the ports in Malabar and the Syrian Christians of the interior being strictly prohibited, by the orders of the archbishop of Goa to the Portuguese commandant at that coast.\n\nMar Ignatius landed at Mail\u00e1pur, and v offering up his devotions at the shrine of the\na dungeon, not, however, till some time subsequent to his communication with his diocese, and an interview with two who had travelled as pilgrims from Travancore to Mail\u00e1pur purpose. To them Mar Ignatius delivered a letter addressed congregation of Syrians in Malabar, approving of their elect Thomas of P\u00e1lakommatta to rule over their church; but most solemn injunction, that he was neither to consecrate nor to confer orders; and directing that four of the principal ecclesiastics should be associated in the office to assist him in the management of the affairs of the church and the people. On the return of the Catan\u00e1rs with this epistle, an assembly of the people was assembled in the church of Alangh\u00e1t. The letter was opened and read over the head of the Archdeacon Thomas of P\u00e1lakommatta, who bound down, along with his four assistant ecclesiastical brethren, to observe the commands of Mar Ignatius.\n\nMar Ignatius, from his dungeon at Mail\u00e1pur, was emancipated by the fetters for Cochin, where his arrival was no sooner known than Christians advanced to the number of 25,000 men, well armed by their archdeacon, carrying the banners of their church, and the city, with the intention of delivering their prelate by force. The Portuguese shut their gates, manned their walls, and took all possible precaution in defence of their city, being resolved to deliver up the metropolitan. But, alarmed for the safety of his establishment, knowing well the unshaken character of the inhabitants, and judging from their numbers, and their bold advance within the range of the guns of the citadel, that they would attack on the town, they conveyed the unfortunate prelate in the night on board of a galliot, which immediately got under sail and sailed out of the harbour. The fate of Mar Ignatius was unknown; whether it was a watery grave, the lingering torments of the inquisitors of Goa, or the more cruel death of an auto-da-f\u00e9.\n\nTo endeavour to reduce the archdeacon and his followers to obedience of the Archbishop of Crangan\u00f3r, the pope, Alexander VII., expressly despatched from Rome an Italian commissary, Jose de Sancta Maria, of the order of the barefooted Capuchins, for that purpose, with the title of Apostolic Administrator of the bishopric of Crangan\u00f3r, and to succeed to the government of the church on the death of its aged archbishop, Francisco Garc\u00eda.\n\nThe papal court, however, rendered wise by experience, perceived at length that the violent proceedings hitherto adopted were not adapted to extend the limits of the empire of the Roman pontiff in the East, and determined therefore to proceed in a matter\nimportance with more moderation and artifice. The apostolic administrator was commanded to confine his views simply to the subjection of these Christians to the jurisdiction of the see of Rome, and to their renouncing, or at least professing to renounce, the opinions that had been condemned in the general councils of the church. In all other matters the Roman envoy was commanded to observe a perfect toleration, and to allow the people unmolested liberty in following the sentiments and observing the institutions they had derived from their ancestors.\n\nThe mission of the Carmelite was not quite fruitless. To reduce the Archdeacon Thomas and his followers to the jurisdiction of the Roman pontiff seemed to be hopeless, after the most persevering exertions, continued for two years, within which period the thunders of the church were fulminated, and the secular arm of the Portuguese brought in aid of the anathemas of the holy office, but in vain. A latent spark, however, did exist, and the intrigues of the Carmelite at length kindled it into a flame; dissension and discord were sown; and, finally, a separation of the members of the ancient church crowned the unwearyed labour of the apostolic administrator. Two of the priests who were associated with the Archdeacon Thomas to rule over the church, impelled either by religious motives, by persuasion, or, what is more probable, by the more unworthy incentives of ambition and jealousy, measured back their steps, and returned to the church of Rome.\n\nAlexander of P\u00e1lakommatta, one of these two priests, who was of the same family as the Archdeacon Thomas, previous to the departure of D. Jose de Sancta Maria, was nominated by him vicar apostolic to the archbishopric of Crangan\u00f3r, and installed in the church of Corvovolangh\u00e1t, where the Christians of forty-five different churches, the followers of Alexander of P\u00e1lakommatta, assembled, rendered to him their obedience, finally united themselves to the Latin church, and acknowledged the supremacy of the pope. The Italian commissary retired to Cochin to witness the fall of the Portuguese power in the East, and to be the bearer thence to Rome of the tidings of the expulsion of the Jesuits from the coast of Malabar, which was one of the first acts of the trading company of Holland, the European successors to the Portuguese dominion on the coast of Malabar.*\n\n* \"About the same time (the surrender of Cochin to the Dutch arms),\" Baldaus says, \"Joseph de Sancta Maria, of the order of the Discalced Carmelites, sent by pope to bishop among the Christians of Saint Thomas, came on his way to Cochin to salute our general, and was very kindly received. He had two sorts of enemies to contend...\"\nThe Dutch, attentive to their interests, and well-informed of the schism in the church, and of the hatred the princes and people conceived against the Portuguese, at the end of the year attacked and took Quilon; and in the month of January of the subsequent year, Cranganor, the see of the Jesuit archbishops, cause of all the misfortunes in the country, fell to their arms by storm. This was followed by the siege and surrender of Cochin, in A.D. 1663, which put an end to the dominion of the Portuguese and restored to the Christians of St. Thomas the liberty they enjoyed from the first appearance of Christianity till the arrival of the Portuguese amongst them.*\n\nIn May 1665 the Portuguese archbishop took his departure, and the Jesuits had to deplore, through the fatal indiscretion of the king who so far forgot the mildness of the Gospel and the policy of order as to introduce, with hasty violence, the liturgy of Rome and the inquisition of Portugal \u2014 the loss of an establishment which gave them a revenue greater than that of their own king; and which was looked upon as one of the most useful, as well as one of the greatest sources of wealth that they ever possessed.\u2020\n\n* \"On the capture of Cranganore by the Dutch,\" Baldaeus says, \"there was a noble college of the Jesuits, with a stately library belonging to it. In the church of the Franciscans, they had a stately cathedral, adorned with the tombs of the archbishops of this place. Without the walls of Cranganore was the town of Chanotte, famous for the resort of the Christians of Saint Thomas who exercise their religious worship here in the Syriac tongue; and, having a school for the education of youth, had several masters and priests of their own.\"\n\nOf this city, or of these buildings, not a stone now remains to mark their site.\n\n\u2020 Of all the Jesuits who distinguished themselves by their zealous labors, Francis Xavier acquired so great a reputation as Francis Xavier, commonly called the Apostle of India. He came into India A.D. 1542, died in China A.D. 1552. The body of this sainted missionary lies in Goa, in a superb mausoleum (his coffin is enchased with silver and precious stones) where it is worshipped with the highest marks of devotion. In Travancore, there is a magnificent church dedicated to Xavier, in which the Catholic Christians pay to that saint the most devout tribute of veneration and worship.\n\n(To be continued.)\nART. XVII.\u2014On Female Infanticide in Cutch, by Lieutenant Alex. Burnes, F.R.S.\u2014Communicated by the Bombay Branch Royal Asiatic Society.\n\nRead 20th of July, 1833.\n\nAs the following remarks by a member of the Council of the Royal Asiatic Society may be considered an appropriate introduction to this subject, they are here prefixed.\n\nI have perused with attention the report on Hind\u00fa Infanticide in Cutch, by Mr. Burnes, affording evidence of the assiduity which marks all his researches.\n\nIts publication in our Journal I should judge every way desirable; for it calls the notice of the public to the circumstance that the total suppression of this practice has not been effected; and we cannot aspire to higher merit than in laudably exerting ourselves to the promotion of such public measures as may tend to the well-doing of our fellow-creatures.\n\nThat there is every disposition on the part of the Honourable East India Company to labour in the field of philanthropy must be acknowledged by all who have considered the principles and practice of its government; and we must ascribe the failure of the full accomplishment of Colonel Walker's benevolent views, rather to the difficulties which have frustrated and continue to frustrate them, than to any relaxation of endeavour on the part of the government of the East India Company.\n\nMr. Burnes remarks, that the female offspring of the Rajap\u00fbts cannot marry, unless by connecting themselves with their inferiors in caste\u2014an alternative which I conclude is rarely resorted to: he further observes, that celibacy and chastity are seldom concomitants in the East.\n\nThe parent, then, has nothing to anticipate in the growth of his child but degradation; he must either countenance her abandoned practices, or he must lower his dignity in forming for his daughter an unsuitable alliance: and we cannot be surprised that the pride and prejudice of the Rajap\u00fbt prevails, and that life is sacrificed to the preservation of a mistaken notion of honour.\n\nIt is clear that this system cannot be abolished by preventive measures of police. A system of domiciliary espionage might be prepared to watch over individual cases of birth, and to warn the parents against the destruction of the gift of God; but such an expedient\n| District     | Town and Village | Men  | Women | Boys | Girls |\n|-------------|------------------|------|-------|------|-------|\n|             |                  |      |       |      |       |\n|             | Brougham Howard  | 456  | 374   | 342  | 42    |\n| Garsthorne  | Graham           |      |       |      |       |\n|             | Redhill          |      |       |      |       |\n|             | Keston           |      |       |      |       |\n| Arkesden    | Froyle           |      |       |      |       |\n| Prigua      | Kelly            | 32   | 35    | 15   | 2     |\n|             | Wang             |      |       |      |       |\n|             | D...             |      |       |      |       |\n| Matlock     | Greenhill        | 17   | 6     | 3    |       |\n| Prigua      | Canal            |      |       |      |       |\n| Reng        | Ch..Leandro      |      |       |      |       |\n|             | Saint James      |      |       |      |       |\n|             | Anna             | 22   | 10    | 4    | 2     |\n|             | Karen            | 7    | 3     | 3    | 1     |\n|             | Denham           | 21   | 8     | 6    | 4     |\n| Arkesden    | Ch.Dawson        | 47   | 30    | 20   | 3     |\n|             | Wingo            |      |       |      |       |\n|             | Motley           |      |       |      |       |\n| Charlotte   | Bishop           |      |       |      |       |\n|             | Naunton          | 24   | 11    | 9    |       |\n|             | Seaton           | 26   | 7     | 4    |       |\n|             | Tl...            | 23   | 12    | 7    | 1     |\n|             | Laver            |      |       |      |       |\n|             | Willa            |      |       |      |       |\n|             | E...             | 21   | 2     | 1    |       |\n|             | Keane            |      |       |      |       |\n|             | Ch.Ford          |      |       |      |       |\n|             | Farnham          |      |       |      |       |\n|             | Chal...Chad...   |      |       |      |       |\n|             | Cham...          |      |       |      |       |\n|             | Chad...          |      |       |      |       |\n|             | Chad...          |      |       |      |       |\n|             | Mim.             |      |       |      |       |\n|             | Ethel            |      |       |      |       |\n|             | Is.              |      |       |      |       |\n|             | Eske             |      |       |      |       |\n|             | Les...           |      |       |      |       |\n|             | Glase...         | 58   | 21    | 12   | 6     |\n|             | Chester          |      |       |      |       |\n|             | Sofia            |      |       |      |       |\n|             | Ch...           |      |       |      |       |\n| District | Towns and Villages | Men | Women | Boys | Girls |\n|----------|-------------------|-----|-------|------|-------|\n|          | Brought forward   | 967 | 732   | 479  | 85    |\n| K\u00e1nti    | Sam\u00e1 Gh\u00f3g\u00e1r       | 94  | 50    | 90   | 2     |\n|          | Bh\u00e1r\u00e1y\u00e1           | 25  | 15    | 7    | -     |\n|          | Bidr\u00e1             | 25  | 20    | 15   | 1     |\n| Chitr\u00e1nn\u00ed| Gajg\u00far            | 5   | 4     | 4    | 2     |\n| W\u00e1g\u00e1r    | Kantc\u00f3t           | 53  | 47    | 21   | 2     |\n|          | Wann\u00fa\u00fa            | 6   | 5     | 3    | -     |\n| Pr\u00e1gtar  | Lodr\u00e1n\u00ed           | 2   | 1     | -    | -     |\n|          | Tram\u00f3             | 3   | 4     | 1    | -     |\n|          | R\u00e1lp\u00far            | 8   | 4     | 6    | 2     |\n|          | G\u00e1n\u00edtar           | 3   | 3     | 3    | -     |\n|          | B\u00e1dargad          | 6   | -     | 1    | -     |\n| My\u00e1n\u00ed    | Rahdinp\u00far         | 3   | 3     | 2    | 1     |\n|          | Naw\u00e1g\u00e1m           | 4   | 3     | 2    | -     |\n|          | D\u00fa\u00fal              | 10  | 4     | 2    | 1     |\n|          | Dh\u00e1markh\u00e1         | 31  | 22    | 11   | 6     |\n|          | P\u00e1kirs\u00edr          | 10  | 10    | 9    | 1     |\n|          | Kh\u00famb\u00e1\u00e9rf\u00ed        | 9   | 9     | 7    | -     |\n|          | Bandri            | 2   | 2     | -    | -     |\n|          | Choabari          | 4   | 6     | 2    | 1     |\n|          | Bhar\u00far\u00ed\u00e1          | 23  | 16    | 17   | 1     |\n|          | S\u00fac\u00e9              | 17  | 11    | 12   | 4     |\n|          | Jess\u00e1             | 18  | 18    | 15   | 8     |\n| W\u00e1g\u00e1r    | Bar\u00e1 R\u00f3r           | 16  | 16    | 10   | 2     |\n|          | Ch.

Burnes.\n\nBombay, Mar. 15, 1829.\n\nART. XVIII.\u2014On the Present State of the River Indus, and the Route of Alexander the Great, by Lieutenant William Pottinger, of H.M. 6th Regiment of Infantry.\u2014(Communicated by the Bombay Branch Royal Asiatic Society).\n\nRead 4th of January, 1834.\n\nMuch discussion having arisen as to whether the Eastern or Western branch of the Indus was formerly the grand stream of the river, and likewise as to the route pursued by Alexander the Great through Sindh, a few remarks from me may perhaps be excused, although the subject is one from which little profit can be derived, and on which it behoves every one to speak with caution and diffidence. Having, however, travelled over a considerable portion of the country, and by personal observation and inquiry made myself acquainted with many circumstances bearing on this topic, I am induced to offer the following facts and surmises for the consideration of those who are in any way interested in the question affecting the route of the Macedonian conqueror; but before entering on this discussion, it will be as well to describe the general features of the Indus as they now exist, in its course through Sindh.\n\nThe river Indus, after receiving the waters of the Panj\u00e1b, flows in an undivided stream to 10 miles N.E. of the Fort of Bhak\u00edr, where the N\u00e1ll\u00e1 (also called N\u00e1rr\u00e1) flows from it to the south, and, passing about 50 miles to the eastward of Haider\u00e1b\u00e1d, falls into the ocean near Lakpat Bandar.\n\nAt 25 miles south of Bhak\u00edr the Indus sends off a small stream to the westward, called the Arrall, which being augmented by the waters of a mountain-stream called the K\u00e1h\u00edr, or Kh\u00e1r\u00eda, rejoins the Indus again at Sehw\u00e1n.\n\nThe Falili leaves the main river 13 miles north of Haider\u00e1b\u00e1d, and flowing in a course nearly parallel to it, rejoins the parent stream at Tikk\u00fan, forming the island on which the capital is built. At the\nS.E. corner of the Fulihi, the Gini* leaves that river, and, flowing nearly in a S.S.E. course, joins the N\u00e1rr\u00e1 above Ali-band, near the village of Chutta.*\n\nAt 4\u00bd miles south of the city of Haider\u00e1b\u00e1d a large branch, called the P\u00e1ga or Pi\u00e1ga, flows in a southerly course from the main river past L\u00e1h\u00edgarh, M\u00e1ghr\u00e1h\u00e1, &c., to the ocean.\n\nAt 6\u00bd miles south of T'hatta the Indus divides into two great branches, called the S\u00e1t\u00e1 and S\u00e1t\u00e1 and the Buggh\u00e1r, which flow in courses nearly south and west to the sea, which they enter by nine mouths.\n\nThe Ganga branch leaves the S\u00e1t\u00e1 at 20 miles south of T'hatta, and after a very short course joins the Pinj\u00e1ri 10 miles north of the town of M\u00e1ghr\u00e1h\u00e1.\n\nAll these rivers have once been navigable for the largest country-boats, but the great eastern branch called the N\u00e1rr\u00e1, and also the P\u00e1ga, have had banks thrown across them, which have ruined the navigation; and the Fulihi (at its south-western extremity) and the Ganga have both become choked with deposit\u2014the latter within five years, and the former since 1809, as the Sindh mission of that year navigated it with a numerous fleet of large boats.\u00a7\n\nThe embankments by which some of these great streams have been destroyed for navigable purposes are certainly amongst the most singular features of Sindh; but I am by no means inclined to believe that they were constructed out of revenge towards the people of C\u00e1l\u00e1h\u00e1, as has been generally repeated and credited.|| The Sindhians deny this assertion, and state that they were erected for the purpose of raising the water of the river to a level sufficient to fill canals having their beds much elevated above that of the river, and into which the water would not otherwise have reached; as also to retain a certain supply of water between the embankments, when after the \"freshes\"\u2020\n\n---\n\n* These names are applied to the same stream in the map to Lieut. Burnes's Travels in Baluchistan, &c., Lond. 1834.\u2014Ed.\n\n\u2020 One branch of the Gini loses itself in pools and marshes near Badina, and the other joins the N\u00e1rr\u00e1 at the village of Chutta. This last is said (by the natives of Sind) to be a canal made by a prince of that country to facilitate navigation, and prevent inundations when the natural channel became decayed.\n\n\u2021 Embankments.\n\n\u00a7 Lieut. Hossar obtained some particulars of the bed of a river which he called the P\u00e1ga (from P\u00e1ga, \"old\"), which lies a long way east of here, and I presume has given rise to the idea of the Phan\u00e1n river, so called in our maps.\n\n|| Vide Memoir on the Indus, &c., by Lieut. Burnes, Tr. p. 551. Ed.\n\n\u2020 Floods.\nthe main river sinks to its usual level. If such be really the case, I doubt not but that these objects might have been attained in the most efficient and simple manner without injuring the navigation; and this I think could be effected by placing these canals at a proper angle to the main stream, and digging their beds (except at the very point where they join the rivers) deeper; so that the water would lodge in them even when it had sunk in all the branches.\n\nIf commerce should ever revive in Sindh, the loss of two of the great branches (the N\u00e1rr\u00e1 and Piny\u00e1ri) will be severely felt; for in position, and in the fact of their estuaries being less exposed to the gales of wind prevalent in these quarters, they have great advantages over all the others. There seems little doubt, however, that even the removal in part of the \"bands,\" which might be done with a very moderate degree of labour, would soon restore these channels to a navigable state; and this was nearly if not altogether proved by the partial bursting of the Ar\u00f3r band* in 1828, when an immense body of water found its way by the channel of the N\u00e1rr\u00e1 \u2020 to the ocean, near Lakpat Bandar, carrying away the other two bands (Ali-band and Allah-band\u2021) at the southern extremity of the river, rendering it in many places from one to three miles broad, and navigable in a considerable part of its course.\n\nBut, to return to the topic under discussion, antiquaries foreseeing that it would be a difficult matter to account for the three days' land journey to the eastward, by reason of the almost insurmountable difficulties to be encountered in crossing the delta from west to east, and at the same time supposing, from the present state of the river Indus, that Alexander sailed down the western branch only; \u00a7 have, without due consideration, and in ignorance of the features of the country, and the wonderful changes which are constantly taking place, decided that the western branch was the one navigated by the Macedonian conqueror, and, in support of this theory, assert their belief that when Arrian mentions the three days' journey to the eastward he meant the west, as if it were at all probable that an historian who\n\n* This band is stated to have served merely to keep the water of the main trunk of the Indus in its course to the sea.

R.A.S., vol. iii. p. 583.\n\nIn the eighth Anniversary Discourse of Sir William Jones before the Asiatic Society of Calcutta, this point is thus alluded to:\u2014\n\n\"We come now to the river Sindhu and the country named from it: near its mouths we find a district, called by Nearchus, in his Journal, Sangada; which M. D'Anville justly supposes to be the seat of the Sanganian, a barbarous and piratical nation mentioned by modern travellers, and well known at present by our countrymen in the west of India. Mr. Malet, now resident at P\u00e1na on the part of the British government, procured at my request the Sanganian letters, which are a sort of N\u00e1gari, and a specimen of their language, which is apparently derived, like other Indian dialects, from the Sanscrit; nor can I doubt, from the descriptions which I have received of their persons and manners, that they are P\u00e1meras, as the Br\u00e1hmans call them, or outcast Hind\u00fas, immemorially separated from the rest of the nation.\"\u2014Vide As. Res. vol. iii. p. 6.\n\nSee also Captain M'Murdo's Memoir of the river Indus, in the present volume, page 40, note \u00a7.\u2014Ed.\n\n\u2020 From Makr\u00e1n.\n\nVol. I.\nof visiting it have in different publications described the country as sandy, desert, and sterile land; and although many parts of the country are most fertile, there is much truth generally in the description, as far as regards this province, and more particularly the very tract now under discussion, viz. that west of Jakow.*\n\nThere is another strong fact which I conclude must have escaped the notice of these authors, that in travelling eastward from Lajpat Bandar there is not a single running stream to be met with (except in the monsoon) for a distance of eighty miles, and the water in use for all purposes is procured from wells and tanks, or from pools which are left in the beds of torrents; and the practice of digging shallow wells in such places as the beds of sandy nullahs and on the sea-shore is followed to the present hour all along this coast.\n\nThe estuary of the eastern branch of the Indus is, besides, the only one which bears the slightest resemblance to that described by the historian, and is really worthy, from its magnitude and formation, of being the embouchure of three great rivers, which I think I shall prove it to have been.\n\nEven from these considerations alone, then, I am inclined to concur most completely with Dr. Vincent and others who have been ridiculed for their opinions on this subject, that Alexander did sail down the eastern estuary of the Indus, and that his march of three days was to the eastward, and consequently through the S.W. part of that portion of Cutch called the Abrasa.\n\nBut without presuming to enter deeply on this question, I shall mention two facts which came under our personal observation in Sindh, and appear to me to bear so strongly on the subject, that, taken together with what I have above stated, they go far to prove Dr. Vincent's correctness.\n\nAt the village of Shakhkapur, on the road from Kotri to Haiderabad, and about sixty miles distant from the former place, there are the ruins of a large town visible on the plain about a mile N.E. of the village, to which the inhabitants give the name of Hingur, and which they describe as having been a very large and opulent place in the time of the Sammids; the remains, which are of kiln-burnt brick of a superior description, cover a very considerable extent of ground, and the circuit of the walls and positions of the bastions are plainly discernible.\n\nTo the N.E. of those ruins the forsaken channel of a very large river is also distinctly to be traced; and the people stated, without being questioned on the subject, that the river Indus, or a large\n\n* Vide Note (A) to Lieut.

Burnes.\n\n\u2020 By Lieut. Burnes, in ow-smith.\u2014Ed.\nof visiting it have in different publications described the country as a sandy, desert, and sterile land; and although many parts of the country are most fertile, there is much truth generally in the description, as far as regards this province, and more particularly the very tract now under discussion, viz. that west of Jakow.*\n\nThere is another strong fact which I conclude must have escaped the notice of these authors, that in travelling eastward from Lakpat Bandar there is not a single running stream to be met with (except in the monsoon) for a distance of eighty miles, and the water in use for all purposes is procured from wells and tanks, or from pools which are left in the beds of torrents; and the practice of digging shallow wells in such places as the beds of sandy nall\u00e1s and on the sea-shore is followed to the present hour all along this coast.\n\nThe estuary of the eastern branch of the Indus is, besides, the only one which bears the slightest resemblance to that described by the historian, and is really worthy, from its magnitude and formation, of being the embouchure of three great rivers, which I think I shall prove it to have been.\n\nEven from these considerations alone, then, I am inclined to concur most completely with Dr. Vincent and others who have been ridiculed for their opinions on this subject, that Alexander did sail down the eastern estuary of the Indus, and that his march of three days was to the eastward, and consequently through the S.W. part of that portion of Cutch called the Abr\u00e1sa.\n\nBut without presuming to enter deeply on this question, I shall mention two facts which came under our personal observation in Sindh, and appear to me to bear so strongly on the subject, that, taken together with what I have above stated, they go far to prove Dr. Vincent's correctness.\n\nAt the village of Sh\u00e1hkap\u00far, on the road from K\u00f3tr\u00ed to Haider\u00e1b\u00e1d, and about sixty miles distant from the former place, there are the ruins of a large town visible on the plain about a mile N.E. of the village, to which the inhabitants give the name of H\u00edng\u00far, and which they describe as having been a very large and opulent place in the time of the Samm\u00e1s; the remains, which are of kiln-burnt brick of a superior description, cover a very considerable extent of ground, and the circuit of the walls and positions of the bastions are plainly discernible.\n\nTo the N.E. of those ruins the forsaken channel of a very large river is also distinctly to be traced; and the people stated, without being questioned on the subject, that the river Indus, or a large\n\n* Vide Note (A) to Lieut. Burnes's Memoir, in Trans. R.A.S. vol. iii. p. 582.\u2014Ed.\nbranch of it, once flowed in this bed, and was navigable for large boats or vessels. They also affirmed that the city first began to decline on the overthrow of the Samm\u0101s, but that it was not until the river had become dry and receded from this channel by one of those changes so constantly occurring, that the place was completely ruined and ultimately became deserted.\n\nNow this channel runs N.W. and S.E., and would have discharged its waters somewhere to the N.N.E. of Lakpat Bandar (in fact, according to the native accounts it did so), thus forming a most convenient and natural channel of communication between the western branch and eastern estuary, which would have enabled Alexander's fleet to have reached that estuary and Cutch, without its being necessary for him to have navigated the eastern branch in its whole course, which, as I have before observed, is a point that seems to have puzzled all writers on the subject.\n\nA reference to the map* will shew the positions the Piny\u0101r\u012b and G\u016bngr\u016b branches bear with respect to this deserted channel; and I am quite of opinion, both from the position of these branches and from the traditions current in Sindh, that the channel I have above described was formerly that of the Piny\u0101r\u012b river, which then flowed in a S.E. direction to near Lakpat, and that the G\u016bngr\u016b branch which now joins the Piny\u0101r\u012b ten miles north of Maghrabi and about the same distance S.W. of Hing\u016br, found its way consequently alone to the ocean, through what has by a change become their joint estuary, viz. the Sir.\n\nAgain, the river which appears to have flowed to the S.E. of Hing\u016br would have passed into what is now called the Runn N.N.E. of Lakpat, and may be very reasonably supposed to have been one of the streams which there formed the congregation of waters mentioned as being like an \"inland lake,\" and its embouchure would in this case have been distinctly visible from the high lands in Cutch at no great distance. This would account for the discrepancy which has been attempted to be shewn\u2020 from the circumstance of none of the present mouths of the Indus being visible from Cutch, not that I at all admit, what has been supposed, that Alexander must have descried Cutch and have been therefore induced to visit it, for we must suppose the people of Sindh to have been more incredibly ignorant than they are even at present, to conceive that they knew not of the existence of a country only separated from their own by a river!\n\n* Vide the Map to Lieut. Burnes' Travels, published by Mr. J. Arrowsmith.\u2014Ed.\n\n\u2020 By Lieut. Burnes, in his Dissertation.\nThat Alexander did visit a place called Patt\u00e1la there seems no reason to doubt, but that this is the same with the modern T'hatta I think very far from certain.* T'hatta is now precisely seventy-five miles from the sea, which by no means agrees with the calculations made by the ancients; and therefore Jarrak, or some other place even more to the northward, where the ruins of towns are still visible, may be fixed upon with equal propriety as the site of Patt\u00e1la. The Piny\u00e1ri branch in that case would have been the first met with in proceeding towards the sea, and would (if it existed, as I have attempted to shew) have offered a convenient passage to the eastern estuary.\n\nFor my own part, I consider that there is much uncertainty in the passage which mentions his sailing down the left branch, as to whether he did actually reach the sea or not; and if we suppose the former, it will be seen that had Alexander followed the course of the Piny\u00e1ri to its estuary called the Sir, he would then have had only twelve miles of coasting to the entrance of the Lakpat creek, and the high lands at K\u00f3t\u00e1sir in Cutch would then have been clearly visible, bearing N.E., and only ten or twelve miles distant.\n\nThe only argument in favour of the Macedonians having followed the eastern branch called the N\u00e1rr\u00e1 in its entire course from Bhak\u00edr to the sea seems to be, that the historian does not mention the branch down which they (the Macedonians) sailed sending off any branches to the eastward; which is perfectly consistent with the state of that river at the present day; but this may readily have been an oversight, and it is much more reasonable to conceive that he did visit Sehw\u00e1n\u2020 and other places in his progress south which he could not have done had he pursued the course of the N\u00e1ll\u00e1, and afterwards found a passage to the eastern estuary by some of the channels now ruined.\n\nThe branch of the G\u00f3ni river which now joins it to the N\u00e1rr\u00e1 above Ali-band is said by the inhabitants of Sindh to be a cut or canal made by order of one of the princes of Sindh when the channel of the G\u00f3ni began to decay; and although I never heard this assertion made previous to my leaving India, I do not consider it at all improbable. The other channel of the G\u00f3ni runs nearly south; and although now lost in swamps and pools near the village of Badina would have discharged its waters into the Runn of Cutch at no great distance from the N\u00e1rr\u00e1.\n\nIf, then, the N\u00e1rr\u00e1, G\u00f3ni, and the branch which I have described\n\n* Vide Captain M'Murdo's remarks, as to the site of Patt\u00e1la, p. 37 of the present volume.\u2014Ed.\n\u2020 Vide Capt. M'Murdo's paper, pp. 30 and 34 of the present volume.\nas once flowing past Sh\u00e1hkapur, all fell into the Runn of Cutch near the same place, which from the direction of their courses they would have done, they would certainly have formed a great \"inland lake\" such as described; nor is there in any of the other branches (at any point) any expanse of water which could have given rise to the idea.\n\nMost authors seem agreed that Alexander could not have sailed down the western branch of the Indus and then crossed the delta of the river from west to east even with a fleet in company, and in this opinion I entirely concur, and believe that no one who has not seen the delta, the state of the river's banks, and the violence of the current, can have an idea of what such an undertaking would be, more particularly with cavalry.\n\nThe W\u00e1ny\u00e1n\u00ed has been supposed to answer the description of the \"inland lake,\"* but, in addition to its (present) magnitude by no means answering this description, if Alexander had proceeded there he would have had the delta on both flanks.\n\nAnother remarkable fact which came under our personal observation in Sindh proves even more strongly than the one I have related the wonderful changes which have taken place all over the country and in the branches of the river.\n\nOn the second day of our march from R\u00e1j ka dereh to Khairpur, and about twenty miles S. or S. by E. of that city, we crossed the deserted channel of a very large river, and after riding along the western bank for some time, the Sindhian chiefs, who had come to meet and welcome the mission, pointed out to us the ruins of a large city which they called Mihr\u00e1bpur. We were not sufficiently near to examine the remains, but they appeared extensive, and the account given of the place by the chiefs was exactly similar to that given of Hing\u00far, with the exception that the former was a modern town and deserted only fifty years ago, at which time the river receded from this channel.\u2020 The inhabitants also affirmed that this river did not join the western branch of the Indus again proceeding south, but flowed in a course nearly due south to the sea.\n\nConsidering all I have stated, it appears to me that there is scarcely one point from which an inference can be drawn that the western branch (below T\u00e1tt\u00fa) was the one down which Alexander passed\n\n* Vide Note (A) to Lieut.

It is quite possible that the same river might have deserted these places as it did Mihr\u00e1bpur.\nand that his three days' march was to the westward; whilst, on the other hand, the proofs seem almost conclusive as to Dr. Vincent's being really correct in his suppositions.\n\nThere is one point which I have purposely omitted, as it rests upon a mere matter of opinion, namely, \"whether it is natural that Alexander should have explored the country to the eastward for three days or not.\" In my own opinion it was most natural that he should have done so; for, when his army mutinied on the Hyphasis, \"he with extreme reluctance gave up all idea of further progress to the east, and began his route southward by the river,\" most probably hoping that the direction which its course might take, would enable him to visit some portion of the unknown territory which the disorders in his army alone had prevented his doing; but finding this not to be the case, and that he had arrived at that point (the mouths of the Indus) from whence his further progress must be towards home, that he should be anxious to catch even a glimpse of a country on which he was about to turn his back for ever; and as it proved not suitable to his convenience, his views, or his expectations, that he should relinquish any project he might have meditated, had he found a rich, populous, and fertile region, the spoils of which he might have held forth as a temptation to his mutinous soldiery.\n\nIn conclusion, I beg to remark, that the object of this dissertation is not so much to prove the view I have taken of the subject to be correct, as to shew that many who have taken an opposite view of the case, and dealt in strong assertions without proofs, have been quite as likely to have erred in their final decision; and even putting the facts which I have adduced as to the features of the country out of the question, I consider my object as fully attained by shewing the amazing changes which have taken place. Of course, in speaking of the Piny\u00e1ri and G\u00fangr\u00fa branches, I have assumed (as others have done of various other branches) that they existed two thousand years ago, which, it must be admitted, is more than doubtful, for I quite agree in an opinion I have heard given, \"that there always has been and will be a noble river in Sindh, but where its course was five hundred years ago, or will be one hundred years hence, is totally beyond the power of any person to say.\"\n\n(Signed) W. Pottinger.\n\n* Since writing the above it has been suggested to me by a friend, that one of the branches of the Indus may formerly have taken an easterly and then southerly course, and flowed to the eastward of Cutch; and really considering the lame attempts which have been made to account for the formation of the Runn of Cutch, I think the supposition a very plausible one. A vast quantity of water is known to\nRemarks on the preceding paper. By Lieut. Alexander Burnes, F.R.S., of the Bombay Military Establishment, &c. &c.\n\nAt the request of the Royal Asiatic Society, I now reduce to writing the observations which I made before the Society on the 4th of January last, regarding the route of Alexander the Great through the delta of the Indus, and which were suggested by a paper on that subject drawn up by Lieut. W. Pottinger. It is very far from my wish to engage in any controversy upon such a subject, but as the various papers which I have from time to time written regarding it have not hitherto been published,* it is incumbent on me briefly to state their contents, which will afford the best answer that I can offer to Lieut. Pottinger's observations. It will be sufficient for me to premise that I have visited the greater portion of the delta of the Indus, and the neighbouring country, as well as ascended and surveyed that great river for some hundred miles above its embouchures.\n\nWhen the Greeks reached Pattala \"Alexander ordered a haven and convenient docks for ships to be built, and resolved to sail down to the ocean by that branch of the river on the right hand,\" for Arrian distinctly tells us,+ that \"the river Indus at Pattala divides itself into two vast branches, and that the realm of the Pattalan's has the form of the Greek letter \u0394.\" The same historian next records that the Greeks descended this right or western branch of the Indus, and after viewing the ocean returned to Pattala. Here Alexander found his fleet in readiness, and now resolved on \"sailing again to the ocean by the other (or eastern) branch of the river, to try whether the passage out to sea was safer or more easy that way, for Alexander had now resolved to send his fleet under the command of Nearchus into the Persian gulf, and thence up the mouths of the Euphrates and Tigris.\" In this his second voyage from Pattala to the sea, it is stated \"that he landed with a party of horse, and travelled three days along the sea-coast to view it, and try if he could find any bays or creeks to secure his fleet from storms; and also dug many wells to supply his navy with water.\" Such is the account of Alexander's expedition in the delta of the Indus, according to Arrian, to whose very words I have adhered.\n\n* They are now before the public. See Trans. R. A. S. vol. iii. p. 559, and Lieut. Burnes' Travels, &c.\n+ Lib. vi. c. 18.\nTwo subjects of controversy have arisen out of this description\u20141st, \"With what city are we to identify P\u00e1tt\u00e1la?\" and, 2dly, \"In what direction was the three days' journey of Alexander the Great after he descended the eastern branch of the Indus?\" We shall treat on each of these subjects.\n\n1st, There are very strong reasons for fixing on the modern city of T'hatta as the P\u00e1tt\u00e1la of the ancients. It stands at the head of the modern delta of the river, and close upon it the Indus divides itself into two great branches, the S\u00fat\u00e1 and Bug\u00e1r. These again subdivide into other branches, and ultimately enter the sea by eleven mouths, occupying a space of 125 British miles, which is the extent of the base of the delta of the Indus. In the immediate neighbourhood of T'hatta there are extensive ruins of two ancient cities named Br\u00e1hmanab\u00e1d and Kull\u00e1nk\u00f3t, while in T'hatta itself we have the modern capital of the country during the reign of the Moghul emperors. Its great population, even so late as the days of N\u00e1dir Sh\u00e1h, will be remembered by those who have perused eastern histories, where they then speak of 14,000 families of weavers. In T'hatta, therefore, we have not only the site and remains of a great city, but a remarkable concurrence with the locality of P\u00e1tt\u00e1la since the river divides into two great branches near it. By the delta of any river we generally understand that portion of it towards the embouchure, when it first sends off its branches. If P\u00e1tt\u00e1la therefore, had stood lower down the Indus, the realm of the P\u00e1tt\u00e1lans could not have been said to form the delta of the Indus. Moreover, we are told that \"that delta was much larger than the Egyptian province of the same name;\" and the modern city of T'hatta at the apex of the delta, is but seventy-five miles from the sea. It has been urged that the distance of T'hatta from the sea varies so much from that of P\u00e1tt\u00e1la given by the Greeks, that this alone disproves the identity of the two places; but to this we reply, that Arrian has expressly declared the base of the delta to have been 1800 stadia, while it is really little more than half the size, or 1000 stadia. These are the words of Arrian:\u2014\"These two mouths of the river Indus are about 1800 stadia distant from each other, and so much is the extent of the island P\u00e1tt\u00e1la along the sea coast.\" I speak from observations both of latitude and longitude, that the face of the delta does not exceed 125 British miles; and rating the stadium at a furlong, according to received opinions, we have here an error of 800 stadia in distance, or, what is more probable, an error in the transcription of the numbers or figures of the historian. In conclusion I have only to add, that Rennell, D'Anville, and Dr. Vincent, appear to be unanimous in considering T'hatta as the P\u00e1tt\u00e1la of the Greeks.\nThe second point for consideration is the direction in which Alexander marched in his three days' journey along the sea coast. Dr. Vincent has recorded his belief that that journey carried him into Cutch, and in this opinion he is now followed by Lieut. Pottinger. I have examined with particular care the text of Arrian on this point, and I cannot discover on what grounds such a theory can possibly be entertained. We have seen that Alexander descended the eastern branch of the Indus, to explore which of the two branches would afford the greatest facilities for the passage of his fleet, and we are told that he landed with a party of horse, and made a three days' march along the coast, examining the country and causing wells to be dug for the use of his fleet. If that march, therefore, had been towards the east, and into Cutch, he would have been digging wells in a direction where his fleet was never to sail. Alexander dreaded the dangers which his admiral would have to encounter; but he was surely not so ignorant of the direction in which his fleet was to pass that he should dig wells in an opposite direction! Arrian tells us, that \"Alexander had a vast ambition of sailing all through the sea from India to Persia, to prove that the Indian gulf had a communication with the Persian;\" and after he had completed his descent of the Indus, the safety of his fleet appears most especially to have engaged his attention. In support of this, and in further corroboration of the motives which dictated the three days' journey westward, we find in the 21st chapter of Arrian's 6th book, that after Alexander had reached the river Arabius, and quitted Sindh, he again turned towards the ocean \"that he might cause more wells to be dug for his fleet,\" and desired Leonatus, one of his officers, \"to tarry there till the fleet should sail round these coasts.\" Are we not to infer, therefore, that Alexander's three days' journey, as well as his route home, were in one direction westward and away from Cutch? It may be observed, that a three days' journey with cavalry along the delta of a river would be a difficult march; but we find that a land expedition under Leonatus seconded Alexander in his descent of the eastern branch of the Indus, and passed \"through the island of Pattala:\" it is a fair conclusion then, that, as they met with no obstacles, Alexander's own party would be equally fortunate; besides, they were accompanied by boats which would have transported them across such creeks and rivers as they could not swim.\n\nSo many years have elapsed since the expedition of Alexander, and so many alterations must have necessarily taken place in such a changeable tract of country as the delta of a river, that it might be difficult to identify one place with another; but this difficulty will not\napply to the direction in which Alexander sailed. There is much, however, both in the topography and names of the modern Indus to identify the country with the scene of Alexander's glories, particularly in the western mouth. Arrian speaks of an island called Crocola near it, and we have the name of Kakra to this day. It is also said, that there was \"a dangerous rock\" which the fleet had to pass; and in this branch of the river the only rock which exists in the Indus, below Thatta, is to be found. The disasters, too, which befell the fleet of Alexander, and which are so graphically described by Curtius, are yet to be experienced in these days. The fleet of boats with which I entered the Indus was left aground by the sudden recession of the waters; and when the tide returned, the adjacent country became flooded, and the tops of mangrove bushes and shrubs were alone visible. Curtius observes, \"when the tide inundated the fields skirting the river, tops of knolls rose above it, like islands.\" But however interesting they may be, these are digressions from the subject.\n\nThere is yet one point that requires notice, and of which we are informed by Nearchus, viz. the existence of a race of people called Sangada, or Sangara, who inhabited the banks of the Arabus westward of the Indus. It is a remarkable fact, that the pirates in the gulf of Cutch belong to a tribe called Sangar, the principal portion of which resides at Jakow, a town about forty miles eastward of the Indus. In Alexander's days, the Sangada are mentioned as occupying the country westward of the river; and in the Sangars we have probably their descendants, although the locality be a little different.\n\nIn conclusion I have only to observe, that if we are guided by the text of Alexander's historians, it is clear that neither the conqueror and his army, nor his fleet, ever entered Cutch. The eastern branch of the Indus was found the safest and best; yet Nearchus, with his whole fleet, sailed out of the western branch, for reasons which are not explained to us. Besides, it was the object of Alexander to impress upon his troops, that the boundaries of his expedition and nature were one. He told them after reaching the sea that they had come to the end of their toils; that nothing now could oppose their valour, nor add to their glory; that, finding he had extended his conquests on that side to the extremities of the earth, he had completed his mighty design, and that he himself, their leader, had rivalled the feats of Hercules and Bacchus.\n\n(Signed) Alex.

XIX.\u2014Description of Ancient Chinese Vases; with Inscriptions illustrative of the History of the Shang Dynasty of Chinese Sovereigns, who reigned from about 1756 to 1112 B.C. Translated from the Original Work, entitled P\u00f6-koo-too, by Peter Perring Thoms, Esq.\n\n(Continued from page 86.)\n\nWINE VESSELS OF THE SHANG DYNASTY.\n\nI.\n\nThis vessel, in height, measured nine Chinese inches and two-tenths; its containing depth was eight inches; its circumference, at the top, seven inches and eight-tenths; and at the centre, seven inches and five-tenths. It weighed seven Chinese pounds and twelve ounces, and was capable of containing three quarts. On the back was engraved the above inscription, which is now written Tsun foo Kwei. The last character was the name of the father of Ching-tang, the founder of the Shang dynasty, and the vessel is supp\nto have been made by order of Ching-tang, in honour of his ancestor's having possessed himself of the empire. Tsun (a son), the first character, which was the name he assumed, represents him as grasping a sword in each hand: it is considered a very early mode of writing the character. The vessel, which is of a quadrangular form, is highly valued for its antiquity, and its workmanship is considered very beautiful. When sacrificing, two of these vessels were commonly used for containing wine.\n\nII.\n\nThis vessel measured, in height, eleven Chinese inches and seven-tenths; its containing depth was eight inches and six-tenths. At the mouth, it measured eight inches and three-tenths; and round the centre, four inches. It weighed eight Chinese pounds and five ounces. The inscription may be thus translated:\u2014\"This valuable vessel is made in honour of the ancestors of Mow.\"\n\nThere was an emperor named \u592a\u620a Tae-mow, who reigned 1552 B.C., who has already been mentioned, and to whom this vessel seems to refer. By his descendants, who were persons of emi-\nnence during nine generations, it was used when worshipping at the altars raised to him. The compiler of the P\u00f6-koo-too considers it a most beautiful and elegantly executed vessel, and says it has excited the admiration of all who have seen it, more especially when its great antiquity is considered.\n\nIII.\n\nThis vessel, including its cover, measured, in height, six Chinese inches and two-tenths; its containing depth was four inches and one-tenth. Its circumference, at the mouth, was three inches and three-tenths; round the centre, three inches and five-tenths. Its containing capacity was rather more than a pint, and it weighed one Chinese pound and two ounces. The inscription contained eight characters, including the one on the cover.\n\nDuring the Shang dynasty, it was customary for the Chow officer, four times a-year, to sacrifice at the royal altars, and invoke b on the government and people. On these o s l s net apart, on which certain animals were the season of the year. The i i \"Chow (the Tae-sze officer)\"\nThis vessel measured, in height, eight Chinese inches and eight-tenths; its containing depth was seven inches. Its circumference at the top six inches and eight-tenths; and around the centre four inches and five-tenths. Its containing capacity was about three English pints, and it weighed three Chinese pounds and twelve ounces.\n\nIn high antiquity, besides conferring honorary vessels, it was the usage for the prince to reward the merits of those ministers who had distinguished themselves by inscribing their names and deeds in some public record, which record was denominated \u7236\u4e59. In the above inscription this character is repeated, implying that the name of the individual to whom the vessel was presented had often been recorded for distinguished merit. The first character was the hieroglyphic mode of writing \u5b6b Sun, \"a grandson or descendant;\" the two latter \u7236\u4e59 Foo-yih. The compilers of the P\u014d-koo-too here remark, that Yih seems to be the name of the family, and Foo, which is generally rendered \"father,\" means \"ancestor;\" hence they read the inscription, \"The grandson having repeatedly caused himself to be\nrecorded on account of meritorious conduct, has had this vase made for his own use when worshipping in the temple of his ancestors.\" They further remark, that it has been shewn under the first vase, that no fewer than six emperors of this dynasty took the name of Y\u012bn, and consequently at this great distance of time it ought not to excite surprise, if we are unable to determine to whom it refers; though, from the ancient form of the characters, there is not the least doubt that it is a vessel of the Shang dynasty.\n\nVI.\n\nThis vessel, in height, measured eight Chinese inches and nine-tenths; its containing depth was seven inches and six-tenths; its circumference, at the mouth, six inches and nine-tenths; round the centre, four inches and one-tenth. It weighed our Chinese pounds and eight ounces; and had the above inscription.\n\nThe relief, which is denominated \"clouds and thunder,\" is considered extremely chaste. The first character of the inscription represents a missile weapon raised, and imports, as when on a se, an admonition against excessive eating and drinking when sacrifici\nancestors. The last two characters are \u4eba\u7678 Jin Kwei, \"the people of Kwei.\" The father of Ching-tang, the founder of the dynasty, was called Kwei. It is conjectured that the people of his native district presented him with this vessel, to be placed in the temple of his ancestors, and that it was afterwards removed to the royal temple of the house of Tang.\n\nVII.\n\nThis vessel, with its cover, measured in height seven Chinese inches and two-tenths; its containing depth was four inches and six-tenths; its circumference, at the neck, three inches and seven-tenths; round the centre, four inches. It weighed two Chinese pounds and fifteen ounces. The above inscription was on the cover, as well as on the vessel.\n\nThe vessel is supposed to have been made by \u592a\u5e9a Tae-Kang, and presented to his brother \u6c83\u4e01 Y\u00fch-ting,* who surrendered\n\n* During the reign of this monarch the celebrated minister E-yun died, and was interred by his sovereign with imperial pomp. His majesty himself attended, and offered sacrifice in honour of the minister's eminent talents.\nthe throne to him about 1656 B.C. About one hundred years later, there was an emperor named Chung-ting, who also resigned the throne to his brother Wei-jin. It is doubtful to which of those two persons the inscription refers. If those princes really transferred the throne, as above mentioned, the national designation must have been continued during their lives, for the standard history does not mention the later sovereigns till the death of the former. As the last character is a hieroglyphical form of Ke, \"a fowl,\" this vessel should have been classed with the vessels.\n\nVIII.\n\nThis beautiful vessel measured, in height, nine Chinese inches and eight-tenths; and its containing depth was eight inches and one-tenth. In circumference, at the mouth, it measured five inches and six-tenths; round the centre, seven inches and four-tenths; and it weighed ten Chinese pounds. It had no inscription. This vessel, the P\u00f6-koo-too says, has always been considered very beautiful, and very ancient. That part of the relief which forms part of a circle in the centre is\nconsidered as representing the imaginary Lung \"Dragon,\" \"the god of rain,\" who is fabled at times to ascend and descend in the clouds. The four sides of the vessel are said to represent, or to be in honour of, the felicitous bird Hwang, which appears only at periods of great national prosperity. Other parts of the relief, which are described in the same fanciful manner, were, in those days, considered admonitory of the necessity of decorum and propriety when sacrificing, by not abusing the creatures.\n\nEND OF PART II.\nART. XX.\u2014An Account of the Country of Sindh; with Remarks on the State of Society, the Government, Manners, and Customs of the People, by the late Captain James McMurdo, of the Bombay Military Establishment.\u2014Communicated by James Bird, Esq. M.R.A.S., F.R.G.S.\n\nRead 5th of July, 1834.\n\nThe author of the Tohfut-al-Gir\u00e1ni states, that \"the country of Sindh takes its name from Sind, the brother of Hind, the son of Noah. It is reckoned the forty-third of the sixty-one countries of the universe. The line of the second climate passes, from the north, directly through its centre; and although Sindh is situated in the five first climates, it nevertheless chiefly appertains to the second, and, consequently, lies in the region of the holy cities of Mecca and Medina.\" It would be difficult to discover where the author quoted has found these grandsons of the patriarch; indeed, as is usual in such genealogies, they are probably altogether imaginary. The Hindu writings may, perhaps, afford some more satisfactory explanation of the name; but I have not been so fortunate as to meet with it. As far as I can learn from such sources, this country was called Sindh\u00fad\u00e9s, or \"the country of the ocean,\" alluding doubtless to the river Indus, which receives that dignified appellation in their sacred writings. The same authorities also state Sindh to have been governed by a Xhuthi, named Jayadrat'ha, who was slain in the civil wars of the Pand\u00fas; and it has, in consequence, sometimes received the name of Jayadrat'had\u00e9s, after that chieftain.\n\nI think it highly probable that Sindh, generally speaking, takes its name from the river,\u2014an opinion which I formed from finding the same appellation used in ancient times; for such I take the Sindomana of the Greeks, which was the capital of a province, to be; and further investigation has confirmed me in the belief, that Sindh was the name originally of a small tract of a country lying upon the river, but whose precise boundaries are now lost, in the changes, both local and otherwise, to which this country has been subject in a remarkable degree; and I conceive that in this division, wherever it may have been, is to be found the site of the ancient Sindomana.\n\nThe limits of this country, as they may have existed at various periods of its history, and under different governments, cannot exactly defined; nor is it even possible to determine, with\nthe precise boundaries of the present province of Sindh proper. The fairest mode of ascertaining its extent would, perhaps, be to confine the term Sindh to the tract watered by the Indus, corresponding nearly with the territories at present held by the Talpuras, the acknowledged rulers of the province; and the same method is, upon the whole, the safest for defining the limits of the country, at the earliest period. According to this plan, the province of Sindh will lie between the twenty-third and twenty-eighth degrees of north latitude, and sixty-seventh and seventieth degrees of east longitude: while, in general terms, it may be said to be bounded on the north by the territories of Kabul; by the Davudpuras, to the west and east of the Indus; and on the south by the district of Cutch and the ocean. The great sandy desert, and the territories which it embraces, separate Sindh from India, whilst a vast chain of rocky mountains forms a distinct and natural boundary along the whole western frontier.\n\nIf credit is to be given to the Greek historians, the country, included in the limits which I have just fixed for those of Sindh, was divided into several considerable sovereignties, possessed of powerful resources both in men and riches. Judging, however, from the extent of space allotted to them, I am inclined to believe that their importance has been much exaggerated, in order to enhance the exploits of an ambitious individual. Whatever changes may have occurred to them, either politically or statistically, in the course of a series of centuries, they cannot have been such, as in any respect to justify the accounts of so many sovereigns and nations being subdued by the army and policy of Alexander, in the space between Multan and the sea. Difference of name, habits, or language, may perhaps have given rise to this hyperbolical classification of the divisions of Sindh; for although we should never think of calling a portion of country, not equal in size to a province, by the name of a nation, yet if people were found living under distinct governments, and differing from each other in manners, customs, and language, the appellation would, in such case, become at least less ridiculous. No traces of such a variety however can be discovered, either in written documents or traditionary accounts; although, with the progress of society, it may fairly be supposed that certain changes must have been produced.\n\nPassing over those obscure and unsatisfactory conjectures, let us proceed to consider the divisions of Sindh, as understood among the people themselves. The province has had, from time immemorial, two grand divisions, the northern and southern. The former, extending from the neighbourhood of Bhakar to the parallel of the modern Halukandi, below Sehwan, is styled Sirra; and the latter, including\nthe space to the ocean, is named L\u00e1r.* Of the etymology or origin of these names, I can find no trace; but that they are extremely ancient is probable, because the geographers, in the commencement of the Roman empire, I believe, applied the name of Laryia to the country lying near the mouth of the Indus; and in the same name we discover the origin of L\u00e1ri Bandar, or the port of L\u00e1r, in whatever part of the delta that place may have at different times been situated.\u2020\n\nEach of these two divisions appears to have had its respective capital; viz. \u00c1l\u00f3r in Sirra, and Br\u00e1hman\u00e1b\u00e1d in L\u00e1r; at least we find no mention made of other cities on the same scale as those, in the earlier times of the Muhammedans. They were undoubtedly considered as the first and second cities in the empire of the Ra\u00edas. Sirra and L\u00e1r were, in all probability, divided into a number of inferior districts, which, it is likely, were, in some instances, known under their present names, and, in others, by appellations now either totally lost, or so corrupted as not to be distinguished. S\u00fandra, Sehw\u00e1n, Tehri, L\u00f3hri, Gora, or Carnalla, are, at all events, names of districts coeval with the Muhammedan conquest, and probably of a much earlier date; but the titles of a moiety of the present divisions are evidently modern, and have their origin in local or temporary circumstances. The districts into which Sindh is now divided, are generally said to be forty-four in number; and, perhaps, in the public records and accounts of the province, they are restricted to that number. The division is, nevertheless, subject to variation; for some modes of dividing the country increase the parganahs to above fifty.\n\nThe following is the most popular mode of dividing this country:\n\nIn the delta lie \u2014 Ch\u00e1chg\u00e1m, Jh\u00e1tti, Kahr\u00e1l\u00eda, S\u00e1kra, T'hatta Dh\u00e1r\u00e1ja, S\u00fandr\u00e1, Pallejar, Chakerh\u00e1lla, Im\u00e1mwah, or Tranda of Muhammed Kh\u00e1n Talp\u00fara.\n\nEast of the river\u2014Sirra, J\u00e1m Tum\u00e1chi, Batt\u00f3ra (menp\u00far), R\u00fapa, Odihj\u00e1hi, S\u00edmaawatti, Tr\u00e1nda, Mir Ell\u00e1h Y\u00e1kh\u00e1n, Mattaloi, Shek\u2014\n\n* Mr. Pottinger, in his definition of the name L\u00e1rkh\u00e1na, says it is derived from a word signifying saliva. This meaning, if authentic, would apply better to the delta of the Indus; for its coolness is greater than that of any other part of Sindh. L\u00e1dkh\u00e1na is spelt with a d, which makes it a different word from L\u00e1r, which, in Sindhi, signifies low.\n\n\u2020 Dr. Vincent gives a L\u00e1ribandar, and a Bandar-L\u00e1ri, the one on the east, and the other on the west branch of the river. I have not been able to discover any foundation for such a distinction, nor, indeed, is the term L\u00e1ribandar at all familiar to the natives. The name, however, might, with equal propriety, have been applied to any port in the delta.\nd\u00fadp\u00far, H\u00falakandi, Dim, Kandi\u00e1ra, R\u00e1ni Gumbat, Lak\u00e1wat, H\u00e1llam, Behlani, L\u00f3hri, M\u00f3r\u00e1guchira, Khairp\u00far, M\u00e1tt\u00edla (M\u00edrp\u00far).\n\nWest of the river\u2014K\u00f3teri, Kh\u00f3nt\u00f3, Sum, Sehw\u00e1n, Tehri, Bobuk, Samtan\u00ed, Kh\u00f3d\u00e1b\u00e1d, Kullah, K\u00e1ch\u00e1, B\u00e1ghb\u00e1n, Tigger, Chandka, Gohrah or C\u00e1rn\u00e1l\u00e1, Do\u00e1ba or Haider\u00e1b\u00e1d, and Kar\u00e1cchi, with its country to the westward of T'hatta, called Ch\u00e1pper, which is a modern addition to the Sindh territory.\n\nVarious, however, are the divisions in the parganahs, and to enumerate these would only be to confuse. Jow and Baddin, two large districts, are included in that of Ch\u00e1chg\u00e1m, as is the very ancient Mandr\u00e1. N\u00e1sirp\u00far was at one time a large sirk\u00e1r, and rose upon the ruins of M\u00e1tt\u00e1l\u00f3\u00ed. It has, however, in its turn again become dependant on its more fertile or favoured neighbours. Under the head of T'hatta are included several parganahs, but in particular that of Druk, supposed to be very ancient; also that of G\u00e1ngra, both of which are now separated from T'hatta by the river. The Dir\u00e1k is another ancient district now not much known by that name.\n\nThe author of the Tohf\u00e1t-al-G\u00edr\u00e1ni states Sindh to be blessed with a fine climate. The mornings and evenings, he remarks, are truly delightful; the northern division warm, and the lower cool. The fact, however, I believe to be, that this province is, generally speaking, unhealthy; particularly in the neighbourhood of those parts subject to the annual inundation. \"When it is considered,\" says a gentleman, who resided several years in L\u00e1r, \"what an immense tract of land is laid under water, and afterwards exposed, with its vegetation, to the putrifying effects of a burning sun, it can hardly be supposed that this climate, farther corrupted by the stagnations which everywhere take place, can be very congenial to the human constitution; on the contrary, a numerous train of diseases are here prevalent, among which, as may be expected, intermittent fevers, asthma, and rheumatism take the lead.\" The northern division of the country, however, does not bear so bad a character in point of climate, although the hot winds blow, in some parts, with uncommon severity; and throughout the summer months, the heat surpasses, by all accounts, that of any part of India. So great is the estimated difference between the climate of L\u00e1r and Sirra, that all public servants receive superior salaries when on duty in the former division, where they seldom remain for any length of time (if not natives) without suffering in their health.\n\nThe whole of the delta, as far west as T'hatta, is exposed, in some degree, to the effects of the south-west monsoon, which, consequently, brings the temperature of this portion nearly to that of the west coast.\nof Gujer\u00e1t. Much inconvenience is, however, felt to the westward of that city, where the monsoon but partially extends; and, indeed, I believe that in Ch\u00e1pper, and the country inhabited by the Jog\u00edas, several years occasionally elapse without any rain whatever. I have already said that the heat of the climate of Sirra, in the months of March, April, and May, is excessive; and the hot winds prevail in Sew\u00ed to such a degree, as to render travelling not only dangerous, but, in the desert which lies between that province and the northern frontier of Sindh, absolutely impossible. Rain, however, falls in Sirra generally in June, which, with the floods in the river, tend materially to relieve the oppressive heat. In the winter season, that is, in December and January, the trees and vegetation generally suffer from the frost, and are deprived of their leaves,\u2014a circumstance which does not occur in L\u00e1r.\n\nThe soil of Sindh is of various descriptions; that which is subject to the inundation of the river is often of a rich clay, sometimes a fine loam, and elsewhere a loose sand. The land in question is extremely fertile, and produces the most luxuriant crops of grain without tillage, when the soil is yet moist from the recent floods. The grain is scattered over the surface, and the produce is yielded without further trouble. Towards the mountains of Bell\u00fachist\u00e1n, on the western frontier of the province, the soil is rocky, and considerably impregnated with iron ore. Here it is poor and scanty, the rock generally approaching the surface, which circumstances, combined with the uncertainty of the season, render it better adapted for pasturage than agriculture; to the former of which habits its people also naturally tend. On the north of Sehw\u00e1n, almost to the vicinity of the hills, the soil is the richest and most productive in Sindh, and is nowhere interspersed with a rock until we reach the neighbourhood of L\u00e1rkh\u00e1na, and north of that place.\n\nThe soil of the eastern parts of Sindh partakes in some degree of the qualities of the neighbouring desert, but near the river, throughout the greatest part, the sand is mixed with a white clay which seems favourable for vegetation. In the eastern parts of L\u00e1r, that is in the vicinity of the river, the soil partakes chiefly of this clay; which, in the hot and dry months, yields a dust so fine as to elude all common precautions for escaping from its unpleasant effects, and the natives have recourse to ventilators in the roofs of their houses, which they keep in other respects shut up in the closest manner. A peculiarity in the soil of Sindh is worthy of remark, and this is, that a travel may journey for days in the eastern parts without meeting with a or stone of any kind.\nThe fertility of this province, in those parts which are exposed to the floods of the Indus, is exceeded by that of no tract of country on the earth. On the regularity and abundance of these, however, depend the wealth, and, in a great measure, the supply of the absolute necessaries of life, of the inhabitants. In tracts remote from the river, where the rise of the waters does not naturally extend, and where this defect is not remedied by the labour and skill of man, the produce of the soil is often scanty and always precarious. A few districts in Sindh yield three crops of grain in the year; they are, however, generally confined to two, and, in some cases, where the waters of the Indus, either from natural obstacles, or from the indolence of the people, have not been introduced, the soil yields but one crop and that of the poorest description.\n\nThroughout the whole of the lower part of L\u00e1r, where the country is one entire sheet of water for three months in the year, the quantities of rice produced is beyond any thing I ever heard of. The parganahs of Kahr\u00e1lla and K\u00e1ch\u00e1, in particular, yield rice in great abundance. The seed is sown with the first appearance of the inundation; the plants rise with the waters, and the crop is sometimes reaped in boats. An inferior division of the Kahr\u00e1lla parganah, is ascertained to have yielded no less than 1000 khirw\u00e1rs* of rice as the share of the government, which, making the usual allowances, is equal to about one-third of the whole produce.\n\nIn the lower parganahs the dry grains are rarely cultivated; nevertheless in those of Jh\u00e1tti, Im\u00e1mwah, and Baddin, crops of wheat, barley, jow\u00e1ri, Indian corn, sugar-cane, and tobacco, are produced by irrigation in the cold months.\n\nThe great portion of Ch\u00e1chg\u00e1m,\u2020 which lies to the eastward of the G\u00f3ni branch of the river, not being exposed to the floods, produces in the natural course of the seasons, b\u00e1jeri and m\u00e1ng (a kind of pulse), besides wheat, Indian corn, &c. &c., by irrigation from the cuts made from the P\u00far\u00e1n and G\u00f3ni.\n\nThe more northern districts produce abundant crops of wheat, barley, jow\u00e1ri, m\u00e1ng, and other common grain; almost exclusively, however, in many parts by irrigation, or in the moist beds of extensive dhinds or lakes which, formed by the annual floods, gradually but quickly evaporate. Cotton is also cultivated in small quantities, and the tree is represented as being tall, with many branches, and not\n\n* A khirw\u00e1r of Sh\u00e1hbandar is about equal to one and a half Surat candies.\u2014The candy is a weight which varies very much in the different provinces where it is used; the Bombay candy is 560 lbs.\u2014Ed.\n\n\u2020 This Sirk\u00e1r takes its name from the Ch\u00e1chak tribe who inhabited it at one period.\nperennial. Sugar-cane is cultivated everywhere in this province to a very great extent, and coarse sugar made annually, part of which is exported by sea, but the largest portion either consumed in the country, or carried to the northern provinces, which are less favoured by climate. The cane produced here is larger than that of western India, but the sugar which it yields is of an inferior quality. The vegetables common to India are found throughout Sindh, where, as elsewhere, they require to be irrigated. The sweet potato seems to be peculiarly adapted to the soil. It is most abundant of all vegetables, and, in some parts, forms an essential article in the food of the people.\n\nThe indigo plant is reared with much care in the north of Sindh, and forms the standing die for the cloths of the majority of the population, besides furnishing a large supply for foreign markets. The cultivation of this plant is confined almost exclusively to the parganahs of S\u00e1ti, Tiggir, B\u00e1ghb\u00e1n, Ch\u00e1ndka, L\u00f3hri, and Samtani; in these, however, it is carried on to a great extent, and is found the most lucrative both to government and the people, of all productions of the earth. A space of ground nearly eight yards square, which is equal to a Sindh b\u00edg\u00e1, employed for the cultivation of indigo, yields an annual revenue to the government of eighty rupees. This plant is entirely produced by irrigation; on the judicious management of which branch of agriculture, indeed, depends the success of every crop in Sindh.\n\nThe country round Thatta, and various other parts, yields abundance of saltpetre. This article was formerly prepared in great quantities for exportation, and furnished the markets of western India. Of late years, however, it has been driven out of use by the extensive and cheaper manufacture of the same article in Bengal, where also more science is displayed and greater pains are taken to render the quality better. Saltpetre is nevertheless very largely prepared for home consumption and for land exportation in Sindh, which has the reputation of manufacturing the best native gunpowder in India. The shores of the delta yield a never failing supply of common salt, which is annually carried inland to a considerable amount.\n\nIn the valuable article of timber, Sindh appears to be nearly destitute, as far as I can discover. There are no forest-trees that can assume the name of timber. Throughout the delta marshes are covered with a brush-wood, of little use but to split and dry for firewood. The most common tree in the province is the lye, which is, I believe, the tamarisk.* Near the sea-shore it never attains to any\n\n* Tamarix Indica.\u2014Willd.\na considerable dimensions, but between Haiderabad and Sehr\u00e1n, on its banks of the river, I am told that the lye is seen in forests, and the trees of a large size.\n\nI do not appear to be in any variety, the mangoes, pomegranate, and all that are worthy of notice; but grapes, apples, annually arrive from Kabul and the north. The others are packed in cotton and keep fresh for several months. Medicinal waters are frequently met with, some of which are said to have medicinal qualities. Hot springs are found in the hills; and alkali is prepared in the hills, and exported to India, where it is used in\n\nThere are vast tracts of Sindh, both in numbers and utility, throughout the province; and, as Rennell observes, the marshes in the delta of the Indus are made for rearing this animal, although neither considered so hardy nor so useful as in sandy countries. In the delta of the Indus, the water is sunk to the middle in mud and sand, on the stunted shrubs which grow below high-water mark. Here herds browse together in herds, and seem to be as much as on the driest leaves of trees.\n\nThe use of the camel in a country like Sindh is incalculable. The whole trade and carriage of merchandise is performed by that animal, and the long and tiresome journey from the sea-shore to the interior is travelled by the camel with a load equal to twelve stone or more back. They travel during the night in these long journeys by stages of sixteen or twenty miles; halting during the day, and feed plentifully where most other animals would starve. Young camels selected for sport are trained to the saddle, and become as fleet as the horse. Incredible journeys are thus performed; and although their paces are rough and uneasy to the rider, yet in Sindh, where people of the first rank do not consider it beneath their dignity to ride on the camel, so much attention is paid to the comfort and, indeed, elegance of the saddle, that the motion is rendered more tolerable than it is in other countries where the animal is in less repute. On the saddles, which are often made of embroidered broad cloth, are two seats, the foremost of which is occupied by the person who manages the camel, which he effects by means of a string attached to a piece of wood about two inches in length, at each end, passed through\n\nCamels fed on cuminating.\na perforation in the nostril: the seat in the rear is filled by an armed person, who acts as an attendant and guard. Fire-arms and even swivels are constantly used upon camels in Asiatic warfare, and are so employed to a great extent in Sindh.\n\nSome other uses to which this animal is applied still remain to be noticed. They are yoked in harness; made to draw water for irrigation; and are occasionally seen at the plough or attached to a mill for expressing oil. Those who breed the camel drink the milk of the female, and consider it wholesome and nutritious. It is necessary to use it almost immediately after taking it from the animal, for, when exposed to the air, it spoils sooner than any other kind of milk.\n\nThe horse of Sindh is hardy and capable of performing long journeys with ease both to himself and rider, by means of an ambling pace to which they are all trained. Horses are procurable in considerable numbers; and as the soil and climate in the northern districts have from experience been found favourable for breeding, the supply might be increased by care and attention.\n\nThe Sindhian men of rank being chiefly military are remarkably fond of horses, and spare neither money nor trouble to possess the finest animal in Quil\u00e1l,* Khandah\u00e1r, and even Persia; all of which produce breeds far superior to any found in Sindh. This country has a very excellent breed of mules, which animal is not considered in the disreputable light that it is in India. The mules in Sindh are large, strong, and handsome; very useful in the carriage of baggage on a journey; and convenient for the use of a servant, who can thus always be present with his master on the longest marches.\n\nThe country more remote from the river feeds vast herds of oxen, particularly the tract on the eastern border, where extensive plains are allotted solely to the pasturage of cattle of all kinds. In Sindh, they are used for food by the Muhammedans, and numbers are annually carried off by merchants from Cutch, Kattiaw\u00e1r, and Guj\u00e1-r\u00e1t. The ox is rather undersized, but broad, strongly made, and well adapted for labour. Buffaloes are in great abundance, and form part of the property of rich and poor; in fact, a man's wealth is estimated by the number of buffaloes, camels, and goats, which he possesses. The domestic animals of India are plentiful in Sindh, and the fields are well supplied with the common species of game. There is perhaps no country in the world where water-fowl are more numerous. The large lakes and marshes are literally covered with them, and they serve as food to all the labouring classes of natives. Of\n\n* Kelul of Mr. Elphinstone's map.\nbeasts of prey, the wolf and jackal are, I believe, alone to be met with, unless in some parts of the country subject to M\u00edr S\u00f3hr\u00e1b, where tigers are found. The creeks and rivers abound with alligators, which are venerated by the natives; and badgers and other animals are hunted for the sake of their skins, which are sold in the northern provinces to advantage. The wild hog, as may be supposed from the nature of the country, inhabits every quarter of Sindh, and the chase of this animal is the principal amusement of the sovereigns and their nobility; all of whom, though strict Muhammedans, keep packs of a large ferocious breed of dogs for the sole purpose of hunting the boar. The river Indus, and the dhinds or lakes formed by its waters absolutely swarm with fish, which is the principal article of food among the natives. Here is to be had the sable-fish, so much celebrated by Europeans. It is called palw\u00e1h by the natives, and resembles the salmon in taste, but is filled with forked bones, which are troublesome and disagreeable.\n\nThe original capital of Sindh was \u00c1l\u00f3r, situated on the old river, nearly in the parallel of latitude of Bhakir. It was ruined in the second century of the hejira, and has been ever since a dependency of Bhakir. During the government of the Kh\u00e1l\u00edfat, which lasted for three centuries, M\u00falt\u00e1n appears to have been fixed on by their governors as the capital; but at the same time other independencies sprung up throughout Sindh, each of which had its capital town, but not one of them is now, I believe, to be met with. Their names and situations it may be proper to enumerate in order to illustrate the history of the country.\n\nThe city next in repute to \u00c1l\u00f3r was B\u00e1hmana or Bh\u00e1mana, also called Br\u00e1hman\u00e1b\u00e1d.* It was situated on or near the P\u00far\u00e1n, in what was subsequently called the Shehd\u00e1dp\u00far parganah: Bh\u00e1m\u00e1na was afterwards called D\u00edbal K\u00e1ngara.\n\nNer\u00fank\u00f3t was a city on the site of which, or nearly so, stands the modern Haider\u00e1b\u00e1d. It was distinguished for its defence, and its submission to the Muhammedan arms on their first entering Sindh. Bhamb\u00f3r, was a city situated on a branch of the Indus, which joined the sea between T'hatta and Kar\u00e1chi. It was deserted in consequence of a failure in the stream; and its inhabitants occupied the T'hatta and S\u00e1k\u00eda parganahs, from what I can collect, about the middle of the seventh century of the hejira.\n\nK\u00e1llank\u00f3t (or K\u00e1llak\u00f3t) afterwards T\u00f3ghlak\u00e1b\u00e1d, was situated on\n\n* I shall enter into no particulars with respect to ancient cities here, as I propose to prosecute the subject elsewhere. (Vide Capt. M'Murdo's former paper in the same volume, p. 20.\u2014Ed.)\nthe hills a few miles west of T'hatta. It was a fort without inhabitants, and was considered as the work of Hind\u00fa gods. S\u00fandra was an ancient city, the ruins of which are in the parganah still bearing that name; and Himak\u00f3t was an old fort in its vicinity, also supposed to be the work of the gods. Its inhabitants were transferred to T'hatta. D\u00edbal was the principal sea-port in Sindh as early as the first discoveries of the Arabians on the Indian coasts. It took its name from a celebrated d\u00e9wala, or temple of the Hind\u00fas, which it contained, and which was destroyed by the Arabs. With regard to the situation of this city there are many different opinions, and I have endeavoured to settle it in another place.* The inhabitants were undoubtedly removed to L\u00e1ribandar, and subsequently to Dh\u00e1rroja.\n\nM\u00e1ndr\u00f3pat was a large town situated near the present G\u00f3ni branch of the Indus, a little above the parallel of Lakpat. It was deserted in the eighth century of the hejira. T\u00far was a city of the S\u00famr\u00e1s in the same tract; and Vijehk\u00f3t was the capital of the same people, lying on the P\u00far\u00e1n, now in the desert. It was destroyed by Sult\u00e1n All\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn in the beginning of the eighth century of the hejira. M\u00e1nkat\u00e1ra or M\u00e1nhat\u00e1ra, was a city situated in the R\u00e9pa parganah. It flourished about the middle of the sixth century of the hejira. Minagar was a city subject to a chief, by caste an Agri. It flourished so late as the seventh century of the hejira; but of its antiquity nothing is known further than that the Agr\u00eds were the descendants of Alexander, according to the author the Tohfat-al-Gir\u00e1n\u00ed. Minagar was situated on the L\u00f3kh\u00e1na river, in the present Shehd\u00e1dpur parganah. It is needless to enumerate more of these ancient towns in this place; I shall, therefore, now concisely state what is known of the modern towns mentioned in the history of Sindh.\n\nAccording to native historians, the ground on which the celebrated city of T'hatta is situated was formerly covered by the sea, which however retired, and left a desert destitute of fresh water, in which state it remained until the change in the river Indus rendered it as fertile as it had before been barren. At the period of Sult\u00e1n All\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn's visit to Sindh in about A.H. 700, the Samm\u00e1s founded the town of S\u00e1moi and the fort of Mandr\u00e1ssa to the north of the M\u00e1kal\u00ed hills, about five miles from T'hatta. Towards the close of A.H. 900, J\u00e1m Nanda (Niz\u00e1m-ud-d\u00edn) selected a spot occupied by a fishing village for the site of a new capital, which he named T'hab, implying closeness of population, while others find its origin in the common word T'hatta, a crowd or assembly of people. Some persons think\n\n* See the present volume of the Journal, p. 39.\nthat the country was named *T'hatta* long before the city was founded; this, however, appears quite uncertain. The *S\u00e1g\u00e1ra* branch of the river runs to the north of *T'hatta*; and its inhabitants were drawn from *Dibal*, *Bhamb\u00f3ra*, *Bagar*, and *Terra*, which were large and populous cities on the *S\u00e1g\u00e1ra* river, and deserted in the course of time either from choice or necessity. It is stated by M\u00edr Abdul Riz\u00e1k Isfah\u00e1n\u00ed, surnamed Mashrab, that this district was originally peopled from *Y\u00faman*,* from which circumstance it is that *T'hatta* has been so celebrated for the learned and able men it has produced.\n\nThe city of *T'hatta* continued to thrive in a surprising manner until it was destroyed by M\u00edrza J\u00e1ni Beg, about A.H. 1000, on the occasion of the invasion of the troops of Akb\u00e1r. It never fairly recovered itself afterwards, and although it had the reputation of being the first city in *Sindh*, it gradually declined in consequence until the accession of the Kalh\u00f3ra dynasty; and as this family did not make it their capital, *T'hatta* never afterwards improved. The city has still further declined under the present rulers, and, by the most authentic accounts, does not now contain more than 18,000 inhabitants; although from its size, being, by all accounts, upwards of four miles and a half in circumference, it must at one time have held four times that number.\n\nThe city is situated on a rising ground about four miles west of the river, which, till within these forty years, sent a large branch off to the westward, above *T'hatta*, placing the town in a delta which does not now exist. *T'hatta* had originally no fortifications, but after it was sacked by the Portuguese, M\u00edrza Isa surrounded it with a brick wall which is now in ruins. The houses of the rich and respectable inhabitants are of brick; but those of the lower classes are of straw and wood, plastered with mud, and consequently are not durable. The trade of *Dibal*, by which name alone *T'hatta* is still known to the Arabs, was formerly very extensive, and in this view *T'hatta* will be considered hereafter. The capital is governed by a nobleman who has the title of Nav\u00e1b, but the military force at his command is very limited.\n\nHaider\u00e1b\u00e1d, the present capital of *Sindh*, is situated in latitude 25\u00b0 22' N. and longitude 68\u00b0 41' E., nearly on the site of the ancient Nerunk\u00f3t. It was founded in its modern state by M\u00edr Gh\u00f3r\u00e1m Sh\u00e1n Kalh\u00f3ra in A.H. 1182, and was defended by a wall and towers.\n\n* Y\u00faman is generally supposed to be Greek; and, according to Dr. Robertson, this country was conquered by the Greek government of Bactria after the division of Alexander's conquests.\n\n\u2020 In digging for the foundation of the walls, vast numbers of human bones and entire bodies were found in a wonderful state of preservation.\nIts position is on a rocky hill, which is in some parts remarkably steep, and the foot of the precipice is washed by the Falili branch of the Indus. The Mani river runs three miles to the west of Haiderabad, but both streams are navigable.\n\nThe next city in fame, though, perhaps, not in consequence, in Sindh, is Schw\u00e1n. It is reckoned extremely ancient; and is known under the various names of S\u00e9wist\u00e1n, S\u00e9w\u00e1n, and Schw\u00e1n, the last of which however is correct. It has been sometimes called Bayhd\u00e1d; and the natives have a fable of its having been inhabited previously by a race of men who were cannibals. The fortifications of Schw\u00e1n were, it is believed, first founded in a regular form by one of the J\u00e1ms of Thatta. Sh\u00e1h Beg Argh\u00fan took it from J\u00e1m Fir\u00f3ze to whom it was restored. It was situated upon a rock rising abruptly from the Indus, was of small extent, and is now in ruins. The town is a miserable collection of huts, but contains about eight thousand people, and is divided from the castle by a ravine filled with water during the floods. In fact, Schw\u00e1n could only have been a place of importance when under a distinct authority, and it must have ceased to be so when it became a part of the general government of Sindh. The town and castle are on the west bank of the river, which is now at some distance.\n\nBhakir, or Bakar, was founded by the Arabs, and built from the ruins of \u00c1l\u00f3r. It was originally Ferishta. The Tohfat-al-Gir\u00e1n\u00ed states, that this town did not exist in the time of the Hind\u00fa Raj, and that it got its name Bakar (\"the dawn\") from Saiy\u00edd Muhammed Mak\u00ed, of religious memory, some years after its foundation. The city of Bhakir was, in the time of Sh\u00e1h Beg Argh\u00fan, surrounded by water, being on a small island in the Indus. Whether it originally was so or not seems doubtful, and I should be inclined to think not. At present, the water to the west of the town, during the dry season, entirely disappears. The Argh\u00fans made it their capital; and Sh\u00e1h Beg built a brick wall round the town for its defence. At this time, also, it was that the Saiyids, who were anciently possessed of great power here, excited the jealousy of the Argh\u00fans, and were compelled to leave the town and occupy Lohri, which has already been considered as a suburb of Bhakir, though divided from it by the easternmost channel of the river, and containing six times the number of inhabitants. On the opposite bank also is Seikhar, or Seiggar, a suburb of the city. In the precincts of Bhakir were the Bhir\u00e1l\u00fa gardens, which were, with their magnificent and elegant buildings, destroyed by Sult\u00e1n Muhammed Kh\u00e1n, on the report being spread of B\u00edram Kh\u00e1n, the Kh\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n\u00e1n of Akhr\u00e1, being about to visit Sindh. Under Vol. I.\nthe celebrated Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u012bn, Bhak\u012br was the seat of an independent government; but on his death it became a dependency of Dehli, and was made the head of a district. On N\u0101dir Sh\u0101h\u2019s visit to Sindh, he destroyed its fortifications. This city is at present in the possession of M\u012br Sohr\u0101b T\u0101lp\u016bra, and has lost much of its importance. It is, however, still of consequence, as a frontier town between Sindh and Kandah\u0101r on one side, and serving as a barrier to M\u012br Sohr\u0101b, towards the D\u0101udp\u016btra country on the other. Bhak\u012br, in a religious point of view, is of some repute among the followers of Mu\u1e25ammad; for it possesses in a golden box, two hairs and a-half of the prophet, to which peculiar properties are ascribed, and which are held in high veneration. Bhak\u012br has always been the seat of old Muhammedan families, among whom much learning has been preserved; and I think that a considerable addition to our stock of knowledge regarding ancient Sindh might be made, if the libraries and records of these families were open to research.\n\nBhak\u012br at present contains only five thousand inhabitants, who are said to be remarkable for their cheerful and social dispositions.*\n\nN\u0101sirp\u016br, now in ruins, was once the most beautiful and flourishing city in Sindh. Although I agree with some geographers in believing this to be the Al M\u0101nsura of the Arabs, as is elsewhere explained,\u2020 it is well established that the modern N\u0101sirp\u016br was founded by an officer named N\u0101s\u012br, who was left by Sult\u0101n Fir\u014dze Sh\u0101h, of Dehli, to command in Sindh after that sovereign\u2019s attack on Thatta in A.H. 751. N\u0101sirp\u016br was situated on the S\u0101ngra branch, at that time the main stream of the Indus, and its suburbs were highly ornamented by rich gardens, and pleasure-grounds filled with temporary or permanent villas for recreation. It was N\u0101sirp\u016br that the Ter-kh\u0101n dynasty, and that tribe in general, took so much trouble to embellish and improve. The precise date of the decay of N\u0101sirp\u016br is unknown; but it was coincident with the change of the stream to the westward of Haiderd\u0101b\u0101d, which was prior to the entrance of the Dehli army in A.H. 1000.\n\nIndependently of the cities which I have here enumerated, there have been, and still are, a vast number of towns of importance in Sindh; but many of them are temporary, and all of them subject to change of name or situation. I have, therefore, thought it needless to enter into any description of them, because what is correct regarding them at the time I am writing, may be very different by the time this history\n\n* L\u014dheri, or R\u014dhri, as it is erroneously called, is an ancient city, at least it is believed to have been built at the same time as Bhak\u012br.\n\n\u2020 See p. 34.\nmeets the public eye. The map will convey, in my opinion, sufficient information on the subject of the towns, ancient and modern, to render intelligible the allusions made to them in the course of the work.*\n\nThe commerce of Sindh, both external and internal, has been subject to great vicissitudes. The country is by nature admirably adapted to benefit by commerce, and that it did so to the utmost extent under the ancient Hind\u00fa government, there is ample proof; but from the time of its subversion by the power of the Kh\u00e1l\u00edfs, society was dismembered, the consolidated authority, which secured quiet and confidence to the people, was broken up, and an aristocracy formed on its ruins, which threw Sindh back, in point of political situation, to that of a country in the first stage of its emerging from barbarism,\u2014a situation from which it has never entirely extricated itself. Such a state of things, it may be readily supposed, was not very favourable for commercial transactions. Were we to form a judgment of the former of the periods just referred to, from the accounts which still exist both in Europe and Asia, we should justly infer that the commerce of Sindh with Persia and Arabia was rich and extensive, and that D\u00edbal, the sea-port of the Indus, was the emporium for the goods, both of India and of Arabia, and conferred a degree of wealth and splendour on the country and government that has never since been equalled.\n\nDuring the period that Sindh was subject to N\u00e1sir-ud-D\u00edn Kabach\u00ed of M\u00falt\u00e1n, when the province was divided among seven tributary chiefs, over whom N\u00e1sir\u2019s authority was but partially established, and during the whole period of the Sumr\u00e1 rule, there appears to have been a great defect in the system of government; and although we do not know from good authority the state of trade during these times, yet we may, nevertheless, assume, that it was not in a very flourishing condition; for besides the internal state of Sindh itself, the entire or partial dismemberment of the Hind\u00fa sovereignties in that part of India bordering on this province, must have tended materially to check speculations in commerce.\n\nWith the J\u00e1m Samm\u00e1 dynasty trade once more assumed a promising aspect, and under the encouragement of some individuals of that family, the country seems to have been rescued from a state deplorable in the highest degree. The succeeding government of the Argh\u00fan\u00eds was not injurious to the prosperity of Sindh; but the manner of their establishment, and the circumstances consequent on a\n\n* It is to be regretted, that the map referred to by Capt. M'Murdo in this and other places, has not yet reached the Society.\nrevolution of authorities, caused more attention to be directed to the military than to the civil branches of policy. In M\u00edrza Isa Ter-kh\u00e1n the industrious of all classes and descriptions found a warm friend and protector; and the M\u00edrza himself engaged deeply in commerce, both before and subsequent to his elevation to the rank of a sovereign. It was this M\u00edrza who improved and regulated the sea-ports; and he spared no expense or trouble to render the conveyance of goods through his dominions safe and easy.\n\nThe tyranny and frenzy of Muhammed Kh\u00e1n, followed, as they shortly were, by the annexation of Sindh to the crown of Dehli, were injurious to the prosperity of the province. From the tyranny of the former, the lives of his subjects were never safe; and the latter gave rise to a contest which, short as it was, was productive of great distress to the country, and was succeeded by an annual change of subad\u00e1rs, who farmed the revenue, and possessed exclusive authority in every department of the government; while their views and dispositions probably assimilated in no respect but in that of amassing wealth,\u2014circumstances which must of necessity have been inimical to industry of all kinds, but particularly so to the safe and profitable employment of capital. Under the Kalh\u00f3ras commerce regained, in some degree, its natural importance; for an English factory was established, which was doubtless productive of mutual advantages, and the country was now also under one head, capable of improving its situation in every respect. The jealousy and narrow-minded disposition of some of that family, however, by endangering the safety of the individuals and property of the English establishment, put an end to those prospects, by causing the factory to be withdrawn; and it was only re-established, to be finally broken up in consequence of an open outrage committed on its chief member.\n\nThe present government of Sindh has left nothing undone to destroy this branch of its revenue, with regard to which it pursues a most barbarous line of policy; for, by appropriating to itself an unfair proportion of the profits of the trader, it effectually checks commercial enterprise, without affording any compensation by personal security, or by a just and energetic rule which might render the property of the subject secure. That trade of any kind has survived the disadvantages and lawless exactions to which it has been so long subjected, must be attributed to the improvements in other parts of India, where the introduction of European goods, capital, and industry, have been particularly felt; and perhaps a great portion of the success still experienced in trade in Sindh, may be placed to the account of the introduction of that equitable and enlightened system\nof government in other Asiatic countries, which not only benefits the\ndominions in which it prevails, but has a tendency indirectly to\nameliorate the condition of all the states with which a connexion, even\nthough purely commercial, is maintained.\n\nThe principal sea-ports are Kar\u00e1chi and Dh\u00e1r\u00e1ja. The former is\na very ancient town, known in the Hind\u00fa p\u00far\u00e1nas by the name of\nR\u00e1mb\u00e1gh, an appellation still commonly in use. It lies in lat. 24\u00b0 51'\nN., and long. 67\u00b0 16' E. The town is situated on a creek at the\nhead of a bay formed by Cape Monze, and carries on a brisk trade\nwith Bombay, Malabar, and Arabia. The entrance of the creek or\nharbour is narrow, and, at low water, has only one foot and a-half\nwater on the bar, but, at spring-tides, vessels of 400 tons find shelter\nhere from September to May. The bay cannot be approached at\nother seasons without danger. Kar\u00e1chi originally belonged to an inde-\npendent chief in Makr\u00e1n, but was conquered by the Sindhians. The\nrevenues fall short of a lak of rupees per annum; but under a wise\nand well-regulated government, there is little doubt that they might\nbe considerably increased. The description of vessels used here in\nthe trade is chiefly the D'hinj\u00ed, which is an awkward boat of from\nfifty to two hundred tons' burden, and can only keep the sea during\nthe favourable monsoon, as it runs the risk of foundering should it\nmeet with bad weather.\n\nDh\u00e1r\u00e1ja is the sea-port of T'hatta, and is the same as L\u00e1ribandar\nthe site of which town is near the present Dh\u00e1r\u00e1ja. This place is\nsituated about twenty miles up the large mouth of the Indus, and is\nconveniently situated for trade. It is only within these few years that\nDh\u00e1r\u00e1ja has superseded Sh\u00e1hbandar, which has been subject to vicissi-\ntudes, owing to the fickleness of the stream.\n\nThe chief articles exported from Sindh of its own produce are\ngrain, particularly rice; hides, shark-fins, saltpetre, potash, assafetida,\ncotton and silk cloths, horses, and indigo. Its imports are coco-nuts,\ndates, iron, tin, lead, and copper; but a particular list of the articles\nforming the trade of Sindh will be given in a table of the appendix.*\n\nThe commerce by sea is almost exclusively carried on by Hind\u00fas of\nthe Bh\u00e1tti and L\u00f3h\u00e1nn\u00e1 castes, both of which are ancient inhabitants\nof Sindh. There are likewise some Muhammedans called Memans,\nwho participate in the trade in some degree. Inland speculations\nare made indiscriminately by all descriptions of people of the country,\nbesides whom, a numerous body of merchants from M\u00falt\u00e1n, called\nM\u00falt\u00e1n\u00eds, are settled in Sindh, where their command of money gives\n\n* This appendix, owing to some mistake, did not accompany the paper.\u2014Ed.\nrevolution of authorities, caused more attention to be directed to the military than to the civil branches of policy. In Mirza Isa Khan the industrious of all classes and descriptions found a warm friend and protector; and the Mirza himself engaged deeply in commerce, both before and subsequent to his elevation to the rank of a sovereign. It was this Mirza who improved and regulated the sea-ports; and he spared no expense or trouble to render the conveyance of goods through his dominions safe and easy.\n\nThe tyranny and frenzy of Mohammed Khan, followed, as they shortly were, by the annexation of Sind to the crown of Delhi, were injurious to the prosperity of the province. From the tyranny of the former, the lives of his subjects were never safe; and the latter gave rise to a contest which, short as it was, was productive of great distress to the country, and was succeeded by an annual change of wabadors, who farmed the revenue, and possessed exclusive authority in every department of the government; while their views and dispositions probably assimilated in no respect but in that of amassing wealth,\u2014circumstances which must of necessity have been inimical to industry and commerce, particularly so to the safe and profitable employment of capital. When the Kolkhas commerce regained, in some degree, its former importance; for an English factory was established there, and the two parties were productive of mutual advantages, and the natives were encouraged, capable of improving its management. But the narrow-minded disposition of the wabadors, endangering the safety of the country, and the establishment, put an end to the factory, which was withdrawn; and it was not until the present consequence of an open war.\n\nThe policy of the wabadors was to destroy this branch of commerce, and to make a most dangerous enemy of the people. The affair proceeded to such a pitch of commercial importance, that the wabadors, for security, sent a party of troops to protect the property of the merchants. This party was dispersed by the natives, who, in their subordination, had no idea of the consequences of their actions. The wabadors, in their indignant feelings, ordered the destruction of the property of the merchants, and the accuser of the wabadors.\nrevolution of authority military than to the c knis the industriou friend and protector commerce, both be of a sovereign.

The present Amir's are in the habit of purchasing vast quantities of grain, which, with the government's share, in cases where the revenues are not farmed at an advanced rate; a practice of which the evil consequences are severely felt; more particularly as the custom originates in avarice, and the purchase-money is turned into gold or jewels, which are deposited in the treasuries of the different members of the government, and, consequently, as these are looked on as private hordes, the money is totally withdrawn from circulation.\n\nIn the appendix will be found a table exhibiting the names of districts with their respective revenues, both of the land and in other branches; which table, although it was framed from the statements of men who had themselves farmed many of the districts, may be perhaps a little in excess of the actual produce, as it refers to a period a few years prior to the present time; and there is reason to believe that the revenues of Sindh are rather on the decrease than otherwise.\n\nIn the table alluded to, it will be seen that the total revenue available to the Haider\u00e1b\u00e1d rulers, including those of M\u00edrs Sohr\u00e1b, Th\u00e1sra, and others of the T\u00e1lp\u00fara family, does not amount to half a crore of rupees. To this amount, however, must be added the produce of lands held in j\u00e1ghir by chieftains for the support of feudal followers, of which the whole military force of Sindh is composed, as also the lands of whole tribes of Zemind\u00e1rs, who have held their patrimonies from the earliest ages, and who pay nothing whatever, either in money or service, to the government of the country.\n\nThere still remains to be taken into consideration the lands and other sources of revenue alienated for the support of Saiyids and other religious establishments attached to the Muhammedan faith. The amount of these there is no possibility of ascertaining correctly; but no country in Asia can boast of a like number of ecclesiastical establishments. Perhaps it would not be beyond the truth if the revenue appropriated to these purposes was calculated at one-third of what is enjoyed by the government. Some of these settlements are coeval with the introduction of Isl\u00e1mism, and nearly all the rest are prior to the fourth century of that era. Almost the whole of the Arabs who first entered Sindh received grants of land; and although it is recorded that few of the families of rank then settled in this province, yet vast numbers appear to have afterwards visited and settled in it, when\nthem a place of the first rank. They are the principal bankers, and possess a good deal of influence both with government and with the people. These M\u00falt\u00e1n\u00eds carry on a trade with Kab\u00fal, Kandah\u00e1r, Kuel\u00e1t, M\u00falt\u00e1n, and Bah\u00e1malp\u00far, both by the river and by land carriage; and by them indeed are consumed the imports which would otherwise find no sale in the province.\n\nThere is little doubt but that the commerce of Sindh is capable of being increased to a great extent. The natural advantages it possesses are very important, particularly as regards the circulation of European goods. Hence lies a short and easy route to the northern countries of India and Persia, the climate of which, as well as the manners and usages of the inhabitants, approach nearest those of Europe, and, of course, their respective necessaries and wants resemble each other more than those of Europe and southern India. The wretched governments of the district provinces here alluded to, however, preclude the hope that the state of security, comfort, and confidence, so requisite to the encouragement of trade, can for a long time be established.\n\nThe revenues of Sindh are differently collected in the different districts. In some, particularly in those of the southern parts, they are realised in kind, in others by jamm\u00fa, or land rent. In general irrigated lands are rented, whilst those which yield three crops with the seasons, pay in kind a third, a fourth, and even so little as the fifth of their produce, according to a valuation made on the grounds. These rates are regulated by the valuation of labour, or by natural obstacles (in the land) to agriculture. Irrigated land is rented from the government generally at the following rates:\n\n| Item       | Rate per annum |\n|------------|----------------|\n| Sugar cane | rupees 12      |\n| Tobacco    | 7\u00bd do.         |\n| Vegetables | 7\u00bd do.         |\n| Opium      | 21 do.         |\n| Indigo     | 80 do.         |\n| Grain      | 6 do.          |\n\nThe big\u00e1 contains a square of about forty paces, with the exception of the indigo big\u00e1, which is twice that extent; and on comparing this assessment with that paid in other parts of India, it will, I believe, be found tolerably moderate. It is, however, merely a nominal value put upon the land; for the collection of the revenues is, in many instances, left to rapacious farmers, who cover their contracts and benefit themselves besides, at the expense of the ryot. Independently of this hardship, it is not uncommon in Sindh for the government to collect vast\nquantities of grain for the supply of troops, when any military expedition is on foot, in which case the rulers make no scruple of seizing a half of the produce of the whole country, leaving the farmer to settle with the cultivator the best way he can. The present \u00c1mir are in the habit of purchasing vast quantities of grain, which, with the government share, in cases where the revenues are not farmed, they deposit in store-rooms, and afterwards retail to their subjects at an advanced price; a practice of which the evil consequences are severely felt; more particularly as the custom originates in avarice, and the purchase-money is turned into gold or jewels, which are deposited in the treasuries of the different members of the government, and, consequently, as these are looked on as private hordes, the money is totally withdrawn from circulation.\n\nIn the appendix will be found a table exhibiting the names of districts with their respective revenues, both of the land and in other branches; which table, although it was framed from the statements of men who had themselves farmed many of the districts, may be perhaps a little in excess of the actual produce, as it refers to a period a few years prior to the present time; and there is reason to believe that the revenues of Sindh are rather on the decrease than otherwise.\n\nIn the table alluded to, it will be seen that the total revenue available to the Haider\u00e1b\u00e1d rulers, including those of M\u00edrs Sohr\u00e1b, Th\u00e1rsa, and others of the Talp\u00fara family, does not amount to half a crore of rupees. To this amount, however, must be added the produce of lands held in j\u00e1ghir by chieftains for the support of feudal followers, of which the whole military force of Sindh is composed, as also the lands of whole tribes of Zemind\u00e1rs, who have held their patrimonies from the earliest ages, and who pay nothing whatever, either in money or service, to the government of the country.\n\nThere still remains to be taken into consideration the lands and other sources of revenue alienated for the support of Saiyids and other religious establishments attached to the Muhammedan faith.

Some of these settlements are coeval with the introduction of Isl\u00e1mism, and nearly all the rest are prior to the fourth century of that era. Almost the whole of the Arabs who first entered Sindh received grants of land; and although it is recorded that few of the families of rank then settled in this province, yet v numbers appear to have afterwards visited and settled in it, v\nthey found themselves respected, and, as being related to the venerated founders of their religion, they derived an ample provision from assisting in its propagation.\n\nBefore an opinion can be hazarded as to the population of a country, it is requisite to possess a much more intimate knowledge of it than any European has yet had an opportunity of acquiring with reference to Sindh. Natives are never in the habit of making particular observations on this subject, so that information derived from them is likely to prove extremely erroneous. The modern capital Haider\u00e1b\u00e1d is said to contain upwards of 30,000 inhabitants, the city of T'hatta not quite 20,000, and Kar\u00e1chi, the principal sea-port and trading town, has a population somewhat less than either. It has been a very frequent and natural remark, that whilst we observe the banks of all the large rivers in the old continents thickly studded with cities, towns, or villages, those of the Indus are observed to be, in all maps, nearly destitute of inhabitants; but although there are few or no cities, or even towns or villages, immediately on the banks of the river, it is not therefore to be taken for granted that they are uninhabited. The map prefixed to this work will, I believe, shew a variety of small towns and villages that have never before been known to exist; and it should be further remarked, that the habits and manners of the people in many parts of Sindh are inimical to living in towns. The nature of the banks of the Indus, the uncertainty of the position of its stream, and the danger occurring annually and throughout its whole course, from its rise, are circumstances which are in a manner peculiar to this river, at least to the extent in which they are there found to exist, and which will account for the thinness of the population on its banks.\n\nAny attempt to calculate the population of Sindh, without some reasonable data, which we do not possess, would be equally vain and fruitless; but though generally speaking I am inclined to consider this province, as below the medium standard of Indian population, it is, nevertheless, surprising that a country in which the necessaries of life are more easily procured than in any other part of India, should send forth such multitudes of adventurers in every profession, and contain that vast number of beggars, for which it is so remarkable. In those parts of the country inhabited by Bell\u00faches, or by the various erratic, or pastoral tribes of Samm\u00e1s, the population, as might be expected, is certainly scanty; but in other situations, perhaps, Sindh is not more deficient than most countries of India.\n\nThe people of Sindh are, for the most part, a strong and hardy race of men, with a complexion similar to that of the natives of western India. The higher ranks are corpulent to a proverb; and\nthis habit of body is here even more than in other Asiatic countries looked up to as no less adding to the respectability than to the beauty of its possessor. Those, therefore, who are wealthy, or of consequence in the scale of society, encourage this tendency to corpulency, by indolence and full diet, and every other means in their power. The Bell\u00faches and many of the Samm\u00e1 tribes have, in a remarkable degree, those features commonly called Jewish, and which are strikingly different from those of the other inhabitants. An oval contour of face, aquiline nose, arched eyebrows, and high forehead, with expressive eyes, are the characteristic features of the Sindhians above alluded to. The people of both sexes are certainly extremely handsome, if a judgment can be formed from the opinions of several gentlemen who have visited the country, and from an acquaintance with the people on the immediate borders of Sindh, who are chiefly natives of that country.\n\nThe Hind\u00fas who reside in Sindh have much the same countenance as their brethren who inhabit the towns in the western coast of India, but they are generally more filthy in their clothes and persons than the latter, as will be afterwards more particularly mentioned.\n\nThere are here, as in other Asiatic countries, two descriptions of inhabitants, totally differing from each other in character; the military part of the population, and those who follow trade or agriculture. The military, including the whole of those Bell\u00fache tribes which have descended into Sindh, together with the various ancient Zemindars now known under different denominations, are, as a race of men, jealous, proud, knavish, and mean. They are, however, remarkable for a fund of good nature in their disposition, which, in the low and uneducated classes, approaches to silliness or stupidity. It may, however, be fairly questioned whether this seeming easiness of temper does not originate in a slowness of perception and an unsusceptible turn of mind rather than in any inherent quality, for if once irritated, the Sindhian remains irascible and unforgiving. The meanness and knavery of this class of men are proverbial; and so strong and natural is their disposition to theft, that those who are otherwise respectable in character and situation, do not hesitate to practise the profession of a night robber; or to lay aside their dress, and with a wallet on their shoulder, make a circuit of many miles for the sake of asking alms. A proper baling is inherent in the Sindh soldier, and to no loss of character accrues.\n\nThe merchant of a different race of j\nindolent, and seem to think of nothing but their professions. They neglect their persons and their comforts for activity in business, in the transaction of which, however, they are not remarkable for fair dealing; but they are enterprising in trade, and bear the exactions and tyranny of oppressive governors without complaint.\n\nWith most, if not all of the vices common to Asiatics, the Sindhians appear to possess few or none of their virtues. The ignorance in which the greater part of the population is involved surpasses what can well be imagined. There assuredly does not exist on the face of the earth a people, among whom the use of letters is known, where so little attention is paid to the acquirement of learning; and that of a religious kind is confined to the Saiyids and Pirzadehs, whose knowledge, in nine cases out of ten, extends no further than the repetition of a few common prayers and ayits from the Kor\u00e1n.\n\nWith the irignorance, their bigotry, arrogance, and self-pride keep equal pace; and an intelligent gentleman, Mr. N. Crow, to whom a long residence in Sindh gave abundance of opportunities for forming a just opinion on this subject, has truly and expressively observed, that in Sindh there is no zeal but in propagating the faith \u2014 no spirit but in celebrating the Ede\u2014no liberality but in feeding lazy Saiyids\u2014and no taste but in ornamenting old tombs. Such a picture as is here displayed in a few words, affords a just insight into the character of the Muhammedans, and into the state of society. They are certainly the most bigoted, the most self-sufficient, and the most ignorant people on record.\n\nThe Sindhian, among other bad qualities, is accused of treachery, at least as a national vice. On the contrary, although there are frequent instances of assassination, which is common to all military governments in a state little above barbarism, the natives of this country are nevertheless much less addicted to this detestable practice than their neighbours on the north and on the east. They have (in particular the Bell\u00fache tribes) a high idea of the duties of hospitality, the rights of which are rarely infringed by those who have not been corrupted by ambitious temptations, or who have not otherwise lost their original manners, by mixing in the intrigues of courts and struggles for power and place. The Bell\u00faches, likewise, have the highest respect for their females, who possess much influence over their mind and actions. Their adherence to any agreement or stipulation to which their women are parties may be implicitly relied on, and more confidence may be safely placed on engagements of this kind than if they had been sworn to on the Kor\u00e1n.\nON THE COUNTRY OF SINDH.\n\nNo Asiatic country, in proportion to the number of its population, sends forth so many needy vagrants as Sindh. All the provinces around it are overrun with a wandering and idle race of men, alternately soldiers, beggars, and thieves, who being too indolent to labour for a scanty subsistence (which in the centre of a most productive country appears unaccountably to be the lot of the greater portion of its inhabitants), prefer the uncertain but more congenial proceeds of the employment above-mentioned, and that even in foreign countries. As mercenaries in the pay of the western countries of India, the Sindhian holds the next place to the Arab, a race of men who have of late years rendered themselves remarkable for a continued though unintentional, and brave though unfortunate, opposition to the English troops throughout those territories.\n\nThe Sindh soldier is entertained by the native powers at the rate of from six to ten rupees per month. He is individually brave, but inferior to the Arab in coolness in action; neither does he possess that sense of honour which is manifested by the Indian soldier. The Sindhian is bold in his attack, but feels less hesitation in turning his back than almost any other man who carries arms. He differs much from the Arab in his absurd boasting, and equally so in the irregularity and meanness of his conduct, being under none of those severe and orderly regulations which exist among the Arab troops, and which have doubtless tended to inspire the Indians with so high an opinion of the military powers of this class of men.\n\nThe military tribes in Sindh are, however, generally expert marksmen, and are trained to the use of the matchlock from their youth, which gives them a fondness that is national for feats of arms. They consider the sabre indeed as the national weapon, but although the swords of Sindh are in high repute, I suspect that the country would derive little military renown if reduced to depend upon that arm. Fire-arms are undoubtedly the natural and most efficient power of Sindh; and it is ridiculous pride and ostentation that induces this nation to hold out that its sabre is irresistible. As soldiers, however, they are remarkably peaceable, faithful, and persevering; but are totally destitute of those ideas of dignity which generally accompany the military character, and hesitate not to steal in their own camp when they can do so with impunity. It will be almost possible to enumerate the various tribes of Sindh, there are numerous beyond belief, and are divided and subdivided into which are known by distinct names. They are, likewise, alike; and, considered as a whole, in customs or religion.\nThe people who live on the Indus, or on the plains near that river, are not so far from those now described. Their lives are...\ndevoted to agriculture and to trade, and their habitations are of course more fixed and in larger societies, although in many parts they are frequently found in small detached bodies on the borders of their fields. In the west parts of the delta, and to the north-west of Thatta, the J\u0101g\u016bts, as a tribe of Bell\u016bches, live in huts of reeds, which are moveable at pleasure, and so well and compactly made as to resist all kinds of weather. Those who live in this way are called by the Sindhians the Pak'hir\u0101ja, which, I believe, signifies as much as \"kings of the wilds.\"\n\nThe food of the greatest portion of the natives of Sindh is fish and rice, although there are some particular sects whose customs do not admit of fish as an article of food. These are, however, very few, and confined to a very small number of Br\u0101hmans and Bh\u0101ttias, the generality of both of whom do not scruple to eat fish. The sweet potato forms no inconsiderable part of the food of the people. It is not a pleasant vegetable, but is very cheap and reckoned a nourishing root.\n\nThe Hind\u016b part of society in Sindh still adhering to their original religion and manners is composed of Bh\u0101ttias, L\u014dh\u0101nnas, with their respective g\u016br\u016bs or priests, and the Pokarna and S\u016brsat Br\u0101hmans. The Bh\u0101ttias and L\u014dh\u0101nnas are mentioned at the time of the Arabian conquest as numerous races of people. These castes of men were exclusively natives of Sindh, until the spirit of trade and speculation scattered them, and they now are to be found all over western India and Arabia. The Bh\u0101ttia of Sindh is not, by the rules of his caste, restricted to vegetable diet, and fish has been always an article of his food; but his brethren who have migrated to India having all adopted the worship of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and assumed the cleanliness of person and strictness in diet peculiar to this sect, many of those remaining in Sindh have, in the same respects, deviated from their original customs.\n\nThe L\u014dw\u0101nnas or L\u014dh\u0101nnas compose the great body of Hind\u016bs in Sindh, where they follow the meanest modes of gaining subsistence, and rise to the highest offices under the government. Those of them who are attached to the chiefs and sovereigns are compelled to dress in the Muhammedan style, and to appear particularly clean; but others are so remarkably the opposite, that \"as dirty as a Sindhi L\u014dw\u0101nna\" is a common expression. Both Bh\u0101ttias and L\u014dw\u0101nnas wear the Br\u0101hman's string and the Musalm\u00e1n's beard; at least the latter is common, although some affect to shave it. Those in the service of government are compelled to wear the beard, and much\nattention is bestowed upon it, as is generally the case wherever the beard is worn. The L\u00f3w\u00e1nnna customs admit of polygamy, of their females contracting second marriage engagements, and of divorce from that state. Those of the Bh\u00e1ttias do not. The S\u00e1rsat Br\u00e1hman is the priest of the L\u00f3w\u00e1nnas, and differs very little from the people of that caste. He eats fish and flesh, drinks spirituous liquors, and lives upon his receipts at the marriages, births, and deaths of his followers. They worship the Hind\u00fa goddesses in particular; and have many small pagodas, dedicated to the worship of the ocean, or rather the river Indus, for a pot of fresh water is indispensable in the ceremonies of worship. The P\u00f3kharna Br\u00e1hmans are the original priests of the Bh\u00e1ttias, and are somewhat more Hind\u00fa in reality than the S\u00e1rsat, although still inferior in that respect to their Indian disciples.\n\nThe language of Sindh is a written language, and has a character peculiar to itself. It is written from left to right, and has other signs of its Indian origin. The character is easily and expeditiously formed, and the letters run much into each other. To a cursory observer the Sindhi approaches nearer to the Malabar character than any other I have seen; but on breaking up the letters and examining them they have no resemblance. In the province there are two distinct languages. The first and original is the Sindhi, the other the Bell\u00fachi, which can scarcely be called a written tongue, although it is commonly met with in the Arabic character. The Sindhi, as I have said, is a written tongue, and seems to me, from the little acquaintance I have with it, to be a branch of the Sanskrit stock, which has supplied India with languages. That it is of Sanskrit origin, I advance on the opinion of scholars of the country; and on the same authority I may state, that the Sindhi has fewer modern innovations and a greater number of Sanskrit words than the Gujar\u00e1ti, which is a pure Hind\u00fa dialect. There is some affinity between the two\u2014at least the radicals of words are alike, though the entire words have no resemblance. There is undoubtedly, however, a great portion of Panj\u00e1bi in the Sindhi; and, in fact, it is by many considered as only a dialect of that language.\n\nThe Sindhi is the language used by the Hind\u00fa inhabitants, and, indeed, by the mass of the population of Sindh Proper, those of the southern desert, and, with a little variation, by the Jh\u00e1rej\u00e1s of Cutch. It is worthy of remark, that the Jh\u00e1rej\u00e1s, Bh\u00e1ttias, L\u00f3w\u00e1nnas, and other Sindhi tribes now inhabiting Cutch, have brought with them their language, which they still continue to speak in that country; but the Gujar\u00e1ti, which is spoken by the Abirs, Ch\u00e1ras, and shepherds, who,\nnot the aborigines, are certainly many centuries prior to the others, inhabitants of Cutch, has maintained its superiority, and continues to be the only written tongue in the province.\n\nThe Bell\u00fache is spoken by the different tribes of that name, who are, in fact, foreigners to Sindh. Their language appears to be a mixture of Arabic, Persian, Panjabi, and Sanskrit, and is spoken by them in various dialects. I subjoin in the appendix the numerals, with a few of the most common words both of the Sindhi and Bell\u00fachi, which have a strong resemblance to each other.\n\nUnder the Kalh\u00f3ra dynasty the government of Sindh was patriarchal. Every Muhammedan, from his religious principles, obeyed the sovereign; and the Hind\u00fa, at all times ready to imbibe every superstition, whether of his own or another faith, became, from the same cause, attached to his rule. A course of conduct replete with treachery, violence, and folly, alienated the affections of many of the military tribes from the later princes of this race, and ultimately gave rise to the revolution which placed the present T\u00e1lp\u00fara family on the throne.\n\nThe system of government pursued by this family is purely military, and, when examined, appears extremely superficial and temporary. All their views are directed to the accumulation of wealth, which they acquire by extortion and cruelty, and have thus reduced the revenues by one-third within the last thirty years. The districts are generally farmed to revenue officers, who are compelled to levy from the subject, over and above the fair dues of the public, a sum to indemnify themselves for the fine which their masters frequently impose.*\n\nThe \u00c1mir holds courts of justice in their own presence every Friday; but they are rendered subordinate to the acquisition of money, both plaintiff and defendant being made to pay to the utmost extent of their means. There are, however, some singular instances of disinterested justice afforded by these venal judges towards foreigners against natives of Sindh, and the excellence of the government which existed under the authority of M\u00edr Gh\u00f3l\u00e1m Ali is frequently spoken of. The power of life and death is centred in two of the principal chiefs and governors only, and other officers send their prisoners to their presence.\n\nAs the government exists at present, it must be considered, in the true sense of the appellation, a military despotism; and although the annals of Asiatic countries seldom record any other kind of rule, yet\n\n* I am acqu and was plunde\n\na respectable L\u00f3z\u00e1na who farmed some of the districts, and compelled to become Muhammedan.\nit may be fairly questioned if any instance of such a despotic government is to be met with in their pages. The light in which the T\u00e1lp\u00faras stand, as usurpers of a popular government, may, perhaps, be the cause of their tenacity of a military reputation; and to this circumstance, and to the divided state of the reigning family in Kanduh\u00e1r, alone is to be attributed the success of the T\u00e1lp\u00faras in holding the supreme authority for so long a time. That they do not possess the good wishes of the inhabitants, and that their rule has always been in a very precarious state, is universally allowed; and that they themselves are aware of the circumstance may be inferred, as well from the steadiness with which they persevere in destroying the revenues of the province, for the sake of accumulating private wealth, as from the extraordinary favours conferred on the military tribes at the expense of their other subjects, and contrary to the rules of a good and systematic government.\n\nWe have seen that the deposed race of sovereigns possessed a double tie upon the affections of the natives of Sindh. The latter were attached to the Kalh\u00f3ras, as a family which long held the sway, and under whose guidance the province had attained a considerable degree of prosperity. The sacred stock from which these chiefs were descended, and the respect and reverence which were their due from the Muhammedan part of their population, likewise weighed in their favour. The severe and illiberal treatment which the Hind\u00fas experienced under a few of the latter princes of the family may be considered as an obstacle to the eventual restoration of the Kalh\u00f3ras to the throne; but as the Hind\u00fas almost exclusively follow the peaceable walks of life, their voice would not be heard among a nation of armed men. It is also remarkable how little the people of Asiatic countries have to do in the revolutions of their governments. They are never guided by any great and common impulse of feeling, and take no part in events the most interesting and important to their country and their own prosperity. Thinking not of consequences beyond a day, they follow blindly, like slaves, whoever may be able to afford them a momentary gratification, by pay or plunder.\n\nIf, what is not probable, it should ever occur that an organised attempt were made by a Kalh\u00f3ra to recover the authority of the family, it could hardly fail of success. The Muhammedan families are, many of them, jealous of the success of a tribe with which they consider themselves as on an equality in every respect; whilst the treatment of every caste and description of natives has been more harsh and inconsiderate than has been their lot under any other of the various forms of government to which Sindh has been subjected.\nThe western Hind\u00fa has for many centuries known no other government but that of Isl\u00e1m. Shut out from intercourse with their Indian brethren, and surrounded by Musalm\u00e1ns, the Hind\u00fas of Sindh have lost those fine feelings of caste and distinction which characterise the same race elsewhere; for in the worst of times, and under the most bigoted Muhammedan sovereigns, there has always been some favoured spot, some happy corner, where the principles of Hind\u00fa government have been maintained, and the prejudices of religion and the caste kept warmly alive. Hence there have, in the course of centuries, occasionally burst forth active and ambitious individuals, who have laid the foundations of powerful and independent states, or restored the vital spark to those which were languishing under the yoke of Isl\u00e1m.\n\nHow different is the picture which Sindh presents! In the course of a thousand years there is not an instance of a Hind\u00fa having attempted to rescue himself or fellow-countrymen from a state of the vilest slavery; nor, since the fall of the Hind\u00fa dynasty, has any aboriginal native of the province raised himself to independence, if we except the Samm\u00e1 family, who had, however, changed their religion before they succeeded to sovereignty.\n\nThe original Hind\u00fa tribes who were lords of the soil are all now ranged under the faith of Muhammed, or have become assimilated to his followers; and the peculiar custom of portions of tribes becoming proselytes to Isl\u00e1m, but retaining the name, dress, and, in some measure, the manners and prejudices of their origin, tended much to the removal of the distinction which religion had established.\n\nBranches of the same family were at the same time professing different religious tenets, and maintaining their accustomed familiarity of intercourse. Muhammedan converts retained Hind\u00fa names, and Hind\u00fas openly avowed their belief in and respect for the Muhammedan faith. In such a state of society, and where such manners prevailed, it cannot be doubted but that there must have been a tendency to the extinction of all feeling in regard to difference of religion and caste. That such has been the result, the present state of Hind\u00fatism in Sindh and the south-west part of India, among the who are original natives of the country, bears ample testimony.\n\nA short digression was necessary to shew, that, if even the Hind\u00fa population had the power to influence the fate of the of Sindh, it would not be guided in any degree by motives and that the restoration of the Kalh\u00f3ras would not be feelings derived from that quarter.\n\nwhat surprised to discover, that notwithstanding the\nunpopular government of the T\u00e1lp\u00faras, they have few or no prejudices against those who profess a different faith. Hind\u00fas possess the confidence of the rulers, equally, and perhaps in a greater degree than do the followers of Muhammed; and they compose the most valuable and trustworthy part of their establishment, as officers and servants. In Sindh, also, the Sh\u00ed\u00e1 and the Sunn\u00ed among the Musalm\u00e1ns are equally protected. The chiefs themselves adhere to the doctrines of the former sect, whilst those of the Sunn\u00ed are more prevalent in the province.\n\nAlthough the Am\u00edrs are thus liberal towards those who worship idols, they are, nevertheless, eager in making converts to the true faith, and avail themselves of the smallest opening or colouring to compel the poorer class of inhabitants to conform to it. If an unfortunate Low\u00e1nn\u00e1 happens to say to a Musalm\u00e1n, \"You are my brother,\" or \"I will accompany you on your journey,\" he is liable to feel the folly of his cordiality in circumcision. Still, however, no advantage is taken of their difference in religion to the detriment of their persons or property. The misfortunes which marked the latter years of their predecessors in power may have afforded the T\u00e1lp\u00faras a lesson on the score of the impartiality which governments owe to their subjects; or the more powerful consideration of pecuniary benefit may have dictated toleration as the best policy.\n\nIn other respects, the oppression and exorbitant exactions of these governors are the subject of well-founded and universal discontent. Their avarice is so unbounded, and so illegally gratified, as to prove an effectual check to trade and manufacture: both of which are fast declining, and must soon reach the lowest ebb, if not saved by a timely revolution. The immediate produce of this short-sighted policy has been enormous; but the increase must naturally become every year less with the deficiency of revenue. It is well ascertained that the Am\u00edrs had deposited many crores of their accumulated wealth in their fortresses within the great desert, where it was long considered safe from the attempts of the northern invaders, who constantly threatened Sindh with their inroads. The rapid strides of the British arms, however, towards their eastern frontier, have alarmed them for their power as well as treasure. The latter was some years ago removed to a position in the mountains to the north-west of Haider\u00e1b\u00e1d, where a fort* is now nearly completed, which they consider, from its natural and artificial defences, as impregnable. The treasure is all in gold and jewels, into which the annual revenues are quickly\n\n* Ranni is the name of the place alluded to.\ntransformed and deposited in their hoard, to the great injury of the trade and industry of the country.\n\nThe quantity of specie and bullion thus annually subtracted from the circulating medium, and, indeed, the capital of the country, it would be difficult exactly to calculate; but if we refer to the revenue of the government, and to the schedule of the expenses of the state, as given in the Appendix, we shall find that the latter are uncommonly small in comparison, and it is therefore probable that the sums amassed are very considerable.\n\nThe policy of the Amirs appears to be equally simple and ridiculous. Their principal anxiety is to keep aloof from intercourse with foreigners, whom they treat with a jealousy and suspicion approaching to insult. By these means they expect to conceal the resources of the country and the disposition of its inhabitants, and by an overbearing and haughty behaviour they expect to impress strangers with a high opinion of their rank and power. Never was there such an erroneous line of policy adopted; for, in the first place, their jealousy invites attention and inquiry, when their threats are at once discovered to be empty boasting, and are contradicted by the personal fears of the Amirs, who have so little command over their feelings that they have become notorious far beyond the limits of their kingdom. The treasure that has been collected is stated by these chiefs to be intended for the public use, in cases of exigent danger from foreign enemies. But it is the general belief, that they are so sensible of the feeble nature of their authority, that it is their intention to ship their riches for Muscat in case of any serious threat or invasion of an enemy.\n\nNo foreign power has excited such uneasiness in the breasts of the Amirs as the British, of whom they have always been extremely suspicious; but the events which have occurred within the last fifteen years have presented to them a nation hitherto only partially known in the capacity of conquerors of princes and nations, approaching with rapid strides in all directions towards their frontier, and have created a sensation which these boasters cannot conceal. These sentiments of fear and suspicion have on frequent occasions been made evident; but since the British government was forced by circumstances to support an influence in Cutch, they have known no bounds. It is well ascertained that they have long since ceased to fear or respect the authority of the King of Kandah\u00e1r; yet in the moment of alarm, and on the advance of an English army into Cutch, the Amirs cunningly endeavoured, by false and exaggerated representations, to urge the already distracted councils of the north into a dispute with our government solely to satisfy their own fears, and at\nthe same time intrigued with the petty states of Cutch to renounce\nthe friendship of that power, which had only a few months previously\ncalled them into existence.\n\nAs the Amirs certainly contemplated the probability of an attempt\non the part of some foreign power to dispossess them of Sindh, it\nperhaps may not be considered irrelevant to offer a few observations\non the means which they possess of repelling such an attack, if made.\nThese, however, I propose to offer in as concise a manner as the sub-\nject will admit, since it possesses but little interest with the generality\nof readers.\n\nThe military force of the Amirs of Sindh is composed of levies from\nthe Muhammedan tribes, which are more remarkable for their numbers\nand variety than for their prowess in war. These tribes are subject to\nchieftains of the same family, holding a certain quantity of land for\nthe support of those followers who reside upon it. The Jaghirs are\nexposed to change with the pleasure of the Amirs, who frequently\nmake transfers annually, and in some cases not for ten years. The\nnames of the soldiers belonging to the chieftains, at least those of the\nBelluchis, are registered with their descent, which is carefully pre-\nserved as a mark of distinction among that caste of people; by which\nmeans, if any of them are discharged by the Jaghirdar, they have\nonly to complain to the Darbar, which redresses their grievances; and\nat the same time this usage enables them to check the abuses conse-\nquent on the system of never mustering their retainers.\n\nThe Jaghirdars seldom or never pay their followers in cash, but\neach man has a certain quantity of grain allotted to him, which he\nreceives at the different periods of harvest. Under the Kalhora go-\nvernment a bad principle existed of Jaghirdars, who were the heads\nof different military tribes, viz. the Talpiras, Jaquias, Leckis, and\nKhosabs, having all the military force of the state included under\ntheir respective banners. The Talpiras, however, have adopted\nanother, and better system; for they cautiously prohibit any excessive\nJaghir, and no Sirdar of that description has now more than a thou-\nsand or twelve hundred followers. The Khosabs are excluded entirely,\nas are the Leckis, from their supposed attachment to the Kalhoras;\nand the number of Jaghirs retained as servants are reduced to an\nofficer and a hundred or two hundred men, with three hundred of\nthe tribe of Namurdhi, of both of which the Talpiras are exceedingly\njealous.\n\nThe number of household troops, which compose the only force on\npermanent duty, does not exceed four thousand men. They are\nartered in Haiderabad; and about half the number are mounted\non government horses. Their duty is to attend the Amirs, both as servants and soldiers. They are paid half-yearly, and receive principally grain in lieu of wages.\n\nOn occasions of necessity, when an army is requisite, orders are despatched throughout the province for the J\u0101ghird\u0101rs to assemble at stated places and periods, with their armed followers. Three days are sufficient to spread the intelligence, and fifteen to effect the assembly of about thirty-five thousand men; two-thirds and upwards of which are cavalry. The country people boast that the Sindh\u012b levies amount to a hundred thousand; but there is every reason to believe that, including twelve thousand of M\u012br S\u0101hr\u0101s and five thousand of M\u012br Th\u0101r\u0101s, who are not federals of Haider\u00e1b\u0101d, the state of Sindh could not levy above fifty or fifty-five thousand fighting men.\n\nThis military assembly is composed of different tribes of Muhammedans amounting to several hundreds, but generally commanded by Bell\u016bchis, and in particular by T\u0101lp\u016bras, in whom the Amirs naturally confide, and whom they have until lately favoured to the injury of all their other subjects. The troops are armed with swords and shields, and matchlocks; and, independent of the established allowances from their immediate chief, they receive from the Amir\u2019s treasury each foot-soldier three Dohr\u0101s, and each horseman double that sum per day, as long as they are employed. The Sird\u0101rs also receive a daily allowance correspondent with the rank which they hold in the list of officers. The artillery of the Sindh\u012bs is notoriously wretched\u2014they seldom have more than three or four guns with the army; and as this powerful arm is looked down upon by these soldiers, the equipments of these few pieces are uncommonly bad.\n\nThe cavalry are mounted on various descriptions of horse. The tatt\u016b, or pony, is, however, the most common. Numbers are seen on mules; and from the Amir to the beggar a camel is in use. The horses, even of the best breeds, are not adapted to form good cavalry, for they are generally heavy in hand\u2014a fault which is increased to such a degree by the ambling pace to which they are universally trained, as to render it difficult to urge them to a gallop. Their matchlock-men are excellent, and, as before observed, are trained to the use of this weapon from their infancy.\n\nThe pay of a Sindh\u012b soldier, calculating on the rate at which he receives grain, may amount to two and a half rupees per month, or perhaps a trifle more, with the additional allowance already mentioned, when on actual service. His food when at home has before been described; and when abroad he still adheres to a simple diet.\n\nThe foregoing cursory remarks will suffice to effort\ncould be made by the military resources of Sindh; and that even admitting that the rulers were capable of bringing into the field the numbers of which they boast, the system by which they are organised would nevertheless prohibit any vigorous military measures. The feudal services of the most warlike nations in the world have been found calculated only to check or quell the intestine broils which they themselves create, and have always been deficient when opposed to an army organised like those of modern times. They are badly armed; are without order or discipline; and constantly disperse on suffering a defeat, however trivial.\n\nUnlike other countries, Sindh has few or no fortified places, the attack of which might retard the motions of an invading army. The few forts that are to be met with are extremely insignificant; and although there are some strong natural positions on the western bank of the Indus, it has never been the policy of the government in such cases to defend them; for to do so, would still leave the fertile country an easy prey to the enemy. The custom hitherto has been for the people of Sindh to fly with their property to the desert, where they remain in perfect safety, under the protection of the desert tribes, whose hospitality has frequently been put to a severe test, but has never failed.\n\nIf the danger is very urgent, an order is issued for the destruction of all property, and the Bell\u00fachis and other barbarous tribes commence a system of plunder and rapine among each other on the goods of their neighbours, which is justified on the principle that the enemy might benefit by it, in a public point of view; or at all events, that it is better for friends to plunder their own country, than that it should fall to the lot of foreigners. The history of the country affords abundance of instances of this line of proceeding; and the province has often been overrun, and generally fallen an easy conquest. The devastating system was adopted by the Sunr\u00e1s, when Al\u00e1-ad-d\u00edn invaded Sindh. When Hum\u00e2y\u00fan sought an asylum here, M\u00edrz\u00e1 Sh\u00e1h Husain followed the same plan; and in the attack of the Kh\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n\u00e1n, M\u00edrz\u00e1 J\u00e1n\u00ed Beg reduced the province to the condition of a wilderness, and permitted his capital city to be burnt and sacked by his own subjects. The same policy was frequently adopted by the Kalk\u00f3ras, whose early history is one continued description of flight to the desert and returns to re-occupy the abandoned province.\n\nThe government of Kandah\u00e1r, as it has existed since the time of Ahmed Kh\u00e1n Durr\u00e1n\u00ed, has never been sufficiently united to effect (if it seriously desired it) the conquest of Sindh. If we refer to the Afghan history of this period, we shall find that they have either been engaged in wars of tribes, with dissensions in their royal family,\nor in defending themselves from the attacks of their neighbours. Nevertheless, they appear to have desolated the country on more occasions than one; but have either been bribed by a pecuniary present, or compelled by domestic circumstances, to return, without making a settlement either for themselves or for the unfortunate Kalhora, whose battles they pretended to fight.\n\nOf late years the government of Kandahar has fallen a prey to the ambition of its different members, and to their enemies the Sikhs, now an aspiring nation of soldiers, who are likely to turn their arms against Sindh in the course of a few years; and there cannot be a doubt but that they will obtain an easy conquest, unless the policy of some other powers shall interfere with this system of aggrandisement.\n\nThe British government has, in the course of events, become a neighbour of Sindh, and our possessions extend so near to the borders of the territory of the Amirs, that our frontier is exposed to depredations from their banditti. Much mischief has already been committed by these plunderers; and representations have been made to the Amirs, without succeeding in checking the evil. As the Pindarri hordes have been broken and dispersed in Hindustan by a wise policy, the execution of which was perhaps delayed too long, it is not improbable that some steps may ultimately be taken for the extirpation of the banditti who find an asylum in countries composing part of the Sindh territory. Should such a measure ever be contemplated, and were a war with the Amirs to be the consequence, it ought not to excite any uneasiness. The success of any attack on Sindh cannot be doubted, provided the proper season of the year is chosen. The policy of such a measure is more problematical. In our present situation, we cannot be provided with a better frontier than that which we have in the desert; and the independence of the Jhureja chieftains in Cutch ought to be particularly cherished by us. The only advantage which we can hope to attain, and by far the most important, is by a commercial connexion with Sindh, to which our views should be restricted; unless appearances in European policy should be such as to dictate the propriety of establishing some degree of influence at the court of a state possessed of great resources for the supply and convenience of armies.\nXXVI \u2014 Some Account of the Systems of Law and Police as recognised in the State of Nep\u00e1l by Brian Houghton Hodgson, Esq., M.R.A.S., of the Bengal Civil Service, Resident at the Court of Kat'hmandu, &c., &c.\n\nIntroduction.\n\n[With a view to obtain correct and authentic information on the subject of Nep\u00e1lese law, both in its theoretical principles and practical administration, Mr. Hodgson addressed a series of questions to several individuals who were judged most capable of replying to them in a full and satisfactory manner. Copies of these series of interrogatories, with their respective answers, have been communicated by him to the Royal Asiatic Society (together with a separate paper on crimes and punishments); and the following article has been drawn up from a careful comparison of the whole, excluding as much as possible the repetitions unavoidably occurring, in many instances, in the various answers to any particular question. A reference to the works of Kirkpatrick, Hamilton, and others, will shew how little has hitherto been contributed to the knowledge of Europeans respecting Oriental systems of jurisprudence, as far as regards the kingdom of Nep\u00e1l. It is therefore particularly gratifying to be enabled to produce so complete a view of the subject as has been furnished by Mr. Hodgson, whose perseverance and energy in obtaining an acquaintance with these and other matters hitherto kept sacred from all strangers, are only equalled by the intelligent and liberal manner in which he communicates to the public the information he has acquired.]\n\nON THE LAW AND POLICE OF NEPAL.\n\nQuestion I.\u2014How many courts of law are there at Kat'hmandu? What is the name of each?\n\nAnswer. There are four Nyayasab'has; the first and chief of which is called Ket Linga; the second, Inta Chapli; the third, Taks\u00e1r; and the fourth, Dhansar. [Another answer mentions four additional courts, viz., the Kosi, the Bangya-bit'hak,\u2020 the Daftar Kh\u00e1na, and the Sirk\u00e1r.] In the Kosi, the Sirk\u00e1r itself administers justice.\n\n\u2020 Not called Bharadar Sab'ha, or great council of state.\n\u2021 Not called Kamari Chok.\n\u2020 The government, or its representative.\nThe B\u00e1ngya-bit'h\u00e1k is the general record-office of the fisc, and a separate dit'ha* presides over it. It is also a Mahal-Ad\u00e1lat.\u2020 The K\u00f3t Linga, Inta Chapli, Taks\u00e1r, and Dhans\u00e1r, are the proper Ad\u00e1lats, exercising both civil and criminal jurisdiction. In the Daftar Kh\u00e1na, the disputes of the soldiers relative to the lands assigned them for pay are investigated, and the Chibh\u00e1ndel is a tribunal for the settlement of all disputes relating to houses; neither of these courts possesses criminal jurisdiction; and whatever penal matters may arise out of the cases brought before them are carried to the Inta Chapli. All these Ad\u00e1lats are situated in the city of Kat'hmandu, and within eighty or ninety paces of each other.]\n\nQuestion II.\u2014What are the territorial limits of the jurisdiction of each court?\n\nAnswer.\u2014There are no limits expressly assigned. Any citizen of Kat'hmandu or Bhatg\u00e1on, or any subject dwelling in the provinces, may carry his cause to any court, provincial or superior, that he pleases. [Another answer says, that whencesoever a civil suit comes, and whatever may be its amount, it may be heard in any of the four courts of the capital at the plaintiff's pleasure; but that grave penal cases must be carried to the Inta Chapli.]\n\nQuestion III.\u2014Are the four Ad\u00e1lats of the capital of equal and co-ordinate authority, or how far is one subjected to another?\n\nAnswer.\u2014The other courts of the capital are subject to the K\u00f3t Linga, in which the supreme judicial officer or dit'ha personally presides.\n\nQuestion IV.\u2014Do the courts of the capital always sit, or have they terms and vacations?\n\nAnswer.\u2014They always sit, with the exception of fifteen days in the twelve months; viz. ten days at the Dasahra, and five days at the Dew\u00e1li,\u2020 during which the courts are closed.\n\nQuestion V.\u2014Are the courts of the capital permanently fixed there; or do their judges, or any of them, make circuits, civil or criminal?\n\nAnswer.\u2014They are fixed, nor does any judicial authority of the capital ever quit it. When necessary, the dit'ha sends special judges (bich\u00e1ri) into the provinces.\n\nQuestion VI.\u2014In what case an appeal lie from the supreme or provincial courts to the B\u00e1\n\nAnswer.\u2014If any one is dissatisfied with the decision of the courts\n\n* A superintendent minister &c.\n\u2020 A court for appeals.\n\u2021 Dew\u00e1li is a festival.\nof the capital on his case, he may petition the government, when the bh\u00e1rad\u00e1rs (ministers) assembled in the Kh\u00f3lcha (palace) receive his appeal and finally decide. [Another respondent says: If the matter be grave, and the party, one or other, be dissatisfied with the judgment of the courts of law, he applies first to the premier; and if he fails in obtaining satisfaction from him he then proceeds to the palace gate, and calls out, \"Justice! justice!\" which appeal, when it reaches the r\u00e1j\u00e1's ears, is thus met: four k\u00e1jis, four sird\u00e1rs, four eminent panch-men, one dit'ha, and one b\u00edch\u00e1ri, are assembled together in the palace, and to them the matter is referred, their award being final.\n\nQuestion VII.\u2014Are the bh\u00e1rad\u00e1rs, or ministers, assisted in judicial cases by the chief judicial authorities of the capital, when they hear appeals in the Bh\u00e1rad\u00e1r Sab'h\u00e1?\n\nAnswer.\u2014They are: the dit'ha, the b\u00edch\u00e1ris, and the dharm\u00e1-d'hik\u00e1ri,* sit with the ministers in such cases.\n\nQuestion VIII.\u2014What concern has the dharm\u00e1-d'hik\u00e1ri with the courts of law in civil and penal cases; and of a hundred cases brought before the courts, what number will come in any way under the cognizance of the dharm\u00e1-d'hik\u00e1ri?\n\nAnswer.\u2014Eating with those with whom you ought not to eat; sexual commerce with those between whom it is forbidden; drinking water from the hands of those not entitled to offer it;\u2014in a word, doing anything from negligence, inadvertence, or licentiousness, by which loss of caste is incurred, renders the sinner liable to the censure of the dharm\u00e1-d'hik\u00e1ri. He must pay the fine called G\u00e1o-d\u00e1n to the dharm\u00e1-d'hik\u00e1ri, who will cause him to perform the pr\u00e1yaschitta.+ In such matters only has the dharm\u00e1-d'hik\u00e1ri any concern.\n\nQuestion IX.\u2014Is any pursuer-general or defender-general recognised in the system?\n\nAnswer.\u2014No; none whatever.\n\nQuestion X.\u2014If the prosecutor fail to appear at the trial of an offender confined at his instance, is the offender dismissed, or what course is taken?\n\nAnswer.\u2014The offender is not dismissed but remanded to confinement, and the trial is deferred.\n\nQuestion XI.\u2014What, and how many, provincial courts are there?\n\nAnswer.\u2014For the provinces west of the capital there are two courts constituted by the supreme judicial authority there; that is, the Dit'ha; and the provinces east of the capital have also two courts similarly constituted.\n\n* A high law officer; the chancellor. + See Question XXX.\nQuestion XII.\u2014Is the regular appeal from the provincial courts of justice to the ordinary courts of the capital, or to the bh\u00e1rad\u00e1r sab\u2019h\u00e1?\n\nAnswer.\u2014To the supreme court of the capital, or K\u00f3t-Linga.\n\nQuestion XIII.\u2014Are not the powers of the provincial courts regulated with reference to the rank of the officer who happens to be nominated to the charge of the province? In other words, what are the limits of a provincial court, of a s\u00faba, of a sird\u00e1r, and of a k\u00e1ji?\n\nAnswer.\u2014They are not; whatever may be the rank of the officer commanding in the province for the time being, the authority of the provincial court is always the same. [Another answer states, that generally all grave criminal cases are carried to the Sadr Ad\u00e1lats; and the officer receiving charge of a province has a clause inserted in his commission prohibiting him from exercising judicial authority in certain offences. These are termed Panch-kh\u00e1t;* viz. 1, Br\u00e1hmahatya, or slaying a Br\u00e1hman; 2, Gouhatya, or killing a cow; 3, Str\u00edhatya, or killing a woman; 4, B\u00e1lahatya, or killing children; and 5, Patki, and all unlawful intercourse of the sexes, such as incest, adultery, or whatever involves a loss of caste by the higher party. All penal cases, with the exception of these five, which must be reported for the direction of the sirk\u00e1r, and all civil cases whatsoever, are within the jurisdiction of the provincial authorities.]\n\nQuestion XIV.\u2014When a s\u00faba, sird\u00e1r, or k\u00e1ji, is appointed to the government of a province, does the dharm\u00e1d\u2019hik\u00e1ri of Kat\u2019hmandu send a deputy dharm\u00e1d\u2019hik\u00e1ri with him? or, the dit\u2019ha or bich\u00e1ri of Kat\u2019hmandu send a deputy bich\u00e1ri with him? or, does the provincial governor appoint his own judicial officers, or does he himself administer justice in his own province?\n\nAnswer.\u2014The provincial governor appoints his own judicial authority, called usually foujd\u00e1r, who transacts other business for the governor besides the administration of justice. The foujd\u00e1r\u2019s appointment must, however, be ratified by the darb\u00e1r.\n\nQuestion XV.\u2014What are the names and functions of every officer, from the highest to the lowest, attached to each Sadr and provincial court?\n\nAnswer.\u2014At the capital, one dit\u2019ha for all four courts; for each of them two bich\u00e1ris, one j\u00e1mad\u00e1r, twenty five mah\u00e1nias, and five chapr\u00e1ssis. The bich\u00e1ri, the bich\u00e1ri to the j\u00e1mad\u00e1r; and\n\n* Panch, \u201cfive,\u201d and the Arabic, \u0639\u0634\u0629.\nand mah\u00e1nias, who serve processes, and see that all persons are forthcoming when required for the purposes of justice. Another authority adds the following to the list of officers, after the b\u00edch\u00e1ri, viz. the bahid\u00e1r, araz-beg\u00ed, and two naiki\u00e1. The dit'ha (he says) decides; the b\u00edch\u00e1ri conducts the interrogation of the parties, and ascertains the truth of their statements; the bahid\u00e1r writes the k\u00fail-m\u00e1ma which the b\u00edch\u00e1ri's interrogation has forced from the party in the wrong; the araz-beg\u00ed is the superintendent of the jail, and sheriff or officer who presides over, and is answerable for, executions. The naiki\u00e1s, with their mah\u00e1nias, inflict the k\u00f3r\u00e1* when needed, and they are also subordinate to the araz-beg\u00ed.]\n\nQuestion XVI.\u2014How are the judges and other persons attached to the courts paid? By fees or salary, or both?\n\nAnswer.\u2014By both; they receive salaries from government and take fees also.\n\nQuestion XVII.\u2014Are there separate courts for the cities of P\u00e1tan and Bh\u00e1tg\u00e1on, or do the inhabitants of those places resort to the courts of Kat'hmandu?\n\nAnswer.\u2014There are separate courts for P\u00e1tan and Bh\u00e1tg\u00e1on, one for each city; and each court has the following functionaries attached to it, viz. one dw\u00e1ria, one b\u00edch\u00e1ri, four pradh\u00e1ns and fifty moh\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s. There is an appeal from these courts to the chief court at Kat'hmandu, and important causes are sent by them to that court in the first instance.\n\nQuestion XVIII.\u2014How far, and in what cases, do the Sadr courts use Panch\u00e1yet?\u2014in civil and criminal cases, or in the former only?\n\nAnswer.\u2014Both civil and criminal cases are referred to Panch\u00e1yet, in any or every instance, at the discretion of the court or the wish of the parties. [The answer of another respondent is as follows: With the exception of cases of life destroyed, all matters may be referred to Panch\u00e1yet at the desire of the parties; but cases of assault and battery are not usually referred to Panch\u00e1yet.]\n\nQuestion XIX.\u2014Are the persons composing the Panch\u00e1yet appointed by the parties to the suit, or by the government; or does the government nominate its own members and the government add a casting vote, or how?\n\nAnswer.\u2014Members of the Panch\u00e1yet are never appointed by the court, but by the judge (dit'ha) at the solicitation of the Dit'ha; they cannot sit on a Panch\u00e1yet without the consent of similarly...\nboth parties. [Another reply adds, that the judge takes from the parties an obligation to abide by the award of the Panch\u00e1yet when given, and that the court or government never volunteers to appoint a Panch\u00e1yet; but if the parties expressly solicit it by a petition, declaring that they can get no satisfaction from their own nominees, the government will then appoint a Panch\u00e1yet to sit on the case. A third respondent says generally, in answer to the query, \"The parties each name five members, and the government adds five to their ten.\"]\n\nQuestion XX.\u2014What means are adopted to hasten the decision of the Panch\u00e1yet, if it be very dilatory?\n\nAnswer.\u2014In such cases the matter is taken out of the hands of the Panch\u00e1yet, and decided by the court which appointed it to sit. [The answer given by another of the respondents states that there never can be needless delay in the decision of causes by Panch\u00e1yets, as these tribunals assemble in the courts out of which they issue, and officers of the court are appointed to see that the members attend regularly and constantly.]\n\nQuestion XXI.\u2014With what powers are the Panch\u00e1yets invested to enforce the attendance of parties and witnesses, and the production of papers; and to give validity to their decrees?\n\nAnswer.\u2014The Panch\u00e1yet has no authority of its own to summon or compel the attendance of any person, to make an unwilling witness depose, or to secure the production of necessary papers; all such executive aid being afforded by the court appointing the Panch\u00e1yet: and, in like manner, the decision of the Panch\u00e1yet is referred to the court to be carried into effect. The Panch\u00e1yet cannot give orders, far less enforce them, but communicates its judgment to the court, by which it is put in execution.\n\nQuestion XXII.\u2014Are all the Panch required to be unanimous, or is a simple majority sufficient? And what course is adopted if there be one or two resolute dissentients?\n\nAnswer.\u2014The whole of the Panch must be unanimous.\n\nQuestion XXIII.\u2014Are there any persons at Kat'hmandu who are regularly employed as members or presidents of Panch\u00e1yets, or are persons indiscriminately selected for each occasion?\n\nAnswer.\u2014There are no permanent individual members of the Panch\u00e1yet; but in all cases wherein Parbattias are concerned it is necessary to choose the Panch out of the following distinguished tribes, viz., Arj\u00e1l, Khandal or Khil, Pand\u00e9, Parat'h, B\u00f3hara, and Rana; one from each tribe. And among the Newars a selection is observed, the tribes from which the Mail\u00e9, Bhanil, Achar, and Srisht.\nIn matters affecting persons who are neither Parbattias nor Newars, there is no restriction as to the selection of the Panch-men by the respective parties.\n\n**Question XXIV.**\u2014Are the Panch\u00e1yet allowed travelling expenses or diet so long as they attend, or not? If allowed, by whom are these expenses paid? Does each party defray its own, or how?\n\n**Answer.**\u2014Persons who sit on Panch\u00e1yets are never paid any sum either as compensation for travelling expenses, loss of time, or on any other account whatsoever.\n\n**Question XXV.**\u2014What is the nature of the dit'ha's authority in those three courts of the capital over which he does not personally preside?\n\n**Answer.**\u2014The bich\u00e1ris, or judges of these courts, cannot decide independently of the dit'ha of the k\u00f3t-Linga: the bich\u00e1ris of those courts are not independent. [Another answer is as follows: In those two courts in which the dit'ha personally presides, causes are decided by the joint wisdom of himself and colleagues (bich\u00e1ris). In those in which he is not personally present, the bich\u00e1ris decide small matters absolutely, but their investigations of grave ones are reported to the dit'ha, and they decide according to his directions.]\n\n**Question XXVI.**\u2014What officers of the court are there to search for and apprehend criminals, to bring them and the evidences of their guilt before the courts, and to see sentence executed on them?\n\n**Answer.**\u2014The officers enumerated in the answer to Question XV., as being attached to the courts of the dit'ha and the bich\u00e1ris.\n\n**Question XXVII.**\u2014What officers are there to serve processes in civil suits, to see that the parties and witnesses in such suits are forthcoming, and to carry the decisions of the courts into effect?\n\n**Answer.**\u2014Those last mentioned, as being employed in criminal cases.\n\n**Question XXVIII.**\u2014If the plaintiff or defendants in a civil suit neglect to attend at any stage of the trial before decision, is the plaintiff non-suited, the defendant cast, the parties forcibly made to appear, the decision suspended or pronounced conditionally, or what course is adopted?\n\n**Answer.**\u2014If the plaintiff be absent and the defendant present, it is the custom to take security from the defendant to appear when called upon at some future time, and to let him depart: no decision is come to in such cases. If the plaintiff be present, and the defendant absent, the latter is not therefore cast; he is searched for, and until he is found no decision can be pronounced.\nQuestion XXIX.\u2014What security is provided in criminal cases that offenders, when apprehended, shall be prosecuted to conviction; and how are prosecutors and witnesses made forthcoming at the time of trial?\n\nAnswer.\u2014M\u00e1l z\u00e1mini, and hazn z\u00e1mini, are taken from prosecutors and witnesses.\n\nQuestion XXX.\u2014What are pr\u00e1yaschitta, chandr\u00e1yan, and aptali?\n\nAnswer.\u2014Pr\u00e1yaschitta: the ceremonies necessary to be performed by an individual for recovering his lost caste. Chandr\u00e1yan: expiatory ceremonies performed by the whole city or kingdom, in atonement for the commission of some heinous sin or uncleanness, the consequences of which have affected a considerable body of the citizens. Aptali\u2014escheats: the lapse of property to the prince, for want of heirs to the last possessor.\n\nQuestion XXXI.\u2014Is the Kum\u00e1ri Ch\u00f3k an office of record and registry for all branches of the government, or for judicial affairs only; and has it any judicial authority?\n\nAnswer.\u2014It is an office of record and registry for the fisc; and has no connexion with the courts of law, nor does it contain their records. [Another respondent, in answer to Question I., reckons it among the courts of law,\u2014Ad\u00e1lats.]\n\nQuestion XXXII.\u2014Describe the forms of procedure in a civil cause, step by step.\n\nAnswer.\u2014If a person comes into court and states that another person owes him a certain sum of money, which he refuses to pay, the bich\u00e1ri of the court immediately asks him for the particulars of the debt, which he accordingly furnishes. The bich\u00e1ri then commands the jamad\u00e1r of the court to send one of his sip\u00e1his to fetch the debtor; the creditor accompanies the sip\u00e1hi to point out the debtor, and pays him two annas per diem, until he has arrested the latter and brought him into court. When he is there produced, the dit'ha and bich\u00e1ris interrogate the parties face to face. The debtor is asked if he acknowledges the debt alleged against him, and will immediately discharge it. The debtor may answer by acknowledging the debt, and stating his willingness to pay it as soon as he can collect the means, which he hopes to do in a few days. In this case, the bich\u00e1ri will desire the creditor to wait a few days. The creditor may reply that he cannot wait, having immediate need of the money; and if so, one of the chapr\u00e1sis of the court is attached to the debtor, with directions to see to the producing of the money in court, by any means. The debtor must then produce money, or goods, or whatever\nproperty he has, and bring it into court. The *dit'ha* and *bich\u00e1ris* then, calling to their assistance three or four merchants, proceed to appraise the goods produced in satisfaction of the debt, and immediately discharge it; nor can the creditor object to their appraisement of the debtor's goods and chattels. In matters thus arranged; that is, where the defendant admits the cause of action to be valid, five per cent of the property litigated is taken from the one party, and ten per cent from the other, and no more.* If the defendant, when produced in court in the manner above described, denies, instead of confessing, the debt, then the plaintiff's proofs are called for; and if he has only a simple note of hand unattested, or an attested acknowledgement the witnesses to which are dead, then the *dit'ha* and *bich\u00e1ris* interrogate the plaintiff thus: \"This paper is of no use as evidence; how do you propose to establish your claim?\" The plaintiff may answer, \"I lent the money to the father of the defendant; the note produced is in his handwriting, and my claim is a just claim.\" Hereupon the plaintiff is required to pledge himself formally to prosecute his claim in the court in which he is, and in no other. The words enjoining the plaintiff thus to gage himself, are \"*B\u00e9ri t'h\u00e1po*;\" and the mode is by the plaintiff's taking a rupee in his hand, which he closes, and strikes the ground, exclaiming, at the same time, \"My claim is just, and I gage myself to prove it so.\" The defendant is then commanded to take up the gage of the plaintiff, or to pledge himself in a similar manner to attend the court duly to the conclusion of the trial, which he does by formally denying the authenticity of the document produced against him, as well as the validity of the debt; and upon this denial he likewise strikes the earth with his hand closed on a rupee. The rupee of the plaintiff and that of the defendant, which are called *b\u00e9ri*, are now deposited in court. The next step is for the court to take the fee called *karpan*, or five rupees, from each party. The amount of both *b\u00e9ri* and *karpan* is the perquisite of the various officers of the court, and does not go to the government. The giving of *karpan* by the parties implies their desire to refer the dispute to the decision of the ordeal; and accordingly, as soon as the *karpan* is paid down, the *dit'ha* acquaints the government that the parties in a certain cause wish to undergo the ordeal. The necessary order is thereupon issued from the Durb\u00e1r; but when it has reached the court, the *dit'ha* and *bich\u00e1ris* first of all exhort the parties to come to an understanding and effect a settlement of their dispute by some other means; if, however, they will not consent, the trial is directed to proceed.\n\n* This fine or tax is called *das\u00f3rad-bis-\u00f6nd*.\nordeal is called ny\u0101ya, and the form of it is as follows: The names of the respective parties are inscribed on two pieces of paper, which are rolled up into balls, and then have p\u016bja* offered to them. From each party a fine or fee\u2020 of one rupee is taken; the balls are then affixed to staffs of reed, and two annas\u2021 more are taken from each party. The reeds are then intrusted to two of the havild\u0101rs of the court to take to the Queen's Tank; and with the havild\u0101rs, a bich\u0101ri of the court, a Br\u0101hma\u1e47, and the parties, proceed thither, as also two men of the Ch\u0101m\u0101khalak (or Cham\u0101ra) caste.\u00a7 On arriving at the tank, the bich\u0101ri again exhorts the parties to avoid the ordeal by adopting some other mode of settling the business, the merits of which are only known to themselves. If they continue to insist on the ordeal, the two havild\u0101rs, each holding one of the reeds, go, one to the east and the other to the west side of the tank, entering the water about knee deep. The Br\u0101hma\u1e47, the parties, and the Ch\u0101m\u0101khalaks, all at this moment enter the water a little way; and the Br\u0101hma\u1e47 performs p\u016bja to Varu\u1e47a in the name of the parties, and repeats a sacred text, the meaning of which is, that mankind know not what passes in the minds of each other, but that all inward thoughts and past acts are known to the gods \u015ar\u012bya, Chandra, Varu\u1e47a, and Y\u0101ma;|| and that they will do justice between the parties in this cause. When the p\u016bja is over, the Br\u0101hma\u1e47 gives the tilak to the two Ch\u0101m\u0101khalaks, and says to them, \"Let the champion of truth win, and let the false one's champion lose!\" This being said, the Br\u0101hma\u1e47 and the parties come out of the water, and the Ch\u0101m\u0101khalaks separate, one going to each place where a reed is erected. They then enter the deep water, and, at a signal given, both immerse themselves in the water at the same instant. Whichever of them first rises from the water, the reed nearest to him is instantly destroyed, together with the scroll attached to it. The other reed is carried back to the court, where the ball of paper is opened, and the name read. If the scroll bear the plaintiff's name, he wins the cause; if it be that of the defendant, the latter is victorious. The fine called j\u012bt'houri is then paid by the winner, and that called harouri by the loser;\u00b6 besides which, five rupees are demanded from the winner in return for a turban which he gets,** and the same sum, under the name of sabbh\u00e1suddha (or purification of the\n\n---\n\n* P\u016bj\u0101, worship\u2014adoration.\u2014Ed.\n\u2020 Called g\u014dla.\n\u2021 This fee is called markouli.\n\u00a7 A very low tribe.\n|| Surya, the sun; Chandra,\nY\u0101ma, the deity presiding\u2014over the\nVaru\u1e47a, the regent of the ocean;\n\u2014Ed.\n\n\u00b6 Vide answer to\n\n** Hence this\n\nVol. I.\ncourt), from the loser. The above four demands on the parties, viz. jil'houri, harouri, pagri, and sabh\u00e1sudd'ha, are government taxes; and, exclusive of these, eight annas must be paid to the mah\u00e1nias of the court, eight annas more to the hotm\u00e1l, eight more to the kumh\u00e1l-n\u00e1ikias, and, lastly, eight more to the khard\u00e1r or registrar. In this manner multitudes of causes are decided by ny\u00e1ya (ordeal), when the parties cannot be brought to agree upon the subject-matter of dispute, and have neither documentary nor verbal evidence to adduce.\n\nQuestion XXXIII.\u2014Describe the forms of procedure in a criminal cause, step by step.\n\nAnswer.\u2014If any one comes into court, and states that such an one has killed such another by poison, sword, dagger, or otherwise, the informant is instantly interrogated by the court thus: How? Who? When? Before whom? The Corpus delicti: Where? &c. &c. He answers by stating all these particulars according to his knowledge of the facts; adducing the names of the witnesses, or saying, that though he has no other witnesses than himself to the fact of murder, he pledges himself to prove it, or abide the consequences of a failure in the proof. This last engagement, when tendered by the accuser, is immediately reduced to writing to bind him more effectually; after which, one or more sip\u00e1his of the court are sent with the informant to secure the murderer, and produce him and the testimony of the deed in court, which, when produced accordingly, is followed by an interrogation of the accused. If the accused confesses the murder, there is no necessity to call for evidence; but if he deny it, evidence is then gone into; and if the witnesses depose positively to their having seen the accused commit the murder, the latter is again asked what he has to say; and if he still refuses to confess, he is whipped until he does; the confession, when obtained, is reduced to writing and attested by the murderer, who is then put in irons and sent to jail. Cases of theft, robbery, incest, &c. are also thus dealt with in Nep\u00e1l, and the convicts sent to prison. When the number amounts to twenty or thirty, the dit'ha makes out a calendar of their crimes, to which he appends their confessions, and a specification of the punishment usually inflicted in such cases. This list the dit'ha carries to the Bh\u00e1rad\u00e1r Sabh\u00e1 (council of state), whence it is taken by the premier to the prince, after the dit'ha's allotment of punishment to each convict has been ratified, or some other punishment substituted. The list, so altered or confirmed in the council of state, and referred by the premier to the prince, is, as a matter of form, sanctioned by the latter, after which it is re-delivered to the dit'ha, who makes it over to the araz begi. The latter, taking the prisoners, the mah\u00e1-n\u00e1ikias,\nand some men of the P\u00f3rya caste* with him, proceeds to the banks of the Bishen-mati, where the sentence of the law is inflicted by the hands of the P\u00f3ryas, and in the presence of the araz beg\u00ed and the mah\u00e1-n\u00e1ikias. Grave offences, involving the penalty of life or limb, are thus treated. With respect to mutual revilings and quarrels, false evidence, false accusation of moral delinquency, and such like minor crimes and offences, punishment is apportioned with reference to the caste of the offender or offenders.\n\nQuestion XXXIV.\u2014Do the parties plead viv\u00e1 voce, or by written statements?\n\nAnswer.\u2014They state their own cases invariably viv\u00e1 voce.\n\nQuestion XXXV.\u2014Do parties tell their own tale, or employ vakils?\n\nAnswer.\u2014They tell their own tale \u2014 vakils are unknown. [Another respondent says that instances of a pleader (mukhs\u00e1r) being employed have occurred; it is usually a near relation, and only when the principal was incapable. Professional or permanent pleaders are unknown.]\n\nQuestion XXXVI.\u2014In penal cases, are witnesses compellable to attend to the summons of the accused, and to depose with all the usual sanctions?\n\nAnswer.\u2014Yes; the court compels the attendance and deposition, in the usual way, of the witnesses for the accused.\n\nQuestion XXXVII.\u2014Who defrays the expenses of witnesses in criminal cases? Are such witnesses obliged to feed themselves during their attendance on the court, and journey to and fro, or does the government support them?\n\nAnswer.\u2014The witnesses in penal cases support themselves; no allowance for food, travelling expenses, &c. is made them by any one.\n\nQuestion XXXVIII.\u2014In criminal cases, if the prisoner volunteers a confession, does his confession supersede the necessity of trial?\n\nAnswer.\u2014It does, entirely.\n\nQuestion XXXIX.\u2014If the prisoner be fully convicted by evidence, must his confession nevertheless be had?\n\nAnswer.\u2014It must.\n\nQuestion XL.\u2014If he be sullenly silent, how is his confession obtained?\n\nAnswer.\u2014He is scolded, beaten, and frightened.\n\nQuestion XLI.\u2014May the prisoner demand to be confronted with his accuser, and cross-examine the witnesses against him?\n\n* The vilest of the vile.\nAnswer.\u2014He has both privileges always granted to him.\n\nQuestion XLII.\u2014In civil cases, are witnesses allowed their travelling expenses and subsistence, or not? and when, and how?\n\nAnswer.\u2014Witnesses must in all cases bear their own expenses.\n\nQuestion XLIII.\u2014Must the expenses of a witness in a civil case be tendered to him by the party as soon as he is desired to attend, or may they be tendered after the witness has presented himself in court?\n\nAnswer.\u2014Witnesses must attend without any allowance being tendered, sooner or later.\n\nQuestion XLIV.\u2014In civil cases, how are costs, exclusive of expenses for witnesses, distributed and realised? Does each party always bear his own, or are all the costs ever laid as a penalty on the losing party when he is to blame?\n\nAnswer.\u2014All costs whatever are distributed between the parties, after the decision, according to fixed rules.\n\nQuestion XLV.\u2014If a witness in a civil cause refuses to attend or to depone, what is the course adopted with respect to him? may the summoning party recover damages proportioned to the loss sustained by the witness's absence or silence? and may any punishment be inflicted on such contumacious witness?\n\nAnswer.\u2014The court will always compel the attendance of a witness required, and will compel his deposition too; and if there be reason to suppose he is prevaricating or concealing some part of what he knows, he is imprisoned until he makes a full revelation.\n\nQuestion XLVI.\u2014What is the punishment for perjury and subordination of perjury?\n\nAnswer.\u2014In trifling cases, the perjurer and suborner are fined; in grave matters, they are corporally punished, and even capitally, according to the mischief done.\n\nQuestion XLVII.\u2014How many sorts of evidence are admissible\u2014oral testimony\u2014writings\u2014decisory oaths\u2014oaths of purgation and imprecation\u2014ordeals?\n\nAnswer.\u2014In civil causes, the Hari-vansa is put on the head of the witness preparing to depose, and he is solemnly reminded of the sanctity of truth. [Another respondent says, \"Evidence of external witnesses is the first and best sort; but if there are none, then an oath is tendered on the Hari-vansa to both parties, and they are required to make their statements over again under the sanction of this oath; by these statements, so taken, the court will sometimes decide, or one party in such a case may tender the other a decisory oath, and, if he will take it, the tenderer must submit.\"]\nQuestion XLVIII.\u2014Is oral testimony taken on oath or without oath? \u2014 what are the forms?\n\nAnswer.\u2014On oath; the form is given above. [By another respondent: \u201cIf the witness be a Siv\u00e1m\u00e1rgi or Br\u00e1hmanical Hind\u00fa, he is sworn on the Hari-vansa; if a Buddhist, on the Pancha-raksha; if a Moslem, on the Kor\u00e1n.\u201d]\n\nQuestion XLIX.\u2014In civil causes, if testimony of men and writings is forthcoming, may either party call for ordeal, or is it only a pis aller? and if one party demands, is the other bound to assent?\n\nAnswer.\u2014Ordeals are only a substitute, the best that can be had when oral and written testimony are both wanting.\n\nQuestion L.\u2014May the prisoner in a penal cause rebut evidence by the ordeal, and are ordeals allowed to any persons under accusation of crime?\n\nAnswer.\u2014If the prisoner be convicted by evidence, but still refuses to confess, and asserts his innocence, his demand of the ordeal must be allowed.\n\nQuestion LI.\u2014Do parties ever depose in their own causes, and under the same sanctions as external witnesses?\n\nAnswer.\u2014In all causes, civil and criminal, the parties may depose like external witnesses, and under the same penalties for falsehood.\n\nQuestion LII.\u2014How are writings signed or sealed, and attested or proved? are the attesting parties summoned, or, if dead, is their hand-writing proved, or how?\n\nAnswer.\u2014In cases of bonds, &c., the witnesses to which are dead, and no other satisfactory evidence is forthcoming, ordeal is resorted to.\n\nQuestion LIII.\u2014How are unattested or casual writings proved? must the writer be produced, or will evidence of his hand-writing be admitted?\n\nAnswer.\u2014If the writer be forthcoming, he must be produced; if not, evidence of his hand-writing is admitted, and any other sort of evidence whatever that can be had: but if the result of the whole is unsatisfactory to the court, it will direct an ordeal.\n\nQuestion LIV.\u2014Are tradesmen allowed to adduce their entries in their books to prove debts to them? and must the shopman or enterer of the items be produced to prove the entries?\n\nAnswer.\u2014The value of entries in merchant's books, and in general mercantile affairs, are referred by the court to a Panch\u00e1yet of merchants.\n\nQuestion LV.\u2014How is the evidence of a man of rank taken?\n\nAnswer.\u2014He must go into court and depose like any other person.\n[Another authority, however, states, on the contrary, that such a person is not required to go into court and depone; but an officer of the court is deputed to wait on him at his house, and to procure his evidence by interrogatories.]\n\n**Question LVI.**\u2014How is the evidence of a woman of rank taken?\n\n**Answer.**\u2014The court deputes a female to hear the evidence of a lady of rank, and to report it to the court.\n\n**Question LVII.**\u2014Is oral evidence taken down as uttered, by rapid writers, and enrolled on record?\n\n**Answer.**\u2014In general, oral evidence is not taken down or preserved, nor is it ever taken in whole. In trifling matters, no record whatever of the evidence is made; but in grave affairs, the substance of the more material depositions is preserved and recorded.\n\n**Question LVIII.**\u2014Is written evidence, when adduced, recorded; and, if so, is it in full or in abstract?\n\n**Answer.**\u2014Important writings are copied, and the copies are recorded after the decision of the case.\n\n**Question LIX.**\u2014Is the decree recorded, and a copy of it given to the winning party?\n\n**Answer.**\u2014The decree is written, the original is given to the winner of the cause, and a copy is deposited in the record-office of the court. [Another respondent states, \u201cthe decree is not written or recorded.\u201d]\n\n**Question LX.**\u2014Do the decrees record the cause in full or in abstract?\n\n**Answer.**\u2014In full, with respect to whatever they profess to record, which, however (as stated above), is not every stage of the proceeding.\n\n**Question LXI.**\u2014Are the records of the several courts of justice preserved in the Kum\u00e1ri Ch\u00f3k, and sent there immediately after the causes are decided?\n\n**Answer.**\u2014The Kum\u00e1ri Ch\u00f3k is the general and ultimate place of deposit, whither the records of each court of justice are sent after explanation, and account of receipts rendered to the government at the close of each year. In the interim, the records stay in the courts where the affairs are decided.\n\n**Question LXII.**\u2014Where the party in a civil cause enters a suit, does he pay any fee, or when he exhibits a document; and, in short, upon what occasions is anything demanded of him?\n\n**Answer.**\u2014There is no fee paid on any of the occasions alluded to; what is taken is taken when the cause is decided.\n\n**Question LXIII.**\u2014What are jit'houri and harouri?\u2014in what proportion and on what principle are they taken?\nAnswer.\u2014Jit'houri is what is paid to the government by the winner of a cause, and harouri, what is paid by the loser. They are proportioned to the amount litigated.\n\nQuestion LXIV.\u2014What is dh\u00fang\u00e1-ch\u00fa\u00e1yi?\n\nAnswer.\u2014A stone (dh\u00fang\u00e1), the image of Vishn\u00fa, is placed before the loser when he has lost, and he is commanded to touch it; he places one rupee and one pice on the stone, and then salutes it with a bow, and retires, leaving the offering.\n\nQuestion LXV.\u2014Besides jit'houri, harouri, and dh\u00fang\u00e1-ch\u00fa\u00e1yi, what other expenses fall on the litigants?\n\nAnswer.\u2014Half as much as is taken as harouri is taken as jit'houri; both go to the sirk\u00e1r, and are proportioned in amount to the property litigated. Dh\u00fang\u00e1-ch\u00fa\u00e1yi is one rupee per cause taken from the loser; sabh\u00e1sudd'h\u00e1 is one or two rupees per cause, according to circumstances; dh\u00fang\u00e1-ch\u00fa\u00e1yi is the perquisite of the bich\u00e1ri.\n\nQuestion LXVI.\u2014Can a civil action of damages be brought for assault, battery, defamation, &c.; or must the party complained against be of necessity prosecuted criminally?\n\nAnswer.\u2014A civil action may be brought by the injured party in any of the four courts of the capital.\n\nQuestion LXVII.\u2014If the defendant in any case as above be cast, is he ever made to pay the plaintiff's expenses in prosecuting him?\n\nAnswer.\u2014In cases of that sort, no expenses fall on the plaintiff, for the sirk\u00e1r takes no fines or taxes from him; witnesses have no allowance, and vakils are unknown.\n\nQuestion LXVIII.\u2014What is the jail-delivery at the d\u00e1sahra? Are not offenders tried and punished at the time of offence? and, with courts always sitting and competent to hear all causes, how comes it that multitudes of prisoners are collected for the d\u00e1sahra?\n\nAnswer.\u2014The jail-delivery is a mere removal of prisoners from the city into an adjacent village, in order that the city may be fully lustrated and purified at that season. The usage has no special reference to judicial matters; but so many offenders as ought about that time to be heard and dismissed, or executed, are so heard and dealt with.\n\nQuestion LXIX.\u2014Is the jail delivered at the d\u00e1sahra by the dit'ha's court, or by the council of bh\u00e1radars?\n\nAnswer.\u2014When the d\u00e1sahra approaches, the dit'ha takes to the bh\u00e1rad\u00e1r sath\u00e1 the criminal calendar of those whose offences have been tried, and states the crime of each, the evidence, and the punishment he conceives applicable. The bh\u00e1rad\u00e1rs, according to their judgment on the dit'ha's report, set down the punishment to be\nwills, do you follow the Mit\u00e1kshar\u00e1, the D\u00e1yabh\u00e1ga, or any other S\u00e1stra of the plains; or have you only a customary law in such matters?\n\nAnswer.\u2014We constantly refer to those books in the decision of such cases.\n\nQuestion LXXXI.\u2014How do sons divide among the Kh\u00e1s tribe? Sons by wives and those by concubines; also unmarried daughters? What is the widow's share, if there be sons and daughters? What if there be none?\n\nAnswer.\u2014Among the Kh\u00e1s, sons by concubines get a third of what constitutes the share of a son by a wife. [Another respondent says in addition: \"If a Kh\u00e1s has a son born in wedlock, that son is his heir; if he has no such son, his brothers and his brother's male descendants are his heirs: his married daughters and their progeny never. If he has a virgin daughter, she is entitled to a marriage portion, and no more.\"]\n\nQuestion LXXXII.\u2014Can the Kh\u00e1s adopt an heir not of their kindred, if they have near male relations?\n\nAnswer.\u2014No: they must choose for adoption the child of some one of their nearest relatives.\n\nQuestion LXXXIII.\u2014Are wills in force among the Kh\u00e1s? and how much of ancestral and of acquired property can a Kh\u00e1s alienate by will from his sons or daughters?\n\nAnswer.\u2014If a Kh\u00e1s has a son, he cannot alienate a rupee from him by will, save only, and in moderation, to pious uses.\n\nQuestion LXXXIV.\u2014Do the magars, and g\u00farlings, and other Parbattias, differ from the Kh\u00e1s in respect to inheritance, adoption, and wills?\n\nAnswer.\u2014In general, they agree closely.\n\nQuestion LXXXV.\u2014How is it with respect to the New\u00e1rs, Siva-m\u00e1rgi, and Budd'ha-m\u00e1rgi.\n\nAnswer.\u2014The former section agree mostly with the Parbattias on all three heads; the latter section have some rules of their own.\n\nQuestion LXXXVI.\u2014How is it with regard to the M\u00farmi tribe, and the Kair\u00e1nti?\n\nAnswer.\u2014Answered above: in regard to inheritance, all tribes agree.\n\nQuestion LXXXVII.\u2014Are the customs of the several tribes above ed, in respect to inheritance, &c., reduced to writing, collected, bodised? If not, how can they be ascertained with sufficient cases of dispute before the courts?\n\nAnswer.\u2014The customary law on those heads is reduced to writing,\nand the book containing it is studied by the bich\u00e1ris, and others whom it may concern. [Another respondent, on the other hand, says, with reference to the customary laws: \u201cThey are not reduced to writing; nor are the dit\u2019has or bich\u00e1ris regularly educated to the law. A dit\u2019ha or bich\u00e1ri has nothing to do with the courts till he receives from the government the turban of investiture; but that is never conferred, save on persons conversant with the customs of the country, and the usages of its various tribes; and this general conversancy with such matters, aided by the opinions of elders in any particular cases of difficulty, is his sole stay on the judgment-seat, unless it is that the ci-devant dit\u2019ha or bich\u00e1ri, when removed by rotation or otherwise, cannot retire until he has imparted to his successor a knowledge of the state of the court, and the general routine of procedures.\u201d] A third reply is as follows: \u201cWhen cases of dispute on these topics are brought into the court, the judge calls for the sentiments of a few of the most respectable elders of the tribe to which the litigants belong, and follows their statement of the custom of the tribe.\u201d]\n\nQuestion LXXXVIII.\u2014Are the bich\u00e1ris regularly educated to the law?\n\nAnswer.\u2014Those who understand dharma and \u00e1dharma, who are well educated and practised in law affairs, are alone made bich\u00e1ris. [By another authority: \u201cThose who are well educated, of high character, and practically acquainted with the law, are alone made bich\u00e1ris. It is not indispensable that they should have read the law S\u00e1stra, though, if they have, so much the better.\u201d]\n\nQuestion LXXXIX.\u2014The dit\u2019ha is not often a professed lawyer; yet, is he not president of the supreme court? How is this?\n\nAnswer.\u2014Whether the dit\u2019ha has read the Ny\u00e1ya S\u00e1stra or not, he must understand ny\u00e1ya (justice-law), and be a man of high respectability.\n\nQuestion XC.\u2014Are there separate bich\u00e1ris for the investigation of the civil causes of New\u00e1rs and of Parbattias?\n\nAnswer.\u2014There are not.\n\nQuestion XCI.\u2014In the dit\u2019ha\u2019s court, if the dit\u2019ha be the judge, the investigator, and decider, what is the function of the bich\u00e1ris?\n\nAnswer.\u2014The investigation is the joint work of the dit\u2019has and the bich\u00e1ris.

Sons by wives and those by concubines; also unmarried daughters? What is the widow's share, if there be sons and daughters? What if there be none?\n\nAnswer.\u2014Among the Kh\u00e1s, sons by concubines get a third of what constitutes the share of a son by a wife. [Another respondent says in addition: \"If a Kh\u00e1s has a son born in wedlock, that son is his heir; if he has no such son, his brothers and his brother's male descendants are his heirs: his married daughters and their progeny never. If he has a virgin daughter, she is entitled to a marriage portion, and no more.\"]\n\nQuestion LXXXII.\u2014Can the Kh\u00e1s adopt an heir not of their kindred, if they have near male relations?\n\nAnswer.\u2014No: they must choose for adoption the child of some one of their nearest relatives.\n\nQuestion LXXXIII.\u2014Are wills in force among the Kh\u00e1s? and how much of ancestral and of acquired property can a Kh\u00e1s alienate by will from his sons or daughters?\n\nAnswer.\u2014If a Kh\u00e1s has a son, he cannot alienate a rupee from him by will, save only, and in moderation, to pious uses.\n\nQuestion LXXXIV.\u2014Do the magars, and g\u00farlings, and other Parbattias, differ from the Kh\u00e1s in respect to inheritance, adoption, and wills?\n\nAnswer.\u2014In general, they agree closely.\n\nQuestion LXXXV.\u2014How is it with respect to the New\u00e1rs, Sivam\u00e1rgi, and Budd'ha-m\u00e1rgi.\n\nAnswer.\u2014The former section agree mostly with the Parbattias on all three heads; the latter section have some rules of their own.\n\nQuestion LXXXVI.\u2014How is it with regard to the M\u00farmi tribe, and the Kuir\u00e1nti?\n\nAnswer.\u2014Answered above: in regard to inheritance, all tribes agree.\n\nQuestion LXXXVII.\u2014Are the customs of the several tribes above mentioned, in respect to inheritance, &c., reduced to writing, collected, and methodised? If not, how can they be ascertained with sufficient ease in cases of dispute before the courts?\n\nAnswer.\u2014The customary law on those heads is reduced to writing,\nand the book containing it is studied by the bich\u00e1ris, and others whom it may concern. [Another respondent, on the other hand, says, with reference to the customary laws: \u201cThey are not reduced to writing; nor are the dit\u2019has or bich\u00e1ris regularly educated to the law. A dit\u2019ha or bich\u00e1ri has nothing to do with the courts till he receives from the government the turban of investiture; but that is never conferred, save on persons conversant with the customs of the country, and the usages of its various tribes; and this general conversancy with such matters, aided by the opinions of elders in any particular cases of difficulty, is his sole stay on the judgment-seat, unless it is that the ci-devant dit\u2019ha or bich\u00e1ri, when removed by rotation or otherwise, cannot retire until he has imparted to his successor a knowledge of the state of the court, and the general routine of procedures.\u201d] A third reply is as follows: \u201cWhen cases of dispute on these topics are brought into the court, the judge calls for the sentiments of a few of the most respectable elders of the tribe to which the litigants belong, and follows their statement of the custom of the tribe.\u201d]\n\nQuestion LXXXVIII.\u2014Are the bich\u00e1ris regularly educated to the law?\n\nAnswer.\u2014Those who understand dharma and \u00e1dharma, who are well educated and practised in law affairs, are alone made bich\u00e1ris. [By another authority: \u201cThose who are well educated, of high character, and practically acquainted with the law, are alone made bich\u00e1ris. It is not indispensable that they should have read the law S\u00e1stra, though, if they have, so much the better.\u201d]\n\nQuestion LXXXIX.\u2014The dit\u2019ha is not often a professed lawyer; yet, is he not president of the supreme court? How is this?\n\nAnswer.\u2014Whether the dit\u2019ha has read the Ny\u00e1ya S\u00e1stra or not, he must understand ny\u00e1ya (justice-law), and be a man of high respectability.\n\nQuestion XC.\u2014Are there separate bich\u00e1ris for the investigation of the civil causes of New\u00e1rs and of Parbattias?\n\nAnswer.\u2014There are not.\n\nQuestion XCI.\u2014In the dit\u2019ha\u2019s court, if the dit\u2019ha be the judge, the investigator, and decider, what is the function of the bich\u00e1ris?\n\nAnswer.\u2014The investigation is the joint work of the dit\u2019has and the bich\u00e1ris. [Another respondent says: \u201cThey both act together: the decree proceeds from the dit\u2019ha.\u201d]\n\nQuestion XCII.\u2014In courts where no dit\u2019ha presides, do the bich\u00e1ris act in his stead?\n\nAnswer.\u2014See the answer to Question XXV.\nQuestion XCIII.\u2014Among New\u0101rs and Parbattias, may not the creditor seize and detain the debtor in his own house, and beat and misuse him also? and to what extent?\n\nAnswer.\u2014The creditor may attach duns to the debtor, to follow and dun him wherever he goes. The creditor may also stop the debtor wherever he finds him; take him home, confine, beat, and abuse him; so that he does him no serious injury in health or limbs. [Another answer states, that the creditor may seize upon the debtor, confine him in his own house, place him under the spout that discharges the filthy wash of the house, and such like; but he has no further power over him.]\n\nQuestion XCV.\u2014Is sitting dharna in use in Nep\u00e1l?\n\nAnswer.\u2014It is.\n\nQuestion XCVI.\u2014Give a contrasted catalogue of the principal crimes and their punishments.\n\nAnswer.\u2014Destruction of human life, with or without malice, and in whatever way, must be atoned for by loss of life. Killing a cow is another capital crime. Incest is a third. Deflowering a female of the sacred tribe subjects a man of a lower caste to capital punishment, and the confiscation of all his property. Robbery is a capital crime. Burglary is punished by cutting off the burglar's hands.

XXII.\u2014Some Account of the P'hansig\u00e1rs, or Gang-robbers, and of the Sh\u00fadgarshids, or Tribe of Jugglers, by James Arthur Robert Stevenson, Esq., of the Madras Civil Service.\u2014(Communicated by the Bombay Branch Royal Asiatic Society.)\n\nRead 1st of February, 1834.\n\nThe P'hansig\u00e1rs* are a tribe of, perhaps, the most deliberate and decided villains that stain the face of the earth. I hardly know whether they should be called a tribe, for they have no distinct religion or prejudices: they admit into their fraternity persons of all castes and persuasions; and the gangs which are found in different parts of the country appear to have no general knowledge of, or connexion with, each other, further than the diabolical compact existing among a few of the members who may at any period have acted in concert in their trade of villany. The following few particulars I gathered from the examination of part of a large gang which inhabited a village on the western frontier of the Niz\u00e1ms country, not very far from Bij\u00e1pur.\n\nThe number of males in this troop amounted to about sixty, almost all of whom had families and houses in D\u00fadg\u00ed, which they considered as their head-quarters. They were subject to two n\u00e1iks, or chiefs, who planned their expeditions, and regulated the division of booty, being themselves entitled to a double share: they were also responsible to the patt\u00e9l, or head of the village, for the payment of a regular tribute, the price of his protection and silence. The greatest proportion of this gang were Muhammedans; but there were among them Rajap\u00fats, and other castes. Their ostensible employment was agriculture and daily labour; but their only actual means of subsistence was the plunder obtained by the murder of their fellow-creatures. When their means of debauchery and indulgence became limited by the expenditure and waste of their ill-gotten wealth, fresh expeditions were ordered, and parties sent to make circuits in different directions, all the plunder being brought to their head-quarters to be shared. They were sworn to a fair division, to secrecy, and to inviolable fidelity to each other. Their standing rules were never to rob without first depriving their victim of life, never to attack by open force, and never to leave the smallest traces of their crimes; the bodies of the murdered being entirely defaced or deeply buried, and the spoil sent to a distant market. As all their murders are committed by means of strangulation, no marks of blood are left on\n\n* From the Hind\u00fast\u00e1n\u00ed word P'h\u00e1nsi, a no\nso well have they generally kept their resolves and contrived their crimes, and so faithful have they generally proved to each other, that there are but few instances of P'hansig\u00e1rs being convicted in a court of justice, although they have been repeatedly apprehended. A departure from their rules (the commission of a daring robbery which was quite out of their line) led to the seizure of the gang to which I have alluded.\n\nTheir methods of proceeding in their own horrid trade are various; but the chief object in view is to lull their victim into a sense of security before they proceed to deprive him of life, which is, as before remarked, always effected by strangulation. When a favourable opportunity presents itself, one of the party throws a noose, which is made with a tightly twisted handkerchief,* round the destined sufferer's neck; an accomplice immediately strikes the person on the inside of his knees, so as to knock him off his legs, and thus throw the whole weight of his body on the noose; and a very few seconds puts an end to the unfortunate man's struggles. The plan generally adopted by the P'hansig\u00e1rs is to pretend to travellers, or to Company's sipahis proceeding to their homes on leave of absence, to have met them by chance, and to agree to pursue their journey together. They likewise fall into conversation with travellers whom they may meet on the road, or in the choultries and halting-places, and frequently share their provisions with them, proposing, at last, that, as they are all travelling the same road, they should, for the sake of companionship and mutual security, travel together. The first favourable opportunity that offers itself on the road is seized to murder the deluded traveller; but so cautious and wary is the P'hansig\u00e1r, that he will often accompany his victim several days' march before he can find a place and an opportunity sufficiently safe for his purpose.\n\nAnother mode of luring the traveller to his destruction is by the assistance of a woman. They select a pretty-looking girl of their tribe, and place her near some retired road, where she watches until she observes an object of prey fit for her purpose. She has a pitiful story ready to explain the cause of her having been left thus alone in the jungles, and seldom fails to interest the unfortunate listener, who almost always falls into the snare that is laid for him. The girl sometimes excites his passions, and having seduced him into a favourable position herself fastens the fatal noose, her companions being always near at hand to afford timely aid. The traveller, if mounted, will perhaps\n\n*Handkerchief, is stated to be always of a white or a yellow colour, the colours of their tutelary deity, Mariatta, the goddess of\noffer to take the girl up on his horse, to assist her in overtaking the party she says she has lost; but before he has advanced many paces, the murderess casts the snare round his neck, and, throwing herself from the horse, drags her protector to the ground, where he is speedily despatched by the ever-ready accomplices.*\n\nOne of the P'hansig\u00e1rs to whom I have alluded in the commencement of this paper turned king's evidence, and was very particular in his details. He said, that during their last tour of a fortnight they had murdered sixteen individuals; and he also mentioned a circumstance which will tend to shew the barbarity with which they carry on their terrible system. The party of P'hansig\u00e1rs had retired to rest in a pagoda, in which a Laskar\u2020 had also taken up his quarters for the night, during the course of which he was murdered. The assassins dug a hole in the sanctum of the pagoda, in which to bury the corpse, but they found that it was too small to admit the body; they consequently dismembered it, and then succeeded in thrusting the mangled pieces into the hole.\n\nThe booty for which these horrid murders are committed is often so trifling\u2014sometimes not exceeding one rupee, or the clothes on the person's body\u2014that it appears as if the P'hansig\u00e1rs found a delight and a pastime in such deeds of blood. This seems more probable, as I found from their cant phrases (of which I collected a few examples, since lost), that they had ludicrous names for the convulsive struggles of their expiring victims, as well as for murder, the noose, and the different acts attending their diabolical trade. An old woman, one of the tribe, repeated them to me with a great deal of glee. She, as well as most of the other females, made no secret of their vocation, and appeared to think that there was nothing wrong in it. When asked of what caste they were? they answered P'hansig\u00e1rs. How do you get your livelihood? By p'hansig\u00e1ring. Are you not ashamed of your way of life? have you never followed any other trade? No, this is the same trade that our fathers followed; if we don't p'hansig\u00e1r, how are we to live?\n\nI fear that many gangs of these miscreants still exist; they have been for the most part hunted out of the British territory, but they are said to carry on an uninterrupted career in the Niz\u00e1m's country, and in other independent provinces. The forms of law have allowed many to escape, or have obliged the magistrates to let loose on their\n\n* Females, and persons of some rank and occupations, are considered by the P'hansig\u00e1rs as enemies; they imagine, in some way connected with t\n\n\u2020 A camp servant\nfellow-creatures beings who are a disgrace to the lowest order of the human race\u2014in fact, they are a race of vampires undeserving of the name of man.*\n\nThe Sh\u00fadg\u00e1rshid is a tribe of jugglers and fortune-tellers, who wander about the Dekkan, and, probably, other parts of the country, where, however, they are not known by this name, but generally, I believe, by that of G\u00e1r\u00f3di (juggler), which is the denomination of the caste in the Vijn\u00e1nesw\u00e1ra S\u00fatra. The Karn\u00e1taka term of Sh\u00fadg\u00e1rshid is derived from Sh\u00eddgd\u00e1r (a burning or burial-ground) and shid (proficient, ready) it being their habit to prowl about these places to collect certain pieces of human bone, with which they are supposed to work charms and incantations. The tribe is looked upon with much awe and detestation, and the fear of exciting the wrath of any of its members, generally secures a ready compliance with their demands for charity. On this, however, they do not place their only reliance, they are notorious for kidnapping children, and also for an abominable traffic, consisting in the sale of sinews extracted from the breasts, the wrists, and the ankles of females; these are supposed to be preservative charms from all evil: but, in order that they may possess this virtue to the full extent, they must be taken from the person of a woman who has been very lately delivered. An instance of this practice occurred at Sh\u00f3l\u00e1p\u00far a few years ago;\u2014a rich merchant named D\u00e9vel\u00e1t had a married daughter (L\u00e1ks\u00e1mi) who resided in his house, and who had been confined of her first child about ten days, when she was suddenly missed. The infant was found in its cradle, but no search was successful in discovering the unfortunate mother. It was at last remembered by some member of the family, that on the morning of the day on which the girl was missed a female Sh\u00fadg\u00e1rshid had been at the house, and had told the fortunes of several of the inmates. Knowing the habits of these people, apprehensions and anxiety regarding the fate of the lost L\u00e1ks\u00e1mi were excited to their height, as it was deemed beyond doubt that she had been enticed away, and had fallen a victim to the Sh\u00fadg\u00e1rshid, who was immediately seized; but nothing could be learnt from her, for she denied ever having seen the girl. In the course, however, of the inquiries and cross-questioning of the friends\u2014probably not conducted in the mildest manner\u2014some words dropped from the juggler\n\n* In the Asiatic Researches, vol. xiii. p. 250, will be found an ample and detailed account of the P'hansig\u00e1rs, T'hegs, B\u00e1dheks, &c. all different classes of gang robbers in India, furnished by Dr. Sherwood, Mr. J. Shakespear, &c.

XXIII.\u2014On Female Infanticide in Cutch, by Lieutenant Alexander Burnes, F.R.S.\n\n[Since the sheet containing the former paper on this subject, by Lieutenant Burnes, was printed off, the Society has been favoured, by that gentleman, with a copy of his letter to Lieutenant-Colonel Pottinger, detailing the substance of a conversation which took place between himself and some of the Jh\u00e1rej\u00e1 chieftains, shortly after the delivery of letters from the Bombay government to the Rao of Cutch, deprecating the continuance of the practice of female infanticide in his dominions. This document is curious as explaining the sentiments of these individuals in regard to this practice, almost in their own words, and will tend to the completion of the evidence in our possession as to the existence of this inhuman custom.]\n\nExtract of a letter from Lieutenant A. Burnes, Assistant Political Resident in Cutch, to Lieutenant-Colonel Pottinger, Resident. Dated 27th December, 1830.\n\nSIR,\n\n1. Agreeably to the instructions conveyed by you, I have delivered the two letters from the government of Bombay to his highness the Rao of Cutch. I took occasion to explain to his highness, in the most forcible manner, the deep anxiety of government for the total abolition of female infanticide, which, as he would observe in the letters now delivered, was viewed with horror by all civilised nations.\n\n2. A few days after this occurrence, I received an intimation from the Jh\u00e1rej\u00e1 chiefs at Bh\u00faj that they wished to wait upon me. I immediately invited them to my house, and found that their object was to converse with me on the subject of infanticide, towards the suppression of which the late letters of government appeared to attach more than usual importance. The names of these chiefs were, Jh\u00e1rej\u00e1 Bh\u00f3ir\u00e1s\u00ed Laida, Jh\u00e1rej\u00e1 Doss\u00e1s\u00ed of K\u00f3t\u00ed, Jh\u00e1rej\u00e1 Jaim\u00e1l\u00ed of Nougurcha, Jh\u00e1rej\u00e1 Pragj\u00ed of Motara, Jh\u00e1rej\u00e1 M\u00e1nsingj\u00ed Bhim\u00e1n\u00ed of Ker\u00faie, Jh\u00e1rej\u00e1 N\u00e1rrayanj\u00ed of Mhow, Jh\u00e1rej\u00e1 Dhrisingj\u00ed of P\u00fanri.\n\nThe remarks of these men I may briefly sketch as follows: they proceeded by expressing solicitude that in the short space of a month, if you left Bh\u00faj, I should have made them acquainted with two communications from government on female infanti-\ninflicted on each offender, and return the list to the dit'h\u00e1, who makes it over to the araz beg\u00ed, or sheriff, and he sees execution done accordingly, through the medium of the mah\u00e1-n\u00e1ikias.\n\nQuestion LXX.\u2014What is the prisoner's daily allowance?\u2014and what is the system of prison discipline?\n\nAnswer.\u2014Each prisoner receives daily a seer of parched rice and a few condiments. [Another respondent states, that prisoners of the common class get one and a half annas per diem; persons above that class receive, according to their condition, from four annas to one rupee per diem.]\n\nQuestion LXXI.\u2014What is the preventive establishment in cities?\n\nAnswer.\u2014There is no civil establishment of watchmen, but the military patrol the streets throughout the night at intervals.\n\nQuestion LXXII.\u2014To whom are night-brawls, and riots, and disturbances, reported?\n\nAnswer.\u2014The night-watch of the city belongs to the soldiery, who go their rounds at stated times. If they apprehend any persons in their rounds, they keep them till morning in the guard-room, and then deliver them to the mah\u00e1nias, by whom they are produced in court, when their affairs are summarily heard, and they are released or committed to prison, as the case may be.\n\nQuestion LXXIII.\u2014What are the village establishments of the preventive and detective kind?\n\nAnswer.\u2014In each village, one dw\u00e1ria, four pradh\u00e1ns, four n\u00e1ikias, and from five to ten mah\u00e1nias.\n\nQuestion LXXIV.\u2014In the villages of Nep\u00e1l is there any establishment similar to the village economy of the plains? Any bar\u00e1 alotaya, or bar\u00e1 balotaya?\n\nAnswer.\u2014No: there is neither patt\u00e9l, nor patw\u00e1ri, nor mird'ha, nor garaiit, nor blacksmith, nor carpenter, nor cham\u00e1r, nor washerman, nor barber, nor potter, nor kand\u00fa, in any village of Nep\u00e1l.\n\nQuestion LXXV.\u2014Is the managing zemind\u00e1r of each village, or are the principal landholders collectively, bound to government, in cases of theft, to produce the thief, or restore the stolen property?\n\nAnswer.\u2014No: there is no such usage.\n\nQuestion LXXVI.\u2014Is the village m\u00e1lguz\u00e1r usually a farmer of the revenues, or only a collector? the principal resident, ryot or a stranger? and how do these fiscal arrangements affect those for police purposes?\n\nAnswer.\u2014The dw\u00e1ria and pradh\u00e1ns above mentioned collect the revenues, and the same persons superintend the police, keep the peace, and punish with small fines and whipping trifling breaches of\nI continued, was viewed as a most favourable period to urge the subject, and that too, resolutely, when a prince of bright hopes and great promise, with an acuteness of understanding beyond his years, was coming to his majority, and shortly to assume the government, an opportunity which had not been lost sight of, and which, from the interest shewn by the Rao in the objects of government, was likely to be indeed valuable. The arguments which I had now heard, I told them, were not unknown to my superiors, as it was a rule of the government which I served to make itself acquainted with customs and prejudices; but they also must be well aware that the custom of female infanticide was of no great antiquity after all, and grounded on no religious motive; and that I had heard the Soda and Chuwan Rajputs of Parkur, and the Nuejur, when on my journey to Marwar last year, rejoice that it was likely to be abolished, as they would now find high-caste wives: further, that it was imperative on them to consider a sacred treaty which was so generous, that it identified the interests of some hundred chieftains with the British government purely from motives of humanity. I explained to these men the case of the slave-trade, and the horror which it had excited in Europe; and begged that they would understand the force of the same motives in our desire to abolish infanticide, which was odious all over the earth, and so unnatural that it was a constant theme of wonder in our conversation. I took the opportunity to mention to these seven chiefs (all of whom, by the by, were married men without a single daughter), that I had it on undoubted information, which I had myself collected, that in fifty-six villages the proportion of male to female Jhareja children was nearly six to one, and that this was well known to government, which had, certainly, for a time, been betrayed into the fond hope that the custom was at an end, an error which the Jharejas themselves had given rise to from repeated asseverations that it would cease.\n\n5.\u2014Much more conversation took place in this interview, which lasted about two hours, but I think that I have now given the substance and spirit of it all. I told the Jharejas that I would report particularly what had passed; and whatever might be their fears about the hidden intentions of government, I could assure them that if they performed their part, you would never forget their \"good name,\"\u2014and the interview terminated.\n\n6.\u2014The minister Luckmidass stayed with me after the chiefs had gone, and repeated all the arguments which I have above stated. You are aware of his great influence among the Jharejas, and I was glad to hear him condemn, in the most unmeasured terms, the practice of infanticide. He said that the abominable vices which degraded\nwills, do you follow the Mit\u00e1kshar\u00e1, the D\u00e1yabh\u00e1ga, or any other S\u00e1stra of the plains; or have you only a customary law in such matters?\n\nAnswer.\u2014We constantly refer to those books in the decision of such cases.\n\nQuestion LXXXI.\u2014How do sons divide among the Kh\u00e1s tribe? Sons by wives and those by concubines; also unmarried daughters? What is the widow's share, if there be sons and daughters? What if there be none?\n\nAnswer.\u2014Among the Kh\u00e1s, sons by concubines get a third of what constitutes the share of a son by a wife. [Another respondent says in addition: \"If a Kh\u00e1s has a son born in wedlock, that son is his heir; if he has no such son, his brothers and his brother's male descendants are his heirs: his married daughters and their progeny never. If he has a virgin daughter, she is entitled to a marriage portion, and no more.\"]\n\nQuestion LXXXII.\u2014Can the Kh\u00e1s adopt an heir not of their kindred, if they have near male relations?\n\nAnswer.\u2014No: they must choose for adoption the child of some one of their nearest relatives.\n\nQuestion LXXXIII.\u2014Are wills in force among the Kh\u00e1s? and how much of ancestral and of acquired property can a Kh\u00e1s alienate by will from his sons or daughters?\n\nAnswer.\u2014If a Kh\u00e1s has a son, he cannot alienate a rupee from him by will, save only, and in moderation, to pious uses.\n\nQuestion LXXXIV.\u2014Do the magars, and g\u00farlings, and other Parbattias, differ from the Kh\u00e1s in respect to inheritance, adoption, and wills?\n\nAnswer.\u2014In general, they agree closely.\n\nQuestion LXXXV.\u2014How is it with respect to the New\u00e1rs, S\u00edva-m\u00e1rgi, and Budd'ha-m\u00e1rgi.\n\nAnswer.\u2014The former section agree mostly with the Parbattias on all three heads; the latter section have some rules of their own.\n\nQuestion LXXXVI.\u2014How is it with regard to the M\u00farmi tribe, and the Kair\u00e1nti?\n\nAnswer.\u2014Answered above: in regard to inheritance, all tribes agree.\n\nQuestion LXXXVII.\u2014Are the customs of the several tribes above mentioned, in respect to inheritance, &c., reduced to writing, collected, and methodised? If not, how can they be ascertained with sufficient ease in cases of dispute before the courts?\n\nAnswer.\u2014The customary law on those heads is reduced to writing,\nART. XXIV.\u2014Notice of the Port of Redout-Kali, and Statement of the Nature and Value of the Exports from Russia to Asia in the year 1827.\n\n[The increasing interest connected with the progress of commerce in central Asia, and the scarcity of authentic information illustrative of that subject, renders it probable that the subjoined documents may not be devoid of use with reference to any future researches of the same nature, and it has, therefore, been deemed advisable to place them on record in the pages of this Journal.]\u2014Ed.\n\nI. PORT OF REDOUT-KALI.\n\nThe port of Redout-Kali, situated to the southward of Anapa, on the coast of the Black Sea, was declared, in 1819 or 1820, a free port for the term of ten years; and many French and English vessels availed themselves of this privilege, especially in 1823, 1824, and 1825; the duties payable on the cargoes being only five per cent ad valorem. The increase in the commerce of this port amounted in 1825 and 1826 from 1,500,000 to 2,000,000 paper roubles;* and, in the course of time, from its favourable position, it will doubtless become of the greatest importance for the commerce of the Levant.\n\nStatement of Exports from RUSSIA to ASIA in 1827.\n\n| Articles       | Caspian Sea | From the Caspian Sea to Semipolatinsk | By Klahta | In

XXV.\u2014Remarks on the Revenue System and Landed Tenures of the Provinces under the Presidency of Fort St. George, by the late R\u0101maswami Naidu.\u2014Communicated by John Hodgson, Esq. M.R.A.S.\n\n[No questions of greater practical importance, perhaps, have ever occupied the attention of the British government in India, than those of the allodial rights of the inhabitants, and the amount and species of revenue which it might be justified in claiming from them. There are certainly none, among the vast number of peculiar and delicate cases connected with the government of our possessions in that country, which have elicited so much conflicting opinion, which have been more ably argued by men of the highest talent and information, or which have appeared more difficult of solution.\n\nAt the particular period when the subject was unavoidably pressed on the attention of those at the head of affairs; in other words, when it became necessary not only to define the rights of the proprietors of the soil, but also to determine what persons should be recognised in that character; and not only to specify the amount which each district should contribute to the public exigency, but also to lay down the principle on which such assessment was founded, the difficulties which opposed themselves, at almost every step, to a satisfactory adjustment of these particulars, were chiefly attributed to a deficiency of accurate and authentic information regarding the tenures of land as they existed under the native governments of the country. After a lapse of forty years, however,\u2014during which many intelligent and well-qualified officers in the service of the East India Company have exerted themselves zealously and laboriously in the investigation of these questions in all their bearings, and have embodied the results of their inquiries in documents which, for extent and value, have probably no parallels in the records of political and statistical science,\u2014such reasons can hardly be considered applicable; and the difficulty probably lies not so much in the absence of additional evidence, as in the disinclination to examine with patience and care that which is in our possession; for it has been well remarked by the able author of a work on this very subject, that \u201cinformation regarding India is, of all topics, the most nauseating in English society; the scene is too remote to excite interest, and ignorance renders the subject unpalatable.\u201d\n\n* On the Land Tax of India, &c. by Lieut.-Col. John Briggs, M.R.A.S. 8vo. London, 1830. See p. 456.\nThe arrangements recently made by the legislature of this country for the future administration of the British territories in India, have, however, it may be supposed, drawn the attention of the public, in a greater degree than usual, to the state and prospects of that country and its inhabitants; and it is presumed, that a production which will at once afford an idea of the mental capacity and intellectual acquirements of our native fellow-subjects in the East, and at the same time furnish some curious illustrations of the system of government existing under the Hind\u00fa princes of the south of India, cannot be unacceptable to the readers of this Journal.\n\nThe article to which these remarks are introductory, was presented to the Royal Asiatic Society by one of its members, John Hodgson, Esq., a gentleman formerly filling a high station in the civil service of the Hon. East India Company on the establishment of Fort St. George; and is thus spoken of in the publication to which we have already referred: \"A manuscript memoir on the Madras revenue system, written by the late R\u00e1maswami Naidu, formerly a public officer of the government, who, at the time of drawing up the memoir, had retired from public life, and was residing in a village, the revenue of which had been assigned to him for his long and faithful services in the revenue department.\n\n\"The document is written in English, and is in the original shape given to it by the author. It contains three remarkable features: the first is the refutation of the doctrine of the sovereign's proprietary right in the soil, which he has handled in a very able manner; the second is a recommendation that the whole of the waste lands should be given up to villages gratis, as the only alternative left of restoring the value of the lands now occupied; and the third contains his observations on our revenue system. The latter is valuable, as containing the view this intelligent native takes of our system of management in India.\"\n\nR\u00e1maswami has divided his essay into three parts; and it is of the first of these only that we propose giving an abstract on the present occasion, reserving the remainder for future opportunities. It is chiefly devoted to an account of the history and local administration of the province of Tondamandalam, a tract of country in the southern peninsula of India, extending from Nellore on the north, to Trichinopoly south, including all the territory lying below the table-land of Mysore, and formerly subjected to the domination of the sovereigns of the Chola and P\u00e1ndya dynasties. These ancient regal governments,\n\n* On the Land Tax of India, by Col. Brigge, p. 467.\nhowever, had been long overthrown when we became acquainted with India, and their territories subdivided among numerous minor princes, each claiming independence within his particular limits. \u2014Ed.]\n\nPART I.\n\nIt is true, as Europeans believe, that we Indians do not possess any recorded histories of our ancient civil and political matters, all that we have being religious tracts mixed with political institutions; and, what must, indeed, be matter of curiosity to the European world, our books treat only upon facts that occurred many thousand years before the commencement of the Christian system of Chronology, which makes the world but little more than five thousand years old. The Indian kings reigned over Bh\u00e1rat\u00e1-V\u00e1rsh\u00e1m, commonly called Hind\u00fast\u00e1n, unmolested, until that unhappy invasion of S\u00edk\u00e1nd\u00e1r Sh\u00e1h,* which opened the way to the barbarous Muhammedans who soon afterwards subdued the country: they not only totally defeated the kings,\u2020 and plundered them of their riches, but destroyed the temples, insulted the sacred images, massacred men, women, and children,\u2021 and sacked the property of individuals; and also forcibly converted them to Islamism for a series of years\u2014an event needless for me here to detail, both Abul Fazl and Ferishtah having treated at large on the subject.\n\nThere can be no doubt, however, that our earliest histories of civil and political transactions, which ought to have remained in the repositories of the ancient kings, may have been either destroyed \u00a7 or lost during the bloody wars of the Muhammedans; since which no one appears to have attempted to continue them, because none, perhaps, liked to treat upon the fall of his own government. But Abul Fazl and Ferishta, elated with the success of their arms, which were every day prospering, were ambitious of having the history of their conquests transmitted to posterity; and so were the Europeans, perhaps for the same reason.\n\nBut we need not lament the want of historical records to trace the subject of this memoir; for the very practice that prevails throughout Hind\u00fast\u00e1n to this day is enough to convince us that the cultivators always possessed the proprietary right in the soil, and paid the tribute to the sovereign in kind.\n\nI shall, therefore, now relate the history of this part of India called\n\n* Alexander the Great.\n\u2020 Dow's Hindust\u00e1n, vol. i. p. 166; Hamilton's Gazetteer, p. 150.\n\u2021 Ferishtah's History of Dekkan, vol. i. p. 28.\n\u00a7 Hulton's Gazetteer, p. 33.\nTondaimandalam * or Tondamandalam, in which the metropolis of the British government was established in the early part of the seventeenth century,\u2020 and in which the Honourable Company's agents have since brought the management of its political affairs to such a state of perfection as to excite the envy of all foreign governments.\n\nThe boundaries of Tondaimandalam are thus defined: from the sea on the east to Nandidruga on the west; and from the Pennar river on the south to Tripati or Kallestry on the north. This tract of land is also called Tonda-mandalam, as a prince of that name formerly reigned over it.\n\nAncient history informs us that this kingdom was conquered by Adanda Chakravarti, who was also called Tonda, a son of Kulatunga Chola, one of the kings of Chola-d\u00e9s,\u2021 and that it thence took its name of Tondamandalam.\n\nAdanda Chakravarti, to celebrate his victory, built a temple in honour of his god, and a mandapa or portico, in which were placed two pillars which he had brought from one of the fortresses of the Kurumbars || to commemorate this event, and which pillars are still to be seen.\n\nAdanda Chakravarti calling his newly conquered country after his own name, i.e. Tondamandalam, sent the news of his victory to his father, requesting of him to send inhabitants from Cholamandalam to re-people his country; accordingly, forty-eight thousand Vel\u00e1lars, or cultivators of the Vel\u00e1l\u00e1 tribe, were sent, and Adanda Chakravarti pointed out to them lands for cultivation, with an assurance of investing them with the k\u00e1ni-\u00e1tehi of such part of the land as they would undertake to clear, under a conviction that they would not continue firmly attached to their farms, unless by fixing them with the irons of k\u00e1ni-\u00e1tehi;\u00b6 an expedient most effectually employed to incite people to industry and to promote agriculture.\n\nHe accordingly divided the whole country of Tondamandalam into seventy-nine n\u00e1dus, or districts, allotting from one to six of them\n\n---\n\n* Tondai, the name of a shrub, with which this part of India abounds.

Nattam, in a strict sense, means the ground on which the village stands; and this with reference to the S\u00fadras, or common people, only.

He allowed a place for erecting temples to Vishnu and Siva, for the houses of the Br\u00e1hmans of the temple and panch\u00e0nga Br\u00e1hmans, and after that for K\u00e1ni-\u00e1thchikarars, granting them heritage in them as well as in the cultivation of the lands, with a good space for back-yards; and then to all the kudi-makkal, or menial servants of the village (of whom I shall treat particularly in their proper place); and, lastly, a spot is allotted distinctly for the purpose of Parach\u00e9ri* and Sh\u00faduk\u00e0du, or place of burning the dead.\n\nIn dividing the Nanja \u2020 and Panja \u2021 lands; i.e. the low lands cultivated with paddy, and the high lands cultivated with dry grain and pulse; he first of all fixed Terabadi-m\u00e1nyas, or lands to be assigned as free gift, to the pagodas and Br\u00e1hmans, the former called D\u00e9vad\u00e0ya, and the latter Br\u00e1hmad\u00e0ya; then K\u00e1nim\u00e1nyam to the K\u00e1ni-\u00e1thchi-kars, that is persons holding k\u00e1ni-\u00e1thchi, and m\u00e1nyam \u00a7 to Kudi-makkal, the village servants; and the remaining land was distinguished by the denomination of V\u00e1rapet, that is, land giving a proportion of the crops; for, without establishing this, you cannot effectually protect the cultivator in the k\u00e1ni-\u00e1thchi, in which, as I have before observed, he is bound for ever; as a fixed rent either of grain or money would render the circumstances of a cultivator truly miserable (since he must occasionally, and sometimes frequently, sustain heavy losses from unforeseen and unavoidable calamities of the season), and by consequence deprive himself of the k\u00e1ni-\u00e1thchi altogether in time. All these considerations, probably, must have operated in establishing this mode of dividing the crop.\n\nIn cutting the crops, however, he enacted rules entitled Swatantra dittam, allotting fees or gifts to the pagoda, Br\u00e1hmans, and all the menial servants of the village, such as sh\u00fadu, or shemai, and picha; the former is paid in sheaves of corn before the paddy is thrashed, and the latter in hand previous to the measurement of the heaps.\n\nM\u00e9rais, and various other deductions, are made during the measurement of the grain, such as k\u00e1mi-m\u00e9rai, kuppatam, &c. to the K\u00e1ni-\u00e1thchi-kars, kalav\u00e1sam and p\u00farak\u00fallam to their slaves or servants.||\n\nThen follows the division between the cultivator and the sovereign; the former is denominated kudi-v\u00e1ram, and the latter m\u00e9-l-v\u00e1ram; or, in other words, the inhabitant's share and the government share; i.e. the cultivator is allowed an adequate portion of the produce for himself, bullocks, seed, implements of tillage, labourers, manure, sowing,\n\n---\n\n* The residence of the Pariyars.\n\u2020 Nanja, irrigated.\n\u2021 Panja, dry.\n\u00a7 Free.\n|| Of whom I shall treat in another place.\ntransplanting, irrigating, weeding, cutting, thrashing, &c. &c. and the sovereign receives the remainder for his protecting him from enemies, robbers, plunderers, and various other evils.\n\n*Tondaiman* perceiving that neither the life of a cultivator could be comfortable, nor the administration of the state facilitated without the aid of the *kudimakkal*, or the officers of the village whom I mentioned before, subsequently appointed eighteen of them to each village, conferring the heritage of office on them, with suitable emoluments, which I shall proceed to explain, with their respective occupations, and privileges, in the order as they stand.\n\n1. A *karnam*, who keeps all accounts belonging to the village; enjoys a portion of land for his service, denominated *kanakku-m\u00e1nyam*, which is inserted in the *Terabadi*, and is generally situated in the extremity of the bounds of the village, in order to prevent others encroaching on them; besides this, he receives a fee called *sh\u00e1l\u00e1ga*, or *wora*, for keeping an account of the measurement of heaps, and also, he gets a fee called *kuri-hadir*, or \"sheaf-fee,\" for chopping the stalks from dry grain.\n\n2. A *k\u00e1vel* or *k\u00e1velgar*, whose duty it is to watch the bounds of the village, crops, stacks, heaps, and other property of the inhabitants in the village; he enjoys a certain quantity of *terapadi-m\u00e1nyam*, a part of which generally lies at the extremity of the limits of the village; as also *kavel valakku*, or fee in sheaves. This officer is held answerable for all thefts committed on the heaps of the village, and for such of the property of the inhabitants as is stolen by night.\n\n3. A *karum\u00e1n*, or blacksmith, is employed to manufacture the iron implements required for agriculture, and to assist in building houses for the cultivators, in which former case the cultivators furnish him with iron and charcoal only; and, in the latter, they pay him for his labour. He also possesses *terabadi-m\u00e1nyam* in the village, together with *shema-* (or sheaf) and hand-fees.\n\n4. *Tatchen*, or carpenter, who manufactures all the wooden implements of agriculture; he claims the same fees as the blacksmith.\n\n5. A *tattan*, or goldsmith's duty, is to *shroff*\u2020 the money collections of the village; he also works in gold and silver, and enjoys a *terabadi-m\u00e1nyam* as well as the fees *valakku* and *m\u00e1ra*.\n\n6. A *kann\u00e1n*, or brass-smith, whose duty is to cast images for the pagodas, and manufacture brass pots, &c. for the use of the inhabitants; he enjoys *terabadi-m\u00e1nyam*, but this does not exist in every village.\n\n*Another name of Adanda Chakravarti.*\n\n\u2020 To assay.\n7. A kal-tatch\u00e1n, or stone-cutter, to cut images, build pagodas, and manufacture stone mortars, grinding stones, &c. for the use of the inhabitants, for which purpose a terabadi-m\u00e1nya is optionally allowed him, but not in every village.\n\n8. A k\u00fashavan, or pot-maker, supplies earthen pots to the cultivators, pot-rings to the wells, and anai-kal, or spouts for the sluices of tanks, and accordingly enjoys terabadi-m\u00e1nya, as well as valaku or sheaf- and hand-fees.\n\n9. N\u00e1vidan, or barber, attends all marriages and funerals of the cultivators, and enjoys terabadi-m\u00e1nya, fees, &c.; besides which the inhabitants optionally pay him for his trouble.\n\n10. A vann\u00e1n, or washerman, washes the clothes of the cultivators, attends all marriages and funerals; and is also allowed a terabadi-m\u00e1nya, notwithstanding he is paid optionally by the cultivators.\n\n11. A panisevan, or v\u00edrakud\u00edyan, literally a workman, attends on the head-cultivator of the village, announces all marriages and deaths to the community, and is allowed a certain quantity of terabadi-m\u00e1nya, with sheaf- and hand-fees.\n\n12. A vall\u00favan, or tailor, sews the clothes of the cultivators, and prays at festivals and at the time of measuring the crops; and is, in consequence, paid a fee in grain mixed with chaff. He sometimes officiates in the capacity of a kad\u00fami, a snake-doctor.\n\n13. A v\u00e1niyan, or oilman, is to press oil for the use of the inhabitants and of the pagodas. He has no fee whatever allotted for this service, but is exempted from professional duty.\n\n14. A par-v\u00e1niyan, or chetti, keeps a shop in the village, and supplies the inhabitants with spices, and is likewise exempted from duty.\n\n15. A y\u00e9lav\u00e1nya, or gardener, to cultivate the gardens, and sell greens and fruits: he is exempted from duty also.\n\n16. Valay\u00e1n, fisherman or boatman, whose business is to open and shut the sluices of the tank; is employed at the ferry in cases where the village happens to be situated on the bank of a river; and, in consequence, enjoys terabadi-m\u00e1nya, fees, &c. He also fishes in the tanks, &c., and sells the fish in the village.\n\n17. A vochan, whose office it is to perform p\u00faja in the pagoda of the village deity, and to carry a fire-pot on his head when any dispute happens, is entitled to a fee in the village.\n\n18. Totty, kumbokutti, or rettiyan, who is a Pariar by caste, is employed in measuring all the heaps of grain, and carrying letters and money in his first capacity; in the second, he waters the fields; and in the third, burns the dead. He possesses m\u00e1nya, with fees.\nSuch are the duties and privileges of the eighteen* village officers established by Tondam\u00e1n, and in addition to these there exists a calendar Br\u00e1hman to point out lucky and unlucky days and hours for commencing ploughing, sowing, cutting the crops, irrigating, &c., and to officiate as a priest at marriages and funeral ceremonies; there are also cowkeepers or shepherds to attend the cattle and sheep of the cultivators.\n\nThus the 48,000 Vel\u00e1lars having become K\u00e1n\u00ed-\u00e1thi-kars of Tondamandal\u00e1m, their next object was to seek for permanent labourers to cultivate their lands, as they found the temporary ones were of little service to them in a place where there was property in the land for generations; for a labourer not permanently fixed might work some time with one and some time with another at pleasure; and in order to avoid this they had recourse to adumai or vassalage.\n\nAccordingly, the Vel\u00e1lars were allowed the right of buying, selling, pledging, and giving in free gift, Pariars, and certain other castes, as slaves, a practice I shall here explain.\n\nWhen a person purchases a woman with children, it is called kottu-adumai; i.e., figuratively, a cluster of vassals or slaves, and the price of it was formerly no more than two or three pagodas; no one can sell her but her master, but if she has no master, her nal-amman, mother's brother, has the power to dispose of her. She is called a paradisi-kottu when she has neither master nor nal-amman, in which case the purchaser generally contracts her through the means of the N\u00e1tamahar, or the head of the parachevi, and the price then becomes higher; the title-deed of the above purchase is always written on a bunch of palmry leaves \u2020 to show that it is a kottu-adumai.\n\nThis slave is not at liberty to marry her daughter to any one without the consent of her master; and when such marriage takes place, the lord of the slave usually defrays the charges, and at every pongal\u2021 feast he pays them rice. All children she brings forth belong to the master, who undergoes the expenses of births and deaths among them. When a mother slave wishes to get her son married, her lord supplies her with the marriage-contract money, k\u00fara and t\u00e1l\u00ed, &c.; \u00a7 but at all\n\n* In unirrigated lands a distributor of water cannot be required, and this proves that the number of village offices is regulated by local custom, and that Upper Gh\u00e1t and Lower Gh\u00e1t village customs are somewhat dissimilar.\u2014Ed.\n\n\u2020 Vide Mr. Hodgson's Memoir on the Village of Pudu-vayel, in the Trans.

Sa'\u00edd\u00e1t Allah Kh\u00e1n and others, divided the country into s\u00fabas, pargunahs, and tal\u00faks, and again tal\u00faks into mah\u00e1gans; and introduced mah\u00e1ratta daftars, on the part of the government, to each district, as well as sampretis instead of n\u00e1tkarnams.\n\nThe Niz\u00e1ms at the same time sent k\u00fanongas to this part of the country with fixed emoluments, who nominated gom\u00e1stas on their part to each of the districts; since which various offices have been established, such as desm\u00fak, dispondia, sarr\u00ed mazmu, st\u00e1lla mazmu, st\u00e1lla carnam, &c.\n\nThe duty of the mazmud\u00e1r is to keep an account of collections and disbursements, &c.; and that of the k\u00e1nonga to keep the records, such as terabadi, v\u00e1r\u00e1-chattam, list of terabadi and sannad m\u00e1nyams, and of beriz collections only, because they were employed to explain the ancient usages of the country from s\u00fabad\u00e1r down to an amuld\u00e1r of the district. The government had granted fees in every village, besides srotryms, &c., which they held as hereditary: all these in process of time became so heavy a burden on the inhabitants, that the government was obliged to bear half the expenses itself.\n\nThey next introduced n\u00e1tt\u00e1wars, to facilitate the business of the district through them; and allowed high v\u00e1ram, as well as m\u00e1nyams and srotryms. These offices were hereditary.\n\nThey then established maink\u00e1vali* polig\u00e1rs, to superintend the police of a certain number of villages and high-roads assigned to them respectively. They enjoyed fees, m\u00e1nyams, mok\u00e1ssa villages, &c.; holding every tukery to be answerable for thefts committed in the villages to the value of five pagodas, and themselves for higher sums: this office was also hereditary.\n\nMuhammed-Al\u00ed-Kh\u00e1n, the last S\u00fabad\u00e1r of the Karnatik, assumed it independently of the Niz\u00e1m of Golconda, as he himself had become an absolute sovereign, independent of the throne of Delhi. He was embarrassed with military expenses, as he was at that time engaged in contending, first with his rival Ch\u00e1nda S\u00e1hib, and then with Haidar, and therefore was necessitated to rent out the s\u00fabas for a certain sum, a part of which, called t\u00edps, was to be paid previously to the renter's departing his presence.\n\nAs soon as a renter arrives at the s\u00faba he has taken, he requires the n\u00e1tt\u00e1wars to assess the several districts of the s\u00faba, over and above the rent he had agreed to with the naw\u00e1b, to answer his expenses, such as presents to the naw\u00e1b, darb\u00e1r, kharch, &c. He then\n\n* Main, \"head;\" k\u00e1vali, \"watch.\"\nflocked to the servant and entreated him to obtain for them serva m\u0101nyams; and the man, no less generous than faithful, accordingly one day put his master in mind of his promise, signifying to him his desire, which was, to be invested with supreme government for the space of one m\u016bh\u016brtam, that is, two Indian hours. R\u0101yalu accordingly gave orders to his ministers to obey him as their king, delivering his seal into his hands.*\n\nBut he was no sooner inaugurated than he commenced distributing villages to Br\u0101hmans as serva-m\u0101nyams; and just as the limited time was expiring, R\u0101yalu sent to know what the result was; and being informed that he had already granted villages to Br\u0101hmans to the number of sixty-four, and that there were yet eight more to complete the number he had in view, and that he was sorry that the time of sovereignty was over, immediately sent orders extending the period till the man had accomplished his generous purpose; and accordingly, all the boundary-marks of the villages he had thus bestowed still retain an inscription of R\u0101yalu on horseback, and himself standing by him, with an umbrella over his head.\n\nHowever, this prince and his ancestors do not seem to have interfered with the k\u0101ni-\u0101tchi right of the inhabitants except in those villages which had been converted into agrah\u0101rams, and which, it is stated, they had purchased from the original proprietors.\n\nThe Muhammedan princes, after overturning the dynasty of R\u0101yalu, eagerly turned their attention to the reduction of this part of the country for a considerable time without success; and since, even Aurangz\u012bb tried his utmost to subvert it by deputing his sons and generals, but to no purpose; after his death, however, the Niz\u0101ms of Golconda sent their s\u016bbad\u0101rs or naw\u0101bs to subdue it, and succeeded in reducing it entirely.\n\nIn the year 1687, in the reign of Abul Husain in Golconda, or Haidar\u0101b\u0101d, his prime minister, Madana Pundit,\u2020 deputed Pod\u0101ry Lingap\u0101\u2021 to this part of the country (Karnataka) as a manager, who, during his administration, introduced many innovations in the ancient system. He abolished the serva-m\u0101nyam tenure, and introduced that of srotryams, and curtailed the v\u0101ram of the inhabitants: his assessment is called k\u0101mil beriz;\u2014this was the time the country underwent a great change.\n\n* The sun, moon, a hog, and dagger, are engraved on it; the two first to denote that the grant may continue as long as those luminaries shall last in the firmament, and the two last to prevent Musalm\u0101ns usurping the grant, by shewing, that whoever shall attempt to snatch it shall incur the sin of killing a hog with the dagger.\n\n\u2020 Akkars\u016b M\u0101dh\u016b Bh\u0101nji Surya-Pr\u0101c\u0101sa Rao, was his title.\n\n\u2021 Bamarasu Lingoji Karn\u0101ik Turfd\u0101r, was his title.\nthe first time to the inhabitants for three years; and in the years 1790 it was reduced to two collectorships again, and afterwards to one, on whom the sole management of the j\u00e1ghir devolved.\n\nUpon some plan proposed by the government in India, the executive power in England was pleased to sanction the introduction of the permanent settlement in their old possessions, with an idea, perhaps, that they would obtain a stipulated sum of rent for ever; while the proprietor of the estate would endeavour to improve it, as he was created a permanent proprietor of the soil by purchase, and the cultivators, as his tenants or under-farmers, receive their dues.* To this effect regulations were enacted, and courts established; and, in short, the whole administration bore quite a new appearance.\n\nIn the j\u00e1ghir, the principal purchasers of the lands under the permanent system were Chinnia and Paupiah, both persons of extensive property. They left the management of their zemindaries wholly to their servants, and seldom personally attended to it: I am, therefore, inclined to believe that they were ill-managed. As for the several other purchasers, they were entirely new to revenue affairs. The calamities of the season afflicted the country, and to these were added the heavy assessment which had been enacted. From these circumstances, possibly, they failed; and consequently their private properties were sequestered, and their estates sold; nay, their very bodies were seized. Hence several estates were surrendered to the government, and all those of minors underwent the same fate, except two, viz. Kunatter and Chickerkota.\n\nI shall now revert to my principal object, viz. k\u00e1ni-\u00e1tihi and V\u00e1ram. I mean to prove that not only this part of Tondamandalam, as I have stated before, was under this footing, but the more southern country, as far as Tanjore, Trichinopoly, Madura, Tuinevelly, and Kanara, as well as Mysore and Koinbatore; while Nellore, the northern Cirkars, Bengal, Bah\u00e1r, and Kashmir, in the north, were also under it.\n\nAs it is well known how the lands are held by the inhabitants in the southern parts of the j\u00e1ghir, as far as Cape Komorin, I must now direct my observations to the western and northern parts; but some able European writers having more fully treated on the subject, I shall here transcribe them in their own words.\u2020\n\n* Fourteenth condition in the Sunnat Milkayat Istimr\u00e1r:\u2014\u201cYou will conduct yourself with good faith towards your ryots, whose prosperity is inseparably connected with your own.\u201d\n\n\u2020 The author proceeds to quote passages in support of his views from the works of Dr. Buchanan Hamilton, Mr. Walter Hamilton, &c. which it is thought unnecessary to reprint here.\u2014Ed.\nI am thus led to think that the cultivators of Bengal have a private property in the soil; but according to the rules of the permanent system, it seems that the proprietary right of the soil is vested in the zemind\u0101rs.\n\nThere is also vassalage of labourers in Bengal and Bah\u00e1r, in every respect similar to the system of Tondamandalam.\n\nI shall now conclude the first part of my Memoir, by observing that the cultivators of Tondamandalam continue to enjoy the k\u0101ni-\u0101tchi, and the system of division of crops to this day, although it underwent many changes from government, and the bloody wars of the Emperors of Delhi; the B\u0101hmani princes of Dekkan, and the Niz\u0101ms; the skirmishes of Mah\u00e1rattas, and the invasions of Haidar and Tip\u00fa.\n\nAnd why? Because the hereditary right in the soil is vested in the cultivator; and the right of offices established in kudimakkal or village-servants, the vassalage of their labourers, and, above all, the principle of the division of crops on which that right is founded, were all considerations which induced them to adhere to their villages for so many ages.\n\n[To be continued.]\nANALYSIS OF WORKS.\n\nART.

Stanislas Julien, the worthy successor of the lamented Abel Remusat, has commenced his career as professor of Chinese literature by publishing translations of some of the popular tales that best illustrate the habits of thought and action which prevail in the celestial empire. As ours is not exactly a critical journal, we shall not offer any opinion on the merits of these works; but in pursuance of our plan of diffusing information on oriental subjects, we shall offer to our readers such abstracts and specimens of the several tales as may serve to illustrate the character of the Chinese school of fiction, and, consequently, the state of the Chinese mind\u2014for popular tales may justly be regarded as the personification of popular principles. Want of space rather than inclination prevents us from examining, at the same time, the professor's specimens of the Chinese drama; but as he proposes soon to translate some additional plays, we shall have another opportunity of directing attention to the subject. We shall at present confine ourselves to the romances, and we shall preserve the French orthography of proper names, as we are about to give only the outlines, not the translations of the tales.\n\nTHE DEATH OF TONG-TCHO.\n\nTowards the close of the second century of the Christian era, a little before the termination of the Han dynasty, a wicked minister, named Tong-tcho, had usurped supreme authority in China, which he maintained by the most atrocious cruelties. His adopted son Liu-pou rivalled him in wickedness, and the following account is given as a specimen of their crimes.\n\nOne day the minister was informed that some hundreds of soldiers who had revolted, but were now returned to their duty, approached the capital. Tong-tcho went to meet them at the gate of the city,\nand all the magistrates followed in his train. TONG-TCHO invited his followers to dinner; scarcely had they been seated, when he ordered all the captive soldiers to be horribly tortured in their presence. Some were deprived of their hands and feet, others had their eyes torn out; they cut away the tongues of some, and threw others into caldrons of boiling water. Bleeding and mutilated, the wretches asked for pardon, and vainly struggled against death.\n\nThe magistrates shook with fear and horror; they let fall their chopsticks, and disregarded the sumptuous banquet before them. TONG-TCHO continued to eat and drink, bursting forth at times into roars of laughter. The magistrates wished to leave the hall.\n\n\"I have killed the rebels,\" said TONG-TCHO, \"why should you be afraid?\"\n\n\"I saw a black cloud ascending to heaven,\" said the keeper of the records; \"that is an evil omen for the great officers of state.\"\n\nOn the next day TONG-TCHO had assembled all the magistrates in his palace, and had ranged them in two rows. When the wine had frequently gone the round of the assembly, LIU-POU approached TONG-TCHO and whispered in his ear.\n\n\"What! is that true?\" said TONG-TCHO, smiling. Immediately he ordered LIU-POU to seize TCHANG-WEN, the minister of public works, by the hair, and drag him out of the room. All the magistrates changed countenance.\n\n\"Yesterday,\" said TONG-TCHO, \"the keeper of the records announced misfortune to the great officers of state, and it was to this fellow his prediction referred.\"\n\nAfter the lapse of some minutes, a domestic presented, on a red plate, the head of TCHANG-WEN.\n\nTONG-TCHO ordered LIU-POU to pour out wine to the guests, and at the same time exhibit the bleeding head to each. The magistrates were filled with terror; they dared not look at each other, for fear of betraying the horror that froze their blood!\n\nWANG-YUN, a virtuous minister, had witnessed these sanguinary scenes, and on his return home anxiously pondered on the means of rescuing his country from such atrocious tyranny. A female servant that he had educated with the most tender care, witnessed his anxieties, and could not suppress her grief when she saw the restless motions that told of his mental struggles. The sight of the lovely maiden suggested a project to WANG-YUN, which he instantly prepared to execute. He proposed to offer her in marriage both to TONG-TCHO and LIU-POU, hoping that their mutual jealousy might prepare the way their destruction. TIAO-TCHAN, such was the damsel's\nname, entered readily into the scheme, and promised to second it with her utmost efforts.\n\nWang-yun invited Liu-pou to dinner, and presented the maiden as his daughter; Liu-pou was so enchanted with her appearance, that he instantly made proposals of marriage, and a day was fixed for the nuptials. Tong-tcho was in the meantime invited, and Tiao-tchan appeared before him as a music girl. The minister ordered her to be immediately conveyed to his palace. Nothing could exceed the rage of Liu-pou when he received this intelligence; and his wrath was craftily aggravated by Wang-yun, who averred that he had told the minister of the contract between the maiden and his son. At the same time, Tiao-tchan added fresh fuel to the flame, by pretending the most extravagant grief for the loss of her proposed husband.\n\nIn the mean time a secret order for the death of Tong-tcho had been obtained from the emperor, and the execution of it was intrusted by Wang-yun to Liu-pou, at a moment when rage and jealousy had driven him almost to madness, and the wicked minister was slain. All the males and females belonging to his family were exterminated, and the instruments of his cruelty were sacrificed to popular vengeance.\n\nThis tale is an episode from a great historical romance, extending to twenty volumes, said to be one of the works most valued by the Chinese literati.\n\nWe come next to a tale of domestic life, entitled,\n\nTHE MYSTERIOUS PAINTING.\n\nUnder the Ming dynasty, in the early part of the fifteenth century; there lived an old governor named Ni, who, at the advanced age of eighty, being struck with the beauty of Mei-chi, one of his farmers' daughters, took her to wife. This extraordinary proceeding gave great offence to his son Chen-ki, a sordid miser, who feared that the young spouse might inherit a large portion of the old man's property. His fears were greatly increased when a son was born to Ni, and Chen-ki loudly declared that he would never acknowledge the child as his brother. Chen-chiu was the name given by the fond governor to the child of his old age: he had scarcely attained the age of five years when Ni was attacked by a fever, the symptoms of which were declared mortal. Chen-ki presented himself to his father, and received from him a will in which, contrary to his expectations, he found himself named sole heir to the entire property. Mei-chi protested against an arrangement which left both herself and her little boy at the mercy of an avaricious enemy; but the governor told her that otherwise their lives would not be safe, and gave her a painting\nand all the magistrates followed in his train. TONG-TCHO invited his followers to dinner; scarcely had they been seated, when he ordered all the captive soldiers to be horribly tortured in their presence. Some were deprived of their hands and feet, others had their eyes torn out; they cut away the tongues of some, and threw others into caldrons of boiling water. Bleeding and mutilated, the wretches asked for pardon, and vainly struggled against death.\n\nThe magistrates shook with fear and horror; they let fall their chopsticks, and disregarded the sumptuous banquet before them. TONG-TCHO continued to eat and drink, bursting forth at times into roars of laughter. The magistrates wished to leave the hall.\n\n\"I have killed the rebels,\" said TONG-TCHO, \"why should you be afraid?\"\n\n\"I saw a black cloud ascending to heaven,\" said the keeper of the records; \"that is an evil omen for the great officers of state.\"\n\nOn the next day TONG-TCHO had assembled all the magistrates in his palace, and had ranged them in two rows. When the wine had frequently gone the round of the assembly, LIU-POU approached TONG-TCHO and whispered in his ear.\n\n\"What! is that true?\" said TONG-TCHO, smiling. Immediately he ordered LIU-POU to seize TCHANG-WEN, the minister of public works, by the hair, and drag him out of the room. All the magistrates changed countenance.\n\n\"Yesterday,\" said TONG-TCHO, \"the keeper of the records announced misfortune to the great officers of state, and it was to this fellow his prediction referred.\"\n\nAfter the lapse of some minutes, a domestic presented, on a red plate, the head of TCHANG-WEN.\n\nTONG-TCHO ordered LIU-POU to pour out wine to the guests, and at the same time exhibit the bleeding head to each. The magistrates were filled with terror; they dared not look at each other, for fear of betraying the horror that froze their blood!\n\nWANG-YUN, a virtuous minister, had witnessed these sanguinary scenes, and on his return home anxiously pondered on the means of rescuing his country from such atrocious tyranny. A female servant that he had educated with the most tender care, witnessed his anxieties, and could not suppress her grief when she saw the restless motions that told of his mental struggles. The sight of the lovely maiden suggested a project to WANG-YUN, which he instantly prepared to execute. He proposed to offer her in marriage both to TONG-TCHO and LIU-POU, hoping that their mutual jealousy might prepare the way for their mutual destruction. TIAO-TCHAN, such was the damsel's\nA ray of light illuminated the picture, and shewed him, between two leaves of paper, several perpendicular lines which resembled writing. The magistrate was struck, he at once unrolled the paper and found that the governor had concealed under his picture an important communication.\n\nThe paper in effect renewed the former bequest to Chen-ki, but reserved to Chen-chu a little cottage to the left of his father's palace. It stated, however, that under the floor of this cottage a sum of money was concealed equivalent to the estates possessed by Chen-ki; and it directed, that from this sum one thousand pieces of gold should be paid to the ingenious magistrate who might penetrate the mystery of the picture.\n\nThe magistrate issued an order for a trial of the question respecting the inheritance of the late governor Ni in Chen-ki's palace, and commanded Mei-chi and her son to attend. They came alone, while Chen-ki was supported by a crowd of friends and relations. When the judge entered, instead of taking the seat prepared for him, he made a profound salutation as if it had been already occupied, affecting to see in it the ghost of governor Ni.\n\nAll the company, observing his gestures and movements, which seemed to announce that he conversed with an invisible being, dared not stir a step. They remained ranged in two lines, and regarded him with an air of stupefaction.\n\nSuddenly the judge, crossing his arms on his breast, made a low bow; \"your wife,\" said he (addressing the supposed spirit of the governor) \"has placed in my hands a complaint respecting the disposal of your inheritance. Are the assertions she makes true?\"\n\nHaving spoken, he assumed the air of a person listening with profound and respectful attention; then, shaking his head and looking surprised, he said, \"What! is it possible that your eldest son can have displayed such perversity?\" He appeared to listen for a moment. \"Where do you wish that your second son should find the means of existence?\"\n\nAfter a pause of some moments, \"What resources can the wretched house of which you speak afford;\"\u2014a pause;\u2014\"I obey, I obey;\"\u2014a pause. \"I shall take every means of securing your second son his inheritance; be assured I shall pay every attention to your wishes.\"\n\nHe then made several salutations, and assumed the look of a man declining a favour. \"It is impossible for me to accept so rich a gift;\"\u2014a pause. \"Well, since you insist upon it I must comply.\"\n\nPretending that the spirit now beckoned him away, he called on the rest of the company to follow, and convinced them of the reality\nwhich she was to keep until her son attained the age of manhood, and then send for explanation to some very intelligent magistrate.\n\nOn the death of Ni, Chen-ki drove Mei-chu and her boy from the palace, but permitted them to reside in a ruined summer-house at the bottom of the garden. Here they struggled with poverty until Chen-chu had attained his fourteenth year.\n\nArrived at this age, the poor boy began to reflect on his condition; and with the usual imprudence of youth, ventured to remonstrate with the elder brother in very angry terms. Chen-ki drove him from his presence with stripes; and to avoid any future remonstrance, sent him and his mother to a distant farm, too barren to cause any reluctance in his miserly bosom for parting with it. Chen-chu remonstrated with his mother for tamely going into hopeless exile; and she, overcome by his importunities, revealed the secret of the mysterious painting. The boy asked to see it; his mother produced it, and when opened it proved to be a portrait of Ni. Chen-chu prostrated himself before the representation of his father, and then proceeded to examine the picture more attentively.\n\nHe beholds a person of importance seated, clothed in a dress of rich silk, with hair white as snow, the traits of whose countenance had such truth of expression that it was impossible almost to avoid believing that a living man, and not a picture, was before him. One hand held a young child pressed closely to the bosom; the other, turned downwards, seemed to point at the ground.\n\nThe picture afforded ample scope for conjecture, both to the mother and son; but they felt that guessing was but an idle waste of time, and Chen-chu resolved to search out an intelligent magistrate, as his father had directed. The very next day, when on his road to a neighbouring village, he heard of a case of the detection of two murderers by circumstantial evidence, which shewed wondrous skill in the magistrate that conducted the investigation. To him he went, accompanied by his mother, related all the circumstances, and placed the portrait in his hands.\n\nFor several days the magistrate spent hours in examining the painting without being able to penetrate the mystery; accident at length proved his friend.\n\nOne evening the magistrate went on his terrace again to examine the painting, and, whilst contemplating it, ordered tea to be brought. Whilst turning to take the cup from his servant, his foot tripped, and he spilled a portion of the tea over the picture. Laying down the cup, he took the picture in both hands, and went to hang it from the balustrade, that it might be dried by the heat of the sun. Suddenly\na ray of light illuminated the picture, and shewed him, between two leaves of paper, several perpendicular lines which resembled writing. The magistrate was struck, he at once unrolled the paper and found that the governor had concealed under his picture an important communication.\n\nThe paper in effect renewed the former bequest to Chen-ki, but reserved to Chen-chu a little cottage to the left of his father's palace. It stated, however, that under the floor of this cottage a sum of money was concealed equivalent to the estates possessed by Chen-ki; and it directed, that from this sum one thousand pieces of gold should be paid to the ingenious magistrate who might penetrate the mystery of the picture.\n\nThe magistrate issued an order for a trial of the question respecting the inheritance of the late governor Ni in Chen-ki's palace, and commanded Mei-chiu and her son to attend. They came alone, while Chen-ki was supported by a crowd of friends and relations. When the judge entered, instead of taking the seat prepared for him, he made a profound salutation as if it had been already occupied, affecting to see in it the ghost of governor Ni.\n\nAll the company, observing his gestures and movements, which seemed to announce that he conversed with an invisible being, dared not stir a step. They remained ranged in two lines, and regarded him with an air of stupefaction.\n\nSuddenly the judge, crossing his arms on his breast, made a low bow; \"your wife,\" said he (addressing the supposed spirit of the governor) \"has placed in my hands a complaint respecting the disposal of your inheritance. Are the assertions she makes true?\"\n\nHaving spoken, he assumed the air of a person listening with profound and respectful attention; then, shaking his head and looking surprised, he said, \"What! is it possible that your eldest son can have displayed such perversity?\" He appeared to listen for a moment. \"Where do you wish that your second son should find the means of existence?\"\n\nAfter a pause of some moments, \"What resources can the wretched house of which you speak afford;\"\u2014a pause;\u2014\"I obey, I obey;\"\u2014a pause. \"I shall take every means of securing your second son his inheritance; be assured I shall pay every attention to your wishes.\"\n\nHe then made several salutations, and assumed the look of a man declining a favour. \"It is impossible for me to accept so rich a gift;\"\u2014a pause. \"Well, since you insist upon it I must comply.\"\n\nPretending that the spirit now beckoned him away, he called on the rest of the company to follow, and convinced them of the reality\nof the vision by accurately describing from the picture the features of governor Ni. He then led them to the little cottage which he declared Ni had designed to be the appanage of his younger son. As the cottage was in ruins, and had been long used only as a lumber store, Chen-ki, glad to get off so well, cheerfully assigned it to his brother. No sooner was the deed of gift complete, than the judge revealed the secret of the hidden treasure, which he assigned to Chen-chu. He did not forget, at the same time, to take the thousand pieces of gold assigned to himself; thus, as the Chinese author says, fulfilling the proverb, \"when the crab and the gull fall out, the fisherman profits by the quarrel.\"\n\nThe next story of which we have to give an account is also a tale of domestic life; it is called,\n\nTHE TWO BROTHERS OF DIFFERENT SEXES.\n\nAbout the beginning of the fifteenth century, in the time of the Ming dynasty, there lived an old man named Lieou-te, in the village of Wau, which stands on the banks of the great canal about sixty miles from the capital. Lieou-te was childless, but he regarded the whole human race as part of his family; and, though an innkeeper, was celebrated through the province for probity and generosity. When his neighbours blamed him for making restitution to those who by accident overpaid him, and said,\n\n\"What a fool you are to rectify their errors! The overplus was a present from Heaven, by which you ought to profit.\"\n\n\"I have no children,\" he replied; \"this misfortune doubtless arises from my not having practised virtue in a previous state of existence; Heaven punishes me in my present life, by depriving me of an heir who may after my death offer funeral sacrifices at my grave; and if this misfortune has not been decreed by destiny, by keeping the smallest coin belonging to another I should doubtless bring on my head some dire calamity or mortal illness. What profit should I have from a small addition to my fortune? Is it not better to render unto all their due? such conduct must be a pledge of future prosperity.\"\n\nOne day, in the midst of a dreadful storm of snow, an old man, accompanied by a very young boy, came to the inn, and Lieou-te hastened to place refreshments before them. Observing that the old man forbore to touch meat, and contented himself with vegetables, Lieou-te asked if he had made a vow of fasting? Learning, in reply, that this abstinence arose from dread of the expense of a good dinner, Lieou-te told the travellers to regard themselves as his invited guests,\nand eat freely. As the violence of the storm did not abate, Lieou-te invited the travellers to spend the night with him, assuring them that he would not expect or receive any remuneration.\n\nDuring the night, the old traveller was seized with a violent fever, and, though the generous innkeeper procured him medical advice and every comfort that his situation required, he died within seven days. The orphan boy was adopted by Lieou-te and his wife, who gave him the name of Lieou-fang.\n\nFrom the moment of his adoption the boy shewed a fond and grateful respect to his new parents. He left them not by day or night\u2014he anticipated all their wishes, and displayed towards them all the tenderness and affection that the most devoted filial love could inspire.\n\nAfter the lapse of two years, a boat was wrecked during a violent storm on the canal. The cries of the people attracted the notice of Lieou-fang; he ran to the bank and saw extended on it a young man about his own age, who had indeed escaped from the wreck, but was so grievously wounded that his recovery seemed impossible. Such a sight recalled to Lieou-fang the misfortunes he had so recently endured, and he ordered the sufferer to be conveyed to the inn, having previously gained the consent of his adopted parents.\n\nThe benevolent innkeeper bestowed every possible care on his new guest, who was named Lieou-ki; but his recovery was very slow, and months elapsed before he was sufficiently recovered to resume his travels. His purpose was to bury the remains of his parents in their native village, and he was transporting them thither in a coffer at the time he was wrecked. When Lieou-ki had acquired sufficient strength, his generous host supplied him with a horse and purse to support him on his road. He reached the spot of his birth, but found that the village had been destroyed by an inundation, so that it was impossible to recognise the sepulchre of his fathers; he therefore resolved to return to Wau, and solicit his benefactor for permission to bury his parents in his family tomb.\n\nThe innkeeper welcomed his return and gladly acceded to his request. He made the second wanderer also his child by adoption, and Lieou-fang and Lieou-ki emulously laboured to soothe the declining days of their adopted parents.\n\nTime rolled on, the innkeeper and his wife were seized with a mortal malady; but they died contented, knowing that the children they had chosen would perform the due funeral rites and \"secure their spirits a tranquil repose near the ni fountains that water the sable empire.\" Nor was this confidence n d.\nWe should vainly attempt to depict the grief of the two (adopted) children. They wept, they groaned, they accused heaven and earth, they wished to exchange their lives for those of their parents, or at least to follow them to the tomb.\n\nThey immediately prepared with all possible magnificence the biers and the winding-sheets, and they hired several bonzes to recite during nine days the office for the dead, in order to facilitate the passage of their souls into a blissful immortality.\n\nThe brothers gave up the inn and opened a cloth warehouse; fortune favoured their probity and industry, so that in three years they found themselves in possession of great wealth. Many of their neighbours, witnessing their prosperity, became anxious to be connected with them, and offered them their daughters in marriage. Lieou-ki, the elder, but the more recently adopted of the brothers, was anxious to accept some of these proposals, but Lieou-fang zealously maintained the superior advantages of remaining as they were. Lieou-ki vainly endeavoured to discover the cause of this disinclination.\n\nOne day he saw a swallow building its nest on a beam, and to sound the intentions of Lieou-fang he took a pencil and wrote on the wall some verses to the following effect:\n\nSee, how the swallows build their humble nest,\nAnd toil together through the livelong day,\nBy mutual love and fond affection blest;\nThey feel not pain, and care has fled away.\nBut if the male in spring remained alone,\nAnd sought no mate his grief or joy to share,\nThe joys of offspring had been now unknown,\nHis nest a desert, cheerless, silent, bare.\n\nLieou-fang having seen these verses, read them over several times with a smile, and at length taking his pencil, wrote beneath them a reply, using the very same rhymes.\n\nSee how the swallows build their humble nest\nAnd sport from morning to declining day,\nHeaven has their race with such sweet feeling blest,\nAnd pointed out to happiness their way.\nThe female loves not to remain alone,\nShe finds a partner and fulfils her share;\nWhy to the male is she as yet unknown?\nWhy left the pangs of solitude to bear?\n\n\"If I rightly comprehend these verses,\" said Lieou-ki, filled with astonishment, \"my brother is a young lady!\"\nMany circumstances confirmatory of this suspicion occurred to his mind; but before taking any steps in consequence, he resolved to consult some friend. The opinion of his friend confirmed his own; he returned home resolved to obtain decisive information by means of poetry.\n\n\"My brother,\" said he to Lieou-Fang, \"I admire very much the verses you wrote on the swallow, but I want talent to imitate them; would you oblige me by writing a few more on the same subject?\"\n\nLieou-Fang took the pencil with a smile, and wrote some additional verses, with the same rhymes, to the following effect:\n\nSee how the swallows build their humble nest,\nIn mutual love behold them spend the day;\nSpring finds and leaves them still content and blest,\nAnd offspring cheers when summer fades away.\n\nA precious gem neglected lay, and lone,\nFor wisdom fell not to the owner's share\u2014\nShould he not grieve that he had never known\nA treasure which light toil would have laid bare.\n\nThe hint in the last verse was too plain to be misunderstood. Lieou-Fang confessed her sex; a marriage soon followed, and those who had long loved each other as brothers, were bound together in more tender affection as man and wife.\n\nThe last and most important of these romances now claims our attention. It differs from those we have already examined in being founded on popular superstitions, and in being written within the present century. It is entitled\n\nWHITE AND BLUE; OR, THE SERPENT FAIRIES.\n\nIn the thirteenth century of the Christian era, under the Mongolian dynasty of Youan, there was a young man named Han-Wen, who having lost his parents at an early age, was carefully educated by his sister and her husband. When he grew up, a situation was procured for him in the shop of a medical practitioner named Wang, when he became distinguished by his talents and close attention to business. Leaving him for a time, we must turn to the \"mountain of the blue city.\"\n\nThis mountain bristled with lofty peaks rising in whimsical disorder one above the other, and its precipitous ridges extended several miles. It was also called \"the fifth heaven with mysterious grottoes,\" because it had seventy-two grottoes, answering to the divisions of the\nyear, and eight large caves corresponding with the epochs of the seasons. It is an old saying, that a lofty mountain is always tenanted by supernatural beings, and that craggy peaks are the haunts of spirits. Among the caves of this mountain was one called the grotto of pure air, tenanted by a spirit that animated the body of a white snake, who had spent entire ages there in the practice of virtue. The rarest flowers adorned this mysterious cavern; a thousand unknown plants vied there in displaying the most brilliant colours and exhaling the most delightful perfumes. The foot of man had never trodden this charming retreat where peace and silence reigned; it was a fit spot for purifying the soul by intellectual meditation. Now the white snake had dwelt in this grotto eighteen hundred years, during which time she had devoted herself entirely to the practice of virtue, and had never harmed a single individual. As she had cultivated wisdom during this long course of time, she had acquired in an eminent degree the power of working miracles. She had taken the name of Blanche; but at bottom she was still an animal, not having yet raised herself from this disgraceful condition by attaining the perfection of virtue.\n\nAt length this mysterious being resolved to make an excursion of pleasure and visit the beautiful lake Li-hou. She ascended her car of clouds and sailed through the air; but, unfortunately, in the midst of her journey she encountered the mighty genius of the North Pole, the deadly enemy of serpent-fairies. To save her life she declared that she was on her way to the southern ocean, to inquire her fate from its deity.\n\n\"If,\" she continued, \"I have told a falsehood, may I be buried under the pagoda of Loui-pong!\" Blanche thus escaped for the moment, but her vow was registered in the sacred books of the gods. Having reached the city of Hang-tcheou, Blanche descended in the gardens of a palace which men had long deserted, but she found the place occupied by a blue serpent-fairy, who wished to expel her as an intruder. A contest ensued in which Blanche was victorious, and the blue snake became her servant. They lived for some time together, and one day, each assuming a human form, they went to walk by the lake Li-hou.\n\nIt happened that on the same day, Han-wen returning from offering sacrifices at the tomb of his parents, went to visit the beautiful shores of the lake. Blanche, as had been predestined five hundred years before, instantly fell in love with him, and Han-wen was as suddenly inspired by a strong attachment to the white fairy. During a heavy shower of rain all the parties embarked in the same boat; An-wen lent the ladies an umbrella, and when he called for it the\nnext morning, proposals of marriage were mutually made and accepted.\n\nHAN-WEN was poor, and in order to provide money for the expenses of the nuptials, BLANCHE sent her familiar spirits to steal a thousand ounces of gold from the royal treasury. It happened that HAN-WEN's brother-in-law, KOU-G-FOU, was the keeper of the treasury; he had been punished as soon as the money was missed, and threatened with death unless he discovered the robber. Whilst he sat overwhelmed with anxiety, HAN-WEN came in to tell his good fortune, and exhibit the gold he had received from his spouse. KOU-G-FOU recognised the royal stamp, and gave information to the governor! HAN-WEN was arrested and dragged before his tribunal. He narrated the circumstances as they occurred, but his tale was scarcely credited, when messengers, sent to search the palace where BLANCHE resided, returned declaring that they found it untenanted. HAN-WEN was sentenced to be exiled from the province for three years, the governor deeming that punishment sufficient, as the money had been recovered. The unfortunate bridegroom departed to another city, but he carried letters of introduction from his former master, which procured him an excellent situation with M. WOU, an eminent medical practitioner at Lou-tcheou.\n\nBLANCHE had by magic art discovered all these events; she rendered herself invisible when the governor's messengers searched her palace, and she resolved to follow her betrothed to his new residence. HAN-WEN at first refused to recognise her, but she prepared an artful story by which WOU was deceived, and HAN-WEN was persuaded by his master to complete the marriage. The generous WOU divided his shop with HAN-WEN, and enabled him to commence business on his own account. No sooner had the new medical practitioner commenced business, than Blanche caused an endemic disease to spread through the country, and supplied her husband with the pills by which alone it could be cured. Fame and fortune rapidly followed his success, and he became every day more fond of a wife to whom he was indebted for such prosperity.\n\nOne day he went to worship in the temple of Liu-tsou, and found there a TOO-SSE, or religious mendicant, who knew by the first glance that HAN-WEN was the victim of some magical delusion. The TOO-SSE revealed the secret to the astonished physician, and sold him some which he believed sufficient to counteract the power of\n\nBLANCHE had attained greater power than the men-\n\nshe easily discovered the circumstances of the talismans from her husband on his return, and\nwent to the temple, resolved to take vengeance on the meddling Too-sse.\n\nHan-wen was obliged to accompany her. They went to the temple, and found the mendicant sitting in the principal hall.\n\n\"Scoundrel Too-sse!\" cried Blanche, \"have you dared to come into this holy place to plunder my husband! Instantly restore the money you have received, if you desire to escape with life.\"\n\nThe mendicant returned a scornful answer; and Blanche challenged him to a trial in magical skill. He spoke the spell-word of power, and flinging from a vase some drops of water in the air, produced a dreadful storm that hid the heavens and shook the earth.\n\n\"Your power is very feeble,\" said Blanche with a smile; \"it is scarce worthy of being named.\" She muttered a magic spell, and pointing her finger to the sky, cried with a voice of thunder, \"Let the clouds disperse, let the rain cease, and let the bright luminary of day shine with his usual splendour!\"\n\nThe holy man seeing that his charm was broken, seized the precious sword which hung from his girdle, and raised it to strike his enemy; but suddenly thousands of luminous clouds surrounded the head of Blanche, and encircled it with a halo of glory. She then took the scarf, called the scarf of heaven and earth, and threw it over her head. The precious sword could no longer reach her, and only beat the air with idle blows. Blanche again spoke words of power, and pointing with her finger to the precious sword, said, in a voice of thunder, \"Fall!\" It immediately tumbled into the dust. She seized it, and it became invisible. She then exclaimed in a commanding tone, \"Where art thou, valiant warrior with the yellow bonnet? Quick! seize this treacherous mendicant, and hang him up between heaven and earth.\"\n\nAt her call \"the valiant warrior with the yellow bonnet\" appeared, and seizing the holy man, hung him in the midst of the air, and, by the command of Blanche, punished him with heavy blows. The Too-sse was forced to beg for mercy; and Blanche thus escaped the danger by which she was threatened.\n\nBut she was soon to encounter a more imminent peril. On a festive day the Chinese are accustomed to drink wine medicated with sulphur; and sulphur they believe is an effectual remedy against all magical spells. The two fairies long consulted on the means of escaping this danger; and at length they agreed that the blue fairy should feign sickness, and that Blanche should endeavour to escape from tasting the dangerous potion. In spite, however, of remonstrance, she was obliged by her husband to swallow some of the medicated\nwine; and finding that she must for a time resume her original form, she feigned a sudden illness, and requested him to take a walk until she should recover.\n\nHan-wen's anxiety brought him back sooner than Blanche expected; he approached her bed, and drawing aside the curtain, beheld his wife transformed into a white serpent. He gave a shriek of horror, and fell dead on the floor.\n\nBlanche resolved at all hazards to restore her husband to life, but could devise no better means than to ascend to the celestial mansions, and attempt to steal some of the divine ambrosia. She mounted her car of clouds, and ascended to the divine regions. She approached the grotto of the venerable goddess Ching-mou; but was prevented from entering by a young man, with the head of a white ape, who kept watch at the entrance. Blanche in a fit of sudden wrath wounded the guardian of the grotto with a poisoned ball, and then fled to escape the vengeance of the goddess. Ching-mou, on hearing the complaint of her servant, chased and overtook Blanche; she was about to cut her in pieces, when the god Kouan-in appeared, and thus described the destiny of the fairy:\n\n\"Fate has for many ages pre-established the marriage of this white serpent and Han-wen. By their means the genius of the star Wen-sing (the star of intelligence) shall become incarnate. When he shall have attained the age of a month, a holy man will come and bury the white serpent under the pagoda of Loui-pong, according to the oath which she herself swore to the genius of the polar star. When the incarnate Wen-sing shall have attained an illustrious name, and procured posthumous honours for his parents, this fairy may expect to be elevated to the rank of the gods.\"\n\nChing-mou readily spared the life of one with whom such important destinies were connected; and Blanche was sent by Kouan-in to get a branch of the tree of life from the genius of the austral pole. On her return she was met by a demon who hated fairies; his shape was that of a young man with a stork's head, and at sight of him Blanche expired from terrors. But the supreme Budd'ha sent one of his favourite spirits\u2014a young man with a parrot's head\u2014to restore her to life. Having escaped all these wondrous dangers, Blanche reached home, and had the art to persuade her husband that his terror or death was merely a fainting fit.\n\nHan-wen soon after appointed to make the annual offerings; and Blanche sent her demons to procure\njewels for the purpose from the royal treasury. The robbery was discovered, and Han-wen exiled a second time. Blanche followed him, and had the art again to effect a reconciliation. A Budd'hist priest, however, one day met the physician, and persuaded him to seek refuge from sorcery in a monastery on the Golden Mountain. Blanche went to attack her new enemy, hoping to triumph over him as she had over the Too-sse; but the priest was her superior in power; the storm she raised destroyed an innocent village, but left the monastery unhurt; and Blanche would have lost her life had not Budd'ha again interfered.\n\nBlanche once more persuaded her husband to receive her, and soon after Wen-sing was born. This event increased the love that Han-wen felt for his spouse; and he was especially delighted by her proposing that the boy should be regarded as the future husband of the only daughter of Han-wen's sister. But a month after the birth of the child, her great enemy the old priest was commissioned by Budd'ha to receive the soul of Blanche in a golden vase, and bury her beneath the pagoda of Loui-pong. The priest contrived that the magic vase should be conveyed to Blanche by her husband. The moment it was brought into her presence, flames ascending from it surrounded the body of the unfortunate fairy; and she found that her last hour was come. After an affectionate farewell to her husband and family, she submitted to her destiny; and Han-wen retired to a monastery.\n\nThe incarnate Wen-sing, or Mong-kiao, as the child was called, remained under the guardianship of his uncle and aunt, who educated him as carefully as if he had been their own child. Accident revealed to him the fate of his parents, and the importance of his making such progress in literature as would enable him to procure for them posthumous honours. Thus incited, he devoted himself to study so earnestly, that when he reached the years of maturity he obtained the highest literary distinctions in the empire. On his petition to the emperor, honorary titles were accorded to Han-wen and Blanche. Han-wen was brought from his monastery to his sister's house; and the old priest was sent by Budd'ha from his celestial mansions to terminate the penance of Blanche. After a long and interesting conversation, the old priest addressed Blanche:\n\n\"The measure of your misfortunes and sufferings is this day complete; you must no longer remain in this step on this piece of white silk, that I may raise you.\" Blanche obeyed; the priest pointed\nwhich instantly changed into a radiant cloud, that gently embraced Blanche, and raised her to the ninth heaven, shining with brilliancy and glory.\n\nThe priest next spread on the ground a piece of blue silk, and called Han-wen. \"My worthy disciple,\" said he, \"step on this piece of blue silk, that I may raise you to heaven to share the happiness of your spouse.\"\n\nThe priest having pronounced the spell, the silk was changed into an azure cloud, which surrounded Han-wen, and raised him majestically into the air. The two groups of luminous clouds floated gently towards the west, and were lost in space.\n\nIt only remains to tell that Mong-kiao, or rather Wen-sino, married his cousin, that they had a numerous offspring, and that their descendants attained the highest dignities in China.\nART. XXVII.\u2014Biographical Sketch of his late Royal Highness Abbas Mirza, Prince Royal of Persia, Hon. M.R.A.S.,* &c. &c.\n\nAmongst the crowned heads and princes of royal blood in Asia who have taken an interest in the welfare of the Royal Asiatic Society, we have to name the Sh\u00e1h of Persia, and his second son, the Prince Royal, Abbas Mirza. The latter is lost to his country and to us; and the untimely termination of his career is both a matter of public concern, and has especial claims on the notice and sympathy of the Society, from the peculiar relation in which his Royal Highness stood with respect to it.\n\nIn the ardent pursuit of his views of public administration, and thwarted, perhaps, in the prosecution of his schemes for the total subjugation of Khoras\u00e1n, and the recovery of the anciently more extended boundary of the empire in the direction of Her\u00e1t and Kandah\u00e1r, Abbas Mirza unhappily fell a victim to the attack of an epidemic disorder last year, while marching to rejoin his army. The loss of a favourite son, and the disappointment attendant on the annihilation of plans formed to secure the future tranquillity of his kingdom, were almost too much for the exhausted frame and constitution of the Sh\u00e1h, so that the greatest apprehensions were entertained for his safety. His majesty, however, has recovered, and, it is understood, has since named his grandson, Prince Muhammed Mirza, the eldest son of the late Prince Royal, and now about twenty-seven years of age, as his successor to the throne.\n\nAbbas Mirza was known to the western world as a prince who laboured to introduce such improvements in his country as might enable the people to emulate, in military prowess and in literary attainments, the present generation in Europe, and who studied, for the advancement of this object, to communicate to them the active habits and superior intelligence of those Europeans who visited the Persian court. Not a little was effected, within the sphere of the prince's direct authority, by slight changes in the national costume.\n\n* We are principally indebted for the materials of this sketch to the kindness of Major Sir Henry Willock, K.L.S., a gentleman who, in his official capacity as British Charg\u00e9 d'Affaires at the Persian court, had ample opportunities of becoming acquainted with the character and views of the enlightened prince in question.\u2014\nThe skirt of the garment was shortened; the European shoe was substituted for the Persian slipper; and the hitherto slip-shod shambling citizen of Tabriz, having the better use of his limbs, now stepped with firmness and alacrity, so that a general improvement of gait, as well as a gradual development of increased activity, were the results of an apparently trifling alteration. All travellers, indeed, have been struck by the manliness of a native of Azerbaijan of the present day, when contrasted with the effeminacy, and proneness to luxury and sensuality, of the modern youth of Shiraz and the southern provinces. Of the prince's own costume, the distinguishing characteristic was simplicity; and thus the broad cloth of Europe, and the cotton fabric (kedek) of Persia, supplanted the brocades and silk stuffs which were formerly in use.\n\nBut the spirit of improvement set on foot by the Prince Royal produced a marked and beneficial change in the habits and manners in general of those subject to his authority; while the capital of the province of which he was governor might, in comparison with other parts of Persia, be considered as Europe in Asia.\n\nHow far the introduction of the European system of military tactics has proved beneficial to Persia, it is not our province to inquire; but it may be stated, that whether good or bad, it was the work of Abbas Mirza. It undoubtedly made the government formidable to Turks, Arabs, Afghans, and Uzbeks; but the calamitous result of two successive struggles against the hardy troops of Russia, may lead to the inference that a more efficient resistance might have been made by an adherence to the peculiar mode of warfare for which Persia was anciently celebrated.\n\nIn the prosecution of the same enlightened views, Abbas Mirza sent some young men to be educated in England, and it was his wish that they should translate such works from the English into the Persian language, as were fitted to improve the knowledge and direct the taste of their countrymen. In connexion with this subject it may also be mentioned, that he established a printing-press at Tabriz, and the Society is in possession of works* executed at this establishment which, for beauty of type, far exceed any thing that has been yet produced either in Europe or India, if we except the specimens recently pub-\n\n---\n\n*Muharrak al Kulub; or, Discourses on the Martyrdom of some of the principal Mohammedan Saints; a work compiled in the reign of Karim Khan, by Mulla Ali, of Nurgah, at the request of Abdul Riza Khan, of Kashan; and Huqat, a work written by Mulla Ibrahim, in the time of Harum-ar-Rashid. For these works the Society is indebted to the attention of Sir Henry...\nlished by the Native Education Society at Bombay,* which nearly equal in excellence the finest manuscripts; and the latter, it should be remarked, are not printed, but lithographed.\n\nAbbas Mirza was remarkable for the comeliness of his person and the elegance of his address. His command of language and power of pleasing were conspicuous, and rendered his conversation fascinating; it may, indeed, be said, that no person ever left his royal highness's presence without being strongly impressed with his superior talent and cultivated taste.\n\nIn his public character as a governor he was mild, open to appeal, and the injured never sued in vain for redress. He afforded the greatest encouragement to commerce; merchants of respectability were not denied access to him, and all private property was respected. His confidence in the individual respectability and probity of Englishmen was unbounded, and he preferred their services to those of natives of other countries. Of the many European adventurers who entered his employment, none left him dissatisfied; and he never failed to adhere to his engagements even with those who had not fulfilled the expectations to which their pretensions had given rise, while in his private pecuniary transactions he was strictly just and honest. His character altogether, indeed, had so much of the ancient principles of truth, simplicity, and general interest for the welfare of his country in its composition, that, since the history of almost every age shews us, more or less, how the energies of one man who is supreme may impel, and even seem to inspire the faculties of the nation he governs, it was not difficult to fancy in Abbas Mirza the individual whose powerful and liberal mind was to create a new epoch in the destinies of his future kingdom towards which his views were so elevated and expanded; while he contemplated the higher range in civilisation attained by the nations of Europe with a rare disposition of candour and liberality; no petty jealousy for a moment clouded his brow when conversing on such subjects, but a noble emulation to tread the same glorious path seemed the pervading feeling of his heart.\u2020\n\nIt is unnecessary to touch on the failings of this prince, for though many blemishes obscured the bright points of his character, yet, making due allowances for the deficiencies of an Asiatic education, and the baneful influence of that flattery and adulation which corrupt and\n\n* The Anw\u0101r\u012b Sohail\u012b of Husain V\u0101iz K\u0101sh\u012bf\u012b, folio, published in 1828; and the History of the rise and progress of the Muhammedan power in India, by Mu\u1e25ammed K\u0101sim Ferishta, in two vols. folio, published in 1833.

It is in itself no slight praise to say, that his royal highness was far superior to all his countrymen in endowments and intelligence.

In his autobiographical memoirs, by Major David Price, M.R.A.S., he informs us that he sat on the throne of Hindust\u00e1n in the month of October 1605, at the age of thirty-eight, and that he was called Muhammed Selim, in honour of a celebrated saint of that name, for whose disciples he ever bore the highest respect; he also describes his throne and crown, which were of immense value. His dominions, consisting of two provinces, extended from Kandah\u00e1r, on the north-west, south-east point of Bengal, producing a revenue of nearly 50,000 sterling.\n\nThe first political event of his reign was the rebellion of his son Khusrav, whose mother was sister of the celebrated Hindu Raj\u00e1 Man Sinha, and whose wife was daughter of Kh\u00e1n, the vizir. This rebellion terminated in the capture of the prince, and the annihilation of many of his followers.*\n\nThe next event we shall relate, is the emperor's marriage to the celebrated N\u00far Jeh\u00e1n (light of the world). This event is detailed at full length in many publications,\u2020 is briefly as follows:\n\nKhuaja Ghaias\u2021-ad-D\u00edn, a T\u00e1tt\u00e1r, resolved to seek his fortune in India, and while crossing the desert with his wife, a son was born, and brought to Lahore where Akbar then held court. The Khuaja being a man of address and good education, obtained employment; and his daughter being well brought up at an early age named Mihr al N\u00eds\u00e1 (the sun of women), was trothed to her countryman Ali Kul\u00ed, entitled the Lion Shah Afgh\u00e1n; but having been seen at a royal entertainment by Selim, the latter fell desperately in love with her. The marriage, however, took place; and the husband was appointed to the post of Bardaw\u00e1n, a district of Bengal.\n\nIt is said that soon after the succession of Jeh\u00e1ngir, Selim was in great peril of being murdered. If such were the case, he was probably science-struck; for although the lady was brought to see him not see her for a considerable time. At length he visited her so much captivated, that he gave immediate orders for the marriage to take place.\n\nHe says in his memoirs: \"When Sh\u00edr Afgh\u00e1n was sent for the K\u00e1z\u00ed, and contracted a regular marriage with her, for her dowry the sum of eighty lacs of gold mohrs.\"\n\n* See Dow's History of Hindostan, vol. iii. p. 3.\n\u2020 Vide Dow's Hindostan; the History of Bengal; and the Library, vol. vi.\n\u2021 Dow's editor, by way of softening this name, has changed\nmoreover, a necklace of pearls containing forty beads, each of which cost 40,000 rupees.

Gold acquired a hundred times its value, by the name of the Empress N\u00far Jeh\u00e1n.\"\u2020\n\nIt was during the reign of Jeh\u00e1ng\u00edr, that two missions were sent from England to his court, the first by the East India Company, conducted by Captain Hawkins, for the purpose of opening a commercial intercourse with India; the second by the celebrated Sir Thomas Roe (whose memoirs are to be found in many biographical works), as ambassador from King James I. Hawkins, after much difficulty, arrived at Agra on the 16th April, 1609, and being able to speak Turkish was most favourably received by the emperor, who subsequently insisted on his marrying a young Armenian lady. He succeeded in obtaining the royal promise for an unlimited extension of the English trade, but being opposed by a violent party at court, headed by Abdul Husain, was, at the end of two years and a half, obliged to quit Agra without having effected any object of his mission.\n\nSir Thomas Roe sailed from Gravesend in January 1615, and landed at Surat in the following September: from thence he proceeded to Burh\u00e1npur,\u2021 where he was graciously received by the Prince Parv\u00edz, second son of the emperor, then governor of the province. After a short residence with the prince, Sir Thomas advanced\n\n* The royal tomb is described by Lieut.

He reached that city on 23rd December, but did not obtain an audience of the monarch till 10th of January, 1616. He then delivered the royal letter, and with a very honourable reception; many other interviews took place, and Sir Thomas fondly hoped to obtain all his demands, but he himself opposed by the same hostile cabal as Hawkins had been headed by Mukarrir Khan, governor of Surat, by Asuf Khan, vizir, and by the prince Khurrum, then in great favour with his father. During Sir Thomas's stay at Ajmir, he beheld with astonishment the display of pomp and magnificence of this court: the person of the monarch on high occasions was not only covered, but completely laden with diamonds, pearls, and rubies. Even the elephants beside rich trappings, had their heads covered with valuable jewels. The ambassador was particularly struck with the range of royal palaces surrounded by screens of half a mile in extent. He declared it the most magnificent object he ever beheld, the whole resembling a beautiful city.\n\nSir Thomas's description of the throne (which was afterwards carried away by Nadir Shah, the Persian sovereign), is also surprising. He says the emperor was a good-natured easy man, but much addicted to drunkenness; that he gave great encouragement to artists so that the portrait of an English lady was so accurately copied by the painters that he had some difficulty in discovering the original. It is said that the carpenters succeeded equally well in imitating King James's state coach.*\u2014See Churchill's and Pinkerton's Collections of Voyages.\n\nSultan Parviz, the second son of the emperor, who received the English ambassador, Sir Thomas Roe, at Burhanpur, frequently but nominally only, commanded the royal armies, and he died before his father. His character was that of a harmless quiet man, calculated to pass through life without either acquiring fame or exciting envy.\n\nSultan Khurrum was the third son of the emperor, and with consequence of the death of his brother Khusrav Parviz, succeeded his father on the first day of February, A.D. 1628, under the title Shah Jehan, King of the World.\n\nHe was suspected of having caused the death of his elder brother.\n\n* Jehangir died in November 1627, on his way from Kashmir to Lahore, was buried in a superb mausoleum in the vicinity of that city, but on the opposite side of the river Ravi. The empress Nur Jehan, was probably buried there. A description of the tomb may be found in page 159 of Lieut. Alexander Burnes's recent journey to Bokhara. Lieut. B. calls it Shaimar, \"House of joy,\" or hal Amr, \"The king of edifices,\" is, I believe, the correct appellation.\nKhusrav. He rebelled against his father in the year 1624, and subdued the provinces of Bengal and Bah\u00e1r, but was defeated by Mah\u00e1bat Kh\u00e1n. He there wrote letters to his father expressive of his contrition, and was forgiven. The events of his long but disastrous reign may be found in the works before referred to.\n\nSult\u00e1n Shuj\u00e1, the emperor's second grandson. He was at that time about ten years old, and was detained at court as an hostage for the good behaviour of his father, the prince Khurr\u00e1m.\n\nAt the age of twenty-four, A.D. 1639, he was appointed governor of Bengal. One of his first acts was to transfer the seat of government from Dakka to Rajmahal, called also Akbar-nagar. He built there an elegant palace, and strengthened the fortifications erected by R\u00e1j\u00e1 M\u00e1n Sinha. It was Sult\u00e1n Shuj\u00e1 who originally permitted the English to erect factories in Bengal; the first was built at Balladore, the second at Hooghly; but the ships were not allowed to enter the Ganges.\n\nFor eight years he ruled Bengal with great justice, but was then removed to the government of K\u00e1b\u00fal. In a short period he was re-appointed to Bengal, and continued to hold it till the unfortunate contest with his brother Aurangz\u00e9b, A.D. 1659.\n\nIn the year 1660 he was compelled to take refuge in Arracan, and was there basely murdered with his sons by the r\u00e1j\u00e1 of that province.\n\nKh\u00e1n Aaz\u00edm (the superior lord), the foster-brother and viz\u00edr of the late Emperor Akbar. He joined the party who wished to raise Khusrav, the eldest son of Jeh\u00e1ng\u00edr, to the throne in opposition to the father; and although allowed to retain his office, was never forgiven his offence. The sons of a nurse in the East, it may be remarked, are considered as half-brothers; and the emperor, in his memoir, says that he used, on great occasions, to consult the mother of this personage.\n\nKh\u00e1n Khan\u00e1n (the lord of lords), son of the famous Bair\u00e1m Kh\u00e1n, preceptor of Akbar, and regent during his minority. This nobleman, on several occasions, commanded the imperial armies, but was not always successful. He is frequently mentioned in the third volume of Dow's history, and in Jeh\u00e1ng\u00edr's memoirs. In fact, he was the tutor of the Prince Parv\u00edz when visited by Sir Thomas Roe at Burh\u00e1npur.\n\nKh\u00e1n Jeh\u00e1n (the lord of the world). A very celebrated general of the Afgh\u00e1n royal family of Lodi. He for a long time commanded in the Dekkan, but rebelled against Sh\u00e1h Jeh\u00e1n, and was killed in an engagement with the royal troops A.D. 1631.\n\nM\u00edrz\u00e1 Rustam, great-grandson of Sh\u00e1h Tahm\u00e1sb of Persia. His\ndaughter was married to Sult\u00e1n Parv\u00edz.

He commanded the city guards of Agra when the Emperor Akbar died, A.D. 1605, and while Kh\u00e1n Azim, and the R\u00e1j\u00e1 M\u00e1n Sinha, were plotting to set up Sult\u00e1n Khusrau on the throne. This officer ordered the gates to be shut, and, taking the keys in his hands, hastened to the palace of Sel\u00edm (Jeh\u00e1ng\u00edr), and, throwing himself on his knees, saluted him as emperor. For this service he was advanced to the rank of paymaster-general. He was sent in command of the army against the Prince Khusrau; he was also employed on many occasions, and wrote the history of Jeh\u00e1ng\u00edr. He was for some time vizir, but having had a stroke of the palsy, was obliged to resign.\n\nTarbiyat Kh\u00e1n (the well-instructed lord), was appointed by the emperor Sh\u00e1h Jeh\u00e1n governor of K\u00e1b\u00fal, but A.D. 1641 was removed for oppression. He was subsequently, in the reign of Aurangz\u00e9b (Aalamg\u00edr), sent as ambassador to the court of Persia; but owing to a mistake by the secretary in making out the titles of Sh\u00e1h Abb\u00e1s, that monarch was much incensed, and drove away the ambassador with great contumely A.D. 1666.\n\nThe next figure has unfortunately no name attached to it.\n\nR\u00e1j\u00e1 Surj Sinha.\n\nAnbir Ray, the Hind\u00fa accountant, or comptroller of the household.\n\nThe Chauri Bard\u00edr, a confidential servant, who carries the fly-fan.\n\nF\u00edruz Kh\u00e1n, the chief eunuch.\n\nThe second eunuch.\n\nSecond Row,\n\nMukarr\u00edb Kh\u00e1n (the confidential lord).

When the emperor was seized by Mah\u00e1bat Kh\u00e1n, he forced his way on the royal elephant, and waited on the monarch during his confinement.\n\nM\u00edrz\u00e1 Sult\u00e1n was the son of M\u00edrz\u00e1 Sh\u00e1h Kutch\u00ed, Prince of Badukh\u00edh\u00e1n.

XXIX.\u2014Biographical Sketch of the Literary Career of the late Colonel Colin Mackenzie, Surveyor-General of India; comprising some particulars of his Collection of Manuscripts, Plans, Coins, Drawings, Sculptures, &c. illustrative of the Antiquities, History, Geography, Laws, Institutions, and Manners, of the Ancient Hind\u00fas; contained in a letter addressed by him to the Right Hon. Sir Alexander Johnston, V.P.R.A.S. &c. &c.\n\n[The Catalogue of the Mackenzie Collection published at Calcutta by Professor Wilson, in the year 1828, being with difficulty procurable in England, it has been thought that the following account of that Collection might not be unacceptable to those persons who feel an interest in the subjects which it was intended to illustrate, and who may not be aware of its nature and extent.\n\nThis sketch was communicated by Colonel Mackenzie himself in the year 1817, to Sir Alexander Johnston, whom he had known from his earliest youth, with a view to its publication in the event of Col. Mackenzie's decease before any accurate and complete catalogue of the Collection should be prepared; and it is the document alluded to by Sir Alexander, in the evidence given by him before the Committee of the House of Commons, in the year 1832; on which occasion he proposed that the government should take the necessary measures for authenticating and completing the collection, in all its different departments of science and literature.\n\nAs this subject was also referred to at the anniversary meeting of\nI owe to the happy genius of this individual the encouragement to pursue, and the means of obtaining, what I had so long sought; for which purpose an acquaintance with no less than fifteen different dialects, and twenty-one characters, was necessary. On the reduction of Seringapatam, in 1799, not one of our people could translate from the Kanarese alone; at present we have translations made not only from the modern characters, but the more obscure and almost obsolete characters of the Sassanams (or inscriptions) in Kanarese and in Tamil; besides what have been done from the Sanscrit, of which, in my first years in India, I could scarcely obtain any information: but from the moment the talents of the lamented Borla were applied, a new avenue to Hind\u00fa knowledge was opened; and though I was deprived of him at an early age, his example and instructions were so happily followed up by his brethren and disciples, that an establishment was gradually formed, through which the whole of our provinces might be gradually analysed by the method thus fortuitously begun and successfully followed so far. Of the claims of these individuals, and the superior merits of some, a special representation has been made to this government.\n\n8. For these thirteen years, therefore, there is little to shew beyond the journals and notes of an officer employed in all the campaigns of the time: first, towards the close of the war of 1783, in the provinces of Koimbatore and of Dindigul; afterwards on professional duties in the provinces of Madras, Nellore, and Guntore; throughout the whole of the war, from 1790 to 1792, in Mysore, and in the countries ceded to the Niz\u00e1m by the peace of 1792; and from that period engaged in the first attempt to methodise and embody the geography of the Dekkan, attempts that were unfortunately thwarted or impeded by measures which it is unnecessary here to detail: the voyage and campaign in Ceylon may be noticed as introductory to part of what followed on my return to resume the examination of the geography of Dekkan.\n\n9. Some voluntary efforts for these purposes had at last excited the notice of a few friends in the field, in the campaigns in Mysore, too partial, perhaps, to my slender talents, and my ardour for the pursuit; and in 1792, after the peace of Seringapatam, I was sent from the army in Mysore, by the desire of the late revered Lord Cornwallis, with the small detachment at first employed in the Niz\u00e1m's domi-\n\nlabours, but not before he had formed his younger brothers and several other useful persons of all castes, Brahmins, Jainas, and Malabars, to the investigations that since been so satisfactorily pursued.\ninformation of the geography boundaries of the several states\n\ndifficulties, the accidents, and\n\nthe progress of this design from\n\nnecessity of a rigid\n\ndoubts and the hinderances ever\n\ndifficulties arising from the nature of the\n\ngovernment\u2014from conflicting\n\nprejudices, both difficult to contend with\n\na general map of the Niz\u0101m's dominions was\n\nfor the first time, compiled and digested\n\nvarious authorities, described in a memoir\n\nand designed rather as a specimen for future cor-\n\nwhat was wanting, than to prove what was done.\n\nbringing the subject into one point of view;\n\n1798 and 1799 improved its supplements, and some\n\nthen held forth that induced perseverance in the\n\nlittle effectual assistance was given; and my removal\n\nin the direction of the Dekkan surveys in 1806, put a\n\nprosecution of this map.

After the reduction of Mysore in 1799, and in the arrangements that followed, I was employed in furnishing the commissioners with geographical information, to assist in the arrangement of the limits of the subject of partition. On my return to Madras, the governor-general (the Earl of Mornington) being justly of opinion that a more complete knowledge of these countries was indispensably necessary for the information of government, was pleased, in the most handsome manner, without solicitation or any personal knowledge, to appoint me to survey Mysore, with an establishment suited rather to an economical scale of expenditure than to so extensive an undertaking, intended to be carried through a country so little known, that the position of some of the provinces ceded by the treaty of partition could not be ascertained* till this survey was carried forward, and that under peculiar circumstances of embarrassment.\n\n15. In conformity with my original ideas, I considered this opportunity favourable for arranging a scheme of survey embracing the statistics and history of the country, as well as its geography; and therefore submitted a plan for this purpose, which was approved of by the government. Three\u2020 assistants and a naturalist were then for the first time attached to me; yet this moderate establishment was immediately afterwards disapproved of in England, and a design that originated in the most enlightened principles was nearly crushed by the rigorous application of orders too hastily issued, which were received in India in the end of 1801, when I had, at very considerable hazard of my health, just completed the survey of the northern and eastern frontier of Mysore.\n\n16. How far the idea suggested was fulfilled, it is not for me to say; from adverse circumstances, one part was nearly defeated, and the natural history was never analysed in the manner I proposed and expected in concert with the survey. The suspense I was placed in from the reduction of the slender stipend allotted to myself, both for my salary and to provide for increasing contingencies, was in itself sufficiently mortifying; and the overthrow of the establishment first\n\n* For instance, Hollolkkaira, ceded to the Mahrattas; Gudikatta, on the N.W. of Chitteldr\u00fbg, mistaken for a small part north of Kolar, in the east of Mysore; and many other instances, whence some knowledge of the country rendered a survey indispensable.\n\n\u2020 Mr. Mather, Lieutenant Warren, and Lieutenant Arthur, assistant-surgeons; and Dr. Heyne, surgeon and naturalist.\narranged for the work, while other branches were favoured in the application of the orders of the court, the effects of these measures on the public mind, and even of my assistants, all contributed to deaden and to paralyse every effort for its completion. Notwithstanding these difficulties, however, the success attending the early researches, and a conviction of its utility, induced me to persevere till 1807; the geography of the provinces of Mysore was actually completed to the minutest degree of 40,000 square miles of territory, considerable materials were acquired for the illustration of its statistics and its history, and the basis laid for obtaining those of the peninsula at large, on a plan which has been undeviatingly followed ever since (see the opinion of the Court of Directors on the completion of the work, letter B annexed).\n\n17. Much of the materials collected on this occasion were transmitted home in seven folio volumes, with general and provincial maps; but it is proper to observe, that still more considerable materials for the history of the south are in reserve, not literally belonging to the Mysore survey, though springing from it. Notices of some of these are in the accompanying sheets.\n\n18. It is also proper to observe, that in the course of these investigations, and notwithstanding the embarrassments in the way of this work, the first lights were thrown on the history of the country below the Gh\u00e2ts, which have been since enlarged by other materials constantly increasing, and confirming the information acquired in the upper country. Among various interesting subjects may be mentioned,\n\n1. The discovery of the Jaina religion and philosophy, and its distinction from that of Budd\u2019ha.\n\n2. The different ancient sects of religion in this country, and their subdivisions\u2014the Lingavanta, the Saivam and Pandaram Matts, &c. &c.\n\n3. The nature and use of the Sassanams, and inscriptions on stone and copper, and their utility in throwing light on the important subject of Hind\u00fb tenures; confirmed by upwards of 3000 authentic inscriptions collected since 1800, hitherto always overlooked.\n\n4. The design and nature of the monumental stones and trophies\n\n* In the regulations of survey of 6th October, 1810, no less than twenty military officers were attached to the quarter-master-general, exclusive of the military institution and the establishment of native surveyors under the revenue department.

The sepulchral tumuli, mounds, and barrows of the early tribes, similar to those found throughout the continent of Asia and of Europe, illustrated by drawings, and various other notices of antiquities and institutions.\n\n19. On the conclusion of the field duties of the Mysore survey, the compilations resulting from it have since at different times occupied much attention. An office was conferred on me in Mysore, which was afterwards confirmed by the Court of Directors, for the purpose of following up the investigations, and digesting and improving the materials in some tranquillity; but on a reform of some branches of the military establishment in 1810, that department was entirely new-modelled, and my appointment ceased, without any compensation, in salary or otherwise, for what I then lost. The Honourable Court in that order had signified their approbation of what had been done, and even sent out other orders encouraging the further pursuit of my inquiries, which have been hitherto but partially attended to, and, from the present aspect of things at this presidency, do not appear likely to be soon fulfilled, either to my satisfaction, or according to the intentions of the Court.\n\n20. At the end of 1810, the government of Madras, on a view of the sudden increase of the expense of surveys in the preceding five years, and the unconnected and confused manner in which these works were executed, without being founded on any general or fixed system, found it necessary to create the office of surveyor-general, similar to one already established at the other presidencies, and was pleased to appoint me (without any previous communication) to this charge, for reasons the propriety of which I had in vain attempted to shew for fourteen years previously. In consequence of the little countenance given to these propositions in Europe,* I had, on the completion of the Mysore survey, relinquished all idea of conducting what would have been gratifying to early habits, and more appropriate to the state of my health and my time of life some years before; and I only undertook the charge at this time in hopes of being useful in assisting to give shape and order to what I had long considered important to the public, and beneficial in an economical point of view to the East India Company.\n\n* And of the measures adopted at Madras in 1806, that I considered adverse and contradictory to the hopes held out to me for years back.\n21. I was employed in arranging this office, for carrying on these duties in future, and for combining the execution and results of the several works on one general systematic plan, together with measures for preserving and digesting the various materials resulting from the labours of several years, in connexion with a very considerable reduction* of expense; when, from the exigencies of the military service, my professional attendance on the expedition to Java was required by the concurring authorities of government; and I had only time to deposit the materials then collected in the office, and to propose a plan for its administration during my absence, when my attention was necessarily called to the duties of the expedition. Of that service on which I embarked, with all alacrity, in obedience to the wishes and orders of my superiors, several detailed reports were submitted to government in India, to which my friends need have no scruple in referring.\n\n22. It may not be improper here to observe, that the plan proposed for the surveyor-general's department in 1810, besides a very considerable reduction of the expense previously incurred for different unconnected, and, I may add, inefficient establishments of survey, embraced (at the same time with a gradual extension on one regular system of the usual objects of geographical delineation) the formation of a body of statistical and historical materials, in addition to the mass of geographical and military surveys then collected and deposited by me in one office, for the first time, before my departure. Among these is a copy of the memoirs of the statistical and geographical survey of the Mysore country, with the original sections, charts, and maps constructed from them, on various scales from one to twenty-four miles, which were among the first of the official documents delivered into the office of the surveyor-general, under the inspection of a special committee, early in 1811.\n\n23. Of the Mysore survey, the detailed reports stand on the records of government at Fort St. George, and copies were sent home to England. For the opinions of the authorities at home on the close of that work, the annexed extract is referred to (Letter B). On its final completion in March 1809, the remaining establishment of native surveyors was sent, on my special representation, to the ceded districts, the examination of which has been since effected; thereby\n\n* In the very first year, ending 1st December 1810, the annual expense was reduced from 85,000 or rather 100,000 pagodas per annum, to 55,000 pagodas, by the operation of the plan submitted, and this with more effect than in the former unconnected system\u2014as appears from a table of five years' expense, presented to government on 30th April 1816.\nalmost completing an entire survey of all the dominions of the late sovereignty of Mysore, as it existed a few years ago in the plenitude of its power and territory. This work adds 30,000 square miles to the 40,000 formerly reported on (mentioned in B), altogether 70,000 square miles, minutely analysed. The direction of this survey of the ceded districts was voluntarily conducted without any specific compensation, until it fell into the general superintendence of the surveyor-general's office, which is now again reversed and transferred to the surveyor-general of India.\n\n24. While these works were in progress, the collection of materials on the history, antiquities, and statistics of the country, was going on throughout the whole of the provinces, under the presidency of Fort St. George, on the basis of the information originally obtained on the Mysore survey, by natives trained and instructed by me for this purpose, and with the only charge to government of the postage being franked, and the aid of some of the native writers; but all the purchases have been entirely at my private expense, as well as the collection of MSS. throughout the Karnatik Malabar, the southern provinces, the Cirkars, and the Dekkan. The papers annexed explain the progress of this branch during the period of my absence in Java; I regret that I cannot at present recur to other documents more fully explanatory of the extent and nature of these researches into the ancient history and present state of the south of India, as the greatest part of the collection has been sent on to Calcutta to wait my arrival at that presidency.\n\n25. A detailed view of the origin and progress of that branch alone (the historical investigations) would more properly be the subject of a separate memoir: a concise view of a similar attempt made in Java is annexed (in No. A). This was effected under limitations of time and means required by local circumstances; but under a liberal degree of encouragement and protection, both from the local government there, and from two successive governors-general of British India, which heightens the contrast in other cases, and without any expense to government on that account, the success of these investigations justifies the hope, that considerable advantage may be derived from following up the same plan of research wherever the influence of the British government affords the same facilities, in the intervals of military occupation.\n\n26. On my return to this presidency in 1815, I found the office of surveyor-general at Madras was ordered to be abolished, and before\n\n* The survey of Dindigul recently finished, and materials of which are about to be sent home, completes it, that of Barramahl being done several years ago.\nI could well go into the revisal and completion of the review of the survey department commenced in 1811, and which had been discontinued in consequence of my being sent on foreign service, I was honoured with the appointment of the office of surveyor-general of India, on a new system which required my residence at Calcutta or Fort William. My attention has in consequence been chiefly turned to that object ever since, with the view of fulfilling the Honourable Court's intentions in conferring an appointment which I must ever consider an honourable mark of distinction, justly demanding efforts that I had no longer in contemplation.\n\n27. I will only further notice the effect of this removal on the inquiries and collection here described. The people trained by me for several years being natives of the coast or the southern provinces, and almost as great strangers to Bengal and Hindust\u00e1n as Europeans, their removal to Calcutta is either impracticable, or where a few, from personal and long attachment (as my head Br\u00e1hman, Jaina translator, and others), are willing to give this last proof of their fidelity, yet still it is attended with considerable expense; and without that assistance, most of what I had proposed to condense and translate from the originals in the languages of this country, could not be conveniently, if at all, effected at Calcutta.\n\n28. I mean, however, to attempt it, and hope in this last stage, preparatory to my return to Europe, to draw up a succinct view of the whole collection, and prepare a catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of the native manuscripts, books, &c., and also to give the translated materials such form as may facilitate the production of some parts, should they ever appear to the public, at least by persons better qualified, if the grateful task be not permitted to my years, or to my state of health.\n\nI regret exceedingly that the pressure of business at this moment will not permit of my adding further to this hasty sketch; but it would require an actual inspection and reference to the originals themselves, to give you any tolerable idea of their nature, and of the interest my partiality may attach to them. I hope, however, that it will appear to all considerate men that some leisure for tranquil and exclusive application to their arrangement would be at least necessary to one who has now resided thirty-four years in this climate, without the benefit of once going to Europe, or even to any other presidency, on account of health or private business.\n\nI remain, my dearest Alexander,\n\n&c. &c. &c.\n\n(Signed) Colin Mackenzie.\n\nMadras,\nFebruary 1, 1817.\nThe Collection of Notes, Observations, Journals, and Collections of MSS., Inscriptions, Drawings, &c. made by Colonel Mackenzie, in India, may be arranged under the following heads:\n\n1. Journals, Notes, Observations, and Memoirs, for thirty-four years, kept at intervals on successive Journeys and Campaigns, through all the Provinces now subject to Fort St. George (excepting Malabar and the Cirkars north of the Kistna), from 1783 to 1790.\n\nThese remarks were afterwards extended through the whole of Lord Cornwallis's campaigns in Mysore, from 1790 to 1792, with particular journals of all the operations, elucidated by maps, plans, and drawings of the battles, sieges, &c. Of the several journeys into the newly-ceded districts of the Nizam, Kuddapa, Kanoul, the wild mountains of Yermulla and Nulnulla, &c. bounding the Karnatik as far as the Kistna at Purwuttum, till 1794; also of four different journeys into the Dekkan, as often relinquished for other expeditions; the campaign of the Nizam against the Mahrattas in 1795; the battle of Kurdla; the expedition to Ceylon; reduction of Kolumbo, and return; a journey to Haiderabad; thence to Kulburga, with description and drawings of that ancient capital of the Dekkan; return to Madras; preparation and materials collected for the designed expedition to Manilla; return to Haiderabad, and arrangement made for a regular analysis of the Dekkan, and of the Nizam's dominions; suspended finally for the last campaign and war against Mysore; the march from Haiderabad for that purpose; during these military movements, measures proposed and information obtained for the future investigation of the history of Bijanagar, and the ancient Kanara and Tellinga empires; journal of the campaign, siege, and capture of Seringapatam; journals through the whole of the survey of Mysore from 1800 to 1807, including observations; and various memoirs on different subjects, customs of the inhabitants, climate, soil, institutions, &c. (exclusive of the official memoirs sent to Europe), several of them particularly mentioned under their respective heads. After a residence of three years and a half at Madras, under the constant expectation of removal, then follows the expedition to Java; journals of the voyages, and campaigns, and the interesting journeys through, and a residence in that island for two years; afterwards on a journey from Calcutta by Benares to Lucknow, Agra, and Delhi, to the mountains dividing Thibet whence the Jumna and Ganges issue into Hindustan; back from Rohilkund, and again to the Ganges; for months the same method was used in memoirs, and journals;\nand the collection of ancient coins, MSS., inscriptions, and sculptures, considerably increased.\n\nFrom the frequent and sudden changes of place that Colonel Mackenzie's course of service, for thirty-four years, was always subject to, these journals, &c. are not all fairly transcribed or arranged from their original notes, and, in several instances, are restricted to short cursory notices intended to be extended afterwards, accompanied by plans, views, sketches by himself, or by friends. It is supposed that if the whole were condensed, they would form six folio volumes, accompanied by authentic charts, drawings, &c. geographical, military, &c. &c.\n\n2. Memoirs of the Survey of Mysore, Geographical, Statistical, and Historical.\n\nThe original copies, in seven volumes folio, were sent to England to the Court of Directors in 1808, accompanied by general maps, exhibiting the country in detail on a scale of four miles to an inch, where all its features, rivers, mountains, and every place, are laid down; lately introduced into Arrowsmith's general map of India, by permission of the Court of Directors. A series of provincial maps, on a scale of one mile, descriptive of the several provinces, were also compiled from the original sections of survey deposited in the office at Madras.\n\n3. Memoirs of the Ceded Districts.\n\nOn the same plan with that of Mysore; including the geography, statistics, and history of these provinces, accompanied by maps from scales of one to four, twelve, and twenty-four miles to an inch. Two volumes sent to England, and more than two more still in preparation, to be transmitted to the Court of Directors.\n\n4. Materials for a General View of the South of the Peninsula.\n\nThe above have been executed under the immediate direction of Colonel Mackenzie, and the same plan is now under execution for the remaining districts under Fort St. George, so far as the measures adopted by this government may admit. The completion of the whole being designed by Colonel Mackenzie to furnish a body of materials for a complete view, geographical, statistical, and historical, of the whole British possessions in the south of the Peninsula, accompanied by maps, under the immediate protection of the East India Company, at whose expense the surveys have been executed; but the historical and literary materials have been hitherto chiefly obtained at Colonel Mackenzie's private expense.\n1. Sought for a complete view of the geographical situation, natural resources, and mode of life of India, and the Indian dependencies in the eastern islands; in the original memoirs and drawings of Col. Mackenzie, whose services in the materials furnished by the circumstances of which he was president in Java, several native officers were sent to the new territories from the Japanese and Malay archipelago, by natives and others employed for that purpose, and translated the extracts and translations from Dutch and French papers and maps. Notices of some of these are subjoined, see also A. extract. From the matter contained in these documents much light may be thrown on the early acquaintance of these islands, and perhaps of the more distant regions of the peoples of America at least of the countries and governments of the Continent of Asia with the commerce and intercourse of the Orient, and South Seas, and of the laws, manners, customs, and customs of the more eastern parts of Asia, so very different from those of the western Peninsula of India.\n\n2. A great object has been, under these inquiries, derived from the labour undertaken, but entirely at Colonel Mackenzie's private expense, excepting the single article of postage*, to collect and obtain translations of materials of various descriptions illustrative of the history, antiquities, and institutions, &c., of India. This was originally directed to those of the Karnatak or Bijapur and its dependencies exclusively, and afterwards extended, as circumstances admitted, to that of the several dynasties that were successively brought to light; to materials illustrative of the history and antiquities of Hindustan and of all parts of India, but more particularly to that of the south or Peninsula; and, ultimately, by the sudden direction of his services in 1811, (arising from the exigencies of the public service), to the Oriental lands and coasts of Asia.\n\n3. Materials, memoirs, and historical pieces translated, illustrative of the history of the several Muhammedan dynasties that were successively established in the Dekkan or the south of India, from the thirteenth to the eighteenth century, under their respective heads; illustrated by descriptions, plans, and drawings of the cities, forts, buildings (civil and religious), remaining, by coins, inscriptions, &c. These include\n\nThe earlier Muhammedan governments in Dekkan, of\n1. Bijapure. 4. Ahmednaggar.\n2. Golkonda. 5. Dowlatabad.\n3. Bedar\n\n* The expenses of postage incurred by the Directors, since\nII. The Mogul government in the Dekkan.\n\n8. Materials collected and translated, illustrative of the geography and political arrangements and provincial divisions of the Dekkan, in its six sibas or viceroyalties, from the earliest times till the arrangement made by Asaf Jah (the celebrated Nizam-ul-Mulk), in the beginning of the eighteenth century. This is of more importance, as by this arrangement most of the political divisions of territory among the present existing powers, the Nizam, the Mahrattas, &c. are thereby regulated; and some knowledge of it is a necessary prelude to that of the present state of the south of India. This object, which has constantly been in view since Colonel Mackenzie was sent with the Dekkan subsidiary force in 1792, by Lord Cornwallis, till he was removed from it in 1806, has never been lost sight of in the intervals of other professional and public engagements. The Daftar of the Dekkan, the Hakikat Hindustan, and the history of Khafi Khan* (an author of credit, little known hitherto), with other authentic MSS., have been translated from the Persian, Mahratta, and other native languages, and now form a body of materials designed to assist a work descriptive of the geography, history, and statistics of the Dekkan, which has been in its progress communicated to several respectable authorities well qualified to estimate its design, and approved of by them.\n\nThese were also designed to be accompanied by a series of maps, charts, and drawings.\n\n9. The history and antiquities of the earlier dynasties, of which notices are daily occurring, are more unconnected and obscure; yet sufficient matter appears in inscriptions, ancient buildings, sculptures, and coins, in addition to traditions, poems, &c. to furnish materials for a sketch of the early dynasties and sovereigns of these countries previous to the Christian era and era of Sallivahana, such as, viz.:\n\n1. The kings of Banawasi\u2020 in the N.W. whose ancient inscriptions and characters confirm the popular tradition of the country of a great kingdom having once been established there.\n\n2. The kings whose capital was Amravully on the Kistna, where the singular fragments and remains lately discovered exhibit specimens of beauty and taste in design and execution, seldom found in Hindustan sculpture. Drawings of these were taken.\n\n* The history of Khafi Khan includes the annals of the celebrated Aurungzeb's reign, hitherto a desideratum in Indian history, excepting the first ten years.\n\n\u2020 The position of Banawasi is laid down in Ptolemy's Tables.\n\nVol. I.\n3. The ancient Kuramber kings, and the pastoral, hunting, or nomadic tribes, who occupied this country previous to the introduction of the doctrine of the V\u00e9das by the Chola kings, and to whom several antiquities, buildings, sculptures, establishments, and coins, of late brought into notice, are supposed to belong.\n\n10. Drawings, maps, plans, and sketches; these are arranged as under:\n\nI. Maps and Charts.\n\n1. Atlases.\n2. Portfolios.\n3. Folio and quarto volumes.\n4. Miscellaneous rolls, &c. containing:\n   1. Geographical, general, and provincial maps.\n   2. Political and statistical maps and plans.\n   3. Mineralogical and orological maps; to which is proposed to be added,\n   4. A philological map descriptive of the extent of the various languages spoken in the fifty-six D\u00e9sams, or Hind\u00fa divisions of the Bh\u00e1rata Kandam, or India.\n\nII. Drawings.\n\n1. Views and sketches of remarkable places.\n2. Plans of cities, fortresses, battles, sieges, &c.\n3. Ditto of ancient cities and temples, &c. as Bijanagar, Halla, Bede, and other ancient capitals.\n4. Elevations and sections of ditto.\n5. Collection of drawings illustrative of the state and progress of the arts of design, of sculpture, &c. &c. among the Hind\u00fas, 2 vols. large folio.\n6. Ditto of ditto of various plants, trees, flowers, executed during the surveys, 4 vols. folio.\n7. Ditto of ditto of the costume of the various classes of inhabitants of India, the different sects of religion, &c. &c. 3 vols. folio.\n\nThe collections (which are gradually increasing, from the constant accession of original materials of late years,) are bound and arranged in volumes chiefly folio, either provincially or according to language, &c. in the following order, viz.:\n\n1. Southern Provinces, containing History, Antiquities, Institutions, &c.\u2014Ancient Chola Mandalam, and Pandya-Mandalam, or Tinnevelly, Madura, Tanjore, Koimbatore, &c.\n\n2. Western Provinces.\u2014Ancient K\u00e9rala and Ch\u00e9ra Mandalam, or Travankore, Malabar, Kanara, Konkan, Bednore, S\u00fanda, &c. &c.\n3. Central Provinces.\u2014Upper Karnataka, Mysore, Chitteldr\u00fag, Raidr\u00fag, Nawabship of Serah, Harponelly, Pennakonda, B\u00e1ramahl, &c. &c.\n\n4. Eastern Provinces.\u2014Ancient Tonda Mandalam, Modern Arkot S\u00faba, Payen Gh\u00e1t or Lower Karnatik (erroneously), Nellore, Ongole, Paln\u00e1d, &c.\n\n5. Ceded Districts.\u2014Nanda-Mandalam, comprehending Kanoul, Kuddapa, Kummum, &c. and extending to the Kistna.\n\n6. Northern Districts.\u2014Comprehending the Andora, Mats\u2019ya, and Kallinga D\u00e9sams, the modern Cirkars of Guntore, Masulipatam, Kondapilly, Chikakole, &c. and the Odia D\u00e9sam, or modern Orissa, or Ganjam, Cirkar, and Kuttack.\n\n7. Muhammedan History.\u2014Comprehending the history of the several states or sovereigns of this religion since the thirteenth century.\n\n8. Mahratta History.\u2014Comprehending materials either relating to this nation or its sovereigns, of modern origin, under Sivaj\u00ed, Sambarj\u00ed, R\u00e1mraj\u00e1, &c. &c. till the permanent establishment of the present or modern Mahratta state under a Peshwa.\n\n9. Karnatik and Bijanagar.\u2014Translations of original works illustrative of the history of that empire under its several dynasties of Karnatik, Tellinga, and Kuramber sovereigns, with reference to their grants, inscriptions, &c.\n\n10. Tellinga and Oria, or Northern Cirkars.\u2014Comprehending the materials of the history of Warungole, and the several dynasties of these languages or nations; the Kuttak Ballalls, the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Kallinga, of R\u00e1j\u00e1mandiri, of Bezoada, &c.\n\n11. Chola and Pandya,\u2014Comprehend the materials translated of these ancient dynasties confirmed and compared by their inscriptions still remaining, by books, poems, and various works of their ancient sages.\n\n12. Sassanams, or Hindu Inscriptions, Grants, Edicts, &c.\u2014These are of three kinds:\n\n1. Comprehends copies of the original sassanams transcribed in all parts of the country, from stones generally, more rarely from copper plates: it is supposed that above 3000 at least have been collected by intelligent natives trained and formed for this purpose.\n\n2. Fac-similes and drawings of the most ancient and curious of the above, being those that are in antique characters\u2014some now obsolete\u2014some read with difficulty\u2014others entirely unknown: it was thought right to preserve fac-similes of them, to authenticate the materials.\n\n3. Translations of the most interesting and curious of the inscrip-\ntions from the different languages; besides a great portion still untranslated on Kajan leaves, country paper, &c.\n\nN.B. The materials from which the above are taken are in fifteen different languages and twenty-one different alphabetical characters; and it was necessary to employ persons conversant in each, sometimes with great difficulty, to extract them from those languages, as follows:\n\n| Languages | Characters |\n|-----------|------------|\n| 1. Sanscrit. | 1. Obsolete. |\n|           | 2. D\u00e9van\u00e1gari or Baulobund. |\n|           | 3. Grundum. |\n| 2. Tellinga. | 1. Ancient Tellinga, very old, obsolete. |\n|           | 2.

These belong to the period since the 17th century. |\n| 13. Arabic. | 1. Arabic. |\n| 14. Malays. |\nLanguages.\n\nCharacters.\n\n15. Javanese.\n\n{ 1. Ancient Javanese from inscriptions.\n   2. Modern ditto.\n\nN.B. There are also fac-similes of several inscriptions in characters still undeciphered, some daily arriving \u2014 such as the inscriptions at Delhi, at Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, from Java, from Ceylon, from Mahab\u00e1lipuram, from Banawassi, &c. &c.\n\n13. Stallamah\u00e1tmams, or Stallap\u00far\u00e1nams.\u2014These comprehend the legends, p\u00far\u00e1nams, or traditions\u2014accounts of the several stallams, or holy places of Hind\u00fa worship; as every temple has or ought to have its p\u00far\u00e1nam, those of the present establishments are evidently founded on the legends of the followers of the V\u00e9das; the p\u00far\u00e1nams of the principal stallams are procured as Kanch\u00fa, Trinamalla, Tripetty, Sr\u00edrangam, R\u00e1miseram, &c. &c.; a few are translated, and more are proposed to be so as specimens. Two vols. translated, bound; four ditto originals, bound, folio.\n\n14. Laws, Institutions, &c.\u2014These parts embrace the several codes of laws received among the Hind\u00fas.\n\n15. Sects of Religion.\u2014Account of the origin, history, and opinions, of the different sects of religion among the Hind\u00fas: \u2014 the followers of the V\u00e9das; the Jaina, Saman\u00e1l or Sr\u00e1vaks; the Buddhists; the Saiva-mattam, &c. &c. &c.\n\n16. Miscellaneous.\n\n17. Extracts from Foreign European Authors.\u2014Translated regarding Indian history, antiquities, literature, and geography, ancient and modern.\n\nThe collection already transmitted to Calcutta, and bound in folio volumes, upwards of forty may be classed under the following heads:\n\n1. History, Antiquities, and Institutions of the empire of the Karnatic or Karnata (called Narsinga erroneously by early European writers), under its several dynasties of Ballalls, Wodiars, Kurambers, Tellangas, &c. princes, and extracted from authentic documents from about 1600 up to about 500 A.D., and more obscurely still further to near 80, A.D. when the eras or mode of reckoning used in inscriptions in these countries were changed and are lost sight of, corroborated also by collation with European and Muhammedan authorities.\n\n2. Ditto, ditto, for the dynasties that reigned in the south with more or less extent of power and territory previous to the former, under the several names of Chola, P\u00e1ndya, &c. confirmed by actually existing inscriptions and records.\n3. Ditto of the more obscurely known dynasties of *Tellina* and *Wodia* kings, of Warankole, Anakonda, Bezoada, Rajamandiri, Kuttak, &c., illustrated by inscriptions, plans, drawings, and MSS. terminating in the 14th century.\n\n4. Ditto of the empire of *Kanara*, whose capital was at *Kalliani*, till its decline by a schism of religion, and finally by the first Muhammedan invasion of *Alla-ad-Din*, in the early part of the 14th century.\n\n5. Ditto, ditto, of the kings of *Deogiri*, or *Devagiri* (now Doulatabad), terminating at the same time; less is known yet of this dynasty, though it is hoped considerable materials may be obtained to illustrate this chasm in Hind\u00fa history, which involves in obscurity the origin of the celebrated sculptured caves of Ellora, which, it is to be noticed, are close to the site of the ancient capital of *Devagiri*.\n\n6. The history of the remains of the *Bijanagar* empire, from the fatal battle wherein *Ram-Raj* fell, A.D. 1536, till the fall of *Chandragiri*, the establishment of the Muhammedans in the Karnatik, the conquests of the states of Bijapore and Golkonda by the Moguls, and the establishment of the European factories and settlements on the coast, in the commencement of the 17th century, the origin and history of the families of the usurpers of Mysore, Bednore, Chiteldrug, Madura, Raidrug, Harponelly, Ginji, Tanjore, the Northern Vemlavar petty chiefs, &c.; for which considerable materials in original family books, records, histories, inscriptions, grants, &c. are collected, translated, and arranged, forming a necessary prelude to the development of the distracted state of the country about, or soon after, the period of the settlement of the European nations in India, a clear understanding of which is perhaps necessary at this day.\n\n7. The ancient history of *Malabar* or *Kerala*, and its singular institutions from materials, MSS., and inscriptions collected in that country.\n\n8. The history of the *Dekkan* under the Muhammedan governments since the 13th century, and a commencement made in opening avenues to its earlier history under the Hind\u00fa princes. The present state of these countries is still unfavourable to minute investigation.\n\n9. The ancient geography of India derives considerable light from these progressive inquiries; and several explanations are derived of the connexion and extent of commercial relations between the eastern and western continents; from ancient traditions, remains of establishments, MSS., sculptures, coins,* and the remains of antiquity scattered in different parts of the country.\n\n* In the ruined city of Mahabalipuram in this vicinity, specimens of the Roman and China coinage are found at present, together with other ancient unknown kinds.\n10. The institutions, laws, and peculiar customs of the various tribes that inhabit India; the early pastoral, or nomadic tribes; the agricultural race; the introduction of arts, sciences, and letters; the colonies of Br\u00e1hmans and other tribes successively arriving from the north, from the same unquestionable authority.\n\n11. These are more particularly explained by what has been hitherto unavoidably overlooked\u2014collection of the ancient sassanams or inscriptions, on stone, copper, and other metals, still existing in all parts of the country, which prove, by dates and regular formul\u00e6, the early existence of established tenures, and all the regulations of a civilised and cultivated state of society.\n\n12. Collection of coins, chiefly Hind\u00fa, in different parts of the country; the most remarkable of these are Roman, Chinese, and a singular square kind of silver coins, specimens of which have been found in Hind\u00fast\u00e1n, as well as in the south.\n\n13. Collection of ancient sculptures illustrative of the state and cultivation of the arts and sciences, aided by drawings from ancient remains, hitherto unnoticed throughout the peninsula; and in the oriental islands of Java, Bali, &c.\n\n14. Drawings and views of buildings, explaining the style and various kinds of architecture.\n\n15. Drawings of the costume of the inhabitants of India, and of the Islands; illustrative of descriptions of the several tribes and castes, their peculiar manners, customs, &c. &c.\n\n16. The population and subdivisions of castes ascertained and illustrated by enumeration, by houses, and by families, through the late dominions of Mysore, and in the island of Java; the authenticated tables of which are annexed to the descriptive memoirs of provinces.\n\nA.\n\nA General View of the Results of Investigations into Geography, History, Antiquities, and Literature, in the Island of Java.\n\nI. CHARTS, GEOGRAPHICAL AND HYDROGRAPHICAL.\n\nIn the geographical and hydrographical branches, complete registers have been taken of the numerous atlases, plans, charts, and memoirs belonging to the Dutch government, since its establishment from 1612 till the year 1811. Among these are to be found detailed regular surveys of several of the eastern provinces, on a plan which I have recommended to our government in Java to be gradually carried on\nat no great expense. This will be the subject of a particular report, which I propose to accompany with a detailed register of these documents, and charts of different descriptions, supposed to be in depot with the present government.\n\nII. MILITARY.\n\nOf military plans numerous pieces exist still, though some of them, particularly connected with the views of the late government, are unattainable, and supposed to be lost in the confusion attending the victory and retreat of Cornelis; those remaining appear in the register. There is reason to think that much of the contents of the dep\u00f4ts at the Bureau de G\u00e9nie, and that of military movements, were lost at the period referred to, or carried off.\n\nIII. TERRITORIAL.\n\nOf the resources and revenues of the island, the whole, it is believed, are saved of the numerous memoirs, reports, and productions arising from the discussions and plans of reform of late years, where the opinions and sentiments of the most intelligent and experienced men in India and Holland are to be found\u2014the result of their reasoning, with a vast body of information in memoirs, reports, and documents,\u2020 in the dep\u00f4ts of archives which, previous to the late government of Marshal Daendels, were preserved on a regular systematic plan: the indexes, or rather abstracts of the proceedings and resolutions of the government from its first establishment, were particularly curious; under the heads Realia, Secret Realia, Personalia, and Miscellanea, reference might be made with ease to any subject that had ever occupied the deliberations and orders of government. There is reason to believe the Miscellanea, consisting of eight volumes, were lost; at least they could not be found on inquiry since the reduction of Java.\n\n2. The reports of the committee of archives, translations of which, it is believed, have been sent to India, will fully explain the number and description. Colonel Mackenzie, confining himself more particularly to the geographical and hydrographical parts, has only brought\n\n* This register was presented to the government at Fort William of the 18th February, 1815.\n\n\u2020 The whole of the voluminous minutes, correspondence, and proceedings of the commission sent from Holland in 1793, of which Mr. Medenburgh was president, and which terminated in 1800, are deposited in a great almyra or cabinet. Mr. Medenburgh afterwards returned to Holland, and was one of the leading members of the Secret Committee on India affairs that sat at the Hague, whose final report in 1807 seems to have been the basis on which the plans adopted by the late government of Holland for their oriental colonies were founded.\ncopies of the reports relating to them, and of the register of reports and memoirs from the dependencies, particularly as regards India.\n\n3. Memoirs or Reports in succession of the Governors and Directors of the Dependencies in India.\u2014It may be proper here to notice, that in the course of inspection of the archives and library of the late government, he casually lighted on a series of memoirs or reports of the Dutch governors and directors in Koromandel from 1612 to 1771, carried regularly on from one governor or director to another. One of the most material to us is a collection or register of all treaties, contracts, parw\u00e1nas, and grants between the Dutch government and the native powers of the south of India; a copy* of this volume was taken, as it was conceived to be useful in fixing dates, facts, privileges, and claims. The other volumes, besides the instructions of the first governors, give a view of the nature of the commerce, and concise views of the political state of the different countries at the time, though not all equally interesting;\u2014as the memoirs or reports of the governors or directors of Ceylon, Surat, and Hoogly in Bengal, and of the Spice Islands, &c. &c.\n\n4. In the same deposits are a complete series of the despatches and letters of the government of Batavia to Europe, consisting of many volumes, which undoubtedly contain many interesting facts and documents regarding the policy and history of these once opulent establishments. As these volumes are in the Biblioth\u00e8que, and it is doubtful whether they are included in the report of the committee of archives, they are particularly adverted to here. It was a peculiar trait of the Dutch government that complete memoirs, or memoires, were usually given in by the governors-general, and those of the dependencies, to their successors on being relieved; and as the whole of them were furnished with very complete indexes, reference was ready and easy to any particular subject or fact before the archives were thrown into confusion and many lost on their removal from the Castle of Batavia in 1808, and afterwards from the events attending the reduction of Java. To restore them to some order would be desirable to the future historian of oriental commerce and possessions, if not in a political point of view, to the British supreme government of India.\n\nIV. HISTORY AND ANTIQUITIES.\n\nOf the history and antiquities of the island of Java considerable\n\n* This is one of the works translated at Serampore since January last, and sent Government April 1816.\nmaterials have been obtained by Lieutenant-Colonel Mackenzie's immediate exertions. Little, indeed, had been done in Java by Europeans in regard to such inquiries since the time that Valentyn published his useful but voluminous work on the Dutch East India Company's settlements, in six folio volumes, in 1724; and although a Society of Sciences had been established a few years previous to ours in 1780, but little progress had been made in developing the history of the eastern islands, and the Society itself had fallen into decline (although not absolutely extinct) since the commencement of the revolution. Of the laudable efforts to revive it since the British government was established this may not be the appropriate place to speak. Under the patronage of the supreme government, should Java remain a British colony, it may be hoped still to contribute essentially to the general culture of science, and of commercial economy, and of useful knowledge in these parts.\n\n2. Lieutenant-Colonel Mackenzie's first efforts were particularly directed to this object of investigation, the progress and actual state of knowledge, and of the history and antiquities of the island; and it is due, in justice to several respectable individuals in Java, British and Dutch, to say that much ready and cordial aid was furnished in the prosecution of these researches.\n\n3. Some of the colonists who had paid an attention to these subjects, which were not very popular in Java, very readily communicated the aid of their knowledge and experience in directing the pursuit and pointing out the sources and individuals that could farther assist. To conciliate the minds of men, and remove difficulties arising from prejudice of education and religion, and from the variety of languages, the experience acquired in India was found of great advantage; but the powerful aid of the penetrating acute genius of the Br\u00e1hmans, which had been of such importance in India, was here wanting, and the languages presented obstacles of no common degree; it was necessary not only to employ translators from the Dutch, French, and Malay, but it was extremely rare to find persons capable of rendering Javanese MSS.* into either of these languages previous to an English version. The difficulty of procuring any of the colonists capable of acting as interpreters was considerable, from the rarity of these necessary qualifications, and from a repugnance to travelling and fatigue, arising from indolence, and from habits widely dissimilar to ours. In the interior the Malay language was of little use, and the Javanese,\n\n* An ingenious native of Java has since this accompanied Colonel Mackenzie to India, and has already made some progress in translating from the Javanese.\nin its several dialects, had been little studied by the European colonists of Java; these few were in the service of government, and there were but few on the island capable of rendering a word from the Javanese into Dutch.\n\n4. Notwithstanding these obstacles, and the discouraging prospect held out by those who had the best pretensions, from long residence, to know the native character, and their literary attainments, it is satisfactory to observe, that the conclusion of this journey produced an accession of knowledge and of lights that had been by no means hoped for, even by the most sanguine.\n\n5. The colonists were found willing to assist and produce their stores, and the natives were soon reconciled, even the class whose interests might be presumed to traverse, if not oppose these inquiries. The regents and their dependants were, though at first shy, ultimately cordial in assisting the objects of investigation; and on the eve of leaving the eastern districts, and to the last moment of stay at Batavia, (18th July, 1813) materials, MSS. and memoirs, in copy or original, with letters in reply to the questions circulated, were transmitted from the most distant parts. In fact, as in Mysore, and other parts of India, the same causes had the same effects. Inquiries before little known, and at first held in suspicion, were found to have no other object than a laudable research into history, laws, customs, and literature, to assist the rulers to protect the subjects and ameliorate their condition. By a more perfect knowledge of their own institutions, all ranks appeared to concur in supporting what they found attended by no deviation from good faith, and tending to conciliate their feelings and prejudices.\n\nTo conclude, what is intended is a general view of the results of these inquiries: until the arrangement of the materials permits of a more detailed report being made up, the following may be considered an abstract of a collection of materials formed for illustrating the history, antiquities, and institutions of Java.\n\nMANUSCRIPTS.\n\nOne hundred and seventy-one * sections rather than volumes of paper MSS. written in the characters of Java and of the Malay; but all in the Javanese language ( ) difficulties occur in getting ( ) by the interposition of ( ) are on paper:\n\n* Several of and Colonel for their best\nsome were saved from the wreck of the Sultan's library at the storm of the Craten of Jokjakarta, by permission of the prize agents and the concurrence, indeed, of all the military present. Others were purchased and collected on the tour through that island: some were presented by Dutch colonists and by regents, and others are transcripts by Javanese writers employed by Colonel MacKenzie to copy them from the originals, in the hands of regents, and with their permission. Several of these are historical. A few of the smaller and more curious tracts have been translated into the European languages during his stay in Java. A considerable number of papers, containing a series of voyangs, or Javanese dramas, which are still a popular and expensive subject of exhibition with the native chiefs of Java.\n\nTwenty-four MSS. written on Kujan leaves in the Hind\u00fa manner, most of them in the Javanese character, and some in a character yet undeciphered. From explanations of the titles of some they appear to belong to the ancient (or Dewa) religion of these islands; but though a native of superior intelligence was found capable of reading them, the prejudices of religion prevented any further information of the contents of books supposed to be adverse to the Muhammedan tenets. This difficulty might, however, have been got over. These MSS. are apparently ancient, and were brought by the civility of a regent from a long deserted house in the distant forests, where they had lain neglected for years.\n\nThirty-five volumes of Dutch MSS. in folio, quarto, and octavo, consisting of historical works, memoirs, reports, some translated from the Javanese into Dutch; some of these are original, others were copied by permission from MSS. in the hands of private individuals, and a few of the most valuable were purchased;* some of the most remarkable of them are:\n\n1. A complete history of Java, in three quarto volumes, translated into Dutch, giving its history from the first supposed colonization to the year 1807; the original apparently written by a native. This is now nearly translated into English.\n\n2. Ancient history of Java; containing its fabulous history, in two quarto volumes, in Dutch: this appears to be compiled from the ancient mythological poems and voyangs, or dramas,\n\n* It is necessary to observe, that all these are exclusive of the memoirs and reports belonging to the Committee of Tenures, which are official and belong to government, though every liberal indulgence was granted by the governor, Mr., afterwards Sir Stamford Raffles, and access given to official records. The collection here specified is wholly distinct from these, and entirely private property.\nof Java, and communicated by the liberality of a Dutch gentle-\nman, by whose desire they were translated.\n\n3. A dictionary* of the Javanese language in Dutch, com-\nmunicated by its author, still living at Samarang.\n\n4. Several other abridged memoirs and historical materials re-\nlating to Java; descriptions and reports relating to Batavia,\nand to the island in general and its climate, with memoirs on\ncommercial and political subjects.\n\n5. Copy of a grammar of the ancient Tamil Grant'ham character\nwritten in India, with copics of some ancient inscriptions tran-\nscribed from the original in the library of the Literary Society\nof Batavia; and a variety of memoirs illustrative of the statis-\ntics and geography of Java, composed at Colonel Mackenzie's\nrequest.\n\n6. Extracts and copies of some memoirs and abridgements ad-\ndressed to the Honourable the Lieut.-Governor, Mr. Raffles,\nwho liberally communicated them; they are in answer to\nqueries and suggestions recommended to particular persons\nmore conversant in the customs and history of the country, by\nColonel Mackenzie.\n\nAncient Inscriptions, Coins, and Sculptures, in every country, assist\nmaterially in developing the ancient history and origin of nations, of\ninstitutions, and of the arts and sciences. In India the pursuit has\nbeen so successful that it could scarcely be omitted in Java.\n\nInscriptions.\u2014Setting modern inscriptions out of the question,\nabout twenty inscriptions or sassanams in ancient characters have\nbeen discovered in Java only, one of which had been noticed, and\nthat slightly, by European authors (the Batu Tulis).\u2020 Fac-similes\nhave been taken of them, and copies are intended to be communicated\nto the Society at Calcutta, and to any others desirous of the commu-\nnication. Three different characters are used in them, all yet unde-\nciphered. One alone in the D\u00e9va-ndgari character was found on the\nvisit to Prambana.\n\nAncient Coins.\u2014A small collection has been made, a few are\nChinese and Japanese, most of them of a kind hitherto unnoticed by\nany European collector, perforated in the centre by a square opening,\nand bearing a variety of figures resembling those of the voyangs, or\n\n* Attempts are making to form a Javanese and English Dictionary for\nbut for want of assistants the work is delayed; Colonel Mackenzie\na Javanese with him, who assists to render it, by means of the\nEnglish language.\n\n\u2020 Thunberg's Vo\nJavanese plays. None of these coins are to be found even in the collection of the Batavian Society; they are usually dug up with other vestiges of antiquities near places that have been destroyed by volcanic eruptions. It is singular, that a few coins of the same Chinese kind were found some years ago in a distant part of the Mysore country; and one also among the ancient coins recently discovered at Mahabalipuram near Madras, a circumstance that points at early commercial communication between the oriental islands and continents with India.\n\nAncient Sculptures and Images are frequently met in Java, some indicating the existence of the Hind\u00fa mythology at a certain period; most of them relate to the Buddhist and Jaina doctrines; some few specimens of the small copper images dug up were obtained, and drawings have been taken of all the remains of architecture and sculpture that were discovered in the tract of this tour. Several of these drawings relate to the interesting remains of Prambana, said to be a very early and the most ancient capital of the dominion, arts, and literature of Java. A particular memoir of its present state was communicated to the Society of Batavia, and has been published in the seventh volume of their Transactions, but without the drawings of curious sculptures, as no engraver was to be found at Batavia.\n\nColonel Mackenzie has thus attempted to convey a hasty, but, he trusts, correct idea of some of the objects that have occupied much of his time in Java; for, besides those observations in a military and political view that might be expected from his professional situation on the late expedition, it was also necessary to pay attention to the inquiries and objects of the commission on tenures and lands, &c., in Java, to which he was appointed in January 1812, when on the journey to the eastward.\n\nIn conclusion, he apprehends that ample materials are collected to give a pretty clear view of the present state of Java, to which if the materials now considerably increased can assist in adding any illustration of the ancient history and the geography of that island, it will be gratifying to him if his exertions can in the least degree have contributed to stir up a spirit of inquiry that may be usefully applied to fill up the outlines he has ventured to trace.\n\nFort William,\n10th of November, 1813.\nB.\n\nExtract of a general Letter from England in the public Department, dated Feb. 9, 1810, to the Government of Fort St. George.\n\n2. In our despatch of the 11th January, 1809, written in the regular course of reply to letters from you in this department, we were prevented by the pressure of other affairs from entering into the consideration of the subject which occupied your letter of the 14th March, 1807, namely, the services of Lieut.-Colonel Colin Mackenzie in the survey of Mysore, and certain provinces adjacent to it.\n\n3. Having now reviewed with attention the whole of that subject, as it is detailed in the letter just mentioned, and the papers which accompanied it, and in the various documents which are referred to in your subsequent advices of the 29th February, 21st, 24th, and 26th October, 1808, we feel it to be due to Lieut.-Colonel Mackenzie; and it is a great pleasure to us to bestow our unqualified and warm commendation upon his long-continued, indefatigable, and zealous exertions in the arduous pursuits in which he was employed, and upon the works which those exertions have produced. He has not confined his labours to the leading object of his original appointment, and in itself a very difficult one, the obtaining of an accurate geographical knowledge of the extensive territories which came under the dominion or protection of the company, in consequence of the fall of Tipu Sultan in 1799, but has carried his researches into two other very important branches, the statistics and the history of those countries; and in all of them he has succeeded to an extent which could not have been contemplated at the commencement of his undertaking.\n\n4. The actual survey, upon geometrical principles, of a region containing above 40,000* square miles, generally of an extremely difficult surface, full of hills and wildernesses, presenting few facilities or accommodations for such a work, and never before explored by European science, in a climate very insalubrious, is itself no common performance; and the minute divisions and details of places of every description given in the memoirs of the survey, with the masterly execution, upon a large scale, of the general map, and its striking discrimination of different objects, rarely equalled by any thing of the\n\n* In addition to this the ceded districts have since been completed on the same plan, containing about 30,000 square miles, with maps, &c. without any consideration for Colonel Mackenzie's direction of that work, and sent home to England in January 18\nsame nature that has come under our observation,\u2014form altogether an achievement of extraordinary merit, adding most materially to the stores of Indian geography, and of information useful for military, financial, and commercial purposes. For such purposes, we shall wish the many materials furnished by Lieut.-Colonel Mackenzie to be used by our government; and a set of his memoirs ought, with that view, to be lodged in some of the public departments, particularly that of the revenue board, together with the sections of his map which he purposes to form into an atlas. But desirous as we are that the public at large should have the gratification, and himself the credit, which would result from a general knowledge of his work, we entertain considerable doubts of the propriety* of publishing it at this time, and would wish no measure to that end to be taken without our farther consideration and authority; therefore no copy of his map, or of the division of it, further than for the public offices just mentioned, ought to be permitted to be taken.\n\n5. On a full review of these labours, and of others which were not so immediately within the scope of Lieut.-Colonel Mackenzie's commission, we must admit that his merits have not been merely confined to the duty of a geographical surveyor; and finding that his representations on the subject of the inadequacy of his allowances are seconded by very strong recommendations from you, we direct that you present him with the sum of 9000 pagodas, as full remuneration for his past labours, and as a mark of our approbation of his work.\n\n6. We next proceed to notice the statistical researches in which also Lieut.-Colonel Mackenzie employed himself. These are nearly allied to inquiries of a geographical kind, and answer the same end in an improved degree; they have, too, the merit of being in India much more uncommon; and though they were adverted to in the original instructions given to Lieut.-Colonel Mackenzie, the ample and successful manner in which he has pursued them, in the midst of other arduous labours, proves the zeal by which he has been actuated, and adds to the value of his services and his discoveries.\n\n7. This observation applies with at least equal propriety to his supplementary inquiries into the history, the religion, and the antiquities.\n\n---\n\n* Colonel Mackenzie does not intend such a publication without some prospect of encouragement to so extensive a work; but materials have been since added that will nearly complete the peninsula. He conceives, however, that the publication of the work would be ultimately economical to the East India Company, exclusive of its advantage to the public and to science.\nthe country; objects pointed out indeed in our general instructions to India, but to which, if he had not been prompted by his own and public spirit, his other fatiguing avocations might have been pleaded as an excuse for not attending.\n\n8. Real history and chronology have hitherto been desiderata in the literature of India, and from the genius of the people and their past government, as well as the little success of the inquiries hitherto made by Europeans, there has been a disposition to believe that the Hind\u00fas possess few authentic records. Lieut.-Colonel Mackenzie has certainly taken the most effectual way, though one of excessive labour, to explore any evidences which may yet exist of remote eras and events, by recurring to remaining monuments, inscriptions, and grants, preserved either on metals or on paper; and his success in this way is far beyond what could have been expected. The numerous collections* of materials he has made under the different heads above noted, must be highly interesting and curious; and the specimens he has adduced in the manuscript volumes he has sent us abundantly answer this character, whether the grants, which are generally of lands, to Br\u00e1hmans, are all authentic\u2020 (which we mention, not to assert a doubt, but to suggest a reasonable point of inquiry), or whether the whole of the materials shall be found to form a connected series of historical facts respecting a country which seems to have been always subject to commotions and changes, and unfavourable to the preservation of political records. Still, it must be allowed, that this effort promises the fairest of any which has yet been made to bring from obscurity any scattered fragments of true history which exist, and undoubtedly encourages the expectation of ultimately obtaining both considerable insight into the state of the country and its governments in more modern periods, and some satisfactory indications of its original institutions and earlier revolutions. We are therefore very desirous that Lieutenant-Colonel Mackenzie should himself digest and improve the materials he has collected; and we hope the office which you have conferred on him in Mysore will afford him leisure for this work. After he has accomplished it, the original materials are to be transmitted to us, to be deposited in our Oriental museum. In the mean-\n\n* This collection has been augmented in a quadruple proportion since 1808, both in the peninsula in Hindust\u00e1n, and ultimately extended to a new field, the oriental islands, seas, and coasts of Asia.\n\n\u2020 There can be no doubt of their authenticity; not an instance of forgery has been discovered or even suspected, save one, (and that rather assists history). As they are all before 1620, there is no inducement to fraud; and no one has yet adduced any claims upon them.\n\nVol. I.\nto indemnify him for the disbursements he has made in his collection of materials, trusting that it will not amount to a sum; and we desire that he will state to us an account from his character, we are persuaded will be correctly not to suspend all payment till the arrival of such an permit you, on receipt of the present letter, to make him advance on this score.\n\n(Signed) D. HILL,\nHead Assistant to Chief Secretary.\nNOTICES OF WORKS.\n\nProfessor Rosellini of Pisa is proceeding with great rapidity in the publication of his important and extensive work entitled, \"I Monumenti dell' Egitto e della Nubia.\" The first volume of the second division of his subject, comprising the civil antiquities of those countries, has just been forwarded to the Society by the Professor, together with a continuation of the series of splendid illustrations, extending from Plate XXV. to LXXXIV. These plates are peculiarly interesting, as they exhibit representations of the domestic habits, and agricultural and manufacturing employments, of the ancient Egyptians. The whole work, as the readers of the Journal are probably aware, will occupy ten octavo volumes, to be accompanied by 400 plates.\n\nThe Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Asiatique of Paris is about to publish the original Arabic text of the geography of Abulfed\u0101. This work will be executed in lithography, and it is expected that the autograph copy of the Sultan of Hama, which belongs to the university of Leyden, will be available for this purpose. The Minister of Public Instruction has, with a praiseworthy liberality, advanced from the funds under his control the sum of two thousand francs towards the expenses of this undertaking.\n\nM. Jaubert's translation of the celebrated geographical work of Edrisi is announced as being nearly ready for publication.\n\nIn consequence of the indisposition of Professor Buron to the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Asiatique of Paris, no report of its proceedings was before the members at the meeting held on the 1st of April last; and we are consequently unable to communicate to our readers\nNOTICES OF WORKS.\n\nactive cultivation of oriental literature by which the\nthat institution are so eminently distinguished.

Williams Wynn, M.P., President, in the chair.\n\nA great number of donations were laid on the table, among which were the following, viz.: \u2014\n\nFrom the Rev. Dr. Wiseman, C.M.R.A.S., a complete set of the Works of Fr. S. Bartolomeo; his own \"Hora Syriaca,\" &c. From Major H. D. Robertson, a copy of the Shastri's game of \"Heaven and Hell.\" From M. Sakakini, a System of Anatomy, in Arabic, for the use of the Medical School at Abu Zabel, in Egypt. From Padre Gonsalves, his \"Diccionario China-Portuguez.\" From the Ritter Joseph von Hammer, his edition and translation of \"The Rose and Nightingale,\" a Turkish poem, by Fazli. From Sri Bhavani Charana Sarma, Sri Narayana Charana Sarma, Mouluvee Ramdhun Sen, and Hukeem Abd-oil Mujeeb, through James Atkinson, Esq., nineteen works, in various Oriental languages, published by those gentlemen at Calcutta. From Sir George Thomas Staunton, Bart., an ingeniously executed and elaborate model of the Pagoda Convent of Priests, &c. at Canton, assigned to Lords Macartney and Amherst for their residence when on embassy to China; an original painting, by a Chinese artist, representing the court of justice held by the Chinese authorities in the hall of the British factory at Canton, on the 8th March, 1807, to investigate a charge of murder preferred against some seamen of the H.C.S. Neptune; and a lithographed fac-simile of the same. From Captain Elwon, of the Bombay Marine, two Cufic inscriptions on stone, and sixty-one specimens of minerals, lavas, &c. &c. from the islands and coasts of the Red Sea.\n\nJohn Arrowsmith, Esq. F.R.G.S., and James Whatman, Esq., were elected resident members of the Society.\n\nThe reading of an Account of the Country of Sindh, with Remarks on the State of Society, Government, Manners, and Customs of the People, by the late Captain James M'Murdo, communicated by J. Bird, Esq. M.R.A.S., was commenced.\n\nThe meeting was then adjourned to the 21st.\n\nSATURDAY, JUNE 21ST, 1834.\n\nThe general Meeting was held this day; the Right Honourable Sir Alexander Johnston, V.P., in the chair.\n\nDr. Holt Yates and Lieut. George Le Grand Jacob, of the Bombay military establishment, were balloted for, and elected resident members of the Society.\n\nA letter from R\u0101maswami Mudeliar, J\u0101ghird\u0101r of Siva Samudram, was read, in which he expressed his thanks for the honour conferred on him by the Society.\nin electing him a corresponding member, viewing it as a testimony of its approbation of his endeavours to improve the state of the island of Siva Samudram, and facilitate the approaches to it by the construction of two bridges across the river Caveri, &c., of which an account, written by himself, was inserted in the Transactions of the Royal Asiatic Society, vol. iii. p. 305.\n\nThe reading of Captain M'Murdo's Account of Sindh was resumed.\n\nSATURDAY, JULY 5TH, 1834.\n\nA general Meeting was held this day; the Right Hon. Sir A. Johnston, V.P., in the chair.\n\nSeveral donations were laid on the table, among which were the following, viz.:\n\nFrom Major Charles Stewart, a very curious and valuable original painting, representing the Mogul emperor, Jehangir, and the principal personages of his court. This interesting record is supposed to have been the work of a celebrated artist, named Abd al Samad, and, from various circumstances, to have been executed about A.D. 1625. Major Stewart communicated several memoranda connected with the subject of the picture, and it is hoped that he may be induced to favour the Society with notices of the individuals whose portraits have been thus preserved.*\n\nFrom Lieut. Alex. Burnes, F.R.S., a copy of the Narrative of his Journey from India to Bokhara, Persia, &c., with the Map by Mr. J. Arrowsmith.\n\nFrom the Right Hon. Sir A. Johnston, an Indian matchlock and powder-flask, apparently very ancient; also an account of the different classes of Elephants, translated from the Sinhalese; and an original drawing of the crater of Mount Merapi, a volcano in Java.\n\nWilliam Holt Yates, Esq. M.D., elected on the 21st of June, having made his payments and signed the obligation-book, was admitted a member of the Society.\n\nJohn Edye, Esq., of the Navy Surveyor's Office, Somerset House, and Robert Alexander, Esq., late member of council at Madras, were balloted for, and elected resident members of the Society.\n\nThe first part of Observations on Atmospherical Influence, in reference to Climate, &c., by Whitelaw Ainslie, Esq. M.D., was read.\n\nDr. Ainslie commences by quoting the recorded opinions of other writers, both ancient and modern, on this subject, and proceeds to examine the effects of climate on the physical and moral character of the human race; observing that, in hot countries, both the mental and corporeal faculties arrive at maturity sooner than in more temperate regions; while, at the same time, it may be doubted whether the causes of this more rapid expansion are not also conducive to more speedy decay. The effects of heat on the children of Europeans born in India, and on half-castes, are next adverted to; and the author then develops the causes of change in national character acting independently of climate, illustrating his remarks by adducing the ancient and modern states of various nations. The next point treated, is a comparison of the climates of the old and new continents, with observations on the probable origin of the differences perceptible between them, which leads the author to speak of the various sanitary stations established in India. He concludes this section with some general reflections on the subject of climate, including considerations on the differences of colour in the human race.\n\n* Major Stewart has since favoured the Society with these Notices, and they appear in this number of the Journal.\u2014Ed.\nThe reading of the late Capt. M'Murdo's Account of Sindh, communicated by James Bird, Esq., was brought to a conclusion.*\n\nThanks were returned to Dr. Ainslie and Mr. Bird for their respective communications.\n\nSATURDAY, JULY 19TH, 1834.\n\nThe last General Meeting for the present Session was held this day; the Right Hon. Chas. W. Williams Wynn, M.P., President, in the Chair.\n\nAmong the donations laid on the table were the following:\u2014\n\nFrom M. Adolph Erman, a copy of the first volume of his \"Reise um die Erde durch Nord Asien und die beiden Oceans in den Jahren 1828, 1829, und 1830;\" with plates.\n\nFrom the Royal Society of Literature, the second Part of Vol. II: of its Transactions.\n\nFrom Maharija Kali Krishna Bahadur, his Bengali Translations of Dr. Johnson's Rasselas, and of a System of Polite Learning. Also his MS. account of N\u0101garkirtana; a public invocation of Hari by the Hindus, with a coloured drawing of the procession.\n\nFrom Major William Yule, a lithographed fac-simile of a magnificent Indian gold coin or medal, struck by the Emperor Sh\u00e1h Jeh\u00e1n, and weighing seventy ounces. Major Yule has added translations of the inscriptions, and inscribed the whole to the Royal Asiatic Society.\n\nFrom the Right Hon. Sir A. Johnston, two portraits, in water-colours, of Mira Sebbe Meestriar Sekadie Maricar, a Muhammedan physician to the court of Kandy, who possessed various privileges and exemptions derived from his ancestors, the first cloth-weavers introduced into Ceylon, to whom they were granted by the then King of Kandy, as evidenced by an ancient deed of gift, of which a transcript was presented to the Society by Sir A. Johnston.\n\nJonathan Birch, Esq. was balloted for, and elected a resident member of the Society.\n\nAn account of the Sect of Kaprias at Mhurr, by Robert Cotton Money, Esq., Bombay C. S., was read.\n\nThis sect, the origin of which, like that of most religious orders among the Hind\u00fas, is involved in much obscurity, derives its name from being devoted to the worship of Parvati, the consort of Siva, under her name of K\u0101la Puri, or Kaya Puri. It claims for its founder Lalla Jus Raj\u00e1, an associate of R\u00e1m-chunder, after his conquest of Ceylon, but who quitted him at Mhurr to establish this sect, by special order of the goddess. The constitution of the order is singular: it is limited in number to 120 or 130 members, who are bound by a solemn obligation to a life of celibacy, and on the death of any one of their number, he is replaced by a person taken from some Hind\u00fa caste; the age is immaterial, above eight or nine years. When the new brother is introduced, the tuft of hair on the crown of his head is cut off, and replaced by the peculiar cap of the order; various other ceremonies are also performed. The temple dedicated to their divinity in the town of Mhurr is of great antiquity and celebrity; and such is the importance attached to the favour of 'Asapura (the Cutch name of the goddess), that the rao of Cutch are not thought to be secure on their throne until they have visited this sacred shrine. The most productive villages in the neighbourhood belong to this sect; and more activity, comfort, and signs of opulence are to be discovered in them than in any other part of the Rao's dominions.\n\nThanks were ordered to be returned to Mr. Money for this communication.\n\n* Inserted in the present volume of the Journal, vide p. 223.\nThe Narrative of a Journey to Senna from Mocha, by Robt. Finlay, Esq., assistant-surgeon to the Mocha residency, was read.\n\nMr. Finlay's journey was performed in the months of August, September, and October, 1823, leaving Mocha on the evening of the 4th of August. His object was to visit the Im\u00e1m professionally, having been sent for by his highness for that purpose. The first part of the paper is occupied with an itinerary of his route; he then gives some account of the city of Senna, which is situated at the foot of the mountain of Nukkum. It has a mud wall twenty feet in height, with three gates and many small turrets; its extent outside the wall is about three miles; the Bost\u00e1n\u00ed \u0160ult\u00e1n, or garden in which the Im\u00e1m resides, is on the south-west of the city, and is of considerable extent; it contains a small menagerie, consisting of two very fine large African lions, some tigers, leopards, and tiger-cats. The palaces are large buildings, of four or five stories in height; the most recent was then finishing, with glass windows. The best land in the neighbourhood of Senna is on the north side, where the water runs after supplying the town. Where the fields are well supplied with water, they will yield two good crops in the year; and when in clover, it will cut every two months. The fields are generally three years in grain, and are then sown with clover, which remains five or six years. The soil is sometimes manured with ashes; many good fields are lying waste. From this subject the author proceeds to sketch the history of the Im\u00e1ms, and to give some account of the then possessor of that dignity, with an explanation of the constitution and government of Senna. Mr. Finlay, in the next place, describes the character and appearance of the population; their manufactures and commerce, and the revenues and military establishment of the Im\u00e1m; concluding with an account of the author's return to Mocha.\n\nThanks were returned to Mr. Finlay for his communication.\n\nThe meetings of the Society were then adjourned over the vacation to the 6th of December.\nPROCEEDINGS\n\nof\n\nThe Oriental Translation Fund.\n\nSince the publication of the preceding Number of this Journal, the Oriental Translation Fund of Great Britain and Ireland has held its fifth General Meeting, at which his Grace the Duke of Richmond, K.G., presided.\n\nThe Report of the committee having been subsequently printed and widely circulated, it will be sufficient to give in this place a concise summary of its most important features, as follows:\n\nAfter adverting to the honours conferred by his Majesty on Sir Charles Wilkins and Sir Graves Haughton, and explaining the reason why no meeting of the subscribers was held in 1833, the Report goes on to say:\n\n\"During the short period of its existence, the committee has been enabled to publish a considerable number of translations and editions of works in the Oriental languages, and to lay the foundation for a still more extensive activity. In the first four years no less than thirty volumes were produced; and in half that period, since June 1832, fourteen works have been, or are now, ready for delivery, making a total of forty-six volumes; whilst the remaining portions of such as were delivered incomplete, and many other interesting translations, have been undertaken, some of which are now laid upon the table, and others in a state of great forwardness.\"\n\nIt then adverts to the superior value of the works now selected for publication, and notices those recently published and in course of preparation, in detail, We select a few of the more important, viz.:\n\n\"'Mirkhond's History of the early Kings of Persia,' by Mr. Shea, is an important addition to Oriental historical literature, as it exhibits a connected view of the Oriental version of a period of ancient history which we are accustomed to receive exclusively on classical evidence. To what degree the old traditions preserved by Mirkhond may be founded on truth; how far his accounts agree with the testimony of the contemporary Greek historians; and whether it is likely that any data from the 'Royal Records' kept at the ancient Persian court, which are referred to by Ctesias, and were seemingly known to Firdusi, may have found their way into the works of Mirkhond,\u2014these are problems yet deserving the renewed attention of the friends of historical study.\"\n\n\"The 'Description of the Burmese Empire,' translated from the Italian MS. of the Rev. Father Sangermano, by Dr. Tandy, besides its own value, becomes doubly interesting from our recent connexion with that empire.\n\nThe Committee cannot here omit to notice the handsome conduct of the possessors of this MS., the Barnabite Fathers at Rome, in transferring it to the Society, and declining any compensation further than a wish to have an Italian translation printed at the same time as the English, and requesting 100 copies for their own library. The sale of the remainder of this Italian edition will in some degree cover the expense incurred by the Institution.\n\nThe reception of this work will doubtless be enhanced from its being the first specimen printed under the superintendence of our active and intelligent Branch Committee at Rome.\"\n\nVol. I.\nGretzinger, of Madrid.\n\nMr. Gretzinger was at length taken into the committee. The new library has been opened to the public by His Excellency Mr. Gretzinger, a Spanish gentleman, who was formerly connected with the Royal Library, the library of the Archdiocese of Toledo. It will henceforth be open to the students of literature, and all who may wish to avail themselves of its services, will be enabled to make use of it at any hour. Of course, no charge will be made for the privilege of consultation or instruction, so far as the expenses of the first years are concerned. A considerable portion of the library is now catalogued, and many valuable works have been added to the collections since the opening. In conclusion, we would say, that in comprising in its contents a vast amount of material for the students of literature, the new library is a great addition to the resources of Spain.\nof that country are very rich; especially to the great chronicle of Al Makari (or Al Mokri), to a History of Grenada by Mohammed Ben Abdallah Ben Said Ben Al Khatib, and to a chronicle entitled 'Al Lamhat al Badriyah fi Daulat al Nasriyah.'\n\nThe Report mentions that a change in the mode of publishing the works brought out by the committee has been effected, but does not enter into particulars: it announces that Mr. R. Bentley, of New Burlington Street, has been appointed publisher to the Fund.\n\nFifteen subscribers have been added to the list since the last anniversary.\n\nThe receipts for the year 1833 were stated at 1,565l. 7s. 3d., and the disbursements for the same period at 1486l. 19s. 8d., leaving a balance of cash in favour of the Fund of 78l. 7s. 7d., to which must be added 8l. 0s. 3\u00bdd. in the hands of the secretary. The receipts from the 1st of January 1834 to the date of the audit, 8th July, were 896l. 10s. 7d., expenses 692l. 14s., leaving a balance in the hands of the treasurer of 203l. 16s. 7d. The assets of the Fund amounted to the estimated value of 5,745l. 15s. 2\u00bdd.\n\nSince this meeting was held, Professor Garcin de Tassy's new translation of the romance of Kamrup, from the Hindustani, has arrived; and the edition of M. von Klaproth's \"Annals of Japan\" is shortly expected.\n\nProfessor Wilson has announced that a considerable portion of the Vishnu Purana is ready to be put to press; as also the translation of the Sankhya Karika, made by Mr. Colbrooke, which the professor has edited and accompanied with notes.\nGENERAL MEETINGS\n\nof\n\nThe Royal Asiatic Society\n\nof\n\nREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND.\n\nFOR THE SESSION 1834 AND 1835.\n\nDAY, December ........................................... 6.\nJanuary .................................................. 3 and 17.\nFebruary .................................................. 7 .. 21.\nMarch ..................................................... 7 .. 21.\nApril .......................................................... 4.\nMay ............................................................ 16.\nJune ........................................................... 20.\nJuly ............................................................ 4 .. 18.\n\nTHE GENERAL MEETINGS\n\nthe Society's House, 14 Grafton Street, Bond Street; and the Chair is taken at Two o'Clock p.m. precisely.\n\nTHE ANNIVERSARY MEETING\n\nheld on Saturday, the 9th of May, at One o'Clock, p.m.\n\nMuseum is open every Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, from Eleven o'Clock till Four.\nREPORT\n\nOF THE\n\nROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY\n\nOF\n\nGREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND,\n\nFOR\n\nTHE YEAR 1834.\nANNUAL REPORT.\n\n10th MAY, 1834.\n\nIn submitting to the Members of the Royal Asiatic Society the following Report of its proceedings for the year now terminated, the Council has the gratification of being able to state, in the first place, that the progress made by the Society has been in the highest degree satisfactory; and affords ample ground from which to look forward with confidence to a future career of undiminished prosperity and usefulness.\n\nThe Council has to announce with sincere regret, that the continued ill health of the venerable Director of the Society, has prevented his taking any active part in its operations since the last Anniversary, and induced him to tender the resignation of the office he has so long filled with honour to himself, as well as great advantage to the interests and character of the Society. Deeply impressed with the magnitude of the obligation due from the Society to its founder and early protector, as well as with the difficulty of securing, even among the many accomplished Oriental scholars of which this country can boast, an adequate successor to that profoundly learned and erudite individual, the Council felt itself bound to request that he would still permit his name to appear in the List of Officers of the Society.\n\nThe Report of the Auditors will be found to exhibit a state of the Society's finances for the last year, which the Council trusts will give satisfaction to the Members, that period having closed with a balance of cash in the Society's favour, amounting to \u00a3365. 15s. 4d.\n\nIn connexion with the subject of finance, the Council has to acquaint the Members that, in conformity to the recommendation contained in the last Auditor's Report, it appointed a Committee to consider the best means of recovering the arrears of subscription due to the Society; and it has the pleasure of stating, that a considerable portion of the arrears which were due has, in consequence, been recovered, and a further amount is confidently expected to be realized. After mature consideration, the Council also resolved to adopt the recommendation of the Committee, that the names of a few gentlemen should be withdrawn from the List of Members; the payment of the arrears due from them and their future attendance appearing to be improbable.\n\nThe Council also appointed a Committee to take into consideration the scale of payments hitherto required from non-resident members, with a view to ascertain if any modification of the regulations could be effected without injury, so as to increase the facilities for gentlemen temporarily residing abroad, to become members of the Society. The result was, a recommendation from the Committee to the effect that members resident at the Cape of Good Hope, or at any place to the eastward thereof, shall not be called upon to continue their annual subscriptions, and that their rights and privileges, as members of the Society, shall, during such absence, remain\nin abeyance, with liberty to resume them on recommencing the payment of their annual subscriptions. This recommendation, the Council has decided on submitting, together with some other, chiefly verbal, modifications in the rules, to the consideration and approval of the members on the present occasion. The Council deems it unnecessary to enter into the details of these proceedings, as they will be found amply developed in the minutes of the several Committees, now lying on the table.\n\nThe Council is happy to announce that the number of members elected into the Society since the Anniversary Meeting in May 1833, equals the average of the last five years; while, on the other hand, the number of members who have withdrawn has been much less. The Council has, however, the painful duty of stating that the loss which the Society has sustained by death, during the year now terminated, has been heavy and severe,\u2014amounting to one honorary, fifteen contributing, and two corresponding members;\u2014namely, His Royal Highness Abb\u00e1s Mirza, Prince Royal of Persia; the Right Honourable the Earl of Plymouth; Major-general Sir John Malcolm; Sir William Rumbold, Bart.; the R\u00e1j\u00e1 R\u00e1m Mohun Roy; the Rev. Bewick Bridge; Lieut-Colonel John Monckton Coombs; Henry Gahagan, Esq.; Richard Heber, Esq.; Godfrey Higgins, Esq.; Charles Mackinnon, Esq.; Charles Marjoribanks, Esq.; Thomas Perry, Esq.; Roger Pettigrew, Esq.; William Sotheby, Esq., and Edward Upham, Esq. R\u00e1m R\u00e1z, Native Judge and Magistrate in Mysore; and Charles Telfair, Esq., President of the Committee of Public Instruction in the Mauritius.\n\nHis Royal Highness Abb\u00e1s Mirza, Prince Royal of Persia, fell a victim to an epidemic disorder, which attacked him while proceeding to rejoin his army engaged in effecting the subjugation of Khorasan. The untimely loss of this illustrious honorary member of the Society, is a circumstance much to be lamented by the public in general, but by this Society in particular. His Royal Highness was known to the western world as one ardent himself in the pursuit of information, and eager to adopt every favourable expedient by which the acquaintance of his countrymen with the arts and sciences of Europe might be facilitated.\n\nOf an individual so prominently before the public, during a long and arduous career of official duty as was the late Sir John Malcolm, but little that is new could here be said; and his character and varied attainments have been so ably delineated, and so justly eulogized on other occasions, that it is the less requisite. But as one of the original members, and a strenuous supporter of this Society, the Council feels it incumbent not to withhold a tribute of respect to his memory. Of his literary capacity, his numerous published works will have enabled the world to judge, and his masterly sketch of the history, condition, and habits of that well-known race of plunderers, the Bhils of Central India, which was inserted in the first part of the Transactions of the Society, has deservedly excited general admiration. The interest he felt in the prosperity of the Society, was evinced on various occasions; and in none more conspicuously than in the establishment of the union between this Society and the Literary Society of Bombay; now the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society.\n\nIt will doubtless, be in the recollection of many members now present, that R\u00e1m Mohun Roy took a part in the proceedings of the last Anniversary\nmeeting. On that occasion, he moved a vote of thanks to Mr. Colebrooke, and passed a high eulogium on his talents and extraordinary acquirements; at the same time observing, that \"although he was mortal, his works would live after him, and secure his lasting fame.\" The object of this tribute still survives, and it is to be hoped may long do so, but he who uttered it has ceased to exist; and it might, perhaps, be difficult to quote an observation more appropriate to his own case, than the one above recorded. The mind of R\u00e1m Mohun Roy was too active and vigorous to be satisfied with the narrow sphere of information to which the customs and prejudices of his country would have limited it, and he availed himself with eagerness of every opportunity to enlarge its boundaries. In every point of view, the loss of R\u00e1m Mohun Roy, as an ardent promoter of the best interests of his countrymen, an indefatigable supporter of institutions founded for the promotion of praiseworthy objects, and an able and enlightened scholar, will not easily be repaired.\n\nLieutenant-Colonel Coombs, was an officer of the Madras army; and besides his services in the peninsula of India, he was long employed in the British possessions in the Eastern Archipelago, having been associated with the late Sir Stamford Raffles, to negotiate a treaty with the Sult\u00e1n of Ach\u00edn. He visited England in 1825, and shortly afterwards joined this Society, of which he became an active member. On his return to Madras, in 1829, he carried with him instructions to enable him to co-operate in the re-organization of the Literary Society of that place, an object which had been specially recommended to the attention of the then Governor of the Presidency, by the Council of this Society. The melancholy circumstances which attended the termination of his existence, are too generally known to require that they should be repeated here. It is understood, that shortly before this event, he had established a journal, devoted to science and literature in connexion with the East, on the plan of that published under the auspices of the Asiatic Society at Calcutta.\n\nMr. Godfrey Higgins was remarkable for the laborious perseverance which he displayed in collecting materials for the illustration of the religions of the ancient world,\u2014a subject on which his theories were somewhat bold and speculative; but the mass of facts which he has brought together, cannot fail to be useful to the future explorer of the difficult path. Besides his work on the Celtic Druids, published in the year 1828, he was the author of an Apology for Muhammedanism; and a little tract entitled, Hor\u00e6 Sabbatice.\n\nMr. Edward Upham was originally a bookseller at Exeter, and he at one time filled the office of mayor of that place. He was, from an early period of life, devoted to literary pursuits, and at length made them his principal occupation. Circumstances having directed his attention more particularly to Eastern subjects, he became a member of this Society; and shortly afterwards furnished a descriptive catalogue of the splendid collection of articles connected with the religion, arts, and manners of the Burmese, which had been found in that country during the war, and were temporarily deposited in the museum of the Society, by Captain Marryat, of the Royal Navy. This catalogue was read at two general meetings of the Society.\n\nIn the Annual Report which the Council had the honour to lay before\nin abeyance, with liberty to resume them on recommencing the payment of their annual subscriptions. This recommendation, the Council has decided on submitting, together with some other, chiefly verbal, modifications in the rules, to the consideration and approval of the members on the present occasion. The Council deems it unnecessary to enter into the details of these proceedings, as they will be found amply developed in the minutes of the several Committees, now lying on the table.\n\nThe Council is happy to announce that the number of members elected into the Society since the Anniversary Meeting in May 1833, equals the average of the last five years; while, on the other hand, the number of members who have withdrawn has been much less. The Council has, however, the painful duty of stating that the loss which the Society has sustained by death, during the year now terminated, has been heavy and severe,\u2014amounting to one honorary, fifteen contributing, and two corresponding members;\u2014namely, His Royal Highness Abb\u00e1s Mirza, Prince Royal of Persia; the Right Honourable the Earl of Plymouth; Major-general Sir John Malcolm; Sir William Rumbold, Bart.; the R\u00e1j\u00e1 R\u00e1m Mohun Roy; the Rev. Bewick Bridge; Lieut-Colonel John Monckton Coombs; Henry Gahagan, Esq.; Richard Heber, Esq.; Godfrey Higgins, Esq.; Charles Mackinnon, Esq.; Charles Marjoribanks, Esq.; Thomas Perry, Esq.; Roger Pettigrew, Esq.; William Sotheby, Esq., and Edward Upham, Esq. R\u00e1m R\u00e1z, Native Judge and Magistrate in Mysore; and Charles Telfair, Esq., President of the Committee of Public Instruction in the Mauritius.\n\nHis Royal Highness Abb\u00e1s Mirza, Prince Royal of Persia, fell a victim to an epidemic disorder, which attacked him while proceeding to rejoin his army engaged in effecting the subjugation of Khorasan. The untimely loss of this illustrious honorary member of the Society, is a circumstance much to be lamented by the public in general, but by this Society in particular. His Royal Highness was known to the western world as one ardent himself in the pursuit of information, and eager to adopt every favourable expedient by which the acquaintance of his countrymen with the arts and sciences of Europe might be facilitated.\n\nOf an individual so prominently before the public, during a long and arduous career of official duty as was the late Sir John Malcolm, but little that is new could here be said; and his character and varied attainments have been so ably delineated, and so justly eulogized on other occasions, that it is the less requisite. But as one of the original members, and a strenuous supporter of this Society, the Council feels it incumbent not to withhold a tribute of respect to his memory. Of his literary capacity, his numerous published works will have enabled the world to judge, and his masterly sketch of the history, condition, and habits of that well-known race of plunderers, the Bhils of Central India, which was inserted in the first part of the Transactions of the Society, has deservedly excited general admiration. The interest he felt in the prosperity of the Society, was evinced on various occasions; and in none more conspicuously than in the establishment of the union between this Society and the Literary Society of Bombay; now the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society.\n\nIt will doubtless, be in the recollection of many members now present that R\u00e1m Mohun Roy took a part in the proceedings of the last Annu...\nFrom the Native Education Society of Bombay, the Society has been favoured with a copy of Ferishta's History of the Muhammedan Power in India, beautifully lithographed, in imitation of manuscript, on tinted paper; in two volumes, folio.\n\nFrom Professor Rosellini, the conductor of the scientific expedition sent to Egypt at the expense of His Imperial and Royal Highness the Grand Duke of Tuscany, at the time when that under M. Champollion was similarly engaged under the auspices of the French government, the Society has received a copy of the splendid work now publishing by him at Pisa, which will embody the results of the labours of both the expeditions. The work will extend to ten volumes, octavo, of text; and as many fasciculi of illustrations, comprising fac-similes of the most extraordinary and interesting relics of sculpture, painting, &c., found in the various districts whose antiquities were explored. Two volumes of the text, descriptive of the historical monuments, and five parts of the plates, have already been sent by the learned Editor, and the remainder will, no doubt, speedily follow.\n\nThe Right Honourable the President has contributed to the library a further portion of the official documents relating to the affairs of the East Indies, ordered to be printed by the House of Commons; and the Right Honourable Sir Alexander Johnston, one of the Vice-Presidents, has presented a complete series of the Reports and Minutes of Evidence delivered before the several committees with reference to the recent discussion on the renewal of the Charter of the East India Company; and also a collection of the cases heard in Appeal from the East Indies before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. The Society has likewise been favoured by Sir Alexander with several papers in MS. connected with the Pearl Fisheries of the island of Ceylon, and some curious Dutch Charts of the Western Coast of the Peninsula of India and Ceylon.\n\nFrom the Raja Ram Mohun Roy, a short time previous to his decease, the Society had the gratification of receiving copies of four of his principal works, viz.: The Precepts of Jesus the Guide to Peace and Happiness; Translation of several books, passages, and texts of the Veds, &c.; Essay on the right of Hind\u00fas to Ancestral Property; and, Exposition of the practical operation of the Judicial and Revenue Systems of India.\n\nProfessor Wilson has presented a copy of the second edition of his valuable Dictionary of the Sanscrit and English Languages; and the Council readily avails itself of this opportunity to allude to the advantages which will doubtless be derived to the progress of Oriental Literature in this country, from the high and important station now held by that distinguished scholar in one of its ancient seats of learning. It is with peculiar pleasure that the Council is enabled to state that the continued assistance of Professor Wilson has been promised to this Society; that he is now engaged in the translation of many important works from the Sanscrit, for the Oriental Translation Fund; and that he is also engaged in the preparation of an entirely new fount of types in the N\u00e1gar\u00ed character.\n\nTo Mr. William Butterworth Bayley the Society is indebted for a set of Treatises on the Anatomy of the Human Body, written in the Persian and Hindi languages, by P. Breton, Esq., one of the Surgeons on the Bengal Establishment, for the instruction of students educated in the\nrecollection of the members. It will, therefore, be only necessary here to observe, that besides many useful and standard works in Oriental literature, it places the Society in possession of, probably, the most extensive library of Russian works accessible to the public in Great Britain. Several of these will be found interesting to those engaged in researches into Oriental history and antiquities, from their intimate connexion with these subjects; and there are also many volumes of travels in the Crimea, the Caucasus, and Persia. In addition to these printed books, amounting to nearly one hundred and eighty volumes, Colonel Doyle presented a most valuable collection of Oriental manuscripts, sixteen of which are in Persian, and two in Arabic. The most interesting specimen in this collection is, perhaps, a splendid copy of the Sh\u00e1h Nameh of Firdousi, which, besides its intrinsic worth as a most beautiful manuscript, possesses a peculiar value as a relic of the Moghul sovereigns in India; containing internal evidence of having been in the Imperial Library at Delhi for many centuries, being stamped with the signet of every emperor from B\u00e1ber to Aurungzeb, and having a long autograph note of the Emperor Sh\u00e1h Jehan at the commencement. This literary treasure was taken from the Imperial Library when the fortunes of the Moghul dynasty sank beneath the power of the Mahrattas, from whom it passed into the hands of the Nav\u00e1b Viz\u00edr of Oude; and by the late supporter of that dignity it was presented to the Marquess of Hastings, Governor General of India. The volume is enclosed in rich crimson velvet and gold cloth cases. Three other manuscripts, of great beauty, are, a copy of the Bost\u00e1n of Sadi, finely illuminated, and written on tinted paper; a copy of the Kho\u00e1s\u00fa va Shir\u00edn of N\u00edz\u00e1m\u00ed, on paper, elaborately ornamented; and a copy of the Khamsah, or five poems of N\u00edz\u00e1m\u00ed, with splendidly-illuminated titles. The Mathnav\u00ed of Mozuffer Kh\u00e1n is curious, as the autograph copy of the author, and containing some well-executed illustrations.\n\nOf the drawings, maps, &c. &c. presented by Colonel Doyle, it will be impossible to furnish any thing like an adequate idea on the present occasion; but among the former are three volumes containing one hundred and fifty beautifully-executed representations of costumes, scenery, and mythological subjects; and the latter comprise maps and surveys of most of the districts in India; routes of detachments, plans of forts, and charts of coasts, only attainable to such an extent through the peculiar facilities afforded by Colonel Doyle's official situation in India.\n\nIt was with sincere regret, however, that the Council had to consider this munificent contribution as the parting gift of its esteemed and respected associate; who has, not only in this instance, but in every other, since the formation of the Society, evinced in the most zealous and liberal manner his desire to further and promote its interests. It is gratifying to know that the high character and talents of Colonel Doyle have met with their reward in his appointment to fill an honourable and important office in the government of one of the most valuable of our West Indian possessions.\n\nThe Royal Society of London having on a former occasion presented a set of the Philosophical transactions from the year 1823, the Council has great satisfaction in stating, that by the liberality of that body the series has been completed retrospectively, as far as it was possible to do so, dating from the year 1801.\nwhich reflects high credit on his talents, zeal, and liberality. It is believed that this is the only copy sent to Europe; and the Council has the pleasure to announce that a notice, by which its nature and objects will be made more generally known, is in preparation.\n\nThe Model of the Hindu Pagoda at Trivellore, presented to the Society by Mr. John Hodgson, some time ago, has arrived from Madras, and is now deposited in the Museum, to which it is a curious and valuable addition, affording an interesting specimen of the ingenuity of the native artist by whom it was constructed, and a faithful representation of the original buildings. A bird's-eye view of this edifice will be found among the illustrations to the work of Ram R\u00e1z, of which copies are now laid on the table.\n\nAnother Model, executed by a native of India, has been placed in the Museum through the kindness of Mr. William Newnham, Member of Council at Bombay. It is a fac-simile of one of those singular depositories for the dead, used in that place by the well-known sect of Parsis, or Fire Worshippers. The one in question was erected in the year 1832, at the expense of Framji Cowasji Sett, by a young engineer named Sorahji Dhumjibhoy; and, to him the Society is indebted for the model as well as the illustrative drawings accompanying it.\n\nDon Juan de Silva, a Corresponding Member of the Society, and Mohan-diram of the Lascorn Corps of Galle, in Ceylon, has presented a series of sixteen specimens of the precious stones found in that district, accompanied by their respective appellations in Cinghalese.\n\nSir Grenville Temple has forwarded to the Society, through the intervention of Lieut.-General Forbes, M.R.A.S., a curious relic of antiquity, being a Phenician monumental slab, with the representation of a human figure rudely sculptured on it, and an inscription, as yet undeciphered. This object was brought by Sir Grenville Temple from a village called Maghr\u00e1wah, in the Beylik of Tunis; and a lithographic fac-simile, with a copy of the letter of Sir Grenville Temple accompanying it, has been inserted in the fasciculus of the Transactions now lying on the table. The Council has to remark that the Society was indebted, before receiving the grave-stone itself, to the kindness of Miss Forbes, daughter of General Forbes, for a very perfect cast of it in plaster.\n\nBy Mr. Nathaniel Bland, jun., the Museum has been enriched with a beautiful series of Russian coins, including one of platinum, a coinage recently introduced into that country. Mr. Bland also presented a copy of Professor Schmidt's Grammar of the Mongolian Language.\n\nCaptain Harkness, Secretary to the Society, has presented a sculptured representation of the Linga, attended by cobra capellas, finely executed in black marble; a curious drawing of the Seringham Temple, by a native artist, richly coloured, and accompanied by descriptions of the particular divisions in Tamil; and a massive silver neck-chain, worn by the Tudas, or aboriginal inhabitants of the Nilgiri Hills, a race first described by him.\n\nIt would be easy to extend these notices, so as to place her important donations for the year, but the\nbounds to which this Report is necessarily restricted, will not allow the Council to do what would otherwise give it much pleasure.\n\nThe very great assistance which has been derived in the prosecution of the Society's objects from the Branch and Auxiliary Societies established in India, has induced the Council to take measures for the establishment of similar associations in other parts of the world to which the views of the Society are directed; and, among these, it is with very great satisfaction that the Council announces the establishment of a Literary Society among the learned and respectable natives of the Madras Presidency, at the head of which is the venerable assistant in the labours of the late Colonel MacKenzie, Cavelli Vencata Lutehniia. Some correspondence has already taken place between this new auxiliary, and the parent institution; and the Council entertains no doubt whatever that when its members shall have acquired a little more experience in the management of a Society so novel in its plan amongst them, the most satisfactory consequences will shortly follow. Indeed, when on the occasion of delivering its last Annual Report, the Council pointed out the peculiar aim of this Society, namely, that of \"urging the singularly intellectual races of India to make known through themselves the results of their ancient and steady civilization,\" it was hardly prepared to expect so speedy an attempt to realize its expectations. The Council has since recommended to some of the most able and influential members of the Parsi community at Bombay to form a similar establishment among themselves, and it entertains a confident expectation that its suggestion will be shortly acted upon. In addition to the foregoing, the Council is happy to state that arrangements are making by the Right Hon. Lord Nugent, Lord High Commissioner of the Ionian Islands, to institute an Auxiliary Society at Corfu, which will have for its especial objects the tracing the intimate connexion which formerly existed between Europe and Asia by means of the Mediterranean countries, and the careful examination of all the libraries existing in any of those states; to ascertain whether they contain any works which may throw light upon its nature and history.\n\nCaptain Alexander, who is well-known to the public from the spirit of observation and enterprise displayed by him in his travels in Ava, Persia, Turkey, Russia, and America, has recently undertaken to conduct an expedition of discovery to Delagoa Bay and its neighbourhood, on the Eastern Coast of Africa; and as he will proceed to his destination via Egypt, the Council at once availed itself of this opportunity to open communications with the Chevalier Clot Bey, M. Augustus Sakakini, Mr. Bonhomi, and other European residents in that country, with a view to secure their co-operation on a similar system, by which the researches of the Society in that most interesting portion of the African continent may be carried on with facility and effect; and, lastly, the Right Hon. Lord Napier, Chief Commissioner of British Affairs at Canton, has been furnished with instructions to enable him, on his arrival, to establish a Branch Society there, from which peculiar advantages are, in many respects, anticipated.\n\nThe Council conceives that it need not dwell longer on these subjects here, because the arrangements having been chiefly conducted through the medium of the Committee of Correspondence, a more ample explanation\nwhich reflects high credit on his talents, zeal, and liberality. It is believed that this is the only copy sent to Europe; and the Council has the pleasure to announce that a notice, by which its nature and objects will be made more generally known, is in preparation.\n\nThe Model of the Hind\u00fa Pagoda at Trivallore, presented to the Society by Mr. John Hodgson, some time ago, has arrived from Madras, and is now deposited in the Museum, to which it is a curious and valuable addition, affording an interesting specimen of the ingenuity of the native artist by whom it was constructed, and a faithful representation of the original buildings. A bird's-eye view of this edifice will be found among the illustrations to the work of R\u00e1m R\u00e1z, of which copies are now laid on the table.\n\nAnother Model, executed by a native of India, has been placed in the Museum through the kindness of Mr. William Newnham, Member of Council at Bombay. It is a fac-simile of one of those singular depositories for the dead, used in that place by the well-known sect of Pars\u00eds, or Fire Worshippers. The one in question was erected in the year 1832, at the expense of Framji Cowas-ji Sett, by a young engineer named Sorahji Dhunjibhoy; and, to him the Society is indebted for the model as well as the illustrative drawings accompanying it.\n\nDon Juan de Silva, a Corresponding Member of the Society, and Mohan-diran of the Lascorn Corps of Galle, in Ceylon, has presented a series of sixteen specimens of the precious stones found in that district, accompanied by their respective appellations in Cinghalese.\n\nSir Grenville Temple has forwarded to the Society, through the intervention of Lieut.-General Forbes, M.R.A.S., a curious relic of antiquity, being a Phoenician monumental slab, with the representation of a human figure rudely sculptured on it, and an inscription, as yet undeciphered. This object was brought by Sir Grenville Temple from a village called Maghr\u00e1-wah, in the Beylik of Tunis; and a lithographic fac-simile, with a copy of the letter of Sir Grenville Temple accompanying it, has been inserted in the fasciculus of the Transactions now lying on the table. The Council has to remark that the Society was indebted, before receiving the grave-stone itself, to the kindness of Miss Forbes, daughter of General Forbes, for a very perfect cast of it in plaster.\n\nBy Mr. Nathaniel Bland, jun. the Museum has been enriched with a beautiful series of Russian coins, including one of platinum, a coinage recently introduced into that country. Mr. Bland also presented a copy of Professor Schmidt's Grammar of the Mongolian Language.\n\nCaptain Harkness, Secretary to the Society, has presented a sculptured representation of the Linga, attended by cobra capellas, finely executed in black marble; a curious drawing of the Seringham Temple, by a native artist, richly coloured, and accompanied by descriptions of the particular divisions in Tamil; and a massive silver neck-chain, worn by the Tudos, or aboriginal inhabitants of the Nilagiri hills, a race first described by him.\n\nIt would be easy, and in many respects highly proper, to extend these notices, so as to place on special record many other important donations with which the Society has been favoured during the past year, but the\nbounds to which this Report is necessarily restricted, will allow the Council to do what would otherwise give it much pleasure.\n\nThe very great assistance which has been derived in the prosecution of the Society's objects from the Branch and Auxiliary Societies established in India, has induced the Council to take measures for the establishment of similar associations in other parts of the world to which the views of the Society are directed; and, among these, it is with very great satisfaction that the Council announces the establishment of a Literary Society among the learned and respectable natives of the Madras Presidency, at the head of which is the venerable assistant in the labours of the late Colonel MacKenzie, Cavelli Vencata Lutchmiah. Some correspondence has already taken place between this new auxiliary, and the parent institution; and the Council entertains no doubt whatever that when its members shall have acquired a little more experience in the management of a Society so novel in its plan amongst them, the most satisfactory consequences will shortly follow. Indeed, when on the occasion of delivering its last Annual Report, the Council pointed out the peculiar aim of this Society, namely, that of \"urging the singularly intellectual races of India to make known through themselves the results of their ancient and steady civilization,\" it was hardly prepared to expect so speedy an attempt to realize its expectations. The Council has since recommended to some of the most able and influential members of the Parsi community at Bombay to form a similar establishment among themselves, and it entertains a confident expectation that its suggestion will be shortly acted upon. In addition to the foregoing, the Council is happy to state that arrangements are making by the Right Hon. Lord Nugent, Lord High Commissioner of the Ionian Islands, to institute an Auxiliary Society at Corfu, which will have for its especial objects the tracing the intimate connexion which formerly existed between Europe and Asia by means of the Mediterranean countries, and the careful examination of all the libraries existing in any of those states; to ascertain whether they contain any works which may throw light upon its nature and history.\n\nCaptain Alexander, who is well-known to the public from the spirit of observation and enterprise displayed by him in his travels in Ava, Persia, Turkey, Russia, and America, has recently undertaken to conduct an expedition of discovery to Delagoa Bay and its neighbourhood, on the Eastern Coast of Africa; and as he will proceed to his destination via Egypt, the Council at once availed itself of this opportunity to open communications with the Chevalier Clot Bey, M. Augustus Sakakini, Mr. Bonhom, and other European residents in that country, with a view to secure their cooperation on a similar system, by which the researches of the Society in that most interesting portion of the African continent may be carried on with facility and effect; and, lastly, the Right Hon. Lord Napier, Chief Commissioner of British Affairs at Canton, has been furnished with instructions to enable him, on his arrival, to establish a Branch Society there, from which peculiar advantages are, in many respects, anticipated.\n\nThe Council come to it need not dwell longer on these subjects here, because the medium of the C\nthe present, will be supplied, and what is erroneous, will be corrected. The members of the Society will not, the Council feels assured, be backward in extending their patronage to a work of this nature, so produced; for, although the estimable author has been removed from this world, he has left those behind him who feel an interest in his fame, and a proportionate anxiety for the success of his labours. That they will not be disappointed, may, it is hoped, be safely prophesied: since his work is before those who are best qualified to pronounce on its merits, and estimate the talents, the industry, and perseverance of its author.\n\nIt was with very sincere regret that the Council received, shortly after the last Anniversary Meeting, the notification from Colonel Tod, of his intention to resign his office as Librarian to the Society. Colonel Tod was the first who assumed the office, and those members who have made use of the Library can bear testimony to the ability and success with which its administration by that gentleman has been attended. Colonel Tod has not only been one of the most liberal contributors in every shape to the stores and Transactions of the Society, but has long put it in possession of a reversionary interest in his own valuable Oriental library; an example which the Council trusts may be followed by all those members who possess means of the like nature. The ill state of his health, arising from long-continued and active exertions in the literary pursuits which have tended so much to his honour, compelled Colonel Tod to reside at a distance from London, with a view to its restoration; and thus induced him to take the step which was reluctantly acceded to by the Council; but it trusts, at no distant period, again to number him in its ranks.\n\nIn concluding its last Annual Report, the Council took occasion to point out the peculiar relations in which the Royal Asiatic Society stands to the British Empire, particularly its Oriental possessions; and to express its hope that the Society might become an effectual instrument in bringing into activity the intellectual energies of the inhabitants of our Eastern dominions: in directing them, when so awakened, to proper objects of public utility, and in making known the results of these exertions to the European world. In this view the Council considered the Society as a national institution, justly entitled to national support, from the means which it possesses for diffusing among the nations of the East whatever of European inventions may seem calculated to improve them in arts or science, or in any way tend to elevate them in the scale of nations; while, on the other hand, it operates as the medium through which a knowledge of all which they themselves possess may be laid before the public here, and be subjected to the scrutiny and examination of those to whom the progress of civilization is an object of deep and permanent interest.\n\nThe Report which has now been read, will show that these anticipations have already been partially realized. The associations of learned natives, the establishment of which is here recorded, proves the efficiency of the Society's endeavours to excite their literary ambition, while the honours which have been bestowed by the illustrious and Royal Patron of the Society on two of its distinguished members, intimate the importance of its objects, and the high estimation in which its operations are held. It will be at once understood, that the Council here alludes to the honours con-\nferred on Sir Charles Wilkins, and Sir Graves Haughton; the former, one of the leaders of that numerous band who have devoted their time and talents to the promotion of knowledge in connexion with the East,\u2014one, whose name, in conjunction with those of Jones and Colebrooke, will descend to posterity, as the founders of a new school of literature, and institutors of the first association for the development of the History and Antiquities of the East; and, though sixty years have passed since that respected and venerable individual first essayed the path, he yet lives, and the sanguine aspiration is that he may long survive to witness the progress of those who mainly depend on the assistance he prepared when comparatively alone: the latter, eminent for his distinguished attainments in the language, literature, and philosophy of the East, while his philanthropy, and ardent zeal in the promotion of the objects of this Society, and of learning and philosophy in general, have too often been the theme of praise to call for eulogy on the present occasion.\n\nSuch is an outline of the Society's history during the year now terminated; and in which the Council hopes will be traced, not only the satisfactory progress made by the Society during that period, but also steps tending to its advancement in usefulness and eminence for the future.\n\nAUDITORS' REPORT.\n\nThe Auditors appointed by the Council of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, to examine the Accounts of the Society for the year 1833, have agreed upon the subjoined report.\n\nThe Auditors have been furnished by the Treasurer with the account of receipts and disbursements for the year ending the 31st of December, 1833, exhibited in the statement marked No. I., by which it will be seen that the year terminated with a balance of cash in the Society's favour amounting to \u00a3365. 15s. 4d.\n\nThe Auditors duly inspected the vouchers produced by the Treasurer and Secretary for their respective disbursements, and have to report them strictly in accordance with the sums charged.\n\nThe statement, marked No. II., contains the estimate of the Society's Receipts and expenditure for the current year. The former are calculated to amount to \u00a31769. 2s., including the balance of cash in hand, on account of the year 1833. The auditors have been careful not to admit into their estimate any item which they have not good reason to believe will be actually realized, proceeding on the same principle as the auditors of last year; and the members cannot have failed to remark, that the actual receipts of the year 1833, were within \u00a325 of the amount estimated, while the actual balance in hand, on the 31st of December, exceeded by \u00a372 the sum expected.\n\nThe probable expenditure for the current year amounts to \u00a31, leaving a presumed balance of cash in the hands of the treasurers of the year, amounting to \u00a3276. 7s. In this expendi-\ncharge for East India Newspapers supplied to the Society during the last six years; and also one, for the publication of three numbers of the Society's Journal, the ordinary expenditure remaining as heretofore.\n\nBy the arrangements made by the Council to carry into effect that recommendation of the auditors appointed at the last anniversary, relative to arrears of subscription, the amount then due has been considerably reduced; and should the measures proposed by the Council be sanctioned by the Society, a prospective reduction may be looked forward to, and eventually the extinction to a great extent, if not altogether, of this item in the Society's accounts.\n\nThe balance of cash in the treasurer's hands, at the date of the last quarterly statement submitted to the Council, namely, the 31st of March, was \u00a3337. 2s. 2d.\n\nThe assets of the Society may, in the opinion of the auditors, be fairly estimated considerably higher than has hitherto been the case; for the value of the copyrights and stock of the Society's publications has never yet been taken into account, and the continued increase of the Society's property in the departments of the Library and Museum, render the former calculation of their value much too low; added to which, the market-price of the Society's funded property is at present considerably augmented. The auditors are, therefore, induced to estimate the assets of the Society as under, namely:\n\n| Description                                                                 | \u00a3   | s. | d. |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----|----|----|\n| Value of Copyrights and Stock of the Society's Publications                  | 1500| 0  | 0  |\n| Ditto of Library, Museum, and Furniture                                     | 2000| 0  | 0  |\n| Ditto of Stock invested in the Three per cent.
