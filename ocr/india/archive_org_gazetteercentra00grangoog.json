Temple, the then Chief Commissioner:\n\n\"It has long seemed to the Chief Commissioner that a Gazetteer is needed for the Central Provinces. None will dispute that for the good management of districts local knowledge is necessary. The more detailed and intimate such knowledge is, the better. This remark, however general may be its application, is particularly applicable to provinces like these, where the areas are widespread; where the tribes and circumstances are diverse; where the component parts are separated from each other by mountain barriers or other physical obstacles; where information is often difficult of acquisition by reason of the remoteness of localities; and where the annals of the country, though to some extent existing, are for the most part inaccessible to the majority of our countrymen.\n\n\"When such knowledge is merely acquired by individuals, it is apt to be of a fugitive character, owing to those frequent changes which are inevitable in Indian administration. It constantly happens that when an officer has, by travelling about, and by communicating with the people, learnt very much regarding his district, he is obliged by ill health, or by the requirements of the service, or by other reasons, to leave, and then he carries all his knowledge away with him, his successor having to study everything ab initio.\n\n\"Thus it becomes of importance that the multiform facts of local interest and value should be recorded by all who have the\nmeans of knowing them; and that such record should be embodied in an abiding shape, patent to, and within the reach of all, so that everyone who is concerned to ascertain these things may have the ordinary resources of information ready to hand.\n\n\"Therefore it was in 1864 resolved to collect materials for a Gazetteer. With this view all officers serving in these Provinces were furnished with a sketch of the information required. In due course every officer transmitted the data for his district. Advantage was also taken of the Settlement Department being in operation to obtain therefrom all the facts bearing on the subjects in question. Thus in the course of two years a mass of information in manuscript was accumulated.\n\n\"The work thus brought out, though probably as complete as it can be made at the present time, is yet avowedly imperfect, and is in some respects only preliminary. The information generally may from year to year be supplemented by further details, and on numerous points will doubtless be found susceptible of emendation. The statistics especially will constantly be open to enlargement and rectification. Still a broad foundation for future superstructure has at least been raised.\"\n\nThe impression of the earlier numbers was soon exhausted, and it became a question whether they should be reprinted. On revision of the sheets, however, so many inaccuracies\u2014unavoidable perhaps in a first attempt of the kind\u2014were discovered, that I undertook to prepare a new edition. I am glad to have this opportunity of cordially thanking Captain Forsyth, Deputy Commissioner of N\u00edma\u00edr, Dr. Townsend, Sanitary Commissioner, Lieutenant Bradshaw of the Police, Mr. Barclay and Mr. V\u00e1sudeva Ball\u00e1l Kh\u00e9r of the Chief Commissioner's Office, and most of all Mr. J. Neill, Assistant Secretary, for the assistance which they have kindly rendered me, and also of recording my grateful acknowledgments to Mr. Morris, Officiating Chief Commissioner, for a degree of interest shown in the undertaking, and of consideration to myself during its progress, without which it would have been difficult to carry through a laborious task under the pressure of regular daily duties.\nIn the present edition the alphabetical form, usual in gazetteers, has been adopted, and a full Index has been added, so that the difficulties in tracing information, complained of in the first edition, will be removed, and the descriptions of rivers and mountain ranges, especially, will be found concentrated in one easily discoverable place, instead of being scattered over many parts of the Gazetteer. A great portion of the matter contained is either quite new or has been newly adapted for the purposes of this work. Thus the long articles on \u00c1's\u00edrgarh, B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t, Burh\u00e1np\u00far, M\u00e1ndh\u00e1t\u00e1, Nim\u00e1r, and the Wardh\u00e1 district have not before been published, while those on the Bil\u00e1sp\u00far, Damoh, Mandla, R\u00e1\u00edp\u00far, and Upper God\u00e1var\u00ed districts mainly consist of extracts from the Land Revenue settlement reports, written after the publication of the first edition. The remaining articles too have been carefully revised, word by word, and in many cases amplified, so that at least one-half of the body of the work is new. An introductory sketch of the Province has also been prefixed, containing a geological description of the Province by T. Oldham, Esq., LL.D., Superintendent of the Geological Survey of India, and statistical tables and a glossary of vernacular words have been appended.\n\nBut though no time, toil, or care has been spared in making the present edition as complete as possible, it is not to be expected that a work written and compiled under the unintermittent pressure of severe official duties should be free from many imperfections. Proceeding, too, from the hands of many writers, the Gazetteer necessarily shows great diversities both of form and of substance. Thus it must be confessed that some of the articles do not reach the standard of the excellent descriptions of N\u00e1gp\u00far (by Mr. M. Low), Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 (by Major Lucie Smith), and Bastar (by Major Glasfurd), in the first edition,\u2014or of Bil\u00e1sp\u00far (by Mr. Chisholm), and Nim\u00e1r and its places of interest (by Captain J. Forsyth) in the present edition; but however deficient in uniformity, the articles all possess this common recommendation, that they were written on the spot by local officers, thoroughly familiar with their subjects. It would not have been difficult to recast the information, thus obtained, in one rigid\nmould for all districts, but in the process all the genuineness, individuality, and freshness of the local descriptions would have evaporated, and substantial value would have been sacrificed to form. The original arrangement of the district articles has therefore in most cases been retained, revision being confined to the correction of the more prominent errors, and (where necessary) to the simplification of the style.\n\nThe most effectual method of obtaining a really good description of the country is probably that recently adopted by the Government in some of the other provinces of India, where the task has been entrusted to selected experts, qualified both by literary skill and by special knowledge to collect and give the best possible shape to all the information available from local or other sources. But the present reproduction of the Central Provinces' Gazetteer was almost ready for the press when the Government of India promulgated its scheme for a general gazetteer, and directed that the local compilations should be so constructed as to admit of their ready combination into an Imperial Dictionary of Geography for India. It was therefore too late to attempt so thorough an alteration of scheme as these instructions would have involved, and considering the great cost of special agency, and the difficulty of carrying through an official publication of the kind at all, it was thought better to take advantage of its completion, even in an imperfect form, and to trust to a future revision for bringing it up to the level which will no doubt be attained by its more matured successors in other parts of India. There was, however, fortunately still time to take advantage of some of the suggestions of Mr. W. W. Hunter, LL.D., who had been deputed by the Government of India to inspect the progress of provincial gazetteers, and it is needless to say that where it has been possible to make the additions suggested by his practised skill, they have given an increased value to the work.\n\nThe system of transliteration employed has been that approved by the Government of India, viz. the Jonesian or Wilsonian system,\nwithout diacritical marks. To scientific readers it may be necessary to explain that in a few cases where the conventional spelling, and indeed pronunciation, had departed very widely from the correct form, a compromise has been adopted. Thus, for instance, Sivar\u00ed N\u00e1r\u00e1yan has been spelt Seor\u00ednar\u00e1in. There has been some difficulty in showing the Arabic letter \u0113 without the usual expedient of an apostrophe; but few Persian words occur in so remote a province as this, and those few have ordinarily been spelt in the manner adopted in Wilson's Glossary. The vowel e has also been accented in a few words whose pronunciation might otherwise have puzzled an unskilled reader. For names of places in other parts of India, especially in the case of well known localities, such as Cuttack and Cawnpore, the conventional spelling has been retained.\n\nTo general readers it should be explained that the vowels e and u and the accented a and i should be given the open sound as in Italian. The unaccented a should be pronounced something like the u in the English word 'but,' and the unaccented i like the i in the English word 'it.'\n\nIn conclusion it is necessary to request indulgence for occasional typographical errors, especially in the names of places. It must always be hard to ensure entire accuracy in the introduction of a new system of spelling, and in the present case there has been the additional difficulty, that while the work was printed at Bombay, the proofs were corrected at N\u00e1gpur, more than five hundred miles off, and sometimes in even more distant places, so that close supervision was not possible.\n\nCHARLES GRANT.\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nGENERAL DESCRIPTION.\n\nGeneral want of knowledge regarding Gondwana\u2014Travellers' Tales\u2014True wonders of the country\u2014Formation of the Central Provinces\u2014Their original amalgamation under the name of Gondwana\u2014Hindu encroachments; and partition of the country between Northern and Southern Hindustan\u2014Reunion of Northern and Southern Gondwana under the Marathas\u2014Isolated position of the present province\u2014Physical subdivisions\u2014Physical Geography\u2014Scenery\u2014Nabada country\u2014The rivers\u2014Natural beauties\u2014Hill country\u2014Removal of obstacles to its settlement\u2014Forest country\u2014Nagpur plain\u2014Chhattisgarh.\n\nTen years ago the country which is now called the Central Provinces was for the most part a terra incognita to Englishmen. So lately as 1853, when the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India had been at work for half a century, and the more detailed surveys for some thirty years, Sir Erskine Perry, addressing the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, wrote, \"At present the Gondwana highlands and jungles comprise such a large tract of unexplored coun-try that they form quite an oasis in our maps. Captain Blunt's interesting journey in 1795, from Benares to Rajamandri, gives us almost all the information we possess of many parts of the interior.\"*\n\nIn these days such a description would scarcely be applicable anywhere out of Central Africa; and it is difficult to realise that at so comparatively late and well known a period of Indian history as the Vicere-galty of Lord Dalhousie, a country, great part of which had been for years under the prosaic but regular administration of Magistrates and Collectors, should have lain so completely beyond the ordinary\n\n* Journal of the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, vol. iv. p. 302 (January 1853).\ncurrents of information. Even within the last fifteen years Surveyors and Missionaries have lost months of work in the fertile Narbada valley from the prevalent idea that camp life there was dangerous till January. If one of the gardens of India could be thus misrepresented, no marvels were too great to gain credence regarding the really wild interior. The Southern Forests are marked in old maps as inhabited by men who live in trees, and though fancy never went so far as to reproduce the men \"whose heads do grow beneath their shoulders,\" there were whispers of \"anthropophagi\"\u2014naked savages who ate their relations;* while others a little higher in the scale, who had both religion and social ties, recognised the one chiefly by human sacrifices, and the other by taking their victims from among alien tribes only.\u2020 The writings of three such distinguished men as Sir Richard Jenkins, Sir William Sleeman, and Sir Donald Macleod \u2021 should have done much to dissipate the curious obscurity which shrouded the centre of our Indian Empire; but with the exception of Sleeman's \"Rambles of an Indian Official,\" these works were not very generally diffused; and all who have been interested in Indian public life will remember that Sir R. Temple's first report on the Nagpur Province was awaited with almost as much curiosity as if it had been a story of exploration in a new country. In the eight years which have since elapsed almost every corner of the province has been searched out, and though under a stronger light the gloomy marvels of the interior have mostly shrunk down to common-\n\n---\n\n* The Bandarw\u00e1s go entirely naked; are armed with bows and arrows; never build any huts, or seek other shelter than that afforded by the jungles; are said to destroy their relations when too old to move about, and eat their flesh, when a great entertainment takes place, to which all the family is invited.\"\u2014Sir R.

The Marfs, to whom this\npractice was attributed, though the shyest of the aboriginal races, turn\nout, when better known, to be cheerful, mild-dispositioned savages,\nwith no pretensions to cleanliness, certainly, but not without a god-\nliness of their own. The true wonders of the country are under the\nsurface, and may be found in such social\nphenomena as the Deist revival and aboli-\ntion of caste among the Chamaras, a helot people of Chattisgarh,\nor such historical episodes as the sway of the Gond dynasties, probably\nthe only aboriginal\u2020 races which ever attained so high an organisation\nas to bear up against the Aryan power in its full development. Some-\nthing has been done to explore these byways of inquiry, but there is\nno want of fresh ground to travel over, and in the present stage of\nour knowledge probably no part of the country has more curious pro-\nblems, whether in sociology or in physical geography, to offer to the\nstudent of Indian subjects.\n\nIn 1861 this central tract of highland and valley, with its unknown\nhistory, its unsuspected resources, and its\nstrange world of wild tribes, became a\nseparate division of British India, uniting\nunder the name of the \"Central Provinces\" the tracts then known as\nthe Nagpur Province, and the Sag\u00e1r and Narbad\u00e1 Terri-\nories. Though these component portions are essentially distinct in\nmany of their characteristics, ethnical and physical, there was much in\nfavour of their amalgamation. Originally they had, roughly speaking,\n\n* \"The Bandarw\u00e1s would appear to have got their name from the monkey\n(bandar), which they eat.\"\u2014Mr. Chisholm's Bilaspur Settlement Report, para. 122.\n\u2020 Here, and throughout, the term \"aboriginal\" is applied to the non-Aryan tribes\nfor the sake of convenience merely, and not as implying any foregone conclusion with\nregard to their origin.\nbeen almost coincident with the old territorial division of Gondwana, and the Gonds had sufficiently outnumbered the residue of the wild tribes, who with them had sought refuge in this unknown region of woods and hills, to take rank as a separate nationality among the peoples of India. The Satpura plateau, which, running east and west for nearly 600 miles, may be regarded as the true barrier between Northern and Southern India\u2014the line on which settlers from Hindustan met the opposite wave of immigration from Maharashtra and the Deccan\u2014seems to have been to these aboriginal tribes a great natural fastness, making life possible to them amid the surgings and convulsions attendant on their displacement by more powerful and highly organised races. As they gained strength and confidence they quitted their earlier seats on the Satpur\u00e1s, and occupied the rich valleys of the Narbad\u00e1 to the north, and of the Wardh\u00e1 and Waingang\u00e1 to the south. But they were as little fitted to cope with men of Aryan descent in peace as in war; and though slow centuries of enervation under an Indian sky had relaxed the Northern vigour of the races to whom they had once before succumbed, yet in every quality and attainment which can give to one people superiority over another, there was probably as much difference between Hind\u00fas and Gonds as there is now between Anglo-Americans and Red Indians, or between Englishmen and New Zealanders. The second repulse of the aboriginal tribes, though not so rapid and violent as we may imagine the first to have been, was more thorough, and probably more irrecoverable.\n\nHind\u00fa encroachments. Step by step the Gond cultivators were driven back to stony summits and upland valleys inaccessible to the plough, and only culturable by the rude expedient of burning the forest and sowing in the wood-ash; while the deep rich soil of the plains below was gradually cleared, and occupied by a yearly increasing body of enterprising farmers. Those of the aborigines who remained were absorbed, though never so completely as to attain equality with the people who had overrun them. They form at present the lowest stratum of the Hind\u00fa social system, allowed to take rank above none but the most despised outcastes. The Chiefs were assimilated by\nthe higher race, and found themselves slowly but inevitably transformed into Hind\u00fa rulers of a Hind\u00fa population.\n\nBoth the Southern and the Northern plains obtained their Hind\u00fa population in some such manner as this, but from different sources. Thus it resulted that the Narbad\u00e1 valley and the country associated with it became, ethnically, an offshoot of Bundelkhand and M\u00e1lw\u00e1, while the N\u00e1gpur territory proper was overflowed by Mar\u00e1th\u00ed-speaking tribes from the Deccan. The Southern belt of the central plateau may be regarded as debatable land, where the two races meet, each, however, retaining its own distinct characteristics. The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 descendant of a rice-eating race, bred in a tropical but equable climate, has neither the physical energy nor the independence of the peasant of the Narbad\u00e1. In dress and appearance the contrast between the two races is striking; and on a gala day when a southern crowd presents a mass of white clothing and enormous red turbans, the more northern people may be known by their costume of mhowa green, and their jaunty, compactly-twisted head-dress of white cloth. Though the difference in latitude and elevation is not considerable, there is a most perceptible variation in the climate and products \"below and above the gh\u00e1ts.\" The Narbad\u00e1 country is a great wheat-field; while the higher temperature of the N\u00e1gpur plain, and its greater facilities for storage of water, are favourable to the production of rice; so that the opposite advance of either race may in some degree have been regulated by the conditions of life to which it had been habituated; and the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1s may be regarded so far as a climatic as well as an ethnic boundary between Northern and Southern India.\n\nWhen to the encroachments of foreign settlers succeeded the subversion of their native princes, and the Gonds lost the last trace of a separate national existence, the two provinces still remained (with a brief interregnum) united under the dominion of the Bhonsl\u00e1 R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Ber\u00e1r, and they were\nnot separated until the cession of the S\u00e1g\u00e1r and Narbad\u00e1 territories to the British in 1818. So that notwithstanding the want of affinity which has been already pointed out, and such minor incongruities as the existence in the population of Uriya, Telugu, and other almost equally heterogeneous elements, there was much historical precedent for their union. More practical arguments in its favour were the difficulty of securing anything like really strong central administration in charges so insignificant as the two provinces would have been standing singly, and their distance and isolation from other seats of British Government. The N\u00e1gp\u00far province is almost entirely surrounded by independent and semi-independent states, except where it joins the S\u00e1g\u00e1r and Narbad\u00e1 territories; while the latter, with a similar exception, only touch other British possessions at three points, viz. in parts of the districts of Lalatp\u00far in the north-western provinces, of Kh\u00e1ndesh in Bombay, and of the God\u00e1var\u00ed in Madras. Thus of a total boundary of some 2,700 miles, not more than 160 march with British territory.\n\nOf the nineteen districts which comprise the united province, two, S\u00e1g\u00e1r and Damoh, lie parallel to each other upon the Vindhyan table-land. Next come to the south, in the Narbad\u00e1 valley and its offshoots, the districts of Mandla, which includes the upper portion of the river course before it debouches into the plains, Jabalp\u00far, Nasirnghp\u00far, Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d, and a part of Nim\u00e1r, the rest of which lies in the valley of the Tapt\u00ed. The next range of districts, continuing southwards, are Bet\u00fal, Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1, Seoni, and B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t, which occupy the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1 table-land, and attain at their central stations a height of about 2,000 feet. Still further to the south is the great N\u00e1gp\u00far plain, formed by the valleys of the Wardh\u00e1 and Waingang\u00e1, and comprising the districts of N\u00e1gp\u00far, Wardh\u00e1, Bhand\u00e1ra, and Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1. Eastwards, and still below the gh\u00e1ts, is the Chhatt\u00edsgarh plain\u2014a low plateau of red soil, containing the districts of R\u00e1\u00edp\u00far and Bil\u00e1sp\u00far. In this division is also included the district of Sambalp\u00far, which is not, however, part of Chhatt\u00edsgarh proper, either geographically or\nhistorically. It was originally attached to the South-west Frontier Agency of Bengal, and lies principally in the valley of the Mah\u00e1-n\u00e1di. Last of all, to the extreme south, almost cut off by forests and wild semi-independent states, is a long strip of territory, lining the left bank of the God\u00e1var\u00ed, and styled the Upper God\u00e1var\u00ed district.\n\nThus within comparatively narrow limits follow each other a Physical geography. plateau and a plain, and again in similar sequence, a larger plateau and a larger plain, ending in a mass of hill and forest, which is probably the very wildest part of the whole peninsula. Even the continuously level portions of this area are broken by isolated peaks and straggling hill-ranges; while its rugged formation and rapid slopes give to the greatest rivers which rise in it, such as the Narbad\u00e1 and Tapt\u00ed something of the character of mountain torrents.\n\nThough the scenery is on too small a scale to compare in sublimity with that of the Him\u00e1laya, it is Scenery. on the other hand as far removed from the monotony of the plains of Hindust\u00e1n. Not only is it characterised by rapid and constant variety of form and level, but it possesses a diversity of colour almost peculiar to itself. The recurring contrast of woodland and cultivation, which brings out so vividly the beauties of each, may be seen on a more imposing though not so wide a scale in the noble glades of the Sub-Himalayan Forests; and the Central Provinces only share with the rest of Central India and with the Deccan the alternation of hill and valley, wood and river, which is so grateful to eyes fatigued by the lengthened sameness of dusty Indian plains. But probably in no part of India are the changes of soil and vegetation more rapid and marked than in the Narbad\u00e1 country. In the pleasant winter months the eye may range over miles of green corn-lands, only broken by low black boundary ridges or dark twisting footpaths. The horizon is bounded here and there by hill-ranges, which seem to rise abruptly from the plain, but on coming nearer to them the heavy green of their slopes is found to\nbe divided from the softer hues of the young wheat by broad belts of gravelly soil\u2014here carpeted with short sward and dotted with noble trees\u2014there uncovered and contrasting their brown-red tints with the deep black of the valley lands. The epithet which occurs to almost every English describer in writing of these border belts is \"park-like;\" but though the smoothness of the surface and the noble growth of the Mhowa trees\u2014too valuable to fear the axe\u2014may favour the illusion, the velvety freshness of English scenery is wanting to complete it.\n\nIt is only in favoured reaches of the rivers, where the pools never dry, that the water-loving shrubs keep their verdure and brilliancy throughout the year; and even here the charm of rippling water and grateful shade may not be free from that element of terror which associates itself with all Indian conceptions of beauty. Often the overhanging rock, with its curtain of foliage, or the clump of bushes in the middle of a sparkling eddy, which an artist would select to draw, is the very retreat which a tiger has chosen for his summer lair, and though the high rewards now paid for wild beasts are telling on their numbers, the dwellers on these secluded river-banks have still many a tale to recount of cattle lost, or even of human lives sacrificed.\n\nOne almost universal characteristic of the rivers is their limpidity.\n\nThe rivers. Even in the lowlands the strength of their currents cuts down through the deep soil to the rock beneath; while in their rapid descent through the rocky valleys of the hill-country they gather up no discolouring load of earthy matters; and the play of the water on successive formations of almost every known class and texture produces an endless variety of form and combination, ranging from the deep weedless pools, separated by dark barriers, of the streams which cross the basaltic region, to the clear sandy beds of the rivers passing through the metamorphic and sandstone formations.\n\nNatural beauties. The tortuous gorge of white marble through which the Narbad\u00e1 winds with a deep silent course is now well known to Indian tourists, but there are many spots, hidden away in corners of little-travelled districts, which\nare as well worthy of a visit. It is often said that the Hind\u00fas have no appreciation of natural beauties, but there is scarcely one of these lovely spots, however secluded, that has not been selected to point some ancient legend, or to adorn the favoured abode of some deity. At Amarkantak, where the Eastern hills reach their culminating point, in a country so rugged and difficult, that till of comparatively late years no European traveller had visited it, the sources of the sacred Narbada are guarded by a little colony of priests, who have reared their temples in the middle of the solitary forests. Westwards, the caves and awful gorges of the Mahadeo group, which may some day become the marvels of a hill sanitarium, are held so sacred that many hundreds of pilgrims have lost their lives from fatigue and cholera in scaling the difficult approaches to them.* The group of temples at Muktagiri in Betul, though selected by Fergusson\u2020 as a type of Jain architecture, owe their reputation as much to their picturesque position in a wooded valley, at the foot of a waterfall, as to the art and taste shown in their construction. But it would be endless to enumerate instances. From this hill is heard the sound of fairy drums,\u2014in that lake are seen reflected the ruins of a buried city; here the hill-sides have been hollowed into rude temples,\u2014there the confluence of two rivers is marked by some solitary temple on the bluff below which the waters meet. In short almost every spot of eminent natural beauty or interest has been appropriated by a religion which, however debased, still retains something of the form, if not of the spirit, of nature worship.\n\nOn the Satpur\u00e1s the alternations of scenery are even more frequent than in the low country. The hills are higher and more abrupt, the black-soil deposits are deeper, and the water-supply is more abundant. Hence in the midst of the grim rolling plateaus of basalt there often may be found little valleys cultivated like gardens,\u2014oases of sugarcane and opium, which, but for their inaccessibility, would tempt away the\n\n* The yearly fair is now stopped.\n\u2020 \"History of Architecture,\" vol. ii. p. 632 (1867).\nbest cultivators of the plains. It is thought that in some of these upland basins\u2014where the winds are cooled by passing over miles of natural vegetation, and the air even in May is clear and light\u2014tea, coffee, and other delicate plants might be raised with success, but the obstacles which have so long retarded the settlement of these plateaus, though partially smoothed away, still exist, and can only be surmounted by patient and continued energy. It is from steady settlers, pushing their way by slow degrees, rather than from speculating farmers, that the reclamation of these wastes must be hoped. Much has been done to open out the country of late years. Railways from either coast run up to within a few miles both of the southern and northern limits of the plateau, and there is no more travelled highway than the road which, running through its heart, forms the central link of communication between Calcutta and Bombay. Not many years ago the passes, which would now scarcely excite notice but for the boldness of their scenery, were looked forward to, days beforehand, with dread by cartmen, and most of the carriage of the country was effected by means of pack-bullocks. The valleys were sufficiently smooth and easy in the fair weather, but a few hours' rain would convert the track through them into a trough of deep black compost, in which every step was a labour to the most lightly laden animal. It was not till many layers of metal had been sucked in that the road was consolidated; and the local engineering department has now laid down the principle that black-soil roads should be constructed \"on the principles applicable to a morass.\"\n\nThese are some of the difficulties which lock up vast unoccupied areas against settlers. The present state of the trunk-road shows how completely they can be overcome; but its great cost must, on the other hand, preclude the repetition of a similar attempt from local resources and for mere local interests. Year by year, however, something is added by the Forest Department to its system of roads; something is done by district officers to smooth the more difficult ascents or to improve the crossings of streams. As these attempts, added to more direct measures of encouragement, attract by degrees a few enterprising\nfarmers from the plains to take up the virgin land which awaits them, the increasing revenues and importance of the upland districts will give those interested in their improvement the opportunity of working for it on a larger scale; and though they may never attain the prosperity which tradition assigns to them in the best days of the aboriginal princes, it may be hoped that the day is not very far distant when advancing cultivation shall be strong enough to neutralise the evil influences of the jungle, and the life of a settler in these forests shall be no longer a constant battle against tigers and malaria. At present it is almost incredible how quickly the ground which the hand of man has patiently gained, inch by inch, is swallowed up again by the jungle, when the pressure of regular occupation is for a moment intermitted. Sir William Sleeman, writing in 1826, records how a few days' ill-judged zeal on the part of a mere underling threw a flourishing tract of country out of cultivation for years, and completely closed a line of road. There had been a bad season, and yet the collection of the revenue had been pressed on in one of the wilder subdivisions of the Narsinghpur district, without allowance or consideration, by an overzealous sub-collector. The hill cultivators, at no time much devoted to their holdings, did not care to bear up against fresh difficulties, and deserted in a body. When better times came it was found impossible to re-populate the deserted villages, for they had been so grown over by jungle in a year or two that the very village sites needed clearing, and tigers had so readily occupied the new coverts thus made for them, that even travellers shunned the country.* The district of Mandla in the upper valley of the Narbad\u00e1 is an instance of the same kind, but on a much larger scale, if tradition is to be believed. It is said to have once returned a State revenue of over ten l\u0101khs of rupees (\u00a3100,000), but its total assessment is now only Rs. 56,516, or little more than \u00a35,000 a year. The high rewards now offered for tigers have, however, done so much to lessen danger from this source, that it may be almost left out of account in many places in estimating the drawbacks to jungle settlement. But there are still some great unbroken tracts of forest on which man has as yet made\n\n* Narsinghpur MSS. Records.\nso little impression that the sums allotted to keeping up communications are spent almost entirely in clearing away the constantly encroaching forest, and it was on a road of this kind that one tigress killed, in 1867-68, 135 men and women.*\n\nThough these jungle lands occupy an immense area in the Central Provinces, very small part of it is really valuable forest. The total extent of the Provinces, including Feudatoryships, is computed to be 111,121 square miles, of which only 29,656 square miles, or little more than one-fourth, are cultivated. Of this vast mass of waste land not above 4,000 square miles have yet been reserved as State forests. The rest is principally covered by scrub jungle, which, though often rich in wild fruit and other forest produce, supplies little wood of value for purposes of construction. On these rugged heights and stony plateaus the thin soil can never have furnished sustenance for fine timber; but there is a large residue of rich sheltered grazing lands, which would have been clothed with forest trees but for the improvidence of former generations. Not only was timber recklessly cut, often with so little regard to the cost of its removal, that it was allowed to lie where it fell, but each one of the more valuable trees had its own special enemy. The teak tree was the favourite prey of charcoal-burners, who from its close-grained wood produced fuel of the strongest and most concentrated kind. The s\u016bl (shorea robusta) when tapped supplies a valuable resin, and hence vast numbers of these noble trees were slowly killed by girdling. Even more universally destructive was the habit of d\u0101hya\u2020 cultivation, now fortunately on the wane.\n\n* In the Ch\u0101nd\u0101 district.\n\n\u2020 The D\u0101hya system of cultivation is thus described by Captain H. C. E. Ward in his Mandla Settlement Report, paras. 109\u2014112:\n\n\"109. As the D\u0101hya cultivation comprises no small amount of the general area, I will endeavour to describe it clearly. With no other instrument of agriculture but their axe, and a small sickle (hansid) it is astonishing to see the extent of clearing one village of B\u0101ig\u0101s makes on the sides of the hills on which their village is located.\n\n\"110. Until lately it was their habit to select the spots for their D\u0101hya with an utter disregard for all the rules of Forest conservancy. Where the trees are large and most numerous, there would the B\u0101ig\u0101 resort, and in the cold-weather months cut down sufficient wood to cover pretty closely the whole of the area he meant to bring under\nThe system of Forest conservancy introduced in 1860 has not yet had time to repair the ravages of centuries, and the northern part of the province is almost without tree-forests, except in the wild inaccessible country where the highlands merge into the valley, around and below the sources of the sacred river at Amarantak, or in the cultivation. In May and June, just before the setting in of the rains, this wood, and the brushwood in which it has fallen, is set fire to, and almost before the fire is out the Baigas may be seen raking up the ashes, and spreading them over the whole surface of their field. This is done either with a bundle of thorns, or with long bamboos, until there is a superstratum of about an inch of ashes spread over the ground. In these ashes they sow Kodo (paspalum frumentaceum), Kutki (panicum miliaceum), and occasionally a poor specimen of rice called here Baigana. From being on the side of a hill, the ashes are cut up into furrows by the action of the rains, and often much of the seed must be washed away altogether; but sufficient seems to remain for the Baiga's wants. When sown, the field is fenced round very roughly and strongly, small trees being felled so as to fall one on to the other; the interstices are filled in with bamboos, and the boughs are carefully interlaced, so that the smallest kind of deer cannot effect an entrance. In addition to this, where there is any danger of the crops being eaten up by buffaloes or bison, which push through any ordinary fence, the Baigas bury a line of broad-bladed spears, called danads, in the ground, at about the spot where these beasts would land if they jumped the fence; they then watch their opportunity, and sneaking round to the opposite side, give a series of yells, which send the cattle off terrified over or through the fence. Generally more than one is wounded, and often one killed on the spot; the rest, once started, make straight away, and never visit that field again. In the fences round these \"Bemars,\" as these patches of cultivation are called, are usually two or three cunningly-contrived traps for small deer, something on the principle of the old figure of four, and several nooses for peacocks, hares, &c. These the Baiga carefully examines every morning, and great is his delight when occasionally he finds a panther crushed under one of the figure-of-four traps.\n\n\"111. One of these \"Bemars\" lasts the Baiga at the outside three years. He usually leaves sufficient wood on the ground the first season to last for a second season's burning; the third year, if by chance he should make up his mind to stick to one field for so long, his labour is much enhanced, as he has to cut and drag the wood for some little distance and lay it over his fields; in addition to this, the outturn of the crops falls off every year; so that altogether the Baiga has every inducement to change the locale of his cultivation, and where no restriction has been put on his movements, as a rule he does so.\n\n\"112. It takes six or seven years before one of these old \"Bemars\" is sufficiently covered with wood again to make it worth the Baiga's while to cultivate it a second time; in three years it is probably densely covered with brushwood; but this, if burnt, leaves so little ash, that it has to be largely supplemented with timber; and as this has been previously cut all round the clearing, it becomes a work of supererogation to take up one of these old plots before the wood has well grown, when other and more suitable land is available.\"\ndeep valley of the Denw\u00e1, hemmed in between the S\u00e1t pur\u00e1 plateau and the precipitous masses of the Mah\u00e1deo hills. It is further south, in the hill Chiefships which border the N\u00e1gpur and Chhattisgarh plains, that the natural forests have suffered least. In these almost unexplored wilds the population is too scanty to have made any serious impression on the dense woods which surround them.\n\nPassing from the hills and forests to the lowlands again, it may be said that the western portion of the N\u00e1gpur plain has little to distinguish it in external character from the country north of the \"Gh\u00e1ts.\" There are the same low volcanic hills, and the same deep black-soil bottoms; but to the east, in the Bhand\u00e1ra and parts of the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, comes in the far more picturesque metamorphic formation. Here the soil may be lighter, but the intermixture of hill-ranges and the levels of the country lend themselves to the construction of magnificent reservoirs, which contribute as much to the beauty of the scenery as to the prosperity of the people. In this \"Lake Region\" an irrigation tank \"is not a piece of water with regular banks, crowned with rows or avenues of trees, with an artificial dyke and sluices, and with fields around it, but it is an irregular expanse of water; its banks are formed by rugged hills, covered with low forests that fringe the water where the wild beasts repair to drink; its dykes, mainly shaped out of spurs from the hills, are thrown athwart the hollows, a part only being formed by masonry; its sluices often consist of chasms or fissures in the rock; its broad surface is often, as the monsoon approaches, lashed into surging and crested waves.\"\n\nThe largest of these lakes\u2014that at Naweg\u00e1on\u2014is seventeen miles in circumference, and has a depth in places of 90 feet, the average depth being 40 feet. The whole of this vast water storage has been effected by means of two embankments 350 and 540 yards in length respectively.\n\nThe N\u00e1gpur plain is terminated on the east by a rocky barrier which divides it from the low-lying plateau known as Chhattisgarh, or the \"thirty-\n\n* Sir R. Temple's Administration Report of the Central Provinces, for 1861-62, p.6.\nsix forts.\u201d Land-locked on every side by deep forests or hill-passes, and remote from all centres, whether of eastern or more modern western civilisation, this little principality was till of comparatively late years the least known portion of the obscurest division of India. Its central portion is an open plain, now so fertile that it is known to the bands of Banj\u00e1ras, who annually come with their long train of pack cattle to carry off its surplus produce, as \u2018Khalauti,\u2019 or the \u2018Land of the Threshing-floors.\u2019* But this agricultural wealth is new. The marks of human settlement have not hitherto gone beyond the bare necessities of agricultural life, and the great central plain of Chhattisgarh is to the eye most uninviting. Nature has provided a wide extent of fertile soil, and settlers have within the last quarter of a century multiplied and prospered; but they have not yet had time, nor perhaps gained confidence, to surround themselves with the amenities of Indian life. Great consignments of grain are sent out almost annually to feed the cotton-growing population of the Wardh\u00e1 valley, and even now Chattisgarh exports wheat to the wheat country round Jabalp\u00far, and rice to the rice country lying in the lower valley of the Mah\u00e1nadi.\u2020 But the granary of other countries is as yet rich in nothing but grain. In ordinary seasons the poorest cultivator revels in food, only to feel its deprivation more keenly when rain fails and nature stints her supplies; but he is ill clothed and ill lodged; he drinks dirty water; and he has heard of and seen such terrible suffering from pestilence, that the name of cholera is enough to set the whole country in wild commotion. There are, perhaps, few who would realise in the long treeless plain, with its frequent clusters of mud huts, and borders of inhospitable ravine and jungle, the capabilities of a country which, even in its present raw stage, supports its own three millions, and in spite of difficult communications sends out of its surplus enough to feed some two hundred thousand more annually.\n\n* The original meaning of this word is somewhat uncertain. By the people of the country it is pronounced as written above. It may be derived either from Kh\u00e1l\u00fati, signifying \u2018low rice land\u2019; or from Khaldv\u00e1t\u00ed, meaning \u2018abounding in threshing-floors.\u2019\n\n\u2020 In 1868-59 the exports were, wheat to Jabalp\u00far, 211,587 maunds; rice to Mah\u00e1nadi valley, 53,504 maunds.\nCHAPTER II.\n\nGEOLOGY.\n\nDiversity of the geological character of the country\u2014General correspondence of geological and physical areas\u2014Geological groups.

Oldham, Esq., LL.D., Superintendent of the Geological Survey of India.)\n\nTo give a general description of the geological structure of the Central Provinces in any detail would involve the necessity of entering upon a discussion of the geology of India at large, as these provinces contain representatives of almost all the formations known to occur within Indian limits, although frequently these are much better seen in other districts, and ought therefore more correctly to be described in connection with the locality where the most typical sections occur. In the very brief notice which follows I am therefore compelled to presuppose a certain amount of acquaintance with Indian rocks, and the classification of them. It is also necessary to state that the few descriptions which follow have been drawn up under great pressure as to time, and while actively engaged in field work of an important and intricate nature, and away from all maps and records.\n\nThe Central Provinces, divided into nineteen districts, naturally group themselves into separate areas, corresponding to well-marked physical features. These again have in a similar way a general agreement with the geological structure. To the north the districts of S\u00e1g\u00e1r and Damoh are altogether on the Vindhy\u00e1n plateau, and a large part of their surface is formed of the deposits to which the name Vindhy\u00e1n has been given. These are, however, concealed over consider-\nable areas by the overflowing volcanic rocks of the great Deccan trap area. Physically also these districts (as is all the Vindhyan plateau) are connected with the country to the north, all the drainage of the area being into the Ganges valley. Immediately to the south of the Vindhyan escarpment, along the marked depression of the Narbada valley, lie the four districts of Jabalpur, Narsinghpur, Hoshangabad, and Nimar (taking them in order from east to west), which are in great part on alluvial and tertiary deposits, with a narrow belt of older rocks along the southern side of the valley.\n\nSouth of the Narbada valley rise the extensive highlands constituting the Satpura range, or its continuation, which are in great part formed of the Deccan traps resting upon crystalline rocks, or upon sandstone and other rocks of later date. Of this region Mandla occupies the extreme eastern end, bounded by the steep escarpment of the trappean plateau, near to the edge of which the Narbada River has its source at Markantak. Along this same range to the west lie parts of Balaghat, Seoni, Chhindwara, and Betul.\n\nSouth and south-east of the Satpura ranges lie the remaining districts. Bilaspur, Rapiur, and Sambalpur lie in the great drainage basin of the Mahanadi. The two former occupy the low plain country of Chhattisgarh, formed principally on rocks believed to belong to the Vindhyan series, with a part of their area covered by coal-bearing rocks. Sambalpur is in a rugged jungly country composed of crystalline and metamorphic rocks. The great drainage basin of the Godavari on the other hand includes Nagpur, Bhandara, Wardha, Chandala, and Sironcha. These districts have no very considerable elevation. The two first are principally on gneissose rocks, with much trap in Nagpur; Wardha is almost entirely on trap-rocks; Chandala and Sironcha have a very varied structure, including more or less of all the formations that have been named.\n\nThese formations may be noticed in ascending order. The Geological groups. Crystalline and metamorphic rocks. crystalline and metamorphic rocks have not as yet been described in any great detail. Gneiss of different varieties, often highly granitoid, predominates. The frequency with\nwhich these rocks appear shows how closely to the surface they form the substratum of the whole area. They are found at intervals all round the irregular boundary or border of the trappean rocks, rising in several places nearly to the full height of the plateau. The principal areas occupied by them are in N\u00e1gpur and Bhandara and in Bet\u00fal. Also in Sambalpur a very large area is formed of these rocks; but this is naturally connected with, and belongs to the great Gneissic area of Bengal. In obscure relation to the gneiss there occasionally appear sub-metamorphic rocks, schists, slates, and quartzites. These may be seen at many points along the borders of the Narbada valley, from the north-east of Jabalpur into Nimar.\n\nThe great Vindhyan series of strata which form so prominent and important a feature in the geology of Hindust\u00e1n are the next deposits in succession of age found in the Central Provinces. There is, however, a wide and complete separation of these from the gneissose rocks. They are universally unconformable to the latter, and they exhibit little or no mineral alteration, and only very locally any marked mechanical disturbance. The range or escarpment, from which the name of the series has been adopted, forms the northern boundary of the Narbada valley, and the districts of Sagar and Dhamoh are occupied by the upper member of the series\u2014the Bh\u00e1nver and Rew\u00e1 groups. Each of these groups consists of a strong band of sandstone resting upon shales with subordinate limestone\u2014an arrangement which, coupled with the nearly horizontal position of the beds, has, through the operation of denudation, produced the peculiar surface features of the country, namely, local plateaus bounded by precipitous scarps, overlooking broadly undulating valley-plains\u2014features even better seen in the Rew\u00e1 country. The Bijer\u00e1ghogarh pargana in the north-east corner of the Jabalpur district lies within the geological region of the Son valley, where the Lower Vindhyan rocks are so well exposed; they consist of less uniform alternations of shales, sandstones, and banded limestones, with some peculiar compact silicious (cherty and jaspery) layers, very homogeneous and regularly bedded.\nAlong the entire southern margin of the Vindhyan area these rocks both 'Upper' and 'Lower' are much crushed and contorted, but they are only locally (in the south-west) penetrated by igneous rocks, probably of the same period as those of the great basaltic area. The extensive plains of Bilaspur and R\u00e1ip\u00far are formed on rocks very similar in composition, arrangement, and external relations to those of the Lower Vindhyan formation as seen to the north, and these extend from here along the upper courses of the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed into very close proximity, if not actual continuity, with the similar deposits in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 and Sironch\u00e1 districts, and beyond the limits of the Central Provinces to the south, extend at intervals into the Madras Presidency, where they cover an immense area in the Kaddap\u00e1 and Karn\u00fal districts. Our knowledge of these detached areas is not as yet sufficient to justify an assertion that they were once continuous, although the striking identity in lithological character of the several deposits lends strong support to this view. Throughout all these widely-extended deposits there is constant physical evidence of their having been accumulated in comparatively shallow water, and so far under physical conditions favourable to life. The sandstones are false-bedded and beautifully rippled on their surfaces, each successive bed often for hundreds of feet in thickness showing its own ripple-marked surface. Nor is there anything in their mineralised condition to suggest the chance of subsequent obliteration of organic remains, had they ever been imbedded or become fossilised. Yet no success has hitherto rewarded our most careful searchings for such traces of early existences.\n\nPassing upwards in the historical succession of rocks, we find in India a wide gap in the Geological record between the Vindhyan rocks just alluded to and the next succeeding series of deposits, in which are included the coal-bearing rocks. The whole face of the country wherever these occur must have been entirely remodelled by long-continued denudation and other causes before the commencement of the deposit of this great plant-bearing series of beds. This series has attracted much attention, both from its economic importance, and from the fact that it is in all its groups more or less fossiliferous. And the proper sub-\ndivision of it as represented at distant localities has been the subject of much study. Nor has the detailed examination of the country yet been sufficiently extended to admit of a final decision of this question.\n\nThree great groups have, however, been thoroughly established\u2014the T\u00e1lchir, the Dam\u00fad\u00e1, and the Panchet rocks, and representatives of these three great groups have been found wherever the general series occurs. It is only as to the exact limits of each that any question still exists, which can only be answered after more detailed examination. This question is, however, of high practical importance, because of the three series which I have mentioned only one is proved to contain workable beds of coal. The T\u00e1lchir rocks below contain no coal, and the Panchet rocks above are equally without any coals, the whole of the workable beds of coal of this geological epoch being found confined to the Dam\u00fad\u00e1 rocks.\n\nThe largest area occupied by the rocks of this great series within the Central Provinces lies in the hilly region S\u00e1tpur\u00e1 coal-field. to the south of Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d and Narsinghp\u00far, partly within the boundaries of these districts, but principally belonging to Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1, and embracing the Pachmarhi or Mah\u00e1deo hills. At the base of the series we find the characteristic deposits of the T\u00e1lchir group\u2014greenish silt beds, breaking up into small splintery flakes and sharp fragments, and hence called 'needle shales,' and greenish brown or whitish earthy felspathic sandstones, in either of which pebbles and large boulders are often irregularly scattered. Often these are very numerous and form a distinct bed, to which, from its peculiar constitution, the name of \"Boulder\" Bed has been given. These rocks, generally speaking, are found at the edges of the field, or weathered out in the deep valleys. The thickness of this group is variable, never very great, and it is locally altogether over-lapped. In the Narb\u00e1d\u00e1 it covers by far the larger portion of the area. As noticed, no coal has ever been found in the T\u00e1lchir rocks, and very rarely any of the dark carbonaceous shales which are so frequent an accompaniment of coal, with the exception of a few thin and irregular streaks which invariably mark the transition of these T\u00e1lchir\nrocks into the Dam\u00fad\u00e1 (Bar\u00e1kar) rocks above. This Dam\u00fad\u00e1 series is chiefly made up of thick-bedded, often coarse felspathic sandstones, with subordinate beds of blue and carbonaceous shales and coal. In Bengal and towards the east this series is of great thickness, and is easily divisible into several distinct groups. But towards the west and the Central Provinces the series is of much diminished thickness, and the subdivisions so well marked in Bengal are not recognisable. The beds of coal in the same way are much fewer and less important. These variations appear to have only a local development when viewed in detail, while on a general comparison the facts would seem to be expressed by saying that the Panchet series, which immediately succeeds the coal rocks assumes towards the west a much greater thickness and importance than in the east, while the Dam\u00fad\u00e1 series has been much less developed. In the Narbada valley the latter series is represented by one group of beds only, which belong to the lowermost group recognised in Bengal (the Bar\u00e1kar), of no great thickness, and covered by an immense series of sandstones of varying age. No trace of any one of the subdivisions of this great plant-bearing series\u2014T\u00e1lchir, Dam\u00fad\u00e1, or Panchets\u2014has been found to the west of about the parallel of Oshangabad (Lokhartalai). The Dam\u00fad\u00e1 rocks cover a widespread of country round the bases of the noble Pachmarhi hills, and extend thence to Umreth and Barkot, about sixteen miles from Chhindwara. They rest in parts immediately on the gneissose rocks, and are frequently succeeded directly by the great trappean flows.\n\nIn Bilaspur (Chhattisgarh) a large area of widely undulating country along the Hasd\u00fa\u2014an affluent of the Mahanadi\u2014is also formed of these rocks, and coal has long been known to exist there in some quantity. The district has not been examined as yet, and no trustworthy information exists as to the quantity or quality of this coal.\n\nIn the Chand\u00e1 district again, and in Ber\u00e1r adjoining, similar Bardakar rocks are found resting upon the characteristic T\u00e1lchir beds, and occupying a\nvery small area in the large field of sandstones which there occur. At least one thick group of beds with coal is known in which the coal itself exhibits the same characters which distinguish the bed in the Bar\u0101kar series elsewhere\u2014that is there is rapid and considerable variation in the thickness and quantity of the coal. Beds of great thickness have, however, been met with, and there is a very large supply therefore of useful fuel.\n\nSimilar rocks extend down the valley of the God\u0101var\u012b and the God\u0101var\u012b and Pranhit\u0101 for a long distance, occurring in detached localities separated by wide ridges of the older formations. Near the mouth of the T\u00e1l River about fourteen miles above D um a g u d e m , both T\u00e1lchir and Dam\u016bd\u0101, rocks occur, the latter containing coal, which form the bed of the River God\u0101var\u012b for some distance, and have probably a considerable extension; and coal is also known to occur about thirty-four miles to the south of the same town, visible on the banks of the river.\n\nWe are not as yet able to speak so certainly of the limits and relations of the beds which occur immediately above these coal-bearing rocks, so far at least as parts of the country under notice are concerned. In the Narbad\u0101 valley coarse conglomeratic sandstones with ferruginous bands, which are believed to be the representatives of the Panchet rocks of Bengal, come in immediate succession on the Bar\u0101kar beds (Mohp\u0101ni, &c.). And similar rocks occur in the same relation in the wide flats of Chhattisgarh, and probably at the intermediate locality of the Chhindw\u0101r\u0101 fields.\n\nBut passing into the drainage basin of the God\u0101var\u012b, a series of rocks of peculiar lithological character and locally abounding in fossil plants, is met with; no exact representatives of which are as yet known elsewhere. In their general mineral aspects they come very near to the ordinary Panchet rocks of Bengal, and they appear to pass upwards into undoubted representatives of these, but the prevailing form of fern of which they contain the fossilised fronds, is one (Glossopteris browniana) which is scarcely known to extend up to the Panchet horizon. These beds would therefore seem to indicate either a commencement in the\nbasin of the God\u00e1var\u00ed of the deposition of rocks having the peculiar minera character of the Panchet beds at a much earlier period than in Bengal into which these ferns continued to exist: or the flora of the God\u00e1var\u00ed basin had not been subjected to the same influencing causes, resulting in a marked change in its character, which in Bengal led to the well-defined separation as to fossils of the Panchets and upper groups of the Dam\u00fad\u00e1 rocks (R\u00e1niganj). I am disposed to think that, viewed in a very general way, it gives the truer representation of the facts to consider these local rocks, notwithstanding their contained plants, as belonging rather to the Panchet series than to the Dam\u00fad\u00e1. And there is one very important practical reason for this also, inasmuch as no workable coal has yet been found in either of these groups, while it has invariably been seen to occur where rocks of the undoubted Dam\u00fad\u00e1 age are developed.\n\nA local name was provisionally given to these rocks by Mr. W. Blanford, who first examined them, and as this has been published (although unintentionally), it may be retained as a useful subdivision. One of the largest areas of these rocks in the N\u00e1gp\u00far country is close to the important military station of K\u00e1mth\u00ed, and from this circumstance Mr. Blanford spoke of them as the K\u00e1mth\u00ed beds. They consist, lithologically, of hard compact gritty sandstones, fine variegated sandstones, coarse loose-textured sandstone, very fine-grained deep and bright red and buff argillaceous or argillaceo-silicious sandstones, and bands of hard very ferruginous pebbly grits.\n\nThese rocks cover an area of about twenty-five miles long from north-west to south-east near K\u00e1mth\u00ed (K\u00e1mth\u00ed to K\u00e9lod), and at the broadest parts (near P\u00e1tans\u00e1ong\u00ed) about eight miles wide. Over a large portion of this area the rocks are concealed by thick alluvial deposits, but they are well seen at K\u00e1mth\u00ed, Silew\u00e1r\u00e1, Bhokar\u00e1, and south and south-east of P\u00e1tans\u00e1ong\u00ed, &c. A small area of the much older T\u00e1lchir rocks is seen north-east of Bhokar\u00e1, and a small hill north-east of P\u00e1tans\u00e1ong\u00ed. Two other localities where these rocks are seen have been exposed within the area of the trap-rocks, these having been removed by denudation.\nOne\u2014the larger of the two\u2014is close to Beh\u00e1r and B\u00e1z\u00e1rg\u00e1on, about fifteen miles from N\u00e1gp\u00far on the road to Amr\u00e1ot\u00ed. The rocks here are of the same type, but become more conglomeratic towards the top than is seen near N\u00e1gp\u00far. The other inlier of these rocks is about thirty-six miles north-west of N\u00e1gp\u00far, near the village of Chorkher\u00ed. The rocks extend over an area of only about six and a half square miles in all. There is also another very small patch not a mile long near Kh\u00fatkher\u00ed, about one mile south-east of the other.\n\nPassing further southward similar rocks are more widely developed in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, and cover a large area, concealing the underlying Bar\u00e1kar beds; there the rocks are as a whole less fine-grained than in the neighbourhood of N\u00e1gp\u00far, and the tendency to become more conglomeratic in the upper beds of the group is still more markedly exhibited than in the case already noticed. In this field also they appear to be closely connected with, and to pass up into a great thickness of bright red clays with thin-bedded sandstones, which belong undoubtedly to the Panchet series\u2014well seen in the Wardh\u00e1 about Pors\u00e1 and in the country round, giving additional evidence of the connection of the two groups. These rocks\u2014the K\u00e1mth\u00ed beds\u2014yield in many of their beds admirable building stones, while others of a coarser texture are used as millstones or querns. Quarries exist at K\u00e1mth\u00ed, Silew\u00e1r\u00e1, Bhokar\u00e1, &c., also in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, but owing to the comparative poverty and sparseness of the population, they are here less worked than in the N\u00e1gp\u00far country. The white argillaceous band which is used near Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 town, and which can be traced for miles along the country, is very even in texture, and can be carved into very minute forms of ornaments (a kind of work which is very skilfully done at Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1), but it is rather soft. The beds, excepting the hard ferruginous pebbly grits, are not generally speaking very compact, and the surface of the ground becomes covered with loose sand resulting from their disintegration. The soil on these, except where they are covered by the alluvial deposits, is poor and little cultivated, almost the whole of this tract being covered with jungle.\n\nThe fossils found in these K\u00e1mth\u00ed beds have been noticed above. The fine sandstones of K\u00e1mth\u00ed, Silew\u00e1r\u00e1, &c. have\nyielded very beautiful and numerous specimens of the large *Glossopteris Browniana*\u2014a fossil-fern common in the coal-bearing rocks of Bengal and also in those of Australia. Similar fronds are found, but more rarely, in the finer beds of the vicinity of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1.\n\nWe have noticed these so-called *K\u00e1mthi* beds a little more in detail than their relative importance or a general sketch would justify, because of their local development, and of the interesting fossils which they contain.\n\nIn ascending order the next important series of rocks is that to which the name of *Panchet* has been given. This, which is a very extensive formation in Bengal and in the country intervening between that and Jabalp\u00far, is not so largely developed in the Central Provinces. Indeed there is still much doubt as to the true limits and true parallel of many of the rocks which would probably at first be classed under this group. There is another peculiar feature: in the Bengal coal-fields, the so-called *Lower Panchet* group, consisting principally of red clays, with fine-grained, thin-bedded, often calcareous sandstones, both of red and greenish white colours, forms a set of beds of very considerable thickness and wide extent. But on passing to the west this group rapidly disappears and soon seems to be entirely wanting, while the *Upper Panchet* group, consisting chiefly of coarse red conglomerates, &c., with numerous ferruginous bands, becomes more largely developed, and constitutes almost the whole of the group. Still further to the west however, as in the Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 fields near Umreth, these red clays and thin-bedded fine-grained sandstones recur with a considerable development. And similar beds cover a large area on the south of the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 coal-field (Pors\u00e1 and all the country around), and also appear in other minor patches throughout the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 field and in Ber\u00e1r. These pass upwards into coarser beds, pebbly and conglomeratic, and it is not an easy task to make out the exact relation of these to the adjoining rocks in a country so very much covered as is the greater part of the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district. Similar rocks are seen again further south (Maledi), and here as at Mangl\u00ed to the north of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 have\nyielded organic remains, which establish with tolerable accuracy their true position in the general European scale of geological formations. Several forms of *Labyrinthodont* reptiles from the Lower Panchet rocks of Bengal, remains of the very remarkable genus *Dicynodon*, previously only known from South Africa, and abundance of *Estheriae* (small bivalved crustaceans) mark the fauna of the time in Eastern India. In the Central Provinces similar *Estheriae* and a remarkable reptile (*Brachyops laticeps*) have been obtained from Mangli thirty miles north of Chand\u00e1, while the red clays of Maledi afford numerous remains of the very curious and interesting *Hyperodapedon*, *Belodon*, and some *Labyrinthodont* fragments also. There is a high probability that the rocks at these different localities are all truly on or about the same geological horizon (a fact which can only be satisfactorily established by detailed and careful observation), and that that horizon represents in Indian geological homotaxis the period of the Trias of Europe.\n\nIn the vicinity of Jabalp\u00far and stretching down the valley of the Narbad\u00e1 to the Sh\u00e9r River, and a little beyond, and forming also a narrow outcrop fringing the general line of the trappean boundary to the east and north of Jabalp\u00far, a distinct group of rocks was recognised by Mr. J. G. Medlicott in 1856-57. This limited group of beds is partially coal-bearing, and from this fact and from certain other obscure relations, it was at first designated under the inappropriate name of Upper Dam\u00fad\u00e1, with which series it was, pending further inquiry, supposed to be connected, while the fossil plants which it imbedded were closely allied to those occurring in the Jurassic beds of R\u00e1jmah\u00e1l and Cutch. Subsequent inquiry showed that there was really no ground for supposing any connection of these beds with the true Dam\u00fad\u00e1 as parts of one formation, and the name Jabalp\u00far group was substituted for Upper Dam\u00fad\u00e1.\n\nAt about 100 miles to the north-east of the Narbad\u00e1 coal basin the boundary of the plateau of trap-rocks recedes south-eastwards, and the narrow outcrop of these Jabalp\u00far beds expands here into the open ground of South Rew\u00e1; there the Jabalp\u00far shales and silt beds were found passing upwards into massive sandstones (at\nBandogarh) so generally identical with the rocks of the great Mah\u00e1deo hills, that they were at once accepted as their representatives; while below the Jabalp\u00far shales overlaid strong pebbly sandstones and conglomerates, which again in the southern part of the same area rested upon a coal-bearing group, recognisable at once by its contained fossils and general character as representatives of the Dam\u00fad\u00e1 series. The Jabalp\u00far beds have not as yet been traced with any care in other districts, and I am unable to state their true limits. Their contained fossils point distinctly to a Jurassic age and to the lower part of that great period. In the Narbada nothing but plant-remains have been found. We may however, although the connection has not been traced, point to the remarkable beds near Kot\u00e1\u2014about five miles from Sironch\u00e1\u2014which have yielded several well-marked fish-remains (Lepidotus Deccanensis, \u00c6chmodus, &c.) considered as Liassic in their relations, as a probable representative to the south of the Jabulp\u00far beds to the north. There are also some detached patches of rock which occur in the intermediate country which may be representatives of the same general age. The coal found in these Jabalp\u00far beds is very irregularly developed (Sher River; Lamet\u00e1gh\u00e1t). It is jetty, and has much of the character of a true lignite; indeed in many specimens the structure of the now-carbonised stems, of which a large portion of it is made, is well preserved. It has been economised recently to a considerable extent by the contractors on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway. But neither in amount nor in quality does it constitute a source of fossil fuel of any importance in a general view. I mentioned above, that immediately resting on the Jabulp\u00far beds, where the succession is best seen (South Rew\u00e1), came the massive sandstones of Bandogarh, which were accepted as representatives of the great Mah\u00e1deo group, so well seen in the upper and magnificent scarps of the Pachmarhi hills (Central Provinces).\n\nThis Mah\u00e1deo group was first established after a brief examination of these hills in 1856-57, and was shown to contain a vast thickness of massive sandstones, with many ferruginous bands which appeared to\nbe entirely unconformable on the *Dam\u00fad\u00e1* beds forming the lower ground adjoining. Unfortunately the same name was applied to rocks in other places which showed an approximation to the same general character, and which appeared to stand in the same general relation of an entirely unconformable series above the *Dam\u00fad\u00e1* rocks. It was from the first indicated that these *Mah\u00e1deo* rocks would require further examination. The progress of geological investigation in India has since shown the necessity also of greater subdivision than was at first apparent. These *Mah\u00e1deo* rocks, with the exception of a few badly-preserved and generally large stems, are so far as known unfossiliferous, and have therefore not attracted quite as much attention as some of the other series I have noticed. This absence of fossils also, and the detached, or comparatively detached, positions in which the *Mah\u00e1deo* rocks occur, have rendered the question of their geological age more difficult than it would have otherwise been.*\n\nMr. W. Blanford, carrying up his examination of the country from the west, gave some good reasons for supposing that the *Mah\u00e1deo* beds were the continuation and expansion of the cretaceous sandstones found near B\u00e1gh in the western Narb\u00e1d\u00e1. A similar general conclusion had been suggested by Mr. Hislop previously, but without much proof. On the other hand it is right to state that Mr. Medlicott, working up from the east, saw reason for supposing that the *Mah\u00e1deo* beds in the Narb\u00e1d\u00e1 districts, which he presumed to be truly representative of the Bandog\u00e1rh rocks in South Rew\u00e1 (and as a subordinate member of which he considered the Jabalp\u00far beds), were at the same time only an upward extension of the same uninterrupted succession of deposits, which elsewhere had been justly believed to belong to the *Panchet* series.\n\nIt will be seen from this that the true position of these beds has not as yet been fixed. When first examined it was by me supposed that they, including the *Lam\u00e9t\u00e1* group (to which we shall presently refer), represented the lowest portion of the Tertiary period.\n\n* The statement originally made that a very perfect specimen of a true *Archegosaurus* found under the Pachmarhi hills had been obtained from these rocks, was at once refuted by the mineral character of the rock in which it was imbedded. It was from the *Dam\u00fad\u00e1* beds below.\nThe Rev Mr. Hislop, whose untiring exertions have done so much to elucidate the palaeontological history of the Central Provinces, was disposed to view them as below all the Tertiary deposits, and as representing in India the upper portion of the cretaceous epoch of Europe\u2014a view strongly confirmed by Mr. Blanford, who was disposed to put them only a little lower in the series, while Mr. Medlicott would now make them much more ancient, and would place them in the same subdivision as the Jabalpur beds, which latter are probably on the horizon of the Kot\u00e1 beds\u2014that is he would consider them Lower Jurassic.* As stated, the question cannot at present (January 1870) be definitely settled.\n\nWhen first examining the Narbad\u00e1 valley Mr. J. G. Medlicott distinguished in the country fringing the river to the south, and between the Mah\u00e1deo hills and Jabalp\u00far, a series of well-marked beds, which he was then disposed to consider as the uppermost group of the Mah\u00e1deo formation, and to which he applied the local name of Lamet\u00e1. These Lamet\u00e1 beds consisted chiefly of whitish earthy and silicious (cherty) limestones or calcareous muds, often a good deal indurated. These sandy calcareous beds formed only a thin band immediately underlying the trappean rocks. Further and subsequent examination, extending more to the east proved that this band was entirely independent of the rocks below it, with which it was associated, inasmuch as, following the trappean boundary to the south-eastwards, the Lamet\u00e1 group was found to accompany the trap-rock steadily and to rest indiscriminately upon all rocks, from the gneiss up. It was therefore clear that it must be viewed as entirely separate from the great Mah\u00e1deo series, and as intimately connected with the overlying trappean rocks. As noticed above, these Lamet\u00e1 beds consist chiefly of cherty and gritty limestones, with subordinate beds of a nodular limestone, loose greenish sandstone, and purplish or greenish argillaceous beds either sandy or marly. They have been traced considerably south of N\u00e1gpur, and thence at intervals round\n\n* The R\u00e1j mah\u00e1l group of Bengal would in this view be of course younger than the Mah\u00e1deo of the Central Provinces.\nby the trappean boundary to Jabalpur, and down the Narbad\u00e1 valley to near Hoshangabad. If Mr. Blanford's views be supported by further examination, the limit must be carried very considerably to the west to Pun\u00e1s\u00e1 and the Dh\u00e1r forest. In all cases, too, the trap-rocks, where any section is seen, appear to rest quite conformably or continuously on these Lamet\u00e1 beds, and beds which cannot be distinguished from them mineralogically are frequently met with interstratified with the traps (as near Nagpur and between Nagpur and Jabalpur).\n\nThese remarkable sedimentary beds intercalated with the traps of the Deccan and M\u00e1lw\u00e1 areas have received much attention. They constitute the Intertrappean series of Hislop, and are interesting from their fossil contents, as well as their mineral character and peculiar stratigraphical position. It would be out of place here to enter into any discussion of the various explanations which have been given of these. It must suffice to say that both in their lithological character [calcareous muds]; in their distribution [local and irregular lenticular masses, not extending laterally to any great distance]; in the fossils contained [fresh-water and lacustrine shells, fragments of plants, &c.], and in their occurrence invariably between the successive flows of trappean rock, the upper surface in all cases being the only one really indurated or altered by the contact of the igneous, heated mass, they indubitably point to their origin in the small and irregular deposits in lakes or pools of varying size, tranquilly thrown down during the intervals of the successive flows of the lava, which now forms the great covering of this immense volcanic region. And I believe that the true explanation of the Lamet\u00e1 beds of which I have just been speaking, is that they were deposited in a similar way in more widely-extended lacustrine areas, previously to the commencement of the great outbreaks of lava. It need not detain us here to indicate the apparently long interval of time which elapsed during the outflowing of these successive lava streams, nor to point out how entirely different in age the intertrappean beds of the upper part of the series (Bombay, &c.) may be from those which accompany the lower and\nolder flows. None of these very much newer beds occur within the limits of the Central Provinces.\n\nThe geological epoch of these intertrappean beds seems to be tolerably well established as belonging to the Eocene period of European geologists; it being just possible that the lower beds of the Lam\u00e9t\u00e1 group may represent a part of the upper cretaceous time. The evidence against this supposition of Mr. W. Blanford seems, however, decidedly stronger than that in its favour.\n\nThe wondrous features of the great trappean country of the Deccan, which extend over so large a portion of the surface of the Central Provinces, have been well described by many observers. The immense area covered continuously by these volcanic rocks; the enormous accumulation of horizontal, or nearly horizontal, layers of basaltic rocks; the distinct separation into beds, or stratification; the peculiar physical features,\u2014massive flat-topped hills with sharp precipitous scarps; the abundance of beautiful zeolites and other minerals, and the occurrence of those curious intercalated beds, containing freshwater fossils, which I have just mentioned, could scarcely escape the notice of any observer. I have already briefly alluded to the general distribution of these rocks, so far as the Central Provinces are concerned, and shall not therefore delay further than to refer to the labours of Malcolmson, Newbold, Grant, Carter, Hislop, Medlicott, Blanford, &c., for more detailed discussions of this extraordinary series, which extends, or has extended, certainly over an area of 10 degrees of latitude by 15 to 16 of longitude. \"The area covered by them in the Peninsula of India can be little less than two hundred thousand square miles.\" Their limited extent within the boundaries of the Central Provinces is therefore but a very small fraction of their entire area.\n\nOf deposits later than the trappean rocks there is a great variety and an immense area. These would include all the soils of the present surface with their numerous modifications and varying agricultural value.\nLaterite occurs in detached areas in S\u00e1g\u00e1r and adjoining districts; it covers a considerable space in the north-east of Jabalp\u00far district, and is found at intervals passing to the south in Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1, where it covers extensive areas in the eastern and north-eastern portions. It presents all the usual characters of this deposit, but nowhere within the Central Provinces attains that great thickness and massiveness which admit of its being freely used for building purposes.\n\nThe older gravels and clays of some of the river valleys would appear to be next in succession. These Tertiary conglomerates have been the object of more careful study, on account of the numerous remains of large animals, as well as ordinary shells which some of the beds contain locally in large number. The largest continuous area of these ossiferous gravels and clays is found in the Narbad\u00e1 valley, along which they extend in unbroken continuity for more than a hundred miles from the falls of the marble rocks near Jabalp\u00far to below Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d. They also occur in the banks of the river both above and below these limits. Very similar deposits are found forming the banks and often the beds of the upper feeders of the God\u00e1var\u00ed\u2014the Wardh\u00e1, P\u00e1ingang\u00e1, &c.\u2014and in the God\u00e1var\u00ed itself; and here also they locally contain a large number of bones, sub-fossilised, the remains of animals which existed at the period of their deposition. The valleys of these streams are, however, by no means so well defined as that of the Narbad\u00e1, and the limits of the ossiferous gravels and clays are not easily fixed. The gravels are for the most part cemented into a conglomerate of tolerable hardness by the infiltration of carbonate of lime, and these beds might not unfrequently be mistaken for conglomerates of greatly older date on a cursory examination. There is, however, one fact which enables them to be readily distinguished, and that is the abundant presence in them of rolled pieces of the trappean rocks\u2014of numerous agates, pieces of bloodstone, &c., which at once prove them to have been post-trappean in their origin. The immense variety and abundance of these pebbles also abundantly indicate the vast denudation to which the trappean rocks have been subjected since their outflowing and deposition.\nIn general character these deposits in their lower portions consist of gravels and sands, frequently, as mentioned, cemented together much in the same way as a concrete is, and sometimes so hard as to be quarried for building. Towards the base the clays become sandy and pebbly. Sandy beds occur even in the clays and irregular deposition and oblique lamination (false-bedding) are frequent\u2014indeed so frequent as to be almost the normal condition. It is not easy to arrive at any just conclusion as to the thickness of these deposits. Actual sections of more than fifty feet in thickness are occasionally met with, but twenty to thirty feet are the more ordinary limits. The greater portion of the deposits is generally clay, the coarser beds being chiefly confined to the portion near the base. Fossil bones are not generally abundant, but locally considerable numbers have been met with. Shells are not uncommon, and they appear to be all of species now existing in the rivers. These beds are obviously of fresh-water origin, and were in all probability the fluvio-lacustrine deposits of the rivers themselves, at a time when the levels and areas of their valleys were very different from those now existing.\n\nIt is not intended to give here a complete list of the organic remains found, which would belong rather to a detailed description. But the very remarkable admixture of existing and extinct forms which these deposits exhibit must be noticed; for along with well-preserved remains of *Hippopotamus*, *Rhinoceros*, *Mastodon*, peculiar forms of *Elephas*, and very remarkable Bovines (which if not identical with European forms, approximate so closely that nothing but the most minute distinctions can be made, while they are entirely distinct from any present Indian forms), are found equally well preserved remains of animals still existing in the country. The not uncommon tortoise (*Emys [Pangshura] tecta*) is found quite as fossilised in these beds as any of the other remains, and yet the species still lives in the valley itself. The imbedded shells, too, are all of species still living, and the evidence is conclusive that the change from the condition under which *Hippopotami* wallowed in the muds, and *Rhinoceros* roamed in the swampy forests of the country, where *Mastodons* abounded, and where the strange forms of the *Sivatherium*, *Dinothereium*, *Camelo-*\npardalis existed, has been one of continuous and gradual alteration, unmarked by any great breaks or vast changes in climate. In the general series of successive epochs into which the geological periods distinguished in Europe have been classified, these ossiferous gravels and clays would seem to mark the upper portion of the Miocene and the Pliocene; while, with unbroken succession, and with nothing more than local change or break, these Pliocene beds pass upwards into the deposits now being formed. We thus find that numerous forms of animals, which are now contemporaries of man, existed at this very early period contemporary with numerous forms of the larger animals now utterly extinct in this country. Was not man also contemporary with these now extinct animals? As I have endeavoured to show briefly, there is no physical break in the long series that would account for the destruction of these species; there is not a shadow of proof that the country was not then, as now, fitted for the abode of man. And although no human remains have yet been found, there is not a single fact which would lead to the conviction that man could not have existed and lived under the conditions which then prevailed. In this point of view, the discovery\u2014although not in the Central Provinces\u2014of a well-formed agate knife, which had obviously been in use, and which was undoubtedly shaped and made with an intelligent purpose, in gravels of the same age as these ossiferous gravels of which we have been speaking, and also containing remains of large animals, becomes one of the highest interest, as giving some amount of positive proof of the existence of man at this early period (Pliocene).\n\nOf a later date, and scattered through the upper soils of large areas, flint (or rather agate) knives, agate cores, from which these knives have been chipped off, and numerous forms of artificially-shaped agate implements, have been met with in the Narbad\u00e1 and Nagpur country. And of a later date still, and invariably in the surface-soils, or taken out of these soils and brought together under trees, or at the rude shrines of the forest races, a large number of well-shaped and polished celts, axes, and other shaped stone implements have been found in\nthe Central Provinces. The most remarkable fact perhaps connected with these implements is the identity of form and of design which they exhibit when compared with those found abundantly in Northern Europe\u2014an identity common to both forms of these stone antiquities, the rudely-chipped and almost undressed, or as they have been called the Pal\u00e6olithic, and the more finished and polished, or Neolithic, types.\n\nThe Central Provinces present many localities peculiarly likely to throw light, if carefully studied, on this intensely interesting question\u2014the antiquity of man. But such inquiries can only be satisfactorily carried out by those who are long resident in the immediate vicinity, and can therefore watch the constant changes which occur, and take immediate advantage of any opportunity which may present itself.\n\nBeneath the recent conglomerates and ossiferous gravels of a large portion of western Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 is a well-marked deposit of brownish-yellow sand or clayey sandstone. This is seen over many miles of the country wherever the streams cut through the upper beds to any depth. It is not at all improbable that it may prove to be of different geological age, and quite distinct from the beds resting on it. No good sections have yet been seen. It is specially noticed here inasmuch as it contains a certain amount of salt, which is thrown out as an efflorescence where this loose sandstone is exposed to the weather, and produces miry places always wet and soft, and often difficult to cross. In connection with this deposit we may recall the occurrence of beds very low down in the alluvium, or below it, all containing a considerable quantity of common salt, in the Ber\u00e1r alluvial plain not far to the west of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1. Into this salt-bearing stratum wells are sunk for the extraction of brine, from which much salt is obtained. I am not aware of any brine-wells in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, but this deposit contains a considerable amount of common salt, although much mixed with impurities, chiefly sulphate of magnesia (Epsom salts).*\n\n* Two specimens of salt roughly prepared from this sandy clay by lixiviation and evaporation were assayed at the Geological Survey Office, and yielded\u2014\n\n| Substance          | Percentage |\n|--------------------|------------|\n| Chloride of sodium | 82\u00b789      |\n| Sulphate of magnesia | 16\u00b702     |\n| Clay and organic matter | 1\u00b760    |\n\nThe first of these was obtained from what is called the white chopan soil; the second was from the dark chopan soil.\n\n6 cpg\nIt is not impossible that the presence of common salt in sensible quantities may indicate that the clays containing it have had a marine origin, and are thus quite distinct from the beds which rest upon them.\n\nTo treat of the more recent alluvial deposits of the country would involve rather more of agricultural than geological questions, and I would leave such to others more competent to enter upon them.\n\nThe black soil or regar, or as it is not uncommonly called the 'cotton soil,' forms one of the most marked varieties in these Provinces. It is the common soil of the Deccan, M\u00e1lw\u00e1, Narbad\u00e1 valley, &c. It varies greatly in colour, in consistence, and, with these, in fertility, but throughout is marked by the constant character of being a highly argillaceous, somewhat calcareous clay, being very adhesive when wetted, and from its very absorbent nature expanding and contracting to a very remarkable extent, under the successive influence of moisture and dryness. It therefore becomes fissured in every direction by huge cracks in the hot weather. It also retains a good deal of moisture, and requires therefore less irrigation than more sandy ground. The colour of this soil, often a deep and well-marked black, with every variation from this to a brownish-black, would appear to be solely due to an admixture of vegetable (organic) matter in a soil originally very clayey. Thus deposits of precisely the same character as this regar are being formed now at the bottom of every jhil in the country, and throughout the very area where the regar is best marked, it is not by any means an uncommon thing to find the slopes of the small hills or undulations formed of more sandy reddish soil, while the hollows below consist solely of the finest regar. This appears to be due to the more argillaceous and finer portions of the decomposed rocks below being washed away by ordinary pluvial action from the slopes and accumulated in the hollows, where this finer mud forms a soil much more retentive of moisture, and which therefore rapidly becomes more impregnated with organic matter, and is often marshy. Regar can thus be formed, wherever a truly argillaceous soil is formed: and its general,\nbut by no means universal, absence over the metamorphic and other rocks is easily accounted for by the fact that these rocks for the most part yield sandy, not clayey soils. It is never of any very great depth, and, excepting when re-arranged by rivers in their recent deposits, it is therefore never met with at any great distance below the surface.\n\nObviously formed from the re-arranged wash of the older and more widely-extended soils we find large areas of very fertile soil, consisting of clays rather more sandy than the older alluvium, and not therefore so black or adhesive. Though rarely formed altogether of the true regar soil, it frequently contains a large proportion of this, mixed with other clays and sands. Every intermediate form of soil occurs, and it would by no means be an easy task to distinguish them all. In an agricultural point of view, it is interesting to see how exactly the limits of certain kinds of cultivation coincide with the limits of these marked varieties of the alluvial deposits of the country\u2014facts which the local officers will doubtless be able to illustrate more fully than I can.\n\nThe preceding sketch has necessarily been of the briefest and most general character. Those who desire to study the geology of the Central Provinces in greater detail may refer to the many papers more or less immediately bearing on this country\u2014of Malcolmson, (Transactions Geol. Soc. Lond.) ; Hislop (Journal of Asiatic Society, Bengal; Journal of Bombay Branch Royal Asiatic Society; Quarterly Journal Geological Society, London); Medlicott, Oldham, Blanford, Theobald (Mem. Geological Survey of India; Records Geological Survey of India), in which full details will be found so far as the country has yet been examined carefully.\n\nI shall also leave the discussion of the economic value of the several rocks to the detailed statements of the local officers, who have infinitely better opportunity of knowing how and to what extent such materials are economised within their own districts. I have solely attempted to give as briefly as possible a general connected outline of the successive formations known to occur within the limits of the Central Provinces, trusting that this outline may be filled in with greater detail by future researches.\nCHAPTER III.\n\nEARLY HISTORY.\n\nIsolation of Gondw\u00e1na\u2014Rise of the Gond power\u2014Early Aryan settlers\u2014Legendary Kshattriyas\u2014R\u00e1jput traditions\u2014The Jabalpur and Chedi dynasty\u2014The Pram\u00e1ra Viceroys of N\u00e1gpur\u2014Yavana dynasty of the Central plateau.\n\nEnough perhaps has already been said to show why Gondw\u00e1na so long stood isolated from the current of Indian history. While equally to the north and to the south of it lay wide plains, over which invading armies, marching unchecked by natural obstacles, found rich cities to plunder and fertile lands to annex, these highlands were occupied by a race whose object was protection rather than production, and by whom the natural ramparts of their adopted country were more prized than its corn-bearing valleys. The expeditions organised for the invasion of the Deccan ordinarily left the forests of Gondw\u00e1na to the east, and traversed the Narbad\u00e1 valley through the pass commanded by the famous hill-fort of \u00c1s\u00edrgarh in Nim\u00e1r. Hence while armies were marching and countermarching, and the Hind\u00fa dynasties of the Deccan were succumbing to northern invaders, the Gond people was gradually and quietly attaining a development and organisation which gave it a place among the independent powers of India. Even the far-reaching power of Akbar and the fanatic zeal of Aurangzeb made themselves but faintly felt at so great a distance from the seat of empire, and it was not until one of the most powerful of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 dynasties enthroned itself at N\u00e1gpur in A.D. 1743 that the history of Gondw\u00e1na merges into that of the rest of India.\nThe Gonds, however, had their annalists, from whose lists, confirmed by contemporary evidence, it seems pretty certain that the aboriginal power had no range or importance until the sixteenth century, though it rose some hundred years earlier. Thus the known Gond principalities only occupy some two centuries of the history of Gondw\u00e1na\u2014a mere fraction of the ages which have elapsed since R\u00e1ma traversed the forest of Dandaka, extending from the Jamn\u00e1 to the God\u00e1var\u00ed, on his way to the hermitage of Sut\u00edkshna at R\u00e1mtek near N\u00e1gp\u00far.* Then the Aryan invaders were represented throughout these Central Forests by a few isolated hermits, who could not even perform their simple devotions in freedom from the mockery of the mischievous savages among whom they dwelt. The picture of their sufferings, given in the R\u00e1m\u00e1yana, would be almost pathetic if it were not ludicrous. \"These shapeless and ill-looking monsters testify their abominable character by various cruel and terrific displays. These base-born wretches implicate the hermits in impure practices, and perpetrate the greatest outrages. Changing their shapes and hiding in the thickets adjoining the hermitages, these frightful beings delight in terrifying the devotees. They cast away the sacrificial ladles and vessels, they pollute the cooked oblations, and utterly defile the offerings with blood. These faithless creatures inject frightful sounds into the ears of the faithful and austere eremites. At the time of sacrifice they snatch away the jars, the flowers, the fuel, and the sacred grass of these sober-minded men.\" \u2020\n\nWhen the tale is again taken up by the sacred books of the Hind\u00fas, the Narbad\u00e1 valley had become a settled country, governed from\n\n* Wheeler's History of India, vol ii. pp. 240, 248.\n\n\u2020 R\u00e1m\u00e1yana III. 1, 15, as translated in Muir's Sanscrit Texts, part ii. chap. iii. sec. iv. p. 427. (Edn. 1860).\nM\u00e1hishmat\u00ed* (now Maheswar) by the Haihayas\u2014one of the most distinguished of the lunar R\u00e1jput races, who, as will be seen below, retained a connection with Gondw\u00e1na until the last century. The story of Arjuna with his thousand arms, and the destruction of the Kshattriyas by Parasur\u00e1ma, are too well known to need repetition here. To connect these shadowy sacred legends with the comparatively sober prose of Gond annals there are but a few ruined cities, some popular traditions, and an occasional inscription on brass or stone. In these unoccupied ages of an unknown country the R\u00e1jput bards let their imagination run riot. The line of the\n\nR\u00e1jput traditions.\n\nNarbad\u00e1 is not only claimed for the Haihayas, but for the Pram\u00e1r\u00e1s\u2020 (or Ponw\u00e1rs), whose first capital is stated to have been Maheswar; and lastly for the Chauh\u00e1ns, from whose \"seat of government Makawat\u00ed (the present Mandla) the oath of allegiance resounded 'in fifty-two castles';\u2021 while the famous fortress of Asirgarh appears to have been appropriated by almost every dynasty whose fame entitled them to carry back their pedigrees into the days of fable. There seems to be nothing to confirm the boasts of the Chauh\u00e1ns, except their own family traditions; but the Pram\u00e1ra kingdom of M\u00e1lw\u00e1 is matter of history, and their power probably extended over the western part of the Narbad\u00e1 valley at some time between the eleventh and thirteenth centuries.\n\nThe Haihayas were undoubtedly far more ancient. An inscription in copper found near Mandla, but lost in the pillage of the Gond R\u00e1j\u00e1's palace by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s in 1780, is said to have proved their dominion over the Upper Narbad\u00e1 valley up to A.D. 144.\u00a7 and a R\u00e1j\u00e1 of their line is mentioned in an inscription on a temple in Chhatt\u00edsgarh, dated Samvat 160, corresponding\n\n---\n\n* Hall's Edition of Wilson's Vishnu Pur\u00e1na, vol. iv. book iv. chap. xi. p. 56.\n\u2020 Tod's Rajasth\u00e1n, vol. i. p. 91.

But it is only quite lately that further indications of their presence in the Narbada country have been brought to light. So far back as 1839 an inscription found at Kumbhi, thirty-five miles north-east of Jabalpur, was published with a translation in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal,+ but there were then no existing data with which to connect it, and it was dismissed with the remark that it gave no important information. Subsequently (in 1857) two inscriptions\u2020 relating to the same dynasty were found by Professor Fitz-Edward Hall at Bheraghat and Tewar, both places a few miles west of Jabalpur. Again in 1861 Professor Hall sent to the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal\u00a7 another inscription relating to the same line, or rather to a branch of it descending from Kokalla, the second king, and connected by marriage with the Yadava kings of the West,|| and in 1862\u00b6 he contributed a revised edition of the Kumbhi inscription. Since then two inscriptions in the Nagpur Museum have been examined, one of which, being almost illegible, has only served to confirm a date, but the other, which is on copper, and very well preserved, identifies the dynasty unmistakeably with Jabalpur,\n\n* It is of course very possible that the era may be neither the Vikramaditya nor the Saka, but a mere local one. The inscription is at Chapr\u00e1 in the Kawardha State. I have not yet been able to obtain a perfectly accurate transcript, but the gist of it is that a Raj\u00e1, Bhaw\u00e1n\u00ed P\u00e1l, built a temple to \u015aiva, which was partially destroyed by the Haihaya king. This would seem to bring back the inscription to the days in which Buddhism was contending with Brahmanism, and we have independent grounds for inferring that the Haihaya kings of Chhattisgarh were at that time Buddhists.\n\n\u2020 Vol. viii. p. 401 (June 1839).\n\n\u2021 Journal of the American Oriental Society, vol. vi. p. 499.\n\n\u00a7 Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, vol. xxx.

Professor Hall calculates from the known dates of the Pram\u00e1ra kings that Alhana Devi, the wife of Gayakarna Deva, may have been born about A.D. 1100, whereas according to the dates given for her sons and grandsons, her birth might have taken place as early as 850 of their era. Therefore the Vallabhi era, assuming it to be rightly counted from A.D. 319, is evidently not that to which the later dates refer, and even for them it will be necessary to suppose the existence of some local or unknown era. The second date assigned to Karna Deva does not correspond either with any known era or with those given for his descendants, but with regard to the first it is not difficult to\nSo far nothing can be gathered with certainty but that a line of Haihayaprinces ruled in or near Jabalp\u00far from the beginning of the eleventh century until the close of the twelfth, and that they were sufficiently influential to ally themselves matrimonially with such powerful families as the Ponw\u00e1rs of M\u00e1lw\u00e1, the Gahlots of Udep\u00far, and the Y\u00e1davas of the west. The name of their kingdom is shown by Professor Hall to have been Chedi,* and this establishes a curious connection between them and their clansmen, the Haihai-Bans\u00ed rulers of Chattisgarh, who are also called rulers of Chedi in one of the Ratanp\u00far inscriptions;\u2020 but this will more properly be noticed below, in discussing the history of the kingdom of Chattisgarh.\n\nWhile they held the Jabalp\u00far province, the present N\u00e1gp\u00far province seems to have been under the dominion of the Pram\u00e1ras of Dh\u00e1r, or possibly of a younger branch of that powerful family, which had established itself in the plains south of the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1 plateau. The first local mention of the Pram\u00e1ras of M\u00e1lw\u00e1 is in an inscription from N\u00e1gp\u00far, which is translated in the Journal of the Bombay Asiatic Society, No. VI. (October 1843), p. 259. Subsequently a copper-plate inscription was found at\n\nexplain why he should have adopted an epoch of his own. From all the genealogies it seems clear that he was the most powerful and renowned of the Kalachuri line, as it is called in the Kumbh\u00ed inscription. The discovery of a tablet in his honour at Benares need not signify more than that he had endowed a temple there, and in the N\u00e1gp\u00far Museum plate the holy city is only noticed as a place where \"his praises are sung,\" while the countries which he subdued, or pretended to have subdued, are mentioned in a very different strain. Most of these high-flown boasts are mere pieces of grandiloquence; but there is a curious mention in the N\u00e1gp\u00far plate of his victory over Bhimesvara, king of A'ndhra, \"at which the God\u00e1var\u00ed, overjoyed, broke into seven channels.\" The reigning prince of the K\u00e1kataya line of A'ndhra, contemporary with Karna Deva, must have been either Rudra Deva, or Ganapati Deva, so that further information is needed to clear up what may be an interesting point.\u00b9\n\n* Journal of the American Oriental Society, vol. vi. pp. 499 ff.

As this prince is not mentioned in other lists of this dynasty, and as, from the local inscriptions, his brother Naravarman seems to have had power to interfere with his grants, it has been inferred that Naravarman was the head of the family, and carried on the line in M\u00e1lw\u00e1, while Lakshmana Deva was his viceroy in the N\u00e1gp\u00far province. Both of these princes must have been nearly contemporary with Yasahkarna Deva of the Kalachuri or Jabalp\u00far line, for being sons of Uday\u00e1ditya, they were uncles of Alh\u00e1n\u00e1 Dev\u00ed, the wife of Yasahkarna's successor. Except these inscriptions there is nothing on record to connect the Pram\u00e1ras of M\u00e1lw\u00e1 distinctly with these provinces, though a seal was found at A's\u00edrgarh, from which it has been inferred that their dominion included that famous fortress.\u2020 The mere discovery of so portable an article as a signet cannot be regarded as very conclusive, but on general grounds of probability it may fairly be assumed that a province, to which the brother of the reigning prince was deputed as a Viceroy, was held by something more than a transitory tenure, and as the western\u2021 portions of the Narbad\u00e1 and Tapt\u00ed valleys lay between M\u00e1lw\u00e1 and N\u00e1gp\u00far, some part of them must have\n\n* Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, vol. xxxii.

The ruler of N\u0101gp\u016br was a scion of the illustrious Pram\u0101ra house, which counts R\u0101j\u0101 Bhoja, the Augustus of India, among its members, and the Kalachuri line of Jabalp\u016br was allied by marriage both to the Pramaras and to \"the ornament of the royal races\"\u2014the sun-descended princes of Udep\u016br. But the other local dynasties which have bequeathed to us their genealogies seem to lie entirely apart from the known currents of Indian history. One of them, it is true, is sufficiently important to have been commemorated in the Pur\u0101nas, but notwithstanding all that has been done to identify it, no certain date or local habitation can yet be assigned to it. This line was first brought to notice by the discovery of a copper-plate grant at Seoni* (on the Central plateau), but the list of kings thus obtained remained a mere fragment, unconnected even with any known legend, until in 1865 Dr. Bh\u0101\u00fa D\u0101j\u012b's re-examination of the Ajanth\u0101 caves enabled him to throw a new light on their history. From an inscription in the Zodiac cave, taken in connection with the Seoni plates, and with certain passages in the Pur\u0101nas, he came to the conclusion that this V\u0101k\u0101taka dynasty was a line of Yavanat princes\u2020 who ruled in Eastern and Central India shortly after the\n\n---\n\n* Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, vol. v. p. 726 (1836).\n\u2020 A Greek, a foreigner (Wilson).\n\u2021 Their genealogy is thus given by him (Journal of the Bombay Asiatic Society, vol viii. p. 248, 1865-66):\u2014\n\nVindhya sakti.\n| Pravarasena.\n| Rudra Sena, grandson of Gautami, daughter of the king Bhavan\u0101ga.\n| Prithvi Sena.\n| Rudra Sena II.\nPravara Sena II., son of Prabh\u0101vati Gupta, the daughter of Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101-dhir\u0101ja Sri Deva Gupta.\n\"Sa\u1e25\" or \"Sena\" kings. This, according to his computation, would place them in the fifth century of our era. The locality of their kingdom cannot be positively inferred from the place in which the Seoni inscription was found, for a copper-plate is easily moved, but taking the site of discovery in conjunction with other circumstances, the Yavana line may fairly be assigned to the Central plateau. The name of its founder, Vindhyasakti, is in itself significant. In the Puranic lists the term Vindhya* is sometimes applied to what is now known as the S\u0101tpur\u0101 range. Then the S\u0101tpur\u0101s lie between the countries which are said in the Ajant\u0101 inscription to have been conquered by one of these princes, viz. Kuntala,\u2020 Avanti,\u2021 Kalinga,\u00a7 Kosala,|| Trikuta,\u00b6 L\u0101ta,** and A'ndhra,\u2020\u2020 and would be a natural centre whence to claim, if not to effect, the conquest of the surrounding kingdoms.\u2021\u2021\n\n* Hall's edition of Wilson's Vishnu Pur\u0101na (book ii. chap. iii.), vol. ii. p. 128. Vindhya \"according to the V\u0101yu (Pur\u0101na) is the part south of the Narmad\u0101, or the S\u0101tpud\u0101 range.\" In the Vishnu Pur\u0101na the Narbad\u0101 is made to flow from the Vindhya, which must therefore have had a much wider significance than it has now.\n\n\u2020 Kuntala was in the Adoni or Bellari district of Madras\u2014(Asiatic Researches, vol. ix. p. 427).\n\n\u2021 Avanti was Ujen\u2014(Hall's edition of Wilson's Vishnu Pur\u0101na, vol. ii. p. 164, note 13).\n\n\u00a7 Kalinga was the upper Coromandel Coast\u2014(Hall's edition of Wilson's Vishnu Pur\u0101na, vol. ii. p. 156, note 3).\n\n|| There were several Kosalas, but this is probably the Kosala south of the S\u0101tpur\u0101 range, mentioned in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata\u2014(vide Hall's edition of Wilson's Vishnu Pur\u0101na, vol. ii. pp. 172-73; and p. 145, Professor Hall's note). See also Asiatic Researches, vol. xv. p. 508, in which the southern Kosala is placed to the west of Gondw\u0101na and Berar. An inscription of the Haihai-Bans\u012b kings found at Ratanpur calls their kingdom Kosala Des, and Huen Thsang's Kosala, 1,200 li N.W. of Kalinga and 900 li N.E. of A'ndhra, corresponds sufficiently with the same locality. It may therefore fairly be assumed that Kosala was the name of a country nearly corresponding to the present Chhattisgarh.\n\n\u00b6 Trikuta vide Vishnu Pur\u0101na (book ii. chap. ii.), vol. ii. p. 117.

Divested of their dress of pompous panegyric they shrink down to dry lists of unmeaning symbols, which the richest imagination could scarcely warm into life. We read how these unknown princes shamed the king of heaven by their prosperity;\u2014how their beneficence made earth better than elysium;\u2014how the world trembled at the march of their elephants, and the seas were swelled by the tears of the queens whom their conquests had widowed. But of the more humble home affairs, which would at least have given them a sure place in local annals, there is nothing. The kings of the eastern and southern coasts are awed at the prowess of the great Karna, and his name makes itself felt even in Kashmir and among the Huns, but we have nothing of the real extent of his petty kingdom, nor of the struggles which he must have maintained with the then rising power of the aboriginal chiefs. The alliances of the family with reigning princes of name are pompously recorded, and its genealogy is traced back to heroes and demigods, but there is nothing of its connection with the reclaimed ground of history. But although of little immediate interest, they cannot altogether be omitted in a record which only professes to be a groundwork for future research. The earliest of these is a line of R\u00e1h tor R\u00e1jputs, whose names are thus given in a copper-plate found at Mult\u00e1\u00ed in the Betul district on the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1 plateau*:\n\nDurga R\u00e1ja\nGovinda R\u00e1ja\nM\u00e1s wamika R\u00e1ja\nSr\u00ed Nanda R\u00e1ja.\n\nThe date of the last of these is either 630 or 830 A.D. according to Prinsep. The other line is commemorated in an inscription\u2020 found at N\u00e1gpur, and consists of the following names:\n\nS\u00e1rya Ghoaha\nKutsa\nUdayana\nBhava Deva.\n\nThey are called sovereigns of Ur\u00edsi, and the date of the inscription is believed to be Samrat 711 or A.D. 654.\n\n* Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, vol. vi. p. 869, October 1837.\n\u2020 Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bombay, vol. i. p. 148, April 1842.\nchiefs of the same line, who had once held the neighbouring district of Mandla, and who still ruled below the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1 plateau in Chhatt\u00edsgarh. Thus, too, Lakshmana Deva, the supposed Viceroy of N\u00e1gpur, crosses the seas with his elephants, and penetrates into supernatural regions; but from the mass of fable which he has accumulated round his name it cannot even be gathered with certainty whence he ruled and where he ruled. Through the froth and false glitter of these inscriptions all that can really be ascertained is that in the fifth century a race of foreign (Yavana) origin ruled from the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1 plateau, and that between the tenth and thirteenth centuries the country round Jabalpur was governed by princes of one of the most distinguished lunar R\u00e1jput races, while a territory south of the S\u00e1tpuras was held by the fire-descended Pram\u00e1ra princes of M\u00e1lw\u00e1. But although, as has been remarked above, the Gond power did not become conspicuous until the sixteenth century, no definite line of demarcation can be drawn between the more vivid period, illustrated by their homely annals, and the inanimate age of inscriptions. The Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 dynasty of Gonds probably rose to power as early as the tenth or eleventh century, but their kingdom lay so far to the south, and their history trenches so little on that of their neighbours, that they may be omitted in any general view of this part of the country as a whole, as may also for similar reasons the long-descended Haihai-Bansi rulers of Chhatt\u00edsgarh. We know, too, from Firishta that there were kings of Gondwana reigning from Khel\u00e1 in the Bet\u00fal district in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, but though they are often called Gonds it is questionable whether they were not Kshattriyas.* There is thus a vast though irregular space to be filled up by tradition, or, where that fails, by conjecture.\n\n* See below p. lxiv.\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nTHE GAULI'S AND NA'GBANSI'S.\n\nThe interregnum between the Kshattriyas and the Gonds\u2014The Gauli's\u2014Gauli traditions\u2014A's\u00e1 Ah\u00edr\u2014Abhira\u2014The two Nagp\u00fars\u2014Serpent descent in Gondwana\u2014Existing traces of Serpent-worship\u2014Serpent-worship once an aristocratic faith,\u2014but now out of fashion\u2014Old Nagbansi families now claim to be Rajputs\u2014Probable date of \"Naga\" ascendancy\u2014Indications of the existence of a Naga race\u2014Naga chiefs\u2014Nagbansi among the Gonds\u2014\"Naga Jogi\" and \"Naga Bhumiain\"\u2014Recapitulation.\n\nHowever we attempt to bridge over the mysterious voids lying between the age of inscriptions and the period illustrated by the Gond annals, questions of curious interest are raised up.\n\nIf their discussion be regarded as verging too much on the speculative, the character of this sketch must be pleaded in justification. It is simply an attempt to bring together the information that already exists regarding the obscurest part of the Peninsula, so as to form a groundwork for future investigation, and where the sum of our knowledge is so small, nothing should be neglected which may serve to indicate new paths of inquiry. The history and the physical character of the province are somewhat alike. It is traversed by but few broad, smooth roads, and those who follow them see little of distinctive local colouring. But as the wanderers in the interior to this day may make fresh discoveries of unexplored forest tracts and unknown mineral deposits, so the byways of inquiry may prove the most profitable in exploring the past. The traditions, beliefs, and habits of the people\u2014even their names\u2014have a meaning which may yield itself to patient investigation; but the many who are interested in local problems have hitherto worked in isolation, and without full knowledge of the conclusions to which their neighbours had come, and even an imperfect presentation of existing data will at least serve to remove this obstacle from their way.\n\nLocal tradition solves all difficulties by reference to a Gauli race of kings. Every ruin of unknown age, every floating legend that cannot be traced\nto Hind\u00fa mythology, is assigned to these pastoral princes. But where the popular difficulty ends ours must begin. Who were the Gaul\u00eds? It seems unlikely that they had any connection with the known tribes of the same name who now live by tending cattle in the great grazing grounds of the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1 range. Sir R. Jenkins, quoting Captain A. Gordon, says that in his time (1827) they took \"pride in the exploits and reputation of their ancient R\u00e1j\u00e1s, whose praises were sung by the bards, and listened to with delight by all classes of K\u00edrs\u00e1ns.\"* In these days, notwithstanding the most persevering investigations, nothing of any interest has been elicited regarding their origin. All their traditions and legends seem to point to Mathur\u00e1\u2014the classic land of cowherds\u2014and to Krishna\u2014the pastoral king and god\u2014and they make no claim to local sovereignty for their ancestors. They are said in some districts to differ from other Hind\u00fas in appearance, but they worship the same gods and speak the same language as their neighbours. In the only instance in which the careful inquiries made about them seemed to have led to the discovery of a Gaul\u00ed clan differing in language and nationality from the people of the country, it turned out that they were a colony from North Kanar\u00e1 who still spoke their own language among themselves. If, then, the existing Gaul\u00ed tribes represent the pastoral chiefs of tradition, they have so drifted away from all ancestral memories that it can serve no historical purpose to investigate the question of their descent.\n\nAnother theory is that the Gaul\u00ed rule is a mere figment of the popular imagination, arising from the tendency to look back to a pastoral age when land was free to all. Thus Colonel Briggs in a note to his translation of Firishta, says\u2014\"It is worthy of notice that many of the most ancient hill-forts in India have reference to the pastoral lives of their possessors; and when the Indians are at a loss to fix an era for any ancient structure or sculpture, they invariably refer it to the period of the shepherd kings.\"\u2020 He quotes as\n\n* Report on the Territories of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of N\u00e1gpur, p. 29 (Edn. N\u00e1gpur Antiquarian Society).\n\u2020 Vol. iv. p. 286 (Edn. 1829).\ninstances among others G\u00e1walg\u00e1rh\u2014the fort of the cowherd\u2014and A's\u00edrg\u00e1rh, which is said by Firishta to be the fort of A's\u00e1, the Ah\u00edr or herdsman\u2014both well-known fortresses on the S\u00e1t-pur\u00e1 range.* But evidence of this kind may be used positively as well as negatively. If we find pastoral names applied to the principal places of strength in a tract of country, it is as fair to conclude that it has really been ruled over by herdsmen chiefs, as that imagination had been at work in shaping nomenclature. The local traditions however, though vague and indefinite, are not so absolutely intangible as to drive us to the second of these alternatives. From Deog\u00e1rh on the plateau\u2014which before its subversion by the midland dynasty of Gonds in the sixteenth century was, according to the popular voice, the last seat of Gaul\u00ed power\u2014the very names of the Gaul\u00ed chiefs are handed down. According to one account the predecessor of the Gonds was P\u00e1nd\u00fa Gaul\u00ed; but a more detailed tradition sets forth that J\u00e1tb\u00e1,\u2020 the known ancestor of the Deog\u00e1rh Gond dynasty, began his career as a dependent on Mans\u00far and Gans\u00far, the two Gaul\u00ed chiefs of Deog\u00e1rh, and received from them a grant of land. He rose to become their minister, and at length obtained from them the entire management of their country. Having thus gained power, he went on to depose and murder his benefactors and to usurp their principality. But a Gaul\u00ed chief still retained possession of the fort of Narn\u00e1l\u00e1 for a few years longer, when he also was slain by the Mohammadans.\u2021\n\nThere seems to be no reason for discrediting the main points of this account. It is derived apparently from the traditions of one of the Gond dynasties,\u00a7 and though it is probable that the Deog\u00e1rh Gaul\u00eds were not princes of much standing, as we know from\n\n* He also quotes Gwalior, Golkond\u00e1 (the shepherd\u2019s hill), and Yenna Kond\u00e1 (butter hill).\n\n\u2020 Mentioned in the Ain-i-Akbari under S\u00faba Ber\u00e1r, Sark\u00edr Kherl\u00e1.\n\n\u2021 These details are taken from manuscript notes by Colonel Hervey, C.B., who lived for long in this part of India as Superintendent of the Thuggee and Dacoitee Department at Jabalpur.\n\n\u00a7 Probably from some descendant of the Garh\u00e1-Mandla family\u2019s retainers, as the representative of the Deog\u00e1rh line has not even preserved his genealogical tree.\nFirisha that in the preceding century the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Khel\u00e1* was the chief potentate in this part of the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1 plateau, it is quite possible that they may have been the last offshoots of a once powerful race. The S\u00e1g\u00e1r traditions bring down the Gaul\u00ed supremacy to an even later date. The tracts of It\u00e1w\u00e1 and Kura\u00ed, both north-west of S\u00e1g\u00e1r, are said not to have passed out of the power of Gaul\u00ed chiefs until the close of the seventeenth century. We come perhaps on more questionable ground in quoting Firisha\u2019s mention of A\u2019s\u00e1, the Ah\u00edr chief of A\u2019s\u00edrgarh. The story is well known, but it may bear repetition in the connection which is now given to it.\n\nIn the beginning of the fifteenth century there lived on the summit of a high hill in Kh\u00e1ndesh a rich herdsman chief, who was one of the principal landholders of the country, and whose ancestors had for nearly seven hundred years retained their estates. Although, besides 10,000 cattle, 20,000 sheep, and 1,000 mares, he had a strong masonry fort and 2,000 followers, whom he employed for protection as well as for other purposes, he was still known to the people to whom his benevolence had endeared him by the familiar name of A\u2019s\u00e1, the Ah\u00edr or herdsman, whence his fort was called A\u2019s\u00edrgarh.\u2020 This derivation is evidently erroneous, as we find the name of A\u2019s\u00edr in use long before A\u2019s\u00e1 Ah\u00edr\u2019s time,\u2021 but the story need not on that account be set down as a fable. It is much more likely that the real existence of a chief called A\u2019s\u00e1 should have suggested a plausible derivation, than that so circumstantial a narrative should have been invented to help out a piece of etymology. Accepting then Firisha\u2019s usually good credit for the main features of the story, we may fairly conclude that a line of herdsmen chiefs held part of the Tapt\u00ed valley for a considerable length of time before the fifteenth century. A\u2019s\u00edrgarh is called to this day a Gaul\u00ed fortress. Going still further back we find that \u201cin the Pur\u00e1nic geography the country on the western coast of\n\n* See below, p. lxxv.\n\u2020 Briggs\u2019 Firisha, vol. iv. p. 287 (Edn. 1629).\n\u2021 Vide article on A\u2019s\u00edrgarh; also Tod\u2019s R\u00e1jasth\u00e1n, vol. i. p. 105.\nIndia from the Tapti to Deogarh is called Abhira, the region of cowherds.* Dr. Bh\u00e1\u00fa D\u00e1j\u00ed mentions having found an inscription of an Abhira king at N\u00e1sik, and suggests that the Gaul\u00ed kings in the neighbourhood of N\u00e1sik and Trimbakesvara were the same as the Abhira kings.\u2020 There seems then to be a sufficient amount of evidence for concluding that in the dark ages of Hind\u00fa history the west of India was occupied by pastoral tribes, and as we find indications of the presence of similar races in western Gondw\u00e1na so late as the sixteenth or seventeenth centuries, there are some grounds for supposing that when pressed out of the plains by increasing cultivation, those of them who did not merge into the agricultural population retreated to the wild grazing grounds of the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1 country, and there lingered on till they sunk before the rising power of the Gonds, leaving nothing but a name behind them. The Gaul\u00ed traditions of these provinces seem to be confined to portion of the Nim\u00e1r district, the S\u00e1g\u00e1r district, the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1 plateau, and parts of the N\u00e1gpur province, but further inquiry may show that they also exist elsewhere.\n\nThe next question which deserves notice rests perhaps still more than the last upon hypothesis; but even if the solution which is here sought for it seem fanciful or erroneous, the facts still remain open to any other interpretation. It must have struck any one who has studied the map of Gondw\u00e1na that the juxtaposition of the two N\u00e1gp\u00fars is at least a curious coincidence. N\u00e1gpur the greater\u2021\n\n* Sir Henry Elliott's Supplemental Glossary, article \"Ahir.\"\n\u2020 Journal of the Bombay Asiatic Society, vol. viii. p. 243.\n\u2021 Tod (R\u00e1jasth\u00e1n, vol. ii. p. 443) says that the princes of Garh\u00e1-Mandla \"for ages continued the surname of P\u00e1l, indicative, it is recorded by tradition, of their nomadic occupation. The Ahirs who occupied all Central India, and have left in one nook (Ah\u00edrw\u00e1r\u00e1) a memorial of their existence, were a branch of the same race, 'Ah\u00edr being a synonym for P\u00e1l.' But he does not quote his authority for these statements.\n\nIt is true that the present name of the (greater) N\u00e1gpur province is not known to be old, but the number of names in the N\u00e1gpur country, into the composition of which the word N\u00e1g enters, shows how strong an impress this term had on the nomenclature of the country.\nand the lesser* may be called representative names in this part of the country, as though in their original meaning they were simply cities of the N\u00e1g or Snake, they have been extended to include two of the principal provinces of Gondw\u00e1na, and the significance of their joint relation to the mysterious serpent-gods and serpent races of Indian mythology is enhanced when we find that the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Chot\u00e1 N\u00e1gp\u00far claim to be N\u00e1gbans\u00eds or serpent-descended, and have, or till lately had, the lunettes of their serpent ancestor engraved on their signets in proof of their lineage.\u2020 If we cannot trace so direct an analogy between the name of the country and of its princes in the greater N\u00e1gp\u00far province, it is probably because we are almost entirely ignorant of its earlier history, for all around it we find indications of N\u00e1gbans\u00ed families. The R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Garh\u00e1 Mandla were N\u00e1gbans\u00eds, and traced back their origin to a serpent ancestor. The R\u00e1j\u00e1s of K\u00e1rond\u2014the most important of the group of Chiefships, which, under the name of the Garhj\u00e1ts, occupy a vast extent of wild territory to the extreme south-west of the province, bordering upon the Tributary Mah\u00e1ls of Cuttack\u2014are N\u00e1gbans\u00eds. So is the Chief of Khair\u00e1g\u00e1rh in Chhatt\u00edsg\u00e1rh, who owns and rules a more valuable, though not a larger, territory than any feudatory attached to these provinces. The present representatives of the Gond line of Deog\u00e1rh have lost their pedigree, but in the fragments of it which remain the name N\u00e1g occurs more than once. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Bastar claims to be a R\u00e1jput of the lunar line; but the dynasty to which he succeeded is said by tradition to have been of N\u00e1gbans\u00ed race, and inscriptions have been found in his territories of a N\u00e1gbans\u00ed line of princes dated 1130 (Samvat), equivalent to A.D. 1073, who by their claim to descend from Kasyapa,\u2021 the mythical progenitor of the sun, show that in Indian genealogies ophite descent may not be held incompatible with claims to the bluest\n\n* More properly Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gp\u00far.\n\u2020 Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, vol. xxxv., part ii.

So too in the small feudatory State held by the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 of P\u00e1tn\u00e1, the chief of the Garhj\u00e1t confederacy, there are curious ruins of temples which are attributed to a devout R\u00e1ni of the N\u00e1gbans\u00ed tribe. But perhaps the most curious relic of serpent-connection left in the province is at the temple of Buram Deva in Chhatt\u00edsgarh, which is evidently of very early origin. It contains no image but that of a cobra, and lying near are two inscriptions, one containing a list of twenty-two kings, who trace their descent to the union of a snake-god with the daughter of a holy man who lived south of the Narbad\u00e1, and the other relating how the Haihay\u00e1 king had opposed the construction of the temple, which was dedicated to Mah\u00e1deo.\u2020 The inscriptions, taken in connection with the snake image, may perhaps imply that the Haihay\u00e1 king of the time was a snake worshipper, and imposed his deity on the founder of the temple, or if he were a Buddhist, as there is reason to think,\u2021 that his Buddhism was tainted by serpent worship. In short we find frequent traces of this mysterious race on all sides of the present N\u00e1gpur country, and there is no great aboriginal house in Gondw\u00e1na which does not show traces of N\u00e1gbans\u00ed connection, with the single exception of the former ruling family of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1, which is of comparatively late origin.\u00a7 On the theory that the aborigines are the \"serpent races\" of the Hind\u00fa writings, this phenomenon, if it can be so called, would offer no difficulty whatever. It would be almost a matter of course that the Gond princes of Mandla, the greater N\u00e1gpur, and the Munda (Kol) R\u00e1j\u00e1 of the lesser N\u00e1gpur should claim descent from the gods of their people. But however natural and obvious this\n\n* The explanation offered is that the divine sage Kasyapa was, by one of his wives, Kadru, father of the Serpent race\u2014(Hall's edition of Wilson's Vishnu Pur\u00e1na, book 1, chap. xxi. p. 74).\n\n\u2020 See above p. li.; also Mr. Chisholm's Bilaspur Settlement Report, para. 37.\n\n\u2021 See below p. lxxiv. Unfortunately I have not been able to obtain accurate transcripts of either of these inscriptions in time for this publication.\n\n\u00a7 This dynasty commences probably in the eleventh century. See below, p. 142. The known origin of the Deogarh house is later, but the extant fragments of their alleged pedigree rise to a high antiquity.\nexplanation may seem, there are some considerations which tell strongly against it. In the first place there is no trace of reverence for serpents in the hagiology of the Gond people, as distinguished from their chiefs. Their pantheon, including some fifteen gods,* gives a full place to that element of terror which is so prominent in the beliefs of all savage tribes; but their efforts of propitiation are directed rather against the inscrutable shocks of storm and pestilence, than against the more tangible and visible scourges which they can combat with fleshly weapons.\u2020 In fact, a non-Hinduised Gond, with his omnivorous tastes, would probably sooner think of eating a snake than of worshipping it. The old snake-worship has not, however, even yet died out altogether among the higher classes of Gonds. It is said that, among the R\u00e1j-Gonds of the R\u00e1jp\u00far district, a solemn service or p\u00faj\u00e1 is performed every seven years to the snake-gods, but it is kept intensely secret, and may only be witnessed by married worshippers.\u2021 This ceremony seems to have died out in the N\u00e1gp\u00far country, but the Pardh\u00e1ns or Gond priests of N\u00e1gp\u00far say that when the Gond kings ruled at Deogarh, before their subjection by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, the adoration of the snake-god was formally and periodically celebrated by the Th\u00e1kur or high-priest of the R\u00e1j\u00e1s. In fact it seems that serpent-worship was among the Gonds an aristocratic faith, unknown to the mass of the people, and that even in the higher classes, where it has not altogether died out, it is carried on in stealth and secrecy.\n\nThe second point worth noticing is, that the claim to serpent descent is, like the serpent worship, a bygone ambition.

A strong instance of the first class are the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Chot\u00e1 N\u00e1gp\u00far,* who, though their family traditions show them to be aboriginal M\u00fand\u00e1s, have for long intermarried with R\u00e1jput families. The Chiefs of Khair\u00e1g\u00e1rah have not been so fortunate. They call themselves R\u00e1jputs, but it is only since a comparatively recent acquisition of territory and importance that their claim has been even admitted to consideration, and they have still to pay very heavily for their R\u00e1jput alliances. The N\u00e1gbansi name, which was once borne with pride as a mark of N\u00e1g\u00e1 or serpent origin, remains, after the importance of the stock from which it was derived has vanished; but it has lost its specific meaning, and the aboriginal princes by whom it was formerly prized, now attempt to gloss it over by confounding it among the tribal designations of the R\u00e1jputs, in which it has properly no place. This change of feeling seems to have occurred early in the Christian era. The first marked instance of it is in the conversion of the Gond N\u00e1gbansi line of Garh\u00e1-Mandla into a so-called R\u00e1jput race by the alleged marriage of the Gond heiress, the daughter of a king with the significant name of N\u00e1g\u00e1 Deva, to a Pram\u00e1ra or Baghela R\u00e1jput called J\u00e1du R\u00e1i.\u2020 This event is placed in A.D. 358\u2021; but if the reigns of the princes named in the Mandla inscriptions be calculated at an average length of twenty years, it would be deferred until the seventh century. It is not only curious as indicating approximately the time at which fashion changed, so to speak, and R\u00e1jput origin began to be an object of preference to N\u00e1gbansi descent, but also as showing how distinct a line of demarcation then existed between the N\u00e1gbansi and R\u00e1jput stocks, which it has since been attempted to confound.\n\n* Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal (1866), vol. xxxv. part ii.

Thus serpent-worship and the\npride of serpent-descent were not only aristocratic rather than na-\ntional or widespread articles of belief among the aborigines of Cen-\ntral India, but even among the ruling classes they seem to have gone\nout of fashion much about the time when Br\u00e1hmanism, superseding\nBuddhism, again became the paramount creed of the country, and when\nperhaps a system of orthodox R\u00e1jput tribes shaped itself out of the\ncongeries of ruling races in which H\u00fanas, Yavanas, and other\nimperfectly-assimilated foreign elements had a place.\n\nThe conclusions to which these considerations seem to me to\nIndications of the existence point are that the N\u00e1gga name, assumed by\nof a N\u00e1gga race. the aboriginal princes of Gondwana, was\nnot connected with the national faith or traditions of the aboriginal\npeople, but was an exotic graft, abandoned when the stock from which it\n\n* Selections from the Records of the Government of India in the Foreign Department,\nNo. xxix.

On any other theory it would be necessary to assume that the aboriginal races, who have not even yet embraced Hinduism, abandoned their distinctive and favourite divinity, while retaining all the rest, so completely as to have preserved no trace of it in their worship. This is of course quite a possible supposition, but it seems to offer greater difficulties than the explanation already suggested. Hind\u00fa proselytism might, and as we know did, wage war against what was regarded by orthodox Aryans as rank heathenism, but it is not likely to have limited its attacks to one particular god out of a popular pantheon, or to have succeeded in obliterating all memory of one part of a system while the rest remained intact. It seems far more probable that the Hind\u00fa legends of serpent-sacrifices should refer to the attempted destruction of a small and prominent class, whether of serpent-worshippers, or of religionists to whom the term \"serpent\" was applied as a distinctive mark from their alleged origin, than to the extermination of whole nations, whose inferior social organism must have prevented their ever being regarded by Aryan Hind\u00fas as formidable opponents. Whether the N\u00e1gas of the Hind\u00fa legends were Scythian Buddhists, as is supposed by Sir H. Elliott,* or not, it seems probable that they were a race apart in the earlier centuries of the Christian era, and there certainly seems reason for inferring the existence in and round Central India of a small but powerful foreign element, distinguished by its reverence, whether religious or ancestral, for serpent-gods or progenitors, which in some cases, such as the N\u00e1g\u00e1 line of the coins, ruled independently, and in others either allied itself to ruling races, such as the Yavanas of V\u00e1k\u00e1taka, and perhaps some of the present N\u00e1g\u00e1ns\u00ed families; or imposed its name and faith on the aboriginal princes, who now for similar reasons affect Hind\u00fa-R\u00e1jput origin. The instance of the Khair\u00e1g\u00e1rah Chiefs, who are steadily buying their way into R\u00e1jputism by costly alliances, has been mentioned, but a similar change may be elsewhere observed in operation by the simple process of imitation and assumption. In the wild feudatory\n\n* Supplemental Glossary, p. 422, article \"Gour Tuga.\"\nstates of Bastar and Jaipur the Rajas openly sell, or until lately sold, the sacred thread to certain castes,* and among the Kanwars of Chattisgarh\u2014a tribe which, whether or not aboriginal, is apparently non-Hindu\u2014some sections have worn the thread for a considerable period, and others have assumed it within the last decade, while the great majority do not even yet make any pretensions to it.\u2020 With this metamorphosis going on before our eyes, it needs no far-fetched theory to account for a somewhat similar assumption by aboriginal chiefs of a title which was then probably as much a passport to respect as the name of Rajput is now, especially at a time when the floating elements of Hindu society had not yet taken their present rigid shape, and admission into the ranks of a warlike aristocracy may still have been partly open to powerful tribes of foreign descent. If the Naga races whose name was assumed by the aboriginal princes were of Scythian origin, they may have been regarded like Sakas, Yavana,\u2021 and other foreigners, as impure Kshatriyas, and if so, a connection, alleged or real, with them would have been an easier passage to social elevation for aspiring Gond and Kol Chiefs, than the pretensions which they afterwards adopted, and still find it so difficult to support, to descent from the more exclusive noble races of the Hindus.\n\nBut if these inferences have any foundation, and the Nagas of Central India were a race of foreign descent, with a status intermediate between that of the aborigines and of the ruling Kshatriya races of Hindus, we should expect to find that they had left some more permanent mark on the population than the few indications of their presence which have been noticed above. Their Chiefs may perhaps still be represented by such families as the Nagabansi line of Karond, which, so far as can be ascertained, is free from any suspicion of aboriginal blood, and intermarries freely with good Rajput families, but the mass of the people, if indeed it was ever settled here in mass,\n\n* Colonel Elliott's Report on Karond, p. 9.\n\u2020 Mr. Chisholm's Bilaspur Settlement Report, para. 120.\n\u2021 Muir's Sanskrit Texts, vol. i. p. 482 (Edn. 1868).\nis more difficult to trace distinctly. The Gonds have, however, a curious legend regarding the origin of one of their historical subdivisions, apparently now almost extinct, which would seem to show that a serpent-descended race of higher origin than their own had been absorbed among their numbers. They say that long after the Gond race had been created, but many generations previous to the Rajput transformation of the Garh\u00e1-Mandla dynasty in A.D. 358, a brother of the Kshattriya ruler of Delhi, when visiting the Mah\u00e1deo hills (in Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d) formed a connection with the daughter of the serpent-god of the place, and that, as a punishment, their issue was excluded from ranking among Kshattriyas, and was condemned to wander about the earth as part of the Gond* tribe. Divested of romance this may be taken to mean simply that the N\u00e1gban\u015b\u00ed section of the Gonds are or were a comparatively distinguished and recent addition to their numbers, and, if so, it would be easy to account for the body of the N\u00e1g\u00e1 tribe, as well as for their chiefs. It may also be worth mentioning that one of the most curious of the so-called aboriginal races of the Central Provinces, the Baig\u00e1s, who are the priests of other wild tribes, claim descent from a pair bearing the significant names of \"N\u00e1g\u00e1 Jog\u00ed\" and \"N\u00e1g\u00e1 Bh\u00fami\u00e1in\".\u2020 Though classed as aborigines they have no distinguishing dialect of their own, and their position among their supposed congeners is sufficiently in accord with the social rank which might have remained to the degenerate descendants of a race originally holding themselves above the aborigines, but not admitted to equality by the highest classes of the Hind\u00fas.\n\nThe length to which these remarks have trespassed and the obscurity of the subject may make a brief recapitulation desirable, and indeed the substance of what has been suggested may be put in a very few words.\n\n* Note on Gonds and Baig\u00e1s\u2014(Appendix to Captain Ward's Mandla Settlement Report).\n\u2020 Report of Central Provinces' Ethnological Committee (1868), p. 52.\nThe curious prominence of the serpent or \"N\u00e1g\u00e1\" element in the nomenclature both of places and Recapitulation. families in Gondw\u00e1na seem to show that a N\u00e1g\u00e1 race must have played an important part in the history of this part of India, and as the claim to N\u00e1g\u00e1 descent, though indifferently made by chiefs of such opposite origin as the Kolarian M\u00fand\u00e1s and the Dravidian Gonds, had seemingly never penetrated down to the body of the aboriginal peoples, the natural inference is that the N\u00e1g\u00e1s of Central India were a separate race, powerful enough to be an object of imitation and aspiration to the more ambitious of the aboriginal chiefs, and probably connected with the N\u00e1g\u00e1 dynasties, of whom there are traces in the Vindhyan* country. Lastly, the absorption of the Central Indian N\u00e1g\u00e1s, admitting them to have been a separate people, is shown to be at least possible by the existence to this day of N\u00e1g\u00e1ns\u00ed chiefs unconnected even by suspicion with any of the known aboriginal races, and of subdivisions among the aboriginal tribes claiming a N\u00e1g\u00e1 descent, and admittedly distinct from the body of their adopted people.\n\n* Narwar, where General Cunningham places the nine N\u00e1g\u00e1s of the coins, is in the Vindhyan country, and the Yavana dynasty, which allied itself with the N\u00e1g\u00e1s, spring from a founder bearing the probably allegorical name of \"Vindhyasakti.\"\n\n\u2020 Since the above was written Fergusson's \"Tree and Serpent-worship\" has been received. From the sculptures at Sanchi and Amravati he finds evidence of the co-existence with Hind\u00fas in the first centuries of the Christian era of a race of bearded serpent-worshippers, probably aborigines. The superior race, whom he calls Hind\u00fas, are never represented as worshipping the snake, but certain sections of them seem to have had the snake as their emblem or tutelary genius, and are invariably shown with the cobra hood canopying their head. \"The distinction between people with snakes and those without,\" says Fergusson, \"is most curious and perplexing. After the most attentive study I have been unable to detect any characteristic, either of feature or costume, by which the races can be distinguished beyond the possession of this strange adjunct. That those with snakes are the N\u00e1g\u00e1 people we read of can hardly be doubted\" (p. 192). His conclusion is that snake-worship was an aboriginal faith, and that the Aryans adopted it \"in proportion as they became mixed with the aborigines, and their blood became less and less pure\" (p. 114). May it not be that the people represented in the sculptures with the N\u00e1g\u00e1 emblem was the N\u00e1g\u00e1 race which has been inferred to have been an object of imitation and respect to the aboriginal tribes of the country? It would not be unnatural that a savage people should carry their reverence for the national symbol of their conquerors so far as to worship it.\nCHAPTER V.\n\nHISTORY UNDER THE GONDS AND MARATHAS.\n\nCommencement of history in Gondwana\u2014The Kherla dynasty\u2014Circumstances under which the Gonds rose to power\u2014The dynasties of Garh\u00e1-Mandla, Chand\u00e1, and Deogarh\u2014The character of the Gond rule\u2014Extracts from Sleeman\u2014Remarks of an eye-witness in the last century\u2014Prosperity of the Gond kingdoms\u2014The Gond people under their own princes and under the Marath\u00e1s\u2014Position of the aboriginal Chiefs after the Maratha conquest\u2014Demoralisation of the hill Gonds\u2014Their pacification under our rule\u2014Maratha period\u2014Character of the Maratha rule\u2014The best days of the Bhonsl\u00e1s\u2014Deterioration of the Government\u2014The Pindaris\u2014Their rivals, the Tax collectors\u2014The spoliation of the land\u2014by direct violence,\u2014by form of law\u2014Devices for obtaining contributions from bankers\u2014Ingenuity of general taxation\u2014Forced benevolences\u2014Exhaustion of the country\u2014Errors of our early administration\u2014Improved system and its effects\u2014Constitution of Central Provinces.\n\nIt has already been said that history proper does not commence in Gondwana until the sixteenth century. It was then that Sangram S\u00e1, the forty-eighth R\u00e1j\u00e1 of the Gond line of Garh\u00e1-Mandla, issuing from the Mandla highlands, extended his dominion over fifty-two garhs or districts, comprising the country now known as Bhop\u00e1l, S\u00e1g\u00e1r, and Damoh on the Vindhyan plateau; Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d, Narsinghp\u00far, and Jabalp\u00far in the Narbad\u00e1 valley; and Mandla and Seoni in the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1 highlands. In the same century the Haihai-Bans\u00ed line of Chhat-t\u00edsgarh emerges from a darkness, only lighted up by occasional inscriptions, into the general history of the country, and in the succeeding century the Gond princes of Deogarh transformed themselves from obscure aboriginal chiefs into a powerful Mohammadan\ndynasty. The annals of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 are difficult to reduce to history, but it may be gathered from them that up to the sixteenth century the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of this line paid tribute to some stronger power.\n\nIt is true that the Garh\u00e1-Mandla dynasty dates its sovereignty from A.D. 358, but even their own annalists do not claim any extended dominion for them during the first twelve centuries of their independent existence, and the vestiges of powerful contemporary dynasties, now only extant in the inscriptions quoted above, are conclusive in limiting the extent of Gond supremacy down to so late a period as the eleventh and twelfth centuries. The Haihai-Bansi of Chattisgarh are far older, and might perhaps be traced to times of unknown antiquity, if history could even feel its way through the inanimate era of inscriptions to the more living, if less real, legendary age which lies beyond it. It has been seen that some of the oldest Hind\u00fa legends relate to the supremacy of this powerful branch of the lunar race in the Narbada valley, and that their earliest inscriptions carry them back to the first centuries of our era. The traditions of the Ratanpur branch ascend even higher, and there seems to be little doubt that eighteen or nineteen centuries ago they held all the eastern part of what is now known as the Central Provinces. The Kshattriya king of Kosala, visited by Huen Thsang* in the seventh century, was in all probability one of this line, and it has already been mentioned that Professor FitzEdward Hall identifies their kingdom with the Puranic realm of Chedi.\u2020 This identification supplies a link, if one were needed, between the kings of Chattisgarh and the dynasty of the same race, commemorated by the Jabalpur tablets, as both are called rulers of Chedi in their respective inscriptions. But though there may be in these rude indi-\n\n---\n\n* Huen Thsang (Julien's Translation, book iv. p. 185, Edn. Paris, 1853) speaks of him as a devout Buddhist, and from the Buram Deva inscription referred to above (p. lxv.) it would seem likely that the Haihai-Bansi kings were Buddhists in the earlier centuries of our era, as a Br\u00e1hmanical prince, even of a different sect, would hardly oppose the construction of a Saiva temple by main force.\n\n\u2020 See above, p. liii.\ncations of a dynastic history, extending not over centuries but over thousands of years, the frame-work for a very curious and interesting sketch, they must be passed over here with the bare mention which is all that necessarily limited space can spare to them.\n\nBefore, however, the simultaneous dominion of the three great Gond houses of Garh\u00e1-Mandla, Deogarh, and Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 united, for a time, almost the whole of Gondw\u00e1na under the sway of aboriginal princes, a dynasty\u2014which is usually called Gond*\u2014had risen to temporary place and power at Kherl\u00e1, on the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1 plateau, in the fifteenth century. The only written record now forthcoming of these princes is in the pages of Firishtha,\u2020 by whom they are said to have had \"great wealth and power, being possessed of all the hills of Gondw\u00e1na and other countries.\" They first appear in A.D. 1398, when Narsinha R\u00e1ya, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Kherl\u00e1, is represented as instigated by the kings of M\u00e1lw\u00e1 and Kh\u00e1ndesh to invade the B\u00e1hman\u00ed territories. A hill chief fighting against the most powerful of the then vigorous Mohammadan dynasties of Southern India had of course little chance, and Narsinha R\u00e1ya had to buy peace from F\u00edroz Sh\u00e1h, the B\u00e1hman\u00ed king, by large presents of money, forty-five elephants, and the hand of his daughter. But lying as he did between two far more highly organised powers, not even his highland position could ensure to the Kherl\u00e1 Chief a long immunity from invasion, and about twenty or twenty-five years after,* the king of\n\n---\n\n* The Kherl\u00e1 princes have been generally set down as Gond, but I cannot find on what authority. There seems to be quite as much, if not more, reason for considering them to have been Kshattriyas. The local legends certainly attribute that dignity to them, and in a very legendary account of the death of a Rahm\u00e1n Sh\u00e1h Dulha, who sacrificed his head in order to take the Kherl\u00e1 fortress with his headless trunk, and to whose head there is a monument at Kherl\u00e1, while his body has similar honours at Ellichp\u00far in Ber\u00e1r, may perhaps be traced the story of the capture of Kherl\u00e1 by the B\u00e1hman\u00ed commander-in-chief (whose name is not given), and his subsequent assassination by two R\u00e1jputs of the garrison, as related by Firishtha\u2014(Briggs' translation, vol. ii. p. 480).\n\n\u2020 Briggs' Firishtha (Edn. 1829), vol. ii. pp. 371\u2014378.\nM\u00e1lw\u00e1, having failed in his attempt to employ the aboriginal principality as a weapon of offence against his powerful southern rival, determined to take advantage of it as a place of refuge in the event of his being hard pressed by his equally dangerous neighbours, the Mohammadan kings of Gujar\u00e1t. Narsinha R\u00e1ya got together an army of 50,000 men, but his attempts at defence were unavailing, and he was defeated and slain. A large booty, including eighty-four elephants, fell to the victors, who also imposed a tribute on Narsinha R\u00e1ya\u2019s successor, and left a garrison in his fortress of Kherl\u00e1.\u2020 But their grasp on their new acquisition could not have been very firm, for some six years afterwards Sult\u00e1n Hoshang of M\u00e1lw\u00e1 is recorded as again invading Kherl\u00e1, though this time with less success. He was three times repulsed, and in the interval which was thus gained the besieged prince was able to appeal to the B\u00e1hman\u00ed king for help. Ahmad Sh\u00e1h B\u00e1hman\u00ed showed the usual readiness of these predatory foreign kings to embark in what promised to be a profitable war, but half-way on his expedition a pious doubt occurred to him whether \u201chawks should pyke out hawks\u2019 een,\u201d and true believers should embroil themselves with each other for the sake of an infidel. His movements were, however, quite misinterpreted by the king of M\u00e1lw\u00e1, who, less capable than his enemy of fine conscientious scruples, put down his hesitation to simple cowardice. Finding his forbearance so ill appreciated, the B\u00e1hman\u00ed king threw the whole weight of his power into the scale of the Kherl\u00e1 Chief, and defeated Sult\u00e1n Hoshang\u2019s army with great loss.\u2021 This was, however, but a temporary respite for Kherl\u00e1, which a few years afterwards, in 1433, again fell before Sult\u00e1n Hoshang, and was at last confirmed to him by treaty with the B\u00e1hman\u00ed kings.\u00a7 This was renewed after a war between the B\u00e1hman\u00ed power\n\n* The date is differently given in the B\u00e1hman\u00ed and M\u00e1lw\u00e1 histories.\n\n\u2020 Briggs\u2019 Firishta, vol. iv.

The two opportunities of the Gonds were the disruption of the Hind\u00fa dominions by Mohammadan invaders, and the subsequent subversion of the independent Mohammadan kingdoms by a strong imperial power. It was between the era of the R\u00e1jput kingdoms of Chedi and M\u00e1lw\u00e1, and the palmy days of independent Mohammadanism in the west and south, that the Kherl\u00e1 dynasty found its place; and the substantial rise of the Gonds in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was probably made possible by the increased security of their external relations, which resulted from the substitution of the contemptuous tolerance of a large imperial power for the territorial greed of a number of restless rivals. The Moghal from his far-off court at Agra was content with obtaining from the lords of these rugged hills the nominal submission which was sufficient to prevent any break in the continuity of his vast dominions, where the petty neighbouring kings always found something to hanker after in even the poorest lands lying so close under their eyes.\n\nThus when the decadence of the Mohammadan power of M\u00e1lw\u00e1 in the sixteenth century had enabled the Gond chiefs of Garh\u00e1-Mandla to turn their principality into a kingdom,\n\n* Briggs' Firishtha, vol. ii. pp. 479 ff., vol. iv. pp. 228, 230.\n\u2020 Ibid, vol. iv. pp. 231, 232.\n\u2021 That is, assuming the Kherl\u00e1 princes to have been Gonds.\nthey retained their regal status for two centuries, only forfeiting it when the strong grasp of the Moghal emperors relaxed, and a hitherto unknown branch of the Aryan race, the Marath\u00e1s, revived the old system of Aryan division and rivalry, which had once before been so fatal to the prospects of aboriginal independence. Although the Gonds were in name completely dependent on Delhi, and Garh\u00e1, one of their chief seats of dominion, was included in the lists of Akbar's possessions as a subdivision of his province of M\u00e1lw\u00e1, they were practically so far from the ken of the Moghal court that, except on occasions of disputed succession or other difficulty, their history runs in a channel of its own, quite unaffected by the imperial policy. Indeed in emergencies they seem to have appealed as readily for aid to the neighbouring princes of Pann\u00e1 (in Bundelkhand), and of Deogarh, as to their nominal suzerains, and their alliances with these powers generally cost them concessions of territory to which it is not very probable that the consent of the imperial court was obtained or even asked.\n\nThe princes of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 and Deogarh, after their first submission to Delhi, seem to have been practically even more independent than their northern neighbour. The annals of the former show no trace of Moghal domination, except the grant of signet rings to the two last kings, on which they are styled \"dependents\" of the emperors. The latter bought his independence by apostasy, and returned from Delhi, which he had visited to make his submission, with a dress of honour and the high-sounding Moslem name of Bakh\u00ed Buland, but thenceforward he seems to have been more powerful and freer from control than any of the other Gond princes, and his descendants to this day are as pure Gonds by blood as if they had never opened out to themselves the possibility of alliances with the higher races whose religion they had adopted. But like their brothers of Garh\u00e1-Mandla, the princes both of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 and Deogarh succumbed almost without a struggle on the advent of the Marath\u00e1s, and the middle of the eighteenth century saw the absorption of their kingdoms into the dominions of the Bhonsl\u00e1 R\u00e1j\u00e1s of N\u00e1gpur. The crushing disaster which befell\nthe Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 confederacy at P\u00e1nipat deferred the fate of the Mandla dynasty for another quarter of a century, but in 1781 their territories became part of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 principality of S\u00e1g\u00e1r, and with them ended the independence of the Gonds.\n\nThe time has passed to obtain much information regarding the real character of the Gond rule, apart from the personal legends and dynastic disputes which make up the tale of the royal chronicles. When we took possession of the country, the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s had occupied the greater part of it for more than half a century, and the accelerated life of the people during a similar period of British administration has done even more to break the thread of old traditions, and to create new aims and interests. The scanty relics of information that still survived at the time of the cession in 1818 were brought together by Sir W. Sleeman and Sir R. Jenkins, the former of whom especially applied his great powers of observation to the task of studying the people amongst whom he was placed. The following passage, extracted from some manuscript notes, dated 1825, and left by him in the Record office at Narsinghp\u00far\u2014the district in which he practically commenced his distinguished career as an Indian administrator\u2014gives, probably, a very fair idea of the internal polity of the Gond principalities:\n\n\"Under these Gond R\u00e1j\u00e1s the district for the most part seems to have been distributed among feudatory chiefs, bound to attend upon the prince at his capital with a stipulated number of troops to be employed wherever their services might be required, but to furnish little or no revenue in money. These chiefs were Gonds, and the countries they held for the support of their families and the payment of their troops and retinue, little more than wild jungles; and we may almost trace the subsequent encroachments of cultivation by the changes that have taken place in their residences, retiring from the plains as they were brought into good tillage, and taking shelter in or near the hills, where alone any considerable jungle is now to be found. The convenience of these jungles in furnishing wood and grass to them and\ntheir followers is the chief motive of their choice, but I believe they would prefer a wild jungle as their residence to a cultivated plain did no advantage of this kind exist.\n\n\"Some fourteen or sixteen generations ago a considerable change appears to have commenced in the population and the cultivation of the plains in this district, as well as in the others that border on the Narb\u00e1d\u00e1, and indeed all those that I have seen in Bhop\u00e1l, N\u00e1gp\u00far, &c., &c. Families of different castes of Hind\u00fas from Bhad\u00far, Antarvedi, and other countries to the north and north-west, oppressed by famine or distracted by domestic feuds in their native countries, emigrated to these parts; and unlike the Mohammadans or Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, who appeared only as military adventurers, they sought a peaceful and a permanent establishment in the soil.\n\n\"Generally they seem to have come first in single families, the heads of whom took a small but well-chosen tract of rich but uncultivated land from the feudatory Gond Chiefs at a small rent in money, or more commonly in kind; and I have traced many of the most respectable and most extensive of those families\u2014Br\u00e1hmans, R\u00e1jputs, and others\u2014back to the time when they paid only a few m\u00e1nis of grain and a few pots of ghee a year for immense tracts of waste that are now covered with groves, villages, and rich cultivation, all owing themselves to the industry of the same family. These families, increasing from generation to generation, and augmented by acquisitions of new emigrants from the same countries and tribes, who invariably joined themselves to the original establishments, became in time valuable and often formidable to the Gond Chiefs from their superior industry, skill, and enterprise; a better system of tillage and greater industry created a greater surplus produce, while a bolder and more enterprising spirit enabled them to appropriate it in extending improvement.\n\n\"Some of these families from the first held immediately under the prince, and almost all ultimately, for as they became sufficiently strong to shake off their dependence on the feudatory chief,\nthey never wanted a pretext, either in their own disputes with them, or in the jealousies of the prince himself, who found them better soldiers and more profitable tenants than the Gond Chiefs, who required all the surplus produce of large estates to subsist their large but useless train of followers.\n\n\"As these families increased and spread over the plains, the Gond population retired to the hills, rather than continue on plains deprived of their jungles. Some of them still live in the plains, near the banks of rivers that retain their jungle, and in other parts, as about Fatehpur, where the soil is too poor to pay the expense of clearing away the plains; but I have frequently seen a few Gond families detach themselves entirely from the rest of a village, and establish themselves at another end of the estate in some corner affording them at least the appearance of a jungle.\n\n\"A great many of the villages in Narsinghpur that are now situated in the midst of a fine cultivated plain retain the names of Gond Patels that formerly held them: and many thus situated, that have the same name with one or more villages in the same pargana, are still distinguished by the prefix Gondi, as Gondi Jhiria, to distinguish it from the others, and denote it as a village of Gonds, while not a Gond has lived near it for ages; but in no instance have I been able to discover a well or a tank dug, or a grove planted by a Gond Patel; all those that I have found in villages denoted to have been possessed by them having been dug or planted by subsequent occupants. The Mhowa tree, whose fruit is much esteemed by them, they no doubt cultivated, and though it now appears to grow spontaneously in the woods to which they have retired, is the only part of an estate that seems to form in their mind any local tie, and the Patel in his annual assessments is obliged to assign to every Gond cultivator one or more of these trees, if any stand on his grounds, in proportion to the land he may till. But not only were groves, temples, tanks, and other works of ornament and utility not to be found in the different villages of a Gond Chief's estate; even his\nresidence showed no signs of such improvement, and scarce anything less than the capital of a large principality possessed them. The surplus produce of their rude state of agriculture was small, and had the villages of the Gond Chiefs been distributed among their relations as those of the heads of the Rajputs, Brahmins, and other families from the north were, they would have consumed it all in the enjoyment of indolence, the highest luxury they knew, as at present. On the contrary the new families possessed superior knowledge, enterprise, and industry, and their imaginations were excited by what they had seen or heard of in their parent country, and they exerted themselves in such a manner as to render every tolerable village superior, in works which they esteemed useful or ornamental, to the capital of a Gond Chief.\"\n\nThough this picture represents an indolent semi-barbarous race, it conveys no impression of cruel savagery in the Gond character. The princes, like the people, seem to have been of an easy, unambitious disposition, rarely seeking foreign conquests after their first establishment, and only anxious to stave off the evil day of dissolution by concessions.* The following passage\u2020 from the narrative of a journey undertaken at the close of the last century by a member of the Asiatic Society, which may be regarded as the nearest discoverable approach to contemporary evidence, speaks well for the stewardship of the Gond princes:\n\n* From the time of the establishment of the Gond kingdom of Garh\u00e1-Mandla in A.D. 1530 to its subversion some two centuries after, we do not read of a single accession of territory to it, nor of a single offensive war undertaken by its princes. The only really spirited stand made by them was that of Durgavati\u2014a Rajput princess who had married into their line (see below, article Mandla, p. 283).\n\n\u2020 Asiatic Annual Register, 1806. \"Miscellaneous Tracts\"\u2014A Narrative of a Journey from Mirzapur to Nagpur by a route never before travelled by any European in 1798-99, by a member of the Asiatic Society, eminent for his extensive acquirements in every branch of oriental literature and science,\" p. 32.\n\"The thriving condition of the province, indicated by the appearance of its capital, and confirmed by that of the districts which we subsequently traversed, demands from me a tribute of praise to the ancient princes of the country. Without the benefit of navigation\u2014for the Narbad\u00e1 is not here navigable,\u2014and without much inland commerce, but under the fostering hand of a race of Gond princes, a numerous people tilled a fertile country, and still preserve in the neatness of their houses, in the number and magnificence of their temples, their ponds, and other public works, in the size of their towns, and in the frequency of their plantations, the undoubted signs of enviable prosperity. The whole merit may be safely ascribed to the former government, for the praise of good administration is rarely merited by Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 chieftains, and it is sufficient applause to say that the Chief of S\u00e1g\u00e1r in twenty years, and the R\u00faj\u00e1 of Ber\u00e1r in four, have not much impaired the prosperity which they found.\"\n\nThe little that is known of the history of the Gond dynasties quite confirms this account. Under their easy, eventless sway the rich country over which they ruled prospered, their flocks and herds increased, and their treasuries filled. So far back as the fifteenth century we read in Firishta that the king of Kherl\u00e1, who if not a Gond himself was a king of the Gonds, sumptuously entertained Ahmad Sh\u00e1h Wal\u00ed, the B\u00e1hman\u00ed king, and made him rich offerings, among which were many valuable diamonds, rubies, and pearls.*\n\nUnder the Garh\u00e1-Mandla dynasty the revenues of the Mandla district\u2014now a wild tract of forest paying with difficulty \u00a35,000 per annum to the State\u2020\u2014amounted it is said to ten l\u0101khs of rupees, or \u00a3100,000. Sleeman writes thus of the reign of the R\u00e1n\u00ed Durg\u00e1vat\u00ed (A.D. 1560),\u2014\"of all the sovereigns of this dynasty she lives most \"in the page of history and in the grateful recollections of the people. \"She formed the great reservoir which lies close to Jabalpur, and is \"called after her 'R\u00e1n\u00ed T\u00e1l\u00e1o' or queen's pond; * * * many other\n\n* Briggs' Firishta, vol. ii. p. 410 (Edn. 1829).\n\u2020 The revenue has been increased by the new settlement.\n\"highly useful works were formed by her about Garh\u00e1.\"* When the castle of Chaur\u00e1garh was sacked by one of Akbar's generals, in A.D. 1564, the booty found, according to Firishta, comprised \"independently of the jewels, the images of gold and silver and other valuables, no fewer than a hundred jars of gold coin,\" and a thousand elephants. Indeed Durg\u00e1vati, we read, kept up in all a stud of 1,500 elephants.\u2020 Of the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 dynasty, Major Lucie Smith, the Deputy Commissioner, who has studied his district with the minutest interest, writes that \"they left, if we forget the last few years, a well-governed and contented kingdom, adorned with admirable works of engineering skill, and prosperous to a point which no after-time has reached.\"\u2021 They have left their mark behind them in royal tombs, lakes, and palaces, but most of all in the grand enceinte of battlemented stone wall, too wide now for the shrunk city within it, which stands, a fitting emblem of its half-reclaimed founders, on the very border-line between the forest and the plain, having in front the rich valley of the Wardh\u00e1, behind and up to the city walls deep forest extending far east. The third contemporary dynasty, that of Deogarh, rose to power in the decadence of the Moghal empire, too near the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 epoch, and, as has been already remarked, it was only the existence of a strong imperial power admitting no rival kingdoms on the field of conquest, but extending a contemptuous tolerance to its more insignificant and distant vassals, which made it possible for the aboriginal principalities to bear up against the surrounding pressure of Aryan invaders. The Deogarh history is therefore but a beginning and an end, with no eventless middle period of peaceful progress, yet it was amidst the wars of Bakht Buland (A.D. 1700), with whom this dynasty practically commenced, that the N\u00e1gpur country received its first great infusion of Hind\u00fa cultivators and artificers, who were tempted away by him from their homes with liberal grants of land. Sir Richard Jenkins says of him that \"he employed indiscriminately Musulm\u00e1ns and Hind\u00fas of ability to introduce\n\n* Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, vol. vi. p. 627 (August 1837).\n\u2020 Briggs' Firishta, vol. ii. p. 218 (Edn. 1829).\n\u2021 See below. p. 144.\n\"order and regularity into his immediate domain. Industrious set-\ntlers from all quarters were attracted to Gondwana, many towns\nand villages were founded, and agriculture, manufactures, and even\ncommerce made considerable advances. It may with truth be said\nthat much of the success of the Maratha administration was owing\nto the groundwork established by him.\"*\n\nThe prosperity of the kingdom generally implies to some extent\nthe prosperity of the governed, but it is a curious commentary on the social capacities\nof the Gonds that their princes should have only been able to advance by leaving the body of the people\nbehind. Their history shows that they were more capable of rising\nto the Aryan level than other aboriginal tribes, and their supplanters,\nthe Marathas, admitted, even after they had harried them down\nto the state of mere blood-thirsty savages, that they were not\nto be classed with the Khonds and other mountaineers. Captain\nBlunt, who has been mentioned above as the only authority\non the condition of the Gonds up to a very late period,\u2020\nwrites that Kamal Mohammad, the officer in charge of\nthe Maratha pargana of Manikpatam, \"who appeared\nto be well acquainted with the different tribes of mountaineers\nsubject to the Berar Government,\" informed him (A.D. 1795)\nthat the Gonds were much larger than the Khonds, and had\nin many instances been made good subjects, while all attempts to\ncivilise the latter had proved ineffectual.\u2021 But as their own princes\nwere unable to make farmers and handicraftsmen of them, it is likely\nthat, even if the Maratha power had not supervened, the mass of\nthe people would have been more and more trodden under and\ndriven back by the pushing Hindu yeomen, whom circumstances\nhad forced between them and their natural chiefs, and that but for\ntheir reputation for bravery, which made them valuable as soldiers,\nthey would have fared little better under princes of their own race\n\n* Report on Nagpur, p. 97 (Edn.

Although their arms altogether failed to save their independence, they had a high military reputation. To quote Blunt again\u2014\"The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s considered them as better soldiers than even the R\u00e1jputs.\"* They were probably employed largely in the military service, for we read in the A'\u00edn-i-Akbar\u00ed that J\u00e1tb\u00e1 of the Deogarh line, which had not then (towards the end of the sixteenth century) quite attained sovereign dignity, kept up an army of 2,000 cavalry, 50,000 infantry, and 100 elephants, and that B\u00e1b\u00e1j\u00ed (Bubjeo) of the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 line maintained a force of 40,000 footmen and 1,000 horsemen.\u2020 The smaller chiefs are also mentioned as retaining large bodies of armed men in their service; so that, allowing also for the retinues of huntsmen and personal retainers supported by all of these forest chiefs, a considerable proportion of the Gond people must have been artificially preserved from the supersession which contact with the Aryan element in the population invariably brought with it. Those who were neither nobles, soldiers, nor huntsmen must have been, as now, mere drudges, and probably lost little by the destruction of their national independence. It was on the chiefs that the levelling Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 sway pressed most heavily. To the feudal organisation, under which their subjection to the paramount authority was but nominal, succeeded a military monarchy which jealously concentrated all power at head-quarters. The loose tribal system, so easy in times of peace, entirely failed to knit together the strength of the people when united action was most required, and the plain country fell before the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 armies almost without a struggle. In the strongholds, however, of the hilly ranges which hem in every part of Gondw\u00e1na, the dispossessed chiefs for long continued to maintain an unequal resistance, and to revenge their own wrongs by indiscriminate rapine and slaughter. The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 system of Government even in its best\u2014\n\n* Asiatic Researches, vol. vii. p. 140.\n\u2020 A'\u00edn-i-Akbar\u00ed, S\u00faba of Ber\u00e1r (Gladwin's Translation) Calcutta Edu. vol. ii. pp. 70, 71.\nthat is in its earliest days\u2014tolerated no powers and honours but those that proceeded direct from the throne, and in the plains and valleys which were accessible to their armies they seem to have succeeded in producing a social dead-level. Blunt says of them that they \"keep their peasantry in the most abject state of dependence, by which means, they allege, the ryots are less liable to be turbulent or offensive to the Government.\"* But it was more difficult to crush out all opposition in the highland fastnesses, in which the malcontents of the subject race had taken refuge, and it does not appear that they ever attained undisturbed supremacy in the hill chiefships. \"The attention of the Slubadars,\" writes Blunt, \"is chiefly directed to levying tributes from the Zamindars in the mountainous parts of the country, who, being always refractory, and never paying anything until much time has been spent in warfare, the result is often precarious, and the tribute consequently trivial.\"\u2020 He also mentions that the Gond Raja of Malliwar threw down and spat upon \"the Maratha parwana (pass), which he sent to him for inspection, saying 'I am not in Nagpur, and I fear nothing from the Raja of Berar'.\"\u2021 In such cases the Maratha plan \u00a7 was to continue pillaging and harassing the Gonds, and thus to obtain from the chiefs a nominal acknowledgment of their supremacy, and the promise at least of an annual tribute.\n\nDemoralisation of the hill Gonds. Under this treatment the hill Gonds soon lost every vestige of humanisation, and became the cruel, treacherous savages that Blunt found them. Those of his followers who, overcome by heat, fatigue, scanty food, bad water, and the other privations of one of the hardest marches on record, lingered behind for a little rest, were cut off and seen no more. The main body, leaving Chunar, had traversed amid many dangers the wild forest-country comprised in the present \"South-Western frontier agency,\" and thence passing through Chhattisgarh and the\n\n---\n\n* Asiatic Researches, vol. vii, p. 110.\n\u2020 Ibid, p. 108.\n\u2021 Ibid, p. 121.\n\u00a7 Ibid, p. 98.\nGond State of Kanker, took to the East, and attempted to make their way through the Trans-Wainganga chiefships of Chand\u00e1 and Bastar. They were, however, obliged to turn back from the Indravati, and seek a safer route through the Teleng country on the opposite or west bank of the Godavari; and the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 A'mil in Dewalmari informed them \"that it was very fortunate they had lost no time in their retreat, for notwithstanding the friendly assurances of the Gond Chief, all his vassals and every neighbouring Gond R\u00e1j\u00e1 had been summoned to co-operate with him for the purpose of plundering and cutting them off.\"* The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 A'mil at Bijur congratulated Captain Blunt on his escape from the mountains and jungles in which \"so many of his people had been lost and never more heard of. Even the Banjar\u00e1s,\"\u2020 he said, \"who never ventured among these Gonds until the most solemn protestations of security were given, had in many instances been plundered.\"\u2021 Such was the temper which the harsh Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 rule had roused in a race of naturally placable savages. When the constant irritation engendered by a system of government strong enough to harass and injure, but not to secure entire subjugation, gave way to the equable discipline established by our Government, these wild marauders soon settled down into rude tillers of the soil; indeed some of the Gond R\u00e1j\u00e1s have gone a step further in civilisation, and after giving up their natural defence of sword and buckler, have become adepts with the more civilised weapons of the law-suit and the usury bond. A remarkable instance of the rapid pacification of a tract once terribly notorious for the character of its inhabitants may be found at Malini, in the Hoshangabad district, whose aboriginal inhabitants, now mere inoffensive drudges, were not half a century ago the most reckless and daring of plunderers, and gained for their forest-haunt the name of \"Chor Malini,\" or \"Malini of the robbers.\" Mr. C.

At present nothing is so remarkable in them as their ready obedience to orders.\" Numerous other quotations might be adduced to the same effect, but there can be no stronger testimony than that of Sir Richard Jenkins, who says of the Gonds:\u2014\"they are sincere, faithful, and intelligent; they are less mendacious than their neighbours, Hind\u00fa or Mohammadan, everywhere; and since our administration we have had no reason to pronounce even the wildest of them, with whom Europeans have had direct intercourse, insensible to good treatment, or unwilling to quit habits of plunder and rapine, imposed upon them by poverty and oppression, for more regular and creditable modes of life.\"\u2020 Unfortunately for the aboriginal tribes they were destined to pass through at least three-quarters of a century of Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 bondage before the day of relief was to come. In the ten years from 1741 to 1751\u2021 the Bhonsl\u00e1 family established its dominion over the three kingdoms of Deogarh, Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1, and Chhattisgarh, and the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 princes of S\u00e1g\u00e1r effected a lodgement in\n\n---\n\n* By Major Henley, Political Agent at Seh\u00f3r.\n\u2020 Report on N\u00e1gpur by Sir R.

Not only did he rack-rent and screw the farming and cultivating classes, but he took advantage of the necessities, which his own acts had created, to lend them money at high interest.\u00a7 He did not even hesitate to play this dangerous game with his troops, whose pay he withheld, lending them money on exorbitant terms through his various banking establishments, and when he paid them at last, giving a third in clothes, from his own stores, at most exaggerated prices. When all other means of making money failed, he organised regular house-breaking expeditions against the stores of men whom his spies had reported to be wealthy, and who \"had declined the honour of becoming His Highness' creditors.\"\u00a7 All through this time the sufferings of the people were aggravated by the ravages of the wandering robber-bands who have obtained such a terrible notoriety under the name of Pindharis.

There is nothing in history more moving than the pictures of the utter desolation which these human locusts left in their track. Their plan of action is thus described by Malcolm\u2020:\n\n\"The Pindh\u00e1ris were neither encumbered by tents nor baggage; each horseman carried a few cakes of bread for his own subsistence, and some feeds of grain for his horse. The party, which usually consisted of two or three thousand good horse, with a proportion of mounted followers, advanced at the rapid rate of forty or fifty miles a day, neither turning to the right nor left till they arrived at their place of destination. They then divided, and made a sweep of all the cattle and property they could find: committing at the same time the most horrid atrocities, and destroying what they could not carry away. They trusted to the secrecy and suddenness of the irruption for avoiding those who guarded the frontiers of the countries they invaded, and before a force could be brought against them they were on their return. Their chief strength lay in their being intangible. If pursued, they made marches of extraordinary length\u2014sometimes upwards of sixty miles\u2014by roads almost impracticable for regular troops. If overtaken, they dispersed, and reassembled at an appointed rendezvous; if followed to the country from which they issued, they broke into small parties. Their wealth, their booty, and their families were scattered over a wide region, in which they found protection amid the mountains and in the fastnesses belonging to\n\n* Sir R.

Their grandfathers were generally Gonds, Kur\u00fas, Bhils, &c., whose children were carried off by the Pindh\u00e1r\u00eds in their raids, circumcised, and made to follow that profession. When the Pindh\u00e1r\u00eds were put down, these men mostly returned to their native villages. They seem almost utterly without religion, not practising the rites of their faith, nor yet those of their families.

Chit\u00fa, the most famous of all the Pindh\u00e1ri leaders, had his head-quarters in the forest tract lying to the north of the Narb\u00e1d\u00e1, which then formed part of the Nim\u00e1rdistrict.* He also held the B\u00e1ra estate in Narsinghp\u00far; and Karim Kh\u00e1n, another influential Pindh\u00e1ri chief, had lands in Paloh\u00e1in the same district.\u2020 Both these chiefs belonged to the Sind\u00eda Sh\u00e1hi division.\n\n* Nim\u00e1rdistrict Settlement Report, para. 86.\n\u2020 Narsinghp\u00far Settlement Report, para. 86.\n\"had been brought together less by despair than by deeming the life\nof a plunderer in the actual state of India as one of small hazard\nbut of great indulgence.\"* When the British Government took it in\nhand to suppress them, their whole organisation crumbled away at\nonce. To quote Malcolm again, \"It was evident that they could not\nexist without a home or a support. To drive them from the terri-\ntories which they possessed,\u2014to identify with them all who gave\nthem aid or protection, was the only mode by which the great and\nincreasing evil could be remedied. No measures were ever more\nwisely planned, more vigorously pursued, or more successfully\naccomplished, than those adopted for their suppression. There\nremains not a spot in India that a Pindh\u00e1ri can call his home.\nThey have been hunted like wild beasts; numbers have been killed;\nall have been ruined. Those who adopted their cause have fallen.\"\u2020\n\nThe real strength of the Pindh\u00e1ris was in the weakness\nof the surrounding Governments. The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 kings had\nmore important things to think of than protecting their subjects\nagainst robbery and murder. Men and\nmoney for their wars were their great\nwants, and the Pindh\u00e1ris could help\nthem in both. Neither the Sind\u00eda nor the Holkar Sh\u00e1hi\nbands of Pindh\u00e1ris kept their hands entirely off the subjects\nof the kings whose name they bore,\u2021 but a sufficient percentage\nof the plunder probably went into the royal treasury; and after\nall, as money was wanted at all hazards, their ways were not\nso very much worse than those of the more regularly licensed\nplunderers who called themselves revenue collectors. Indeed in one\ncase at least on record, the maddened cultivators called in the aid of\nthe Pindh\u00e1ris, preferring the crash of a sudden raid, with all its\nterrible accompaniments of fire and sword, to the slow torture of con-\nstant pressure, or perhaps hoping that, in the general upset, good men\nmight chance to come uppermost. This happened in the Jabalp\u00far\ndistrict in 1809, and the landholders gained their object at first, as\n\n* \"Memoir of Central India,\" vol. i. p. 431 (2nd Edn.)\n\u2020 Ibid, vol. i. p. 461.\n\u2021 Ibid, vol. i. p. 442.\nthe arrival of the Pindh\u00e1ri army so thoroughly frightened the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 governor that he quite forgot for the time to go on with his exactions; but before the plunderers left the country they had made themselves as much felt by their friends as by their foes, \"approaching all they could seize, insulting the temples of the Hind\u00fas, defacing the images, and committing outrages and excesses such as will not readily be forgotten, or the horror excited by them be buried in oblivion.\"*\n\nAll revenue reports of those times teem with accounts of the cruel, but often ingenious, processes by which the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 collectors slowly bled the people. Inconvenient precedents and institutions were of course at once cleared away as mere clogs upon the process of extracting money. The carefully-adapted organisation of village and circle officers which the Moghals, wherever they had come, had grafted on the old feudalism of Gondw\u00e1na, with all its graduated structure of rights and duties, gave way to a system of public auction.\u2020 Villages were put up to the highest bidder, but even he was lucky if he got to the end of the year safe. After passing with alternating hope and fear through the rainy season, and watching his crops safe through the caprices of the elements, some turn in the tide of war or an unexpected robber-raid might destroy all the fruits of the toil and expenditure of months. In the border districts one day Holkar's army would come and sweep the country before it.\n\nThen perhaps Sindia marched down troops to defend his possessions, in which process they pastured their bullocks on the crops, trampled in the water-channels with their elephants, and killed any of his subjects who made objections.

The unfortunate country-people gave up all attempt at protecting themselves against the troops, whether hostile or nominally friendly, and when they heard of an army coming, hid themselves in the glens and the rocks, creeping out by moonlight in a last desperate attempt to cultivate their land.* But then if they tided through these greater catastrophes there was the never-absent danger of predatory inroads from the hill-tribes, or indeed from any one who was strong enough to get up a following.+ To avoid these they clubbed together and paid blackmail, or collected themselves into large villages and built mud fortifications round them, going out armed to their fields many miles off perhaps, and leaving wide tracts of country, in their own expressive phrase, \"be chir\u00e1gh\"\u2014without a light or a village fire. If the crops thus sown in sorrow and tended in fear came to maturity, there were fresh trials to encounter. Sometimes the lease taken at the beginning of the year, and carried through with so much difficulty and anxiety, was unceremoniously\n\n* H o s h a n g \u00e1 b \u00e1 d Settlement Report, chap. ii. para. 27.\n\n\u2020 The following extracts from the epitomised translation of a petition presented by the inhabitants of the K h a n d w \u00e1 p a r g a n a of the N i m \u00e1 r district (quoted in Captain Forsyth's N i m \u00e1 r Settlement Report, p. 83, para. 155) gives a vivid representation of those times, viz. from 1803 to 1814:\n\n\"Robbers and P i n d h \u00e1 r \u00ed s oppress the district and levy blackmail, which the Z a m \u00ed n d \u00e1 r s (chiefs) share with them.

Sometimes the village would be made over by the authorities to troops in arrears\u2020 to pay themselves, no question of course being asked. Sometimes the crop was seized directly by the Government officials without any pretence of form or reason.\n\nIn the districts of the interior, where there was a little less anarchy and confusion, rather more formality was observed in the process of exaction, though with very similar results. Tracts of country were assigned either to large farmers for a fixed sum, or to military leaders for the payment of troops; and as the valuation put upon the leases was always of the highest, the assignee had to exercise all his ingenuity to bring his collections up to the mark. Taught by experience, the cultivators assumed the appearance of poverty, concealed their stock, and hung back from taking farms. But they were always worsted in the long run. Practically they had no choice except to cultivate or to starve, and the assignee soon found out, by means of his spies, who were in the best position to take the leases. On these \"dresses and titles were liberally bestowed, and solemn engagements entered into, at a very moderate rate of rent, which engagements were most assuredly violated at the time of harvest, when the whole produce was at the mercy of the J\u00e1g\u00edrd\u00e1r (assignee) * * Thus he proceeded from year to year, flattering the vanity of the M\u00e1lguz\u00e1rs (farmers) with dresses, titles, and other distinctions, and feeding their hopes with solemn promises, till all their capitals were exhausted.\"\u2021\n\nThere was a little more difficulty in tapping the wealth of bankers and others, whose substance was stored in a form less accessible and prominent than standing crops or flocks, and\n\n* D a m o h Settlement Report, para. 51.\n\u2020 Ibid, para. 50.\n\u2021 MSS. \"Preliminary Observations to the Report on the District of N a r s i n g h p \u00fa r,\" by Sir W. (then Captain) Sleeman, para. 42.\nherds. Even in those times it was not for every one to take the royal road, hit upon by Raghoji III., of going direct to the coveted strong-boxes by means of burglary.* So the notable device was discovered of establishing adultery courts, furnished with guards, fetters, stocks, and a staff of witnesses. When good information was obtained of the existence of a hoard of money, the unfortunate possessor was at once charged and found guilty, and if the disgrace of a crime which was then held to reflect on the whole family of the accused was not sufficient to bring him to reason, he was chained in the stocks till he agreed to pay ransom. In one case the landholders of the Srinagar pargana of Narsinghpur clubbed to free themselves from an incubus of this kind, agreeing to purchase its abolition by an immediate payment of Rs. 45,000, which they raised by a cess of 25 per cent all round on the revenue of their villages. But the only effect of their effort was, that they were presumed to be able to stand another turn of the screw, and the amount which they had managed to raise was thenceforward regularly added to their assessment for future years.\u2020\n\nThe devices for levying money with a show of legality in towns and populous non-agricultural tracts show almost endless ingenuity, though some of them were such flimsy veils for exaction that it is difficult to imagine why the pretence of form should have been kept up at all. Thus the provisional government appointed at Jabalpur to carry on the administration of the newly-annexed Narbad\u00e1 country (1817) was called upon by its Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 officials to decide, among other questions,\u2014whether widows should still be sold for the benefit of the State,\u2014whether one-fourth of the proceeds of all house sales should continue to be paid into the treasury,\u2014and whether persons selling their daughters should not still be taxed one-fourth of the price realised. At a meeting of the same provisional government there is an entry ordering the release of a woman named Pursi\u00e1, who had been sold by auction a few\n\n* See above, p. xciii.\n\u2020 Sleeman's MSS. \"Preliminary Observations,\" para. 44.\ndays before for seventeen rupees.* The taxes levied in different places varied with the idiosyncrasies of the Government, or of the individual tax-collector; but among them it may be noticed that people were mulcted for having houses to live in, or if they had no houses, for their temporary sheds or huts; if they ate grain, their food was taxed at every stage in its progress through the country; if they ate meat, they paid duty on it through their butchers. When they married, they paid for beating drums or putting up marquees. If they rejoiced at the set Hind\u00fa festivals, they paid again,\u2014at the \"Holi,\" for instance, on the red powder which they threw at each other, at the Pol\u00e1, on the ornaments which they tied to the horns of their cattle. Drinkers were mulcted by an excise, and smokers by a tobacco duty. Weavers, oil-pressers, fishermen, and such low-caste industrials had as a matter of course to bear a special burthen. No houses or slaves or cattle could be sold\u2014no cloth could be stamped\u2014no money could be changed,\u2014even prayers for rain could not be offered without paying on each operation its special and peculiar tax.\u2020 In short a poor man could not shelter himself, or clothe himself, or earn his bread, or eat it, or marry, or rejoice, or even ask his gods for better weather, without contributing separately on each individual act to the necessities of the State.\n\nThese were the regular taxes merely, and it certainly does not seem likely that any money could have slipped by owing to their want of comprehensiveness; but the revenue accounts of the times show that supplementary measures were occasionally found necessary to reach men who would otherwise have escaped.

The more extensive the devastation of the crops, and the greater the diminution of the means and number of the cultivators, the higher rose the price of the grain produced by the rest; and even a Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 army could not get its supplies entirely free from a country which it permanently garrisoned. Thus great sums of money were set in circulation among the people, while the number of pockets to fill and mouths to feed was much reduced. The sums spent on military establishments alone in the Narsinghp\u00far district averaged nearly nine l\u00e1khs of rupees (\u00a390,000) for the ten years previous to the cession, while after our occupation of the country the expenditure on all public establishments rapidly fell to less than two l\u00e1khs (\u00a320,000).* But this process of stimulation, though it might avert for a time the day of exhaustion, only rendered it the more complete in the end.\n\nExhaustion of the country. All accounts concur in representing the condition of the once-flourishing Narb\u00e1d\u00e1 districts, which we acquired by the war of 1817-18, as desolate almost beyond conception. An old map of Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d in the Bengal Asiatic Society's Journal for 1834 (p. 70) shows all the Soh\u00e1gp\u00far valley as waste and jungle.\u2020 At the recent settlement (1863-64) nearly two-thirds of the culturable area, including all the good land, were cultivated, chiefly with wheat. Of parts of Nim\u00e1r it was reported in 1819 that \"all traces of former cultivation had ceased to be perceptible, and, with the exception of K\u00e1n\u00e1p\u00far, not a dwelling or an inhabitant was to be seen in any part of the country.\"\u2021 Their desolation was expressed even\n\n* Sleeman's MSS.

Sleeman says that for two years, \"by far the most laborious of his life,\" his whole attention was engrossed \"in preventing and remedying the disorders of his district.\"* Had all the colleagues this distinguished officer possessed as large a share of his clear insight, as they undoubtedly had of his sense of his duty, the history of our new acquisitions might have been an almost unbroken record of prosperity, and the ground which it has taken fifty years of often halting progression to gain might have been covered in a quarter of a century. The new administrators of the country\u2014taken many of them from the ranks of the very regiments which had conquered it\u2014found a rich soil, a docile peasantry, and an equable climate. They saw that under the rule introduced by them life and property were safe, that Courts of Justice tried to deserve their name, and that the people had at length breathing time; and they jumped to the conclusion that a country with such capacities needed but a well-meaning government to enter upon a golden era of limitless prosperity.\n\nUnfortunately, though the world may be generally governed with very little wisdom, there are times when something more than rule of thumb is required to secure success. It has been a common enough mistake among sanguine young officials, prompted perhaps by the wish to satisfy their distant financial superiors, to overrate the vivifying powers of our rule, and to estimate its material value to the people by the measure of its moral advantages. In the present instance the illusion was fostered by the readiness with which farmers flocked forward to take village leases, some themselves sharing the hopes of their rulers, but the majority mere broken speculators,\u2020 who had found land-gambling a paying trade in the \"time of trouble,\" and who took advantage of a change of Government to start again with refreshed characters. Thus misled, the district officers might, perhaps, be excused for forgetting that for the barbaric pomp of\n\n* MSS.

The result was, that with all our good intentions, the commencements of our rule were marked by most vigorous taxation, and the people found less cause to congratulate themselves than they had expected in their change of masters. They were no longer robbed and murdered, it is true, but then they were equally prevented from redressing the inequalities of fortune by robbing and murdering others; and while under native rule the greater the disorganisation, the greater was the hope of a general crash and change, the new r\u00e9gime, with its heavy uniform pressure, seemed too systematic to leave room for evasion\u2014to strong to allow even the idea of opposition. The excess of the evil, however, in most cases worked its own cure, and by degrees, after conjecture had been exhausted in seeking causes for the difficulties of the people, the conviction began to gain ground that the fault lay not so much with them as with their masters. Within twenty years from the cession an era of material prosperity had set in for many districts, the effects of which, as shown at the recent land-revenue-settlement, need give us no cause to be ashamed of our stewardship. Some parts of the country have lagged behind others, but our older acquisitions in the Central Provinces may now confidently be ranked among the most prosperous of British Indian possessions.\n\nTo these were added in 1854 the last remaining provinces of the Bhonsl\u0101\u2014N\u00e1gpur and Chhattisgarh, which, having already enjoyed some degree of British protection, directly, during the last R\u00e1j\u00e1's minority, and, indirectly, after his assumption of power, through the influence of the Resident, had comparatively little lee-way to make up. They have since benefited greatly by the enhanced price of produce, and the improvement of communications.\n\nIn 1860 a strip of territory on the left bank of the River God\u00e1var\u00ed was ceded by the Niz\u00e1m, and incorporated in the\nBritish possessions under the name of the \"Upper God\u00e1var\u00ed District.\"\n\nIn the following year (1861) the \"Central Provinces\" were formed by the union of the S\u00e1g\u00e1r and Narb\u00e1d\u00e1 territories with the N\u00e1gp\u00far Province. Three years afterwards (in 1864) the new administration obtained an accession of territory by the addition to it of the Nim\u00e1\u0301r district, in the Narb\u00e1d\u00e1 and Tapt\u00ed valleys, and in 1865 it received a fresh accretion of some seven hundred square miles of country, which had formerly constituted the native State of Bij\u00e9r\u00e1ghog\u00e1rh in Central India, but had been confiscated in 1857. This is neither the time nor the place to put forward speculations regarding the advantages which long-neglected Gondw\u00e1na may have derived from the concession to her of an administration of her own, with no rich, smooth home-domain to distract its attention from these far out-lying stretches of rugged hill and valley, but in the succeeding chapters details will be given regarding the population, trade, and present condition of the province, which may enable those interested in the question to form a judgment of their own.\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nPOPULATION.\n\nAboriginal section of the population\u2014Dravidians and Kolarians\u2014Gond legends\u2014Gond character and status\u2014The R\u00e1j-Gonds\u2014The Dh\u00far-Gonds\u2014The M\u00e1r\u00eds\u2014The Baig\u00e1s\u2014The Bh\u00edls\u2014The Kurk\u00fas\u2014Difficulty of civilising the aborigines\u2014The Kanwars\u2014The Halb\u00e1s\u2014Aboriginal beliefs and ceremonies\u2014Aryan races\u2014Aryan colonisation\u2014Changed manners\u2014Satn\u00e1m\u00ed Chamar\u2014Witchcraft\u2014Punishment of witches\u2014Prevalent Hind\u00fa castes.\n\nThe Central Provinces have been aptly compared to a \"thick bit of cover in the middle of open country\"\u2014a thicket in which, \"when the plains all round have been swept by hunters, or cleared\n\"by colonists, you are sure to find all the wild animals that have not been exterminated.\"* But even this\u2014 one of the last refuges of the aboriginal races\u2014has been so largely invaded by people of Aryan descent, that out of a total population amounting in round numbers to nine millions of souls, two millions only are classed under the head of hill and aboriginal tribes, three-fourths of whom are Gonds. Whether the ordinarily accepted theory be true, that the less perfectly developed races were expelled from the rich valleys by people possessing a higher organisation, and were forced to content themselves with the scanty produce of the bare hill-sides, or whether, as some suppose,\u2020 the aborigines\u2014hunters by taste rather than agriculturists\u2014never cared to make head against the heavy tropical vegetation of the black soil bottoms, the result is equally that the Gond has retained nothing of the old heritage which still bears his name, except the rocky uplands on which a less hardy race would find no sufficient sustenance. The chief remaining aboriginal stronghold is the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1 plateau, divided among the districts of Bet\u00fal, Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1, Seoni, and the higher half of Mandla. Commencing from the west, one-fourth of the population of Bet\u00fal is Gond; in Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 the proportion is as high as three-sevenths; in Seoni, which is traversed by the main line of communication through the plateau, it sinks to one-third, rising again to one-half in the wild hill district of Mandla, where the last Gond kings held sway. To the east and west of this region hill-races of a different stock press in upon the Gonds. In Bet\u00fal and Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d may be found the Kurk\u00fas, numbering in all some 40,000 souls, whose central seat is the Pachmarhi group of hills. Further west again in the Nim\u00e1r district we come into the Bh\u00edl country, but even including a few scattered colonies of this race in other parts of the province, they only contribute some 25,000 to the population.\n\n* Report of Central Provinces' Ethnological Committee (1868), Introductory chapter, p. 2.\n\n\u2020 Captain Forsyth's Nim\u00e1r Settlement Report, para. 110.\nTo the east the natural fastnesses which hem in the head waters of the Son and the Narbada\u2014unexplored until of late years by Europeans\u2014give a secure shelter to the wildest of all the hill tribes\u2014the Baig\u00e1s\u2014who, all told, are under 17,000 souls. The first two of these almost certainly belong to that group of aboriginal tribes which is designated by Mr. G. Campbell as \"Kolarian\"* or northern, to distinguish them from the Dravidian or southern races; and the Baig\u00e1s also are conjecturally classed with the former by the Central Provinces' Ethnological Committee.\n\nThus the heart of Gondw\u00e1na is still occupied in force by the Gonds, who, according to the authorities already quoted, belong to the great Dravidian or southern section of the aborigines, while scattered fragments of the weaker Kolarian races, which have never risen to independent sovereignty, find refuge here and there on its outskirts. The great southern wilderness\u2014covering many thousand square miles between the plains of Chhatt\u00edsgarh and the God\u00e1var\u00ed, and extending from the Waingang\u00e1 on the west almost to the Eastern Gh\u00e1ts\u2014is another Gond stronghold. In these unexplored regions are to be found probably the best specimens of the real wild Gond, who shuns the sight of strangers, and between whom and his rulers communication is only maintained through a sort of quarantine,\u2020 his tribute being deposited in a fixed spot, whence the R\u00e1j\u00e1's officers come to take it at certain seasons. Kolarian colonies, in addition to those already mentioned, may be found intermixed, in almost every direction, with the tribes of Gond descent. The east and west have already been mentioned. To the extreme north in the hill country bordering on\n\n* Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, vol. xxxv. part ii.

Their tribute to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of B\u00e1s\u00e1r, which is paid in kind, is collected once a year by an officer who beats a t\u00e1m-t\u00e1m outside the village, and forthwith hides himself, whereupon the inhabitants bring out whatever they have to give, and deposit it in an appointed spot.\"\u2014(Hislop's Aboriginal Tribes of the Central Provinces, part i. p. 8, 1856.)\nRew\u00e1 are some 25,000 Kols. To the south-east in Sambalp\u00far there is a large colony of Dh\u00e1ngars, apparently belonging to the Kol stock from Chot\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur; while still further south, in the eastern part of the Bastar dependency, are found the Gad-b\u00e1s, another Kolarian tribe. But even at these extremities of their country the Gonds and their congeners out-number other aboriginal tribes.\n\nMr. Hislop thinks that, from this curious intermixture within a limited area of tribes of totally different stock, we may conclude that the Dravidians, entering India by the north-west, here crossed the stream of Kolarian immigrants from the north-east.* These are matters of which so little is known that there is barely groundwork even for speculation about them; but the aboriginal legends contain one or two curious traditions, which, in the absence of any certain information, may be worth mention. In one of the Gond hymns quoted by Mr. Hislop a legendary account of the origin of the tribe is given, which, though defaced by some interpolations, palpably due to Brahmanical influence, is as evidently aboriginal in its incidents and conception. It purports to relate how the Gonds were created, on or near mount Dhalagiri (in the Himalayas); how they displeased the gods and were shut up in a cave, four only escaping through a jungle-country to a place called Kachikop\u00e1 Lohagarh, or the \"Iron valley in the Red Hills\"\u2014a name sufficiently applicable to many parts of Gondw\u00e1na; how here they found a giant, who was at first inclined to eat them, but becoming pacified gave them his daughters in marriage, and from this union sprang the present Gond race.\u00a7 If any faith can be placed in the antiquity of this legend it would certainly\n\n* Hislop's Aboriginal Tribes of the Central Provinces, edited by Sir R. Temple part i. p. 27.\n\u2020 Ibid, part iii. pp. 3\u20146.\n\u2021 Ibid, part iii. pp. 17, 27.\nseem to imply that the Gonds found their country already occupied when they entered it, and that they allied themselves with their precursors. Another Gond tradition runs, that when Sarj\u00e1 Ball\u00e1l Sinha, the tenth of the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 royal line, by services rendered, had established his right to ask a favour from the Delhi Emperor, he claimed, as an addition to his kingdom, all the possessions of his ancestor \"Kol-Bh\u00edl.\"* Whether this may be taken as indicating that the predecessors of the Gonds were tribes of Kolarian descent, or not, it is at least curious that the Gonds, who ordinarily assume themselves to have been lords of the soil from time immemorial, should in any of their legends base their pretensions on a succession from rival claimants so well known as the Kols and the Bh\u00edls. Another branch of the Kolarians, the Baig\u00e1s of Mandla, are apparently admitted by the Gond to be autochthonous, being known and reverenced among the surrounding population, which is chiefly Gond, as \"Bh\u00fami\u00e1s,\"\u2020 or children of the soil, and worshipping \"M\u00e1i Dharitr\u00ed,\" mother earth.\u00a7 The legend first quoted also shadows out, it will be observed, the idea of a direct northern origin for the Gonds, in accordance with Mr. Hislop's theory. Their own reminiscences certainly seem to point direct to the north as the cradle of their race, for till lately they buried their dead, head to south, feet to north, in order that the corpse might be ready to be carried to the northern home of its people.\u00a7\n\nWhichever of the two races can claim the priority in order of time, the Dravidian Gonds undoubtedly succeed the Kolarians in order of development. The leaders of the latter\u2014in this part of the country at any rate\u2014never rose above the status of predatory chiefs, while the Gond princes founded kingdoms, received high titles of nobility from the Moghal Emperors,|| and even in their decadence were\n\n* Major L.

While the Baig\u00e1s in their isolation from Aryan contact retain the free spirit and honesty of the savage, the Gonds have sunk, in a rash competition with the stronger race, to the level of mere drudges. Though almost everywhere intermixed with the Hind\u00fa population, and sometimes so closely as to have almost lost the flat head, the squat nose, and the thick lips, which are the facial characteristics of their race, it is only in the wilder and less populated districts that the ordinary Gonds have retained any share in the ownership of the soil. Throughout the Narbad\u00e1 valley and the N\u00e1gpur plain scarcely a village is held by a pure Gond, and in Chhattisgarh their possessions, though still pretty considerable in extent, mostly lie in jungle tracts of little value.\u2020 The proprietary lists show, it is true, Gond owners even in the richest districts, but these are not of the true non-Aryan blood, but half-bred chiefs, generally claiming R\u00e1jput ancestry. Such was the origin of the royal line of Garh\u00e1-Mandla, and probably of most of the families which now call themselves \u201cR\u00e1j-Gond\u201d or \u201cRoyal Gond.\u201d If so, however, the lower blood is dominant, for in appearance most of them obstinately retain the Turanian type. In aspiration they are Hind\u00fas of the Hind\u00fas, wearing the sacred cord, and carrying ceremonial refinements to the highest pitch of parvenu purism. Hislop\u2021 says that, not content with purifying themselves, their houses, and their food, they must even sprinkle their faggots with water before using them for cooking. With all this exterior coating of the fashionable faith, they seem, however, to retain an ineradicable taint of the old\n\n* Raghoji I. took possession of the Deogarh kingdom, as Protector, or Mayor of the Palace only, maintaining the Gond R\u00e1j\u00e1 as titular sovereign\u2014(see below, article N\u00e1gpur, p. 303).\n\n\u2020 In R\u00e1ipur the average revenue of the 294 villages held by Gonds is under Rs. 90.

Some of these outwardly Brahmanised chiefs still try to pacify the gods of their fathers for their apparent desertion of them by worshipping them in secret once every four or five years,* and by placing cow's flesh to their lips, wrapped in a cloth, so as not to break too openly with the reigning Hind\u00fa divinities. The annual sacrifice of cows to Phars\u00e1 Pen, the great god of the Gonds, was not given up by the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 kings until the reign of B\u00eer Sh\u00e1h, the last of the line but two, who reigned at the close of the seventeenth century, though the Brahmanic faith seems to have been ostensibly adopted by his ancestors four generations before.\u2020\n\nAmong the Chhatt\u00edsgarh Gonds there are to this day faint lingering traces of the prehistoric serpent-worship, which is said to have retained a hold on the Deogarh kings even after their nominal conversion to Isl\u00e1m.\u2021 In the social habits of the Gond chiefs there is the same curious compromise between the wild savagery of the hill-man and the sleek smoothness of the modern Hind\u00fa, that is observable in their profession of faith. Nearly all of them retain the old love of hunting; and the taste for thieving, or rather for the encouragement of thieves, still runs in the blood, though with a class, ambitious of recognised gentility, the prospect of anything so vulgar as a jail life has undoubtedly a very cooling effect. On the other hand they surround themselves with Hind\u00fa priests and agents, and some of them have even taken to turning an honest penny by the thoroughly Hind\u00fa pursuit of money-lending. There is an immense gap between the sensual, Pharisaical half-breed chief and the down-trodden mass of the Gond race. The former has still the prestige of long descent and great possessions to support him against the race-prejudices of the Hind\u00fas. A struggling Hind\u00fa cultivator, whatever may be his claims to superiority in the abstract, would be very unlike the rest of the world if he could so thoroughly divest himself of material considerations as to look\n\n* Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d Settlement Report, chap. iii. sec. 2, para. 29.\n\u2020 See below, article \"Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1,\" p. 143.\n\u2021 See above, p. lxvi.\ndown on the man upon whom he and hundreds of his tribe depend, not only for the land which they till, but often for the advances necessary to keep body and soul together until harvest time. Seeing, too, that the purest of his race do not scruple to serve the aboriginal chief as priests, agents, and even as cooks, he must feel that he has quite sufficient warrant for respecting power and place, without inquiring too nicely in whom they are vested.\n\nBut the plebeian or Dh\u00far-Gond, with no artificial aids to keep his head above water, has sunk to the very bottom of the community. Of his natural recommendations, the savage straightforwardness of speech has suffered somewhat from social depression and enervating contact with Hinduism, but the stalwart limbs and contempt of fear, which are the characteristics of the race, still survive, and render Gonds useful tools in employments requiring strength and courage rather than intelligence. In the Narb\u00e1d\u00e1 valley the regular and avowed calling of the tame Gonds is driving the plough, but it is well known that unscrupulous masters often use them in thieving expeditions, for which they are fitted, as well by the attributes already mentioned as by a perfectly unreasoning docility. These qualities have been more legitimately utilised in the Mohp\u00e1n\u00ed coal-mines, where a considerable number of the miners are Gonds, and even for military purposes\u2014a Gond battalion having been raised for service in the critical times of 1857-58;\u2014but though not wanting in courage and coolness, they were found scarcely capable of taking a sufficiently high polish of discipline and order. The exact position which these Gonds occupy in the social scale is ordinarily below the lowest of the recognised Hind\u00fa tribes, but above the Mh\u00e1rs and Dhers, who, though not known to be of aboriginal descent, are equally denied admission within the pale of genuine Hinduism, and thus have no caste except among themselves. But although beneath the depth to which he has sunk there is a lower deep still, the tame Gond is so low in Hind\u00fa estimation that the huts of his people are almost always clustered apart from the better habitations in the villages of the valley.\nIn the highlands, where the Hind\u00fas do not care to penetrate, the Gonds are seen to better advantage. On the range of hills north of Ellichp\u00far (in Ber\u00e1r), where they come into contact with other aboriginal races, instead of accepting a subordinate position, they take the lead, generally becoming the patels or headmen of their villages.* Writing of this class in 1825, \"Sleeman says,\u2020 \"Such is the simplicity and honesty of character of the wildest of these Gonds, that when they have agreed to a Jama, they will pay it, though they sell their children to do so, and will also pay it at the precise time that they agreed to. They are dishonest only in direct theft, and few of them will refuse to take another man's property when a fair occasion offers, but they will immediately acknowledge it. They consider as a matter of course all the better kind of crops they till to go exclusively to pay the Government rent, and of that they dare not appropriate any part. The Kodo and Kutki, or coarser grains, they eat or sell, with some jungle fruit, to provide themselves the salt they require, and the very little cloth they use to cover their nakedness.\"\n\nThese particulars are quite confirmed by more modern observers, though since Sleeman's time civilisation has extended its, to them injurious, influence over a constantly increasing section of the really wild Gonds. The best specimens of them now remaining are in the feudatory State of Bastar, lying to the extreme south of the province. In this ill-explored wilderness of hill and forest at least four-fifths of the population may probably be classed under the head of Gonds and their allied races. Hitherto there seems to have been no very hard and fast line between these different subdivisions, rising from the M\u00e1r\u00eds or the M\u00e1ri\u00e1s, the wildest of all, to the semi-Hinduised Khatolw\u00e1rs and R\u00e1j-Gonds. In Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1, where the forest-country meets the more civilised plain, the higher classes of Gonds are recruited from\n\n\u2020 Hislop's Aboriginal Tribes of the Central Provinces, part i. p. 13.\n* MSS. Notes on Mr. Molony's Report on Narsinghp\u00far, note 2.\nthe wilder tribes, and it is said that the process of transformation may be observed in actual operation, the M\u00e1r\u00ed\u00e1 first calling himself \"Koit\u00far,\" then \"Jangli\" or \"Forest Gond,\" and lastly shaking off the prefix and designating himself \"Gond\"\u2014pure and simple.* A little more and he might sublimate himself into the Khatolw\u00e1r or Khatuly\u00e1 class, under which are enrolled all of this family who \"have begun to conform to the Hind\u00fa religion and to ape Hind\u00fa manners,\"\u2020 except of course the R\u00e1j-Gonds, who claim a higher lineage.\n\nA very interesting account of the M\u00e1r\u00ed\u00e1s will be found below under the heading \"Bastar.\"\u2021 The writer, Captain Glasfurd, describes them as a \"shy race, avoiding all contact with strangers, and flying to the hills on the least alarm.\" He adds that they are timid, docile, and \"not quarrelsome\u2014indeed amongst themselves most cheerful and light-hearted, always laughing and joking.\" * * * * In common with many other wild races they bear a singular character \"for truthfulness and honesty; and when they once get over the feeling of shyness, they are exceedingly frank and communicative.\" Of the same class, but even wilder, are the M\u00e1r\u00ed\u00e1s, who inhabit the difficult country called Mad\u00edan, or Abajm\u00e1rd. The whole population will fly at the sight of any number of strangers approaching their village, and the appearance of a horse is a perfect terror to them. It is not, moreover, very easy to find their habitations, which are constantly shifting. Revenue is collected from them through an official called a \"Ch\u00e1lki,\" who makes it his business to know where the villages are to be found; and such other communication as they have with the outer world is carried on through the medium of the cultivators of a frontier village, who alone find it worth while to venture into so rough a country for a poor trade in cloth, beads, and salt, paid for in coarse grain and wax. The M\u00e1r\u00ed\u00e1s possess no cattle of any kind, and their only implements of\n\n* See below, p. 137 (article \"Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1\").\n\u2020 Hislop's Aboriginal Tribes of the Central Provinces, part i. p. 5.\n\u2021 See below (article \"Bastar\"), pp. 34\u201436.\nagriculture are a hatchet and an iron hoe. Like the M\u00e1ri\u00e1s, they seem quiet, truthful, and honest, and though timid they are readily reassured by kind treatment.\n\nPutting aside, therefore, their distaste to strangers and to fresh water, they appear to be harmless, well-dispositioned nomads, with little of the sensational barbarism which has been attributed to them. It has been seen that in Sir Richard Jenkins' time they were represented as naked savages, living on roots and sprigs, and hunting for strangers to sacrifice.* Even in the far more recent work of Mr. Hislop the M\u00e1ri\u00e1 women are said to wear nothing but bunches of twigs, fastened to a string passing round their waists.\u2020 The least-clothed M\u00e1ri\u00e1s seen by Captain Glasfurd wore a square patch of cloth, suspended as the twigs are supposed to have been, and he describes even the wildest of them as raising grain for their food, and smoking tobacco grown by themselves. It is difficult to imagine that a race, whom a strange face now puts to flight, should ever have laid themselves out systematically to seek foreign victims, and it seems far more probable that these old marvels arose in city gossip, originated, perhaps, by some Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 official knowing nothing of Bastar but its distance and poverty, and hoping devoutly that unkind fate would never lead him to know more.\n\nAs the M\u00e1ri\u00e1s are the most characteristic section of the Dravidian races in these provinces, so the Baig\u00e1s may be taken as presenting the most strongly marked individuality among the Kolarian aborigines. An excellent account of them will be found below under the heading \"Mandla,\"\u2021 by Captain H. C. E. Ward, who has, during the last few years, devoted considerable time and interest to studying their habits. Though their associations and their religious ceremonies have stamped them in the general opinion as a non-Aryan race, they have qualities, both physical and moral, which give\n\n* See above p. xii.; also Sir R. Jenkins' Report on N\u00e1gpur (Edn. N\u00e1gpur Antiquarian Society,) p. 23.\n\u2020 Hislop's Aboriginal Tribes of the Central Provinces, part. i. p. 8.\n\u2021 See below (article \"Mandla),\" pp. 278\u2014280.\nthem a distinct pre-eminence among their fellow-denizens of the woods and hills. The purest of the race in the Eastern Forests of Mandla approach in feature to the aquiline Aryan type, and as a rule they are above the Gonds in stature. In character not only do they possess in a very high degree the savage virtues of truth and free-bearing, but they show a power of combination and independent organisation very rare among savage tribes. Writing in 1869 Captain Ward was able to record that for three years not one of these wild Baig\u00e1s had troubled the district courts of justice. All offences and disputes are referred by them to the village tribunal, consisting of a committee of elders, which also manages, with considerable system and success, the internal affairs of the communities. Crime is, however, rare, except it be the appropriation of a stray handful of grain in times of scarcity, or an occasional forgetfulness of the marriage-tie, neither of which are regarded as very heinous offences, or severely visited by the representatives of public opinion. Though their method of cultivation, by burning down the forest and sowing seed in the ash, is wasteful and precarious, it is not adopted so much from idleness as from the unsuitability of regular husbandry to the steep hill-sides and thick forests, in which alone the Baig\u00e1s find a congenial solitude. Indeed at the sowing season, when occasion demands it, they show themselves capable of enduring protracted labour and considerable privation, though these qualities are more generally displayed in the chase, of which they are passionately fond. With their light axes they bring down unerringly small deer, hares, and peacocks, and sometimes even panthers thus fall victims to their skill. Though they are wonderfully nimble in evading beasts of prey, they will not hesitate to attack tigers if it is to save a comrade, and even their dogs are so thoroughly familiarised with these conflicts, that a case is known of a tiger having been turned from its human prey by the attacks of a puny-looking Baig\u00e1 cur. Whether it be from this superiority in mental and physical qualities, or from some lingering tradition of their exalted descent, the Baig\u00e1s are the accepted priests of other aboriginal races,\nand their decisions, especially in boundary cases, command most implicit respect throughout the hill country. Their peculiar powers are supposed to lie in the removal of disease, and the pacification of disturbed spirits. No hill-man will go near the spot where a comrade has been killed by a tiger till the Baig\u00e1 has performed his rites, both to lay the spirit of the dead, and to counteract the increased power which the tiger is believed to absorb from his victim. The process is very simple. The Baig\u00e1 goes through a series of antics, supposed to represent the tiger in his fatal spring, and ends by taking up with his teeth a mouthful of the blood-stained earth. When this is done the jungle is free again, and there really may be thus much genuineness in the remedy, that if the tiger were still hanging about the spot he would probably commence upon the Baig\u00e1, who thus acts as a kind of forlorn-hope in meeting the first brunt of danger. His power of combating disease commands even a wider acceptance, being admitted and courted by the Hind\u00fa population of the adjoining lowlands. When cholera breaks out in a village, every one retires after sunset, and the Baig\u00e1s parade the streets, taking from the roof of each hut a straw, which are burnt, with an offering of rice, clarified butter, and turmeric, at some shrine to the east of the village site. Chickens daubed with vermilion are then driven away in the direction of the smoke, and are supposed to carry the disease with them. If they fail, goats are tried, and last of all pigs, which never disappoint expectation, the reason being, according to Captain Ward, that by the time their turn has come, owing to the delay incurred in repeated ceremonies, and in getting up subscriptions to pay for them, the epidemic outbreak has ordinarily worked itself out.\n\nThe Baig\u00e1s are said to resemble in many respects the undoubtedly Kolarian Bh\u00edls, whose headquarters are in the Vindhyan range, some four hundred miles west of the Baig\u00e1 forests; but there are some striking differences between the habits of the two tribes. The Baig\u00e1s, as has been seen, have easy notions about the marriage tie, and build their villages in a very gregarious fashion. The\nBhils are, on the contrary, very jealous of the honour of the other sex, and very doubtful of the continence of their own; they therefore guard against accidents by keeping their houses far apart.* In moral character, however, the Bhils seem to be certainly below their brother aborigines. Whether it be owing to a naturally intractable disposition, or to the temptations offered by their central position throughout the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 and Pindh\u00e1ri wars of the \"time of trouble,\" they were certainly more determined marauders than any other of the hill races, till Outram took them in hand. Those of them who cultivate are now said to be scrupulous in keeping their engagements, and instances are quoted of their rising to the position of steady and substantial farmers. The Bhil\u00e1l\u00e1s\u2014who are apparently lowland Bhils, calling themselves after their Bhil R\u00e1jput chiefs, just as in Scotland the name of a powerful sept was sometimes taken by subordinated races\u2014are the dregs even of the tame aborigines, being proverbial for dishonesty and drunkenness. The Mohammadan Bhils are another instance of the ill-effects which the strong meat of civilisation has upon primitive races ill-prepared to receive it. They retain nothing of what should have been to them an elevating faith but its most elementary rites, and are, \"with few exceptions, a miserable \"set, idle and thriftless, and steeped in the deadly vice of opium-eating.\"\u2020\n\nThe Kurk\u00fas again, who live on and round the Mah\u00e1deo hills, conform more nearly to the ordinary aboriginal type. They are mostly black, with flat faces and high cheek-bones, so that it is difficult to distinguish them from the Gonds in appearance.\u00a7 Like most of these hill races and unlike the Bhils, they are not prejudiced about feminine chastity, and \"there seems to be almost no possible form of illegitimacy so long as a Kurk\u00fa man or woman consort\n\n* Captain Ward's Mandla Settlement Report, Note on Gonds and Baig\u00e1s, para. 19.\n\u2020 Captain Forsyth's Nim\u00e1r Settlement Report, paras. 410, 411.\n\u00a7 Mr. C. A. Elliott's Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d Settlement Report, Appendix i. para. 3.\n\"only with their own race.\"* But they have the virtues, as well as the failings, of their kind. \"They are remarkably honest and truthful; slow at calculation * * * very indignant at being cheated. * * * Though too improvident and lazy to be good cultivators, they are in great request as farm-servants and ploughmen, being too honest to defraud their master of labour or material.\"\u2020\n\nEverything thus tends to show that civilisation, in the only form in which he as yet knows it, is the most fatal of all influences to the semi-savage aboriginal. He tries to match with the Hind\u00fa in cunning, and loses his simple-minded honesty without gaining a step in the race of life. He learns a more careful method of cultivation, but only to exercise it as the tool of the superior intelligence by which he has been instructed. His brute-courage survives, but it only serves him to become a cat's-paw in dark enterprises, which bring profit to his master,\u2014to him risk and demoralisation. In this dull helot life the spirit of the hill-man, who in his own wilds knew no restraint but the easy sway of vague supernatural powers, becomes cribbed and confined, the constant sense of inferiority wears away his self-confidence, and he sinks to the condition of a mere besotted animal. Thus the natural lever of association with those immediately above him having proved worse than ineffectual, it becomes a difficult problem indeed to raise his tastes and aspirations. If he is too far behind the Hind\u00fa to enter into competition with him successfully, it may be that the only means of fitting him to hold his own would be to develop his character and strengthen his abilities in isolation from deteriorating influences. There are malarious localities in which the physical qualities of the hill-men should give them almost a monopoly of employment; and efforts are now being made to induce members of the aboriginal tribes to serve in the police of the wilder districts, and to\n\n---\n\n* Mr. C. A. Elliott's Hoshangabad Settlement Report, Appendix i. para. 30.\n\u2020 Ibid, para. 4.\ntake employment as watchers and woodmen in the Government forests. The attempts to educate them at the Government schools have hitherto necessarily been mere beginnings, but they have not been so fruitless as to discourage hope, and a scheme is on foot for establishing aboriginal schools in connection with the Forest Department, which promises greater results. In the forests of Mandla, where land is plentiful, and malaria keeps competitors at a distance, the education of the wandering Baig\u00e1s has commenced at an even earlier stage; and it may be hoped that the measures devised for confining them within fixed though liberal limits, and thus turning them from the chase to agriculture, will in time bear fruit.\n\nAltogether the Ethnological Committee compute that there are twenty-three certain and six doubtful aboriginal races in the Central Provinces. Of the former thirteen are classed as Kolarian and ten as Dravidian, while under the head \"doubtful\" each division contributes three.* It is, however, likely that some of the designations given as generic merely mark subdivisions of the same race,+ and that others belong to tribes who, though generally considered aboriginal, are of doubtful origin. Thus it seems\n\n* Report of Ethnological Committee of the Central Provinces (1858), Introductory chapter, p. 7:\n\n| Kolarian. | Dravidian. |\n|-----------|------------|\n| Kol.      | Gond.      |\n| Kurk\u00fa.    | Bhatr\u00e1-Gond. |\n| Bh\u00edl.     | M\u00e1ri-Gond. |\n| Binjw\u00e1r.  | M\u00e1ri\u00e1 or Gottaw\u00e1r. |\n| Bhunjy\u00e1.  | Dhurwe-Gond. |\n| Bh\u00famfa.   | Khatolw\u00e1r-Gond. |\n| Baig\u00e1.    | Aghari\u00e1-Gond. |\n| Dh\u00e1ngar.  | Halb\u00e1. |\n| Gadb\u00e1.    | Ko\u00ed. |\n| Kanwar.   | Khond. |\n| N\u00e1har.    | Dhanw\u00e1r. |\n| M\u00e1nj\u00ed.    | N\u00e1hil. |\n| M\u00e1hto.    | Pank\u00e1. |\n\n\u2020 Thus Binjw\u00e1rs are a subdivision of the Baig\u00e1s.\ndoubtful whether the Kanwars\u2014a curious primitive race who hold the greater part of the hill country overlooking the Chhattisgarh country\u2014are not of Aryan stock. It is certain that one of their chiefs\u2014the Zamindar of Narr\u00e1\u2014obtained his estate some one hundred and fifty years ago as a marriage dowry with the daughter of the R\u00e1jput chief of Khari\u00e1r. Another sign of R\u00e1jput connection is their worship of the sword under the name of \"Jh\u00e1gr\u00e1 kh\u00e1nd,\" and it seems that they conquered the country, which they now occupy, from the aboriginal Bh\u00fay\u00e1s.* On the whole there is much in favour of the theory that they are \"imperfect R\u00e1jputs\" who settled in early times among the hills of the Vindhyan ranges, and failed in becoming Hinduised, like other warlike \"immigrants.\"\u2020 They are now classed with the aboriginal races mainly because their habits and observances are non-Hind\u00fa\u2014thus they marry at puberty, bury their dead, and eat flesh and drink liquor, with the exception of a limited section, who conform to the more distinguished Brahmanical faith, in the hope of obtaining recognition as R\u00e1jputs. So palpable is the innovation, however, that Kanwars wearing the aristocratic cord do not hesitate to take wives from among the unconsecrated septs of their race.\u2021\n\nThe only other aboriginal or quasi-aboriginal tribe which deserves special notice is the Halb\u00e1, which appears to be an importation from the south, and where not Hinduised, has some very original customs. In the wild country of Bastar they are said to \"gain their living chiefly by distilling spirits, and worship a pantheon of glorified distillers, at the head of whom is Bah\u00e1dur Kal\u00e1l.\"\u00a7 In the R\u00e1\u00edp\u00far district, where they hold thirty-seven flourishing villages, they have settled down as steady cultivators, and, unlike other aboriginal tribes, are quite able to hold their own\n\n* Mr. J.

Their religious observances are very simple:\u2014\n\u201cAll that is necessary for a good Halb\u00e1 is that he should sacrifice,\n\u201conce in his life, three goats and a pig, one to each of the national\n\u201cdeities called N\u00e1r\u00e1yan Gos\u00e1in, Burh\u00e1 Deo, Sat\u00ed, and\n\u201cRatn\u00e1; of these the two former are male, and the two latter\n\u201cfemale divinities, and it is to N\u00e1r\u00e1yan Gos\u00e1in that the pig is\n\u201csacrificed.\u201d*\n\nIn this brief sketch of the principal aboriginal tribes of the\nCentral Provinces stress has been laid\nrather on their distinguishing social charac-\nteristics than on their rites and ceremonies,\nwhich, whether originally peculiar to different tribes or not, are now\nso intermingled and confused, that they may be regarded almost as\ncommon property. The Gonds, according to Hislop,\u2020 have\nabout fifteen gods, but few or none of the tribe are acquainted with\nthe whole list. Th\u00e1kur Deo and Dulh\u00e1 Deo\u2014both household\ngods\u2014and Burh\u00e1 Deo, the great god, are the most popular objects\nof worship throughout Gondw\u00e1na, and they command a certain\nrespect even among so-called Hind\u00fas. All aboriginal tribes\nhave a decided respect for the powers of evil, whether in the form of\ncholera and small-pox, or under the more idealised guise of a de-\nstructive god and his even more malignant wife.\u00a7 Indeed the theory\nthat the Aryan Hind\u00fas drew this element of their worship from\naboriginal sources is not without strong confirmatory evidence in\nthese provinces. The shrine of Mah\u00e1deva (Siva), on the Pach-\nmarh\u00ed hills, which till lately attracted the largest religious fair\nin these provinces, is still under the hereditary guardianship of\nKurk\u00fa chiefs, and the oldest temples on the far more widely\ncelebrated island of M\u00e1ndh\u00e1t\u00e1, on the Narbad\u00e1, originally\nthe seat of worship of the aboriginal powers of evil, K\u00e1l Bhairava\nand K\u00e1l\u00ed Dev\u00ed, and afterwards appropriated by the more civilised\n\n* Mr. J.

The Baig\u00e1s again are distinguished by an extraordinary reverence for \"mother earth.\" On the other hand the Khonds, who are classed as Dravidian, combine both these faiths. It is in short impossible, in the present state of our knowledge, to found any generalisations on the shifting beliefs of tribes to whom change is almost a necessary of life, and whose customs are constantly acting and reacting upon each other. The Ethnological Committee appointed in 1867 to report on the aboriginal tribes of the Central Provinces, after a careful analysis of the peculiar practices attributed to each race, came to the conclusion that no distinctive customs had been elicited by their analysis as attaching to separate tribes. In their own words,\u2014\u201cIt had been suggested that the worship of dead relatives belonged to the Kolarians, or supposed immigrants from the north-east; but it seems certain that all the wild tribes of Central India worship relatives immediately after death, and, moreover, traces of this superstition may be found all the world over. The Hind\u00fas themselves now practise rites of the same kind. Herodotus and Homer could be quoted to show the antiquity of the custom. And Captain Burton describes the ceremonies as they are now practised in Central Africa; also, by the way, the worship of trees\u2014a very early and widely-spread superstition in India. If it be true that all races in their earlier periods of development pass through certain states of religious belief, then a general account of the religion of a tribe will not assist the ethnographer, though one or two peculiar forms of worship may give a clue to recent affinities. However, the gods of the Khonds are plainly the same as the gods of the south-eastern Gonds. The word Pen, or Penn\u00fa for deity, is\n\n* See below, article \u201cM\u00e1ndh\u00e1t\u00e1,\u201d p. 259.\ncommon to both. And that ceremony of bringing back the soul of the deceased does seem peculiar to these provinces, at any rate.\n\nAs for Dulh\u00e1 Deo, so commonly mentioned as a favourite Gond deity, he comes from Bundelkhand, and is the apotheosis of a bridegroom (Dulh\u00e1) who died in the marriage procession, and whose untimely end so affected the people that they paid him divine honours.* None of these tribes keep a regular priesthood, but employ medicine-men, exorcists, men who are the stewards of the mysteries by mere profession, not necessarily by birth, or by entry into a religious order. In fact their religion is simple fetichism\u2014the worship of any object supposed to possess hidden influence for weal or woe.\n\nFuneral rites.\u2014Most of the tribes burn, as well as bury, their dead; they cannot be divided like more civilised nations into those that burn and those that bury. Burial is probably the more ancient custom here as elsewhere; the aborigines of north-east Bengal are usually said to bury, and it may be fairly conjectured that the practice of burning is entirely borrowed from the Aryan Hind\u00fas. Most of these tribes raise memorials to their dead\u2014a pure Turanian feature.\n\nMarriage customs and ceremonies exist in infinite variety all the world over, and the practice of pretending to abduct the bride, which is universal among these tribes, is probably known widely among all such societies. The serving a fixed period for a bride is curious; it prevails among the Koch and Bodo people of the north-east hills (Hodgson), and is easily intelligible among very poor races where women are at a premium. The tribes classified do not intermarry among each other, nor do they usually eat together.\u2020\n\n* \"Compare the legend of Adonis\u2014his worship\u2014and that of Thammuz, 'whose annual wound in Lebanon allured the Syrian damsels to lament his fate,' &c. &c.\u2014Milton.\"\n\n\u2020 Report of the Ethnological Committee, Central Provinces (1869), Introductory chapter, pp. 9, 10.\nOf all that has been said regarding the gradual displacement of the aboriginal tribes in one of their last refuges by Hind\u00fa races, nothing, perhaps, has marked the course of events more strongly than the simple fact, drawn from the census records, that in Gondwana there are now only two millions of aborigines out of a total population of nine millions. The remaining seven millions almost amount to a microcosm of the peoples of India; and justice is administered in the Central Provinces in five different languages\u2014Urdu, Hindi, Marathi, Uriya, and Telugu. But though nearly every quarter of the peninsula has thus sent forth its representatives to this debatable land, the great mass of the population has been furnished by the Hindi-speaking races of Upper India. In round numbers the seven millions may be thus classified:\n\n1\u00bd million of Marathi-speaking races.\n\u00bd do. Uriya do.\n5 do. Hindi do.\n\nThe Marath\u00e1s proper\u2014consisting chiefly of Maratha Brahmins and Kunbis\u2014scarcely exceed half a million in number, but owing to the prominent and powerful position so long occupied by them in the country, they have imposed their language and some of their customs on about twice their own number of menial and Helot races, such as Dhers and Mangs, who, Marath\u00e1s in Nagpur, speakers of Hindi in the Narbada valley, only retain their individuality because they are too low in the scale for absorption. The Maratha influence, however, did not penetrate much beyond the Nagpur plain, consisting of the lower valleys of the Wardha and Wai ganga. To the south of this area the Telinga races are intermingled with the settlers from the west, though not in sufficiently large numbers to influence a general calculation, based, like the above, on units of large dimensions only. To the east there is Chattisgarh, inhabited, after some fifteen centuries of Rajput ascendancy, mainly by Hind\u00fa races, except in the remote eastern district of Sambalpur, which by language belongs to Orissa. The northern line of demarcation may be\ndrawn along the southern crest of the S\u00e1tp\u00far\u00e1 range, for though a few Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s are found on the table-land, there are probably more Hind\u00ed speakers \"below the gh\u00e1ts\" in the N\u00e1gp\u00far plain, and the almost universal language of the three S\u00e1tp\u00far\u00e1 districts, Seon\u00ed, Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1, and Bet\u00fal, is Hind\u00ed. It would seem indeed as if the stronger race had rolled back the weaker one on their common meeting ground. Though for hundreds of years no R\u00e1jput king had held sway in Central Gondw\u00e1na, while every part of it had been subject to the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, there are whole colonies of Ponw\u00e1rs, Lodh\u00eds, and other northern tribes in the N\u00e1gp\u00far plain, and the Hind\u00ed language is understood throughout it, while above the gh\u00e1ts Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 would be of very little assistance to a traveller out of the larger towns. The predominance of the northern races may, perhaps, be referred to that seeming law of Indian population which directs the course of immigration from north to south, training up in the rich northern plains a sturdy and prolific population, and causing it in due season to overflow and force its way southwards.\n\nFor long, however, the stream was turned aside by these isolated heights, and it is only within the last three centuries that Gondw\u00e1na has been occupied by Hind\u00fa races. It was ruled by R\u00e1jput chiefs, as has been seen,* at a very much earlier period, but those seem to have been days in which R\u00e1jputs had not been thoroughly assimilated into the Hind\u00fa caste system, and it is quite conceivable that they may have reigned as a semi-foreign tribe directly over the aborigines, without the intervention of a middle class of Hind\u00fas. Certainly this seems to have been the system in Nim\u00e1r, where \"at a very early period the aboriginal tribes were \"more or less subjected to the domination of various clans of \"R\u00e1jputs, successive immigrations of them subdividing the \"country into numerous petty chiefships. In the more central \"and open parts of the district these clans appear to have kept them- \"selves distinct from the aborigines they subdued, and as their own\n\n* See above, p. lviii.\nmembers increased, to have gradually passed from the condition\nof mere military lords of the soil, exacting the means of livelihood\nfrom the toil of the indigenous races, to the actual cultivation of\nit with their own hands.\"*\n\nThe country was not really opened out to Hind\u00fa settlement\ntill the reign of Akbar. Although his dominions never included\nmore than the western portion of Gondw\u00e1na, yet his armies\npenetrated to the easternmost parts of the Narbad\u00e1 valley, and\nthe gun manufacturers of Katang\u00ed in Jabalp\u00far are said to be\ndescended from a party of his soldiers. The returning troops, even\nmore than those who stayed behind, may have contributed to the\nsettlement of the country, by describing its beauty and fertility in\ntheir own over-crowded villages; and there are traces of a consider-\nable Hind\u00fa immigration shortly afterwards. Sleeman says,\u2014\n\"Probably such emigration from the north began with the invasion\nand conquest under Akbar; for though tradition speaks of an\nintercourse with Delhi, and a subjection, nominal or real, to its\nsovereigns from him down to the paramount sway of the Mar\u00e1-\nth\u00e1s, no mention is ever made of any before; nor can we trace\nany invasion or conquest of these parts by the sovereigns of the\nDeccan.\" He adds\u2014\"The oldest rupees that have been found\nin the treasures buried in the earth at different times along the\nNarbad\u00e1 valley are of the reign of Akbar.\"\u2020\n\nThe mass of the Hind\u00fa population is probably of later date,\nand, counting by number of generations, may be referred to the time\nof Aurangzeb.\u00a7 The older settlers are in many districts called\n\"Jh\u00e1ri\u00e1s\" or \"Jhari\u00e1s\" from \"Jh\u00e1r\" (underwood,\u2014forest),\nChanged manners. and are much looser in their observances\nthan later comers of the same caste,\neating forbidden food, and worshipping strange gods.

By degrees, however, the fear of distant public opinion wears off, and they find it convenient to follow the example of their neighbours. Religious and social standards are thus very imperfectly maintained. Gods of most opposite tendencies find themselves associated in \"happy families,\" and, indeed, some combination among them is probably needed to withstand the influence of the local deities, who muster very strong, and recruit their influence from all quarters. Not only are there the elemental divinities of the hills and the forests, but the spirits of the dead pass very rapidly from a state of canonisation to one of deification. Thus in the Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d district the Ghor\u00ed (Mohammadan) kings of M\u00e1lw\u00e1 seem to have attained this dignity without distinction of persons, and a Hind\u00fa in difficulties would as soon invoke the \"Ghor\u00ed B\u00e1dsh\u00e1h\" as any other supernatural power.* At Murm\u00e1ri, ten miles from Bh\u00e1nd\u00e1ra, the villagers worship at the tomb of an English lady\u2020\u2014ignorant, and probably careless, of the object for which it was erected. In social matters ideas are equally confused. There is amongst most castes no restriction on widow marriage, except with the widow of a younger brother; and when a widow remains unmarried, public opinion allows her to manage her husband's estates, and does not condemn her very strongly for giving him a temporary successor or successors. Indeed there is not much rigidity about the marriage tie at all, and the offsprings of irregular connections are often allowed to succeed equally with those born in regular wedlock. The conventional character and pursuits of a caste, too, are often quite transformed by the change of associations and circumstances. The Gujars, like other reformed rakes, are among the steadiest members of the community, and have a\n\n* Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d Settlement Report, chap. iii. para. 91, foot-note.\n\u2020 See below, p. 63.\ngreat deal too much property of their own to admit the idea of professional cattle-lifting as a possibility amongst civilised people. The Lodh\u00eds\u2014mere agricultural drudges in Upper India\u2014have attained some distinction as swash-bucklers and marauders in the Narbad\u00e1 country, and some of their chiefs still retain all the popular respect due to families which have forgotten to live on their own industry. On the other hand there may be found R\u00e1jputs who have put aside their swords and pedigrees, and taken to banking.\n\nBut the most striking and interesting of all these movements is the religious and social revolt among Satn\u00e1m\u00ed Cham\u00e1rs. In Upper India there is no more despised race. In the distribution of occupations nothing has been left for them but the, in Hind\u00fa eyes, degrading handicraft of skinning dead cattle, which is so insufficient for their numbers that the great majority of them are driven to earn their bread from hand to mouth by ill-paid day-labour. In the great isolated plain of Chhatt\u00edsgarh, where the jungle has not even yet been thoroughly mastered by man, hands cannot be spared from agriculture simply to gratify social prejudices, and the Cham\u00e1rs, who make up some twelve per cent. of the population, are nearly all cultivators. A considerable proportion of them have acquired tenant-rights, and they own 362 villages out of a total of 6713. Although, therefore, they have not quite risen to an equality with other castes, they have entirely broken the tradition of serfdom which tied them down and dulled their aspirations, and they have been emboldened by the material change in their condition to free themselves altogether from the tyranny of Brahmanism. The creed adopted by them is the \"Satn\u00e1m\u00ed\" or \"Raj D\u00e1s\u00ed\"\u2014a branch of one of the most celebrated dissenting movements in Indian religious history.* The local revival occurred not quite half a century ago, and was headed by one of the brotherhood named\n\n* The B\u00e1m\u00e1nand\u00eds. See Rost's Edition of Wilson's Essays on the Religion of the Hind\u00fas, vol. i. p. 113 (1862).\nGh\u00e1s\u00ed D\u00e1s.* Since his time corruptions have crept in, and the attempt to start with too high a standard of asceticism, by forbidding tobacco as well as liquor, has produced a split in the community. The theory of their religion is perhaps, like its social practice, too refined for a rough agricultural people, which has only lately emerged from centuries of social depression. No images are allowed\u2014it is not even lawful to approach the Supreme Being by external forms of worship, except the morning and evening invocation of his holy name (Satn\u00e1m), but believers are enjoined to keep him constantly in their minds, and to show their religion by charity. A faith so colourless and ideal has scarcely motive-power to influence the daily life of the rough Cham\u00e1rs, and their morality is said not to be very strict. The priests are, indeed, accused by the Br\u00e1hmans of using their power to gratify their sensual tastes, but no Satn\u00e1m\u00ed acknowledges the truth of this charge. Even if the creed be weak as a moral support, it is strong as a social bond, and no longer weighed down by a sense of inferiority, the Satn\u00e1m\u00eds hold together and resist all attempts from other castes to reassert their traditional domination over them. They are good and loyal subjects, and when they have grown out of a certain instability and improvidence, which are the natural result of their long-depressed condition, they will become valuable members of the community.\n\nBut the orthodox Hind\u00fa has an even greater trouble than dissent in Chhatt\u00edsgarh. The wild hill country from Mandla to the eastern coast is believed to be so infested by witches that at one time no prudent father would let his daughter marry into a family which did not include amongst its members at least one of the dangerous sisterhood.\u2020 The non-Aryan belief in the powers of evil here strikes a ready chord in the minds of their conquerors, attuned to dread by the inhospitable appearance of the country, and the terrible effects of its malarious influences upon human life. In the\n\n* See below, article \"Bil\u00e1sp\u00far,\" p. 100.\n\u2020 Sleeman's \"Rambles and Recollections,\" vol. i. pp. 93, 96.\nwilds of Mandla there are many deep hill-side caves which not even the most intrepid Baig\u0101 hunter would approach, for fear of attracting upon himself the wrath of their demoniac inhabitants; and where these hill-men, who are regarded both by themselves and by others as ministers between men and spirits, themselves fear, the sleek cultivator of the plains must feel absolute repulsion. Then the suddenness of the epidemics to which, whether from deficient water supply or other causes, Central India seems so subject, is another fruitful source of terror among an ignorant people. When cholera breaks out in a wild part of the country it creates a perfect stampede\u2014villages, roads, and all works in progress are deserted; even the sick are abandoned by their nearest relations to die, and crowds fly to the jungles, there to starve on fruits and berries till the panic has passed off. The only consideration for which their minds have room at such times is the punishment of the offenders; for the ravages caused by the disease are unhesitatingly set down to human malice. The police records of the Central Provinces unfortunately contain too many sad instances of life thus sacrificed to a mad, unreasoning terror. The tests applied are very various; as a commencement, either a lamp is lighted, and the names of the supposed witches being repeated, the flicker of the light is supposed to indicate the culprit;* or two leaves are thrown up on the out-stretched hand of the suspected person, and if that which represents him (or her) falls uppermost, opinion goes against him.\u2020 In Bastar the leaf-ordeal is followed by sewing up the accused in a sack and letting him down into water waist-deep; if he manages in his struggles for life to raise his head above water, he is finally adjudged to be guilty. Then comes the punishment. He (or she) is beaten with tamarind or castor-oil plant rods, which are supposed to have a peculiar efficacy in these cases;\u2021 the teeth\n\n* Mr. Chisholm's Bilaspur Settlement Report, para. 132.\n\u2020 Captain Glasfurd's Report on the Dependency of Bastar.

The extraction of the teeth is said in Bastar to be effected with the idea of preventing the witch from muttering charms, but in Kum\u0101on the object of the operation is rather to prevent her from doing mischief under the form of a tiger, which is the Indian equivalent of the loup-garou.* The shaving of the head is attributed by an acute observer to the notion of power residing in the hair, and it seems clear, from the recorded instances, that it is done rather as an antidote against future evil than merely as a punishment to the offender.\u2020\n\nSometimes the suspected persons escape these trials, accompanied as they are by abuse, exposure, and confinement, with life, and then they are driven out of the village. But often the tests are too severe for them, or the fury of the villagers is so roused by the spectacle that they kill their victims outright. The crime is not yet quite extinct, but it has been much checked of late years by the expedient of executing the murderers on the scene of their misdeeds. To quote again from the paper already mentioned\u2014\"There is at this moment no logical method whatever of demonstrating to a m\u00e1l-\"guz\u00e1r of R\u00e1\u00edp\u00far that witchcraft is nothing but a delusion and an imposition. Your only chance would be the proving that such things are contrary to experience; but unluckily they are by no means contrary to every-day experience in R\u00e1\u00edp\u00far, and the facts are positively asserted and attested; wherefore we are reduced to abandon logic altogether, and to give out boldly that any one who kills a witch shall be most illogically hanged\u2014a very practical and convincing line of argument.\"\u2021\n\nTo sum up. The Hind\u00fa castes most largely represented in the Central Provinces' population are, from the north\u2014Br\u00e1hmans, R\u00e1jputs, Ah\u00edrs (herdsmen), Lodh\u00eds and Kurmis (cultivators), and Cham\u00e1rs; from the south and west\u2014Br\u00e1hmans, and Kunb\u00eds.\n\n* \"Witchcraft in the Central Provinces,\" by Mr. A.

Of Mohammadans there are only 237,962 altogether (not three percent of the population), and many of these of a very hybrid sort.\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nADMINISTRATION AND TRADE.\n\nEthnical subdivisions\u2014Formation of the Central Provinces\u2014First measures of administration\u2014Non-regulation system\u2014General and Judicial administrative staff\u2014District duties\u2014The revenue\u2014Land revenue\u2014Land Tenure\u2014Salt and Sugar tax\u2014Excise\u2014Stamps and assessed taxes\u2014Forest revenues\u2014Miscellaneous receipts\u2014Education\u2014Higher education\u2014Sanitation and Vaccination\u2014Dispensaries\u2014Jails\u2014Local funds and operations\u2014The Engineering Department\u2014Communications\u2014Trade\u2014Exports, Cotton\u2014Native cloth trade\u2014Grain trade\u2014Remaining articles of export\u2014Imports, Salt\u2014Sugar\u2014Piece-goods and other articles of import\u2014Conclusion.\n\nThe preceding brief notice of the population of the Central Provinces shows that though it was originally, so far as we know, homogeneous, or at least that one race\u2014the Gond\u2014predominated sufficiently to give a name and distinctive character to the country, yet in subsequent times the aboriginal stratum has been so overlaid by foreign accessions from the four quarters of the compass, that the country is now split up into subdivisions, ethnically connected with entirely different provinces of India.\n\nEthnical subdivisions. Thus S\u00e1g\u00e1r and D\u00e1moh on the Vindhyan plateau somewhat resemble Bundelkhand. The Narbad\u00e1 valley population, though more localised and individualised, has similar affinities. The N\u00e1gp\u00far country is a bastard of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 family. Sironch\u00e1 and parts of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 come within the outskirts of Telengana. Sambalp\u00far leans to Orissa. Nim\u00e1r and Chhattisgarh, especially the latter, are exceptions, each possessing a dialect and characteristics peculiar to itself. After the Bhonsl\u00e1 kingdom was broken up, the experiment was tried of attaching these disjecta membra of different\nnationalities to their parent stocks. The northern provinces were first administered by a semi-political agency, but were afterwards added to the Lieutenant-Governorship of the North-Western Provinces. Nim\u00e1r was administered directly from Indore, the nearest seat of British power, and indirectly from Agra. Sambalpur was included among the non-regulation districts of the Bengal Province. N\u00e1gpur only retained a Government of its own, the Resident being transformed into a Commissioner until better arrangements could be made. Chhattisgarh was a kind of no-man's-land, but as it was not easily accessible from any side but the west, considerations of administrative convenience prevailed, and it remained attached to the Bhoosl\u00e1 capital. None of these dispositions worked quite successfully. The S\u00e1gar and Narbada territories were never really amalgamated with the North-Western Provinces, from which they are separated by a vast intervening tract of independent country. They had an administrative staff, codes, and procedure of their own, and owing to their distance from the seat of Government, and the difference, in many important respects, of their physical and moral characteristics from those on which the experience of the North-Western administration had been founded, the orders of the Government often failed to strike home, and the province became practically an outlying dependency, in which external authority was rather felt as a check than as a stimulus. Nim\u00e1r was in much the same case, while the wild chiefships attached to Sambalpur were always hot-beds of disorder. Thus Gondwana had been lopped of its extremities and resolved into two provinces; neither of them large enough to ensure the healthy circulation of ideas and the emulation among the official staff, which are indispensable to administrative success. The nominal supervision of distant authorities had proved\u2014as must always be the case where a poor, distant, and unattractive dependency is added to the charge of an old Government, fully occupied with the established routine of its more important and immediate interests\u2014quite inadequate to put spirit into the administration, or to throw clear light on the real wants of the country and the people. Abandoning therefore the\nexperiment\u2014which had indeed originated rather accidentally, in consequence of the gradual disintegration of the Bhonsl\u0101 kingdom, than in any set design of separating the Hind\u012b and Mar\u0101th\u0101 elements of Gondw\u0101na\u2014Lord Canning decided, in November 1861, to reunite British Central India under one strong Government. It fell to the lot of Sir Richard (then Mr.) Temple to write the first official account of the new territories, and newspaper readers of that time (1861-62) must still remember the curiosity with which it was awaited, and the interest with which it was perused, not only on account of the high reputation of the writer, but owing to the novelty of the subject which he treated. There was a famous lake at S\u00e1g\u00e1r; Jabalp\u016br produced Thug informers, tents, and carpets; N\u00e1gp\u016br had been the capital of one of the great Mar\u0101th\u0101 kingdoms, and the country generally was inhabited by Gonds (spelt \"Gooands\"), whom some supposed to be \"a low caste of Hind\u00fas,\" others, to be men of the woods, who lived in trees and kidnapped travellers to sacrifice them to their gods;\u2014these were the main heads of the popular information about Gondw\u0101na. Sir Richard Temple was able, in less than a year, to give an account of the province, its people, its history, and its wants, which subsequent research has supplemented, but has not altered or improved in any important particular. In his first two seasons he penetrated into almost every corner of a province larger than Great Britain, and with scarcely a mile of made road, except that leading out of it, from Jabalp\u016br to Mirzap\u016br. The knowledge thus gained by inquiry and observation served to facilitate the still arduous work of freeing the administrative machine from time-honoured obstructions\u2014already crumbling away, perhaps, under the influence of air and light from without,\u2014and of building up, almost from the commencement, a fresh and more perfect organism. The first year's list of measures* comprises\n\n* Among these judicial reform has not been mentioned, because, although perhaps the most important and difficult of all, it does not come under the class of creative measures. The complete and rapid reorganisation of the Courts effected by Mr. John Strachey, was, however, as great a boon as could possibly have been conferred on a law-loving people.\nthirty-nine headings, among which\u2014putting aside departments already in full working, which only needed stimulation\u2014may be counted the land-revenue settlement and record of agricultural rights; the introduction of State education (into the N\u0101gp\u016br province); the construction of trunk roads; the repression of drunkenness by the introduction of the Central distillery system; the levy of a local cess to support village-schools; the organisation of a regular constabulary; the creation of an honorary magistracy; the introduction of jail discipline, and the erection of suitable jail buildings; the preservation of forests; the improved preparation of cotton for the English market; the extension of irrigation; the establishment of mercantile fairs; the suppression of forced labour; and the collection of reliable statistics of population, trade, and agriculture. In some of these respects a commencement had been made, especially in the S\u0101gar and Narbad\u0101 territories, but in all there was much severe up-hill work required to bring the Central Provinces up to the level of other parts of India. Thus, although preliminary settlement operations had for years dragged their slow length along, no single assessment had been announced, and while the Government was losing the benefit of the general enhancement which has since taken place, the people were in places suffering from the pressure of the demand. In the N\u0101gp\u016br province the prisons were \"temporary makeshifts of the worst description.\"* State education had been commenced in about a third of the province, but the scheme comprised no regular village-schools, while in the remaining districts there was no educational system at all. In short in the S\u0101gar and Narbad\u0101 territories much had to be done; in the N\u0101gp\u016br province almost everything had to be done, and public opinion, for the first time called into council, demanded a rate of progress rapid in proportion to the deficiencies to be made up. The essential difficulties of forcing the progress-rate with a limited command of men, money, and time, were much enhanced in the Central Provinces by the characteristics of the country. The distances were great,\n\n* Administration Report of the Central Provinces (1861-62), p. 59.\nthe communications were rough, difficult, and even dangerous. Even now an order from head-quarters can scarcely, under the most favourable circumstances, be in the hands of all district officers under a week's time. The regular post-lines indeed worked with astonishing regularity, considering the rude machinery by which they were carried on, and the inhospitable country through which many of them passed, though occasionally a man-eating tiger would stop all night-travelling, or a mountain torrent in flood would cause a day's delay, or perhaps a bad fever season would prostrate the post-runners over many miles of road. But when the missives of authority had to be passed on to the subordinate officials in the interior, quitting the main net-work of communication, their progress was beset with even greater difficulties. Admitting that they reached their destination safely, effect had to be given to the instructions, which they contained, in a wild, thinly-inhabited backward country, by means of native officials, almost all of whom were foreigners, little interested in the people, driven from their homes, perhaps, by inability to obtain service where competition erected a high standard of qualification, and with no aspiration but to shake off the dust of their feet from this land of jungle, witches, and fever. In short there was a necessary loss of power at every step, and in judging of the past by the present, it must be remembered that these harassing mechanical obstacles are now no longer so formidable, and that their mitigation is mainly due to Sir Richard Temple's energy.\n\nA detailed account of the steps by which the administration has reached its present form would be out of place even here, but a brief sketch of the existing constitution of the Central Provinces may be useful for purposes of comparison. The term \"non-regulation,\" as is well known, has quite lost its original meaning;\u2014it now merely implies that the regulations and laws passed for the Bengal Presidency prior to the promulgation of the \"Indian Councils' Act, 1861\" (24 & 25 Vic., Cap. LXVII.) do not necessarily apply to the province thus designated. All acts of an imperial character have the same\nforce here as elsewhere in India; and the Central Provinces, like other non-regulation provinces, have also had extended to them from time to time considerable portions of the local law of the Bengal Presidency. In almost every respect, then, the legal procedure is as strictly defined as in the oldest provinces, and the only distinguishing feature of the system, in its present form, is the combination of judicial and executive functions in the same officials\u2014a method which has more than a formal value among a simple people, unaccustomed to the subdivision of authority or to the intricacies of law. The administration is carried on by a Chief Commissioner, aided by a Secretary and an Assistant Secretary, in direct subordination to the Government of India. In addition to his general duties of superintendence, he is charged with the special supervision of the Revenue and the Executive. The Courts, Civil and Criminal, are separately controlled by a Chief Judge, under the name of Judicial Commissioner, in deference to the principle of guarding against abuse from the combination of judicial and executive functions, by keeping the former in the last resort independent of the latter. The administrative staff consists of four Commissioners, nineteen Deputy Commissioners, seventeen Assistant Commissioners, twenty-four Extra Assistant Commissioners, and fifty Tahsildars or Sub-Collectors, who are distributed over nineteen districts, grouped into four divisions. The police force, consisting of eighteen District Superintendents, two Assistant District Superintendents, fifty-two Inspectors, and 7,417 petty Officers and Constables, is controlled by an Inspector-General in matters of discipline, and in its internal relations generally, but in its executive functions it is subordinate to the district authorities. Education, Forest conservancy, and Vaccination have separate establishments of their own, though the regular civil staff is expected to contribute assistance, direct or indirect, to the operations of these departments. Jail management, Sanitation, and Registration are more or less in the hands of the local authorities, but are supervised by special officers. The Medical staff, consisting of eighteen Civil Surgeons and Apothecaries, nine Sub-Assistant Surgeons, and ninety-five Hospital\nAssistants or Native Doctors, is directly subordinate to the executive authorities, though a general control and supervision is maintained over them by the heads of the Medical Department throughout India. The Public Works Department is more detached from the regular administrative staff, owning no subordination to any local authority but the Chief Commissioner, to whom the Provincial Chief Engineer is Secretary in that branch of the administration.\n\nNext in the scale of executive authority to the Chief Commissioner come the Commissioners of division, whose charges in three cases include five districts\u2014in one (Chhattisgarh) only three. They are Sessions Judges, having the power of death\u2014subject to confirmation by the Judicial Commissioner,\u2014and of all minor punishments; Civil Judges of appeal with powers under the Central Provinces Courts\u2019 Act (Act XIV. of 1865); and are also responsible for the general administration of the country. But the unit in the executive scheme is the Deputy Commissioner, whose duties are very various. He is the Chief Magistrate of a district, averaging in these provinces 4,316 square miles in extent, with an average revenue of Rs. 6,30,000, and an average population of 420,000 souls, and has also special criminal powers of imprisonment up to seven years in certain cases. His original civil jurisdiction is unlimited in amount, and he hears appeals from his Assistants up to Rs. 1,000. He is also chief of the police; chief collector of revenue; conservator of the district forests; supervisor of popular education; marriage registrar; ex-officio member of all municipalities in his district, and head of the local agencies for the management of roads, ferries, encamping grounds, public gardens, stock-breeding establishments, rest-houses and other public buildings not of an imperial character. These duties branch into many others too numerous to mention, but it may safely be said that the miscellaneous work of a Deputy Commissioner in a central district often occupies more time than his more regular functions. In subordination to him the Civil Medical Officer manages the jails, lock-ups, lunatic asylums,* and dispense-\n\n* Of these there are only two\u2014one at Nagpur, and one at Jabalpur.\nsaries; and the police investigate all cases which the law considers sufficiently serious to warrant intervention without special authority from a Magistrate, and bring them before the Courts in a complete form for trial. They also take charge of cattle-pounds, collect vital statistics, guard treasuries and jails, and escort treasure and prisoners, besides their regular duties in the repression and detection of crime.\n\nThe Assistant and Extra Assistant Commissioners aid Deputy Commissioners in their general duties, and try cases within the limits of their powers,* to obtain which they must pass two examinations, by the higher and lower standards, and obtain certificates of qualification from their immediate superiors. Assistant Commissioners are ordinarily drawn from the covenanted class, consisting of members of the regular civil service and officers in the army; while Extra Assistant Commissioners\u2014who are usually natives of the country\u2014belong to the subordinate or uncovenanted Civil service, and cannot rise to the higher appointments except through the intermediate grade of Assistant Commissioner, which is only conferred in cases of special desert. Before dismissing the subject of judicial administration it should be mentioned that much assistance has been rendered to the regular judicial staff, and justice has been in many cases brought home to the doors of the people, by the\n\n* Act XIV. of 1865 thus grad.:s the Civil Courts of the Central Provinces:\u2014\n\n(1) The court of the Tahsildar of the 2nd class, with power to try suits not exceeding Rs. 100 in value.\n\n(2) Do. do. 1st class do.

Of these gentlemen there are now one hundred and twelve in the province, most of whom are landholders. A considerable proportion, however, belongs to the merchant and banker class. The honour is highly appreciated and eagerly sought, and it is but rarely that those to whom it is awarded are accused of abusing their powers. If the principle be borne in mind of conferring the honorary magistracy only on the accepted leaders of the people, rather as an acknowledgment of existing status and character than as a stepping-stone to social promotion, there is good ground for hoping that the measure may contain the elements of political as well as of judicial success.\n\nThe other main occupation of the executive staff is the collection of the revenue. This is no mere \"sitting at the receipt of custom,\" and taking what comes in. The land-revenue is a fixed amount, it is true, during the currency of the twenty or thirty years' engagements, but it may fail in a bad year. The excise, though less directly, is even more powerfully, affected by the fluctuations of seasons and prices, inasmuch as the liquor and drug consumers are a poorer and less provident class than the landholders. The form of the assessed taxes has of late been changed yearly, but even if it had been maintained, the changes among the poorer tax-payers are so frequent that minute annual revisions would have been necessary. The Forest Revenue is still in its infancy, and needs careful nursing. The stamp-revenue alone gives the collector little trouble, and the inland customs on salt imported, and sugar exported, to native States are managed by an imperial department.\n\nOf these heads of revenue the land furnishes by far the greatest contribution. In 1868-69 it gave Rs. 59,30,603 out of a total revenue, for imperial purposes, of Rs. 1,04,74,699. The whole of the land of the Central Provinces, with the exception of certain assignments for religious and other purposes, made chiefly by former govern-\nments, belongs theoretically to the State, which, however, limits its demands to a fixed share, ordinarily one-half of the gross rental.\n\nThe remainder of the rents goes to the responsible owners of the villages\u2014a class which our Government has created by consolidating the position of the revenue farmers, whom we found managing their villages and paying the Government dues, often from generation to generation, but with no security for permanence beyond what might be conceded to the popular feeling in favour of prescriptive occupancy. Subject to certain conditions, the chief of which is the regular payment of the revenue, these men are now firmly seated in their holdings, and feeling no uncertainty about the future, are free to extend cultivation and improve their possessions. Without itself losing anything, the Government has thus conferred upon them a valuable property, in the security of tenure which draws capital and enterprise to the land, while it has fostered in a large and powerful section of society the surest incentive to self-reliance, and the strongest interest in loyalty. While the security of the revenue and the prosperity of the tax-payers have thus been ensured, subordinate interests in the soil have been consulted by liberal measures of tenant-right. Under the well-known Bengal Rent Law (Act X. of 1859) all cultivators of twelve years' standing can claim fixity of tenure, subject to the payment of fair rents; but though this concession may amply meet the requirements of a long-settled country, it would not have been a sufficient recognition of the claims of tenants, many of whom had shared with the revenue farmer, though in a less responsible degree, the toil and some of the risk of reclaiming their villages from the jungle. Accordingly this class has been held entitled to fixity of rent, as well as to stability of tenure, for the period of the revenue settlements, which run from twenty to thirty years.\n\nThe next great head of revenue is the salt and sugar tax, from which Rs. 15,45,985* were derived in 1868-69. This is collected by means of an\n\n---\n\n* Details.\nSalt..................

The duty levied is three rupees per maund of 82 lbs., part of which is taken, in the case of Bengal and Madras salt, at the works on the sea-coast. A small impost of one rupee per maund is also levied on British sugar crossing the line outwards\u2014that is from east to west\u2014for consumption in foreign States. The Customs is, however, a quasi-imperial department, worked by an executive of its own; and the second place in the Revenue Collector's duties is occupied by the excise, which in 1868-69 produced Rs. 9,44,931.* The tax on liquor is raised by means of the Central Distillery system, under which all distillation must take place within certain appointed enclosures, the duty being paid on removal of the liquor. These restrictions on free trade in liquor have occasioned some loss of revenue, but the power which is gained by them of adjusting the tax to the circumstances of the payers admits of obtaining the maximum of revenue with the minimum of consumption. All observers concur in representing the good effects of checking the supply of intoxicating spirits to the hill-tribes, who are naturally very prone to indulge in them. In parts of the Upper Godavari district, where the aboriginal Ko\u00eds are so unsettled that any interference with their habits would drive them to emigrate in a body, the population of whole villages\u2014men, women, and even children\u2014may be seen drunk for days together at the season of the year when the palm-juice ripens for toddy. In the wilder portions of the Central Provinces generally the practice has so far died out since the introduction of the Central Distillery system, that gur (unrefined sugar) is now habitually used by the Gonds at their feasts as a substitute for spirits. The reform has thus\n\n* Details.\n\n| Liquor | Rs. 7,18,061 |\n|--------|-------------|\n| Opium | Rs. 1,21,150 |\n| Drugs | Rs. 1,05,720 |\nanswered its main object\u2014the check of demoralisation among the people,\u2014but it costs the revenue collector far more labour, care, and thought than the simple farming system which it succeeded. When the excise revenue was derived from the sale of the monopoly of vend, his responsibilities were limited to securing a brisk competition at the auction; but now he has to adjust prices, satisfying himself, on the one hand, that they are not forced up so high as to encourage smuggling\u2014on the other that they are not kept so low as to stimulate consumption; he has to see that distilleries are supplied in sufficient numbers and at proper places, and to defeat the efforts both of the distillers and of his own establishment to defraud the revenue. In short he has in the interests of morality to maintain artificial checks on consumption, in opposition not only to the drinking-classes themselves, whose tastes and habits he is obliged to cross, but to the distillers, who know by experience that large consumption at low rates creates a far more paying trade than that which is now imposed upon them. The taxes on opium and intoxicating drugs are at present farmed, or to speak more accurately, the monopoly of the retail of these articles is annually sold by auction; but modifications in this system are under consideration.\n\nThe stamps are nearly as lucrative a source of revenue as the excise. In 1868-69 Rs. 8,37,026 were derived from stamp revenue.\n\nThe assessed taxes produced in 1868-69 Rs. 3,71,155.* In the present year the certificate tax on incomes over Rs. 500 has given way, as elsewhere in India, to a 1\u00bd per cent income tax, from which about Rs. 2,75,000 will be obtained. Incomes under Rs. 500 are taxed by an impost called \"p\u00e1ndhri,\" which is peculiar to these provinces, having come to the British Government as a legacy from their M \u00e1 r \u00e1 t h \u00e1 predecessors.\n\n* Details.\n\nCertificate Tax ........... Rs. 1,05,887\nP\u00e1ndhri.................. ,, 26,526\nThe Forest Revenues are derived, in the case of the Reserved Forests, from the sale of timber and other forest products. Of the Reserved Government Forests, which cover some 4,000 square miles of country, and produce Teak (*tectona grandis*), S\u00e1l (*vatica robusta*), S\u00e1j (*terminalia glabra* or *tomentosa*), Bijes\u00e1l (*pterocarpus marsupium*), Shisham (*dalbergia latifolia*), Kaw\u00e1 (*pentaptera arjuna*), Anjan (*hardwickia binata*), and other less valuable woods. They are managed by a Conservator, four Deputy Conservators, four Assistant and three Sub-Conservators, besides a subordinate staff.\n\nThe tree forests of the Central Provinces have, however, been so much exhausted, mainly owing to the destructive *d\u00e1hya* system of cultivation practised by the hill-tribes, that, except in one or two localities, the labours of the Forest officers will for many years be limited to guarding against further damage, and thus allowing the forests to recover themselves by rest. By far the greater part of the uncultivated lands belonging absolutely to the Government are stony wastes, incapable of producing a strong straight growth of timber. But they supply many of the daily wants of the people\u2014grass and poles for thatching; firewood; bamboos for mats and fences; tough small wood for agricultural implements; wild-fruits; and above all the fleshy *mhowa* flower, from which not only is a spirit distilled, but the poorer population draws half its sustenance at certain times of the year. Then the disposal of the hill-grazing grounds is a question of the last importance to the villages of the plain, and the lac, silk, wax, honey, resin, and other articles of commerce are eagerly bought up for export. The district officer has therefore to administer the Government estates not only so as to secure a full revenue, but with a due regard to the many interests concerned. Hitherto the revenue has been ordinarily levied by means of annual usufruct farms, but it has been found that the farmers often take undue advantage of their monopoly to make exorbitant terms with the more ignorant villagers; and a system of commutation under which each village shall pay a small fixed sum for the right to\ncollect jungle produce is under consideration, and has already been introduced in some districts.\n\nThe Forest Revenues for 1868-69 amounted to Rs. 3,51,014, of which Rs. 1,01,851 were contributed by the Reserved Forests, and Rs. 2,49,163 by the Unreserved Forests.\n\nMiscellaneous receipts. The receipts from Fines, Refunds, Registration fees, Profits of jail manufactures, &c. under the head of \"Law and Justice,\" amounting to Rs. 2,24,527, and the miscellaneous items, amounting to Rs. 2,60,581, make up the total revenues for 1868-69 to Rs. 1,04,74,699.*\n\nEducation, as has already been observed, is on something the same footing as Forest conservancy\u2014that is it is partly conducted by a special department, partly by the regular civil staff. Since the Central Provinces have been established in their present shape, it has been recognised that the real want of a thinly-populated backward country like this is cheap instruction for the many, and that the high education of the few must for the present be quite a secondary object. Aryan civilisation is here an exotic, which in the rude atmosphere of the camp and the farm has never reached its ornamental prime. There was therefore no basis of time-honoured erudition from which to shape stately schemes of advanced education; but on the other hand the mass of the people, if apathetic, was unprejudiced, and had no deeper objection to bring against learning than its irksomeness. Thus in eight years the number of pupils grew from 16,766 to 72,885. One in every 125 of the population is now under instruction, which, though unfortunately a low enough ratio in the abstract, compares favourably with the results obtained in more settled provinces.\u2020 In one district, Sambalpur, where the\n\n* There is a small difference between the Revenue and Finance Department figures, arising from their closing the accounts on different days at the end of the year\u2014a defect which is being remedied.\n\n\u2020 In the N.W.P.\u2014One in 166.\n\u201e Punj\u00e1b\u2014\u201e in 217.\n\u201e Bengal\u2014\u201e in 239.\n\u201e Oudh\u2014\u201e in 260.\npopulation belongs to a more intelligent race (the Uriya) than the people of the Central Provinces generally, a greater advance has been made, nearly two per cent of the people being under instruction, great part of the cost of which is defrayed from their own voluntary subscriptions. Their appreciation of schools is shown not only by the sacrifices which they make to maintain them, but by the crowds which flock to public examinations. This is, however, an exceptional instance of the success which in a greater or less degree always attends the system of enlisting the influence of the district officer in the cause of education.\n\nThe higher education alone in these provinces is left exclusively to the care of the Educational Department, which, having its functions thus limited, consists merely of an Inspector-General and three circle Inspectors. Their special charge is confined to the management of two high schools, sixteen middle class schools, and six Normal schools;* but they also inspect the town and village schools managed by district officers, and are responsible for the maintenance of the prescribed educational standards.\n\nThe cost of popular education is defrayed from the proceeds of a special two per cent cess on landholders, from subscriptions and from fees. High class education draws something from these last two sources, but is mainly supported by a State grant. Altogether of a total expenditure of some \u00a350,000 (in 1868-69) considerably more than half was met from local resources.\n\nSanitation and Vaccination are supervised by a Sanitary Commissioner. For the latter purpose he has an establishment of vaccinators, which, if not numerically adequate to grapple with the disease in all parts of the province, has been of service in familiarising the process to the people, and in thus preparing the way for its extension by\n\n* There are also Missionary Institutions at Nagpur and Jabalpur which teach up to the \"High School\" standard.\nmeans of local enterprise. The science of Sanitation is as yet in its infancy, and this branch of the Sanitary Commissioner's duties is for the present limited to advising the local authorities in cases of epidemics, and to collecting data, especially with regard to the course and working of cholera outbreaks.\n\nA kindred subject is the Hospital Establishment, which, however, is under the charge of the Inspector of Jails. There are now in existence 79 of these charitable institutions, of which 66 are dispensaries, two are lunatic asylums, one is a leper asylum, and six are poor-houses. The dispensary income is now rather over \u00a310,000 a year, of which the Government contributes about a third, the remainder being obtained in nearly equal proportions from local funds and private subscriptions. Dispensaries are located not only at the head-quarters of districts, but at many places in the interior, and afford medicines and treatment gratis to all who apply for them. In proportion to the numbers of the population the amount of medical aid as yet available is but small, but in so vast an undertaking the Government cannot attempt to do more than show by example the advantages of scientific treatment in disease, and lately there have been symptoms, in the voluntary establishment of a few dispensaries, that the appreciation for them is gaining ground.\n\nThe Jails in the Central Provinces resemble those of other parts of India, and need no particular notice. They are conducted on the most approved principles, and the earnings of the prisoners defray about half the expenses.\n\nIt has already been mentioned that, in addition to the duties imposed upon them as part of the administrative staff of the country, district officers perform certain functions of a local character. The chief of these are the superintendence and guidance of the municipal bodies which have been created in all large towns. Self-government, even in a very modified form, is so strange to Asiatics that as yet the initiative in deliberation, except where the\ncommittee includes European members, is almost necessarily taken by the district officer. Great efforts have, however, been made to secure a true representation of all classes of the people in these bodies, and as they are not only entrusted with the management of communications, conservancy, &c., and in minor matters with the preservation of order, but have the power of self-taxation, the stimulus of self-interest is not always ineffectual in rousing them to a sense of their duties. In addition to his municipal duties the district officer has the management of the ferry fund, arising from the proceeds of ferry leases, pound-fees, and other sources; of the nazul fund, being the proceeds of public gardens, building-plots and buildings in cities, and other Government property not paying land revenue; of the school fund (already mentioned), derived from a two per cent. cess on land revenue; and of a similar two per cent. cess for the maintenance of district roads.*\n\nThe main lines of communication are however, with the Government buildings, military and civil, kept up by an Engineering department, consisting in these provinces of a Chief Engineer, three Superintending Engineers, sixteen Executive Engineers, and twenty-one Assistant Engineers, besides subordinates. This staff is rather larger than would be retained for simply local requirements; considerable establishments being employed on the river God\u00e1var\u00ed navigation works, and on the road between Jabalp\u00far and N\u00e1gp\u00far, which, pending the completion of the Narb\u00e1da valley extension of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, has been the connecting link between the railway system of Eastern and Western India. The two railways will meet shortly at Jabalp\u00far, north of the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1 plateau, and then the line terminating at N\u00e1gp\u00far, south of the plateau, will sink to the position of a mere branch. Passing, however, through the rich cotton fields of Ber\u00e1r and the Wardh\u00e1.\n\n* There is also a half per cent. cess on land revenue for the maintenance of the district posts, but these are managed by the Post Office authorities, who, like the Telegraph Officers, belong to an Imperial Department, independent of the local Government.\n\n19 cpg\nvalley, and tapping at N\u00e1gpur the teeming grain stores of Chhattisgarh, it will always be an important commercial line, even if it is not eventually connected with the coal and iron fields of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1, which lie some 80 miles to the south. Chhattisgarh is as yet only linked to the Railway system by an unfinished road, but its great capacities as a granary will become yearly more valuable as the grain lands of the N\u00e1gpur plain are invaded by cotton. The plain of Chhattisgarh, in itself rich and fertile, is so hemmed in on all sides but the west by hills and forests that its natural outlet is in the direction of N\u00e1gpur, and therefore the further improvement of the somewhat costly communications between the cotton country and the grain country is only a question of time and price-currents.\n\nAn immense field is therefore left for Engineering enterprise before India can profit to the full by the coal fields, the iron mines, and the long stretches of wheat and rice which are still shut in by their hilly borders. The progress already made will best be realised by remembering that the main thoroughfare* in India for mails and English travellers now traverses a country in which five years ago none but occasional Government officials attempted to move about, and there were no means of transit except by the slow, patriarchal process of daily marches. The effect of the improvement in the communications may also be well illustrated by the course of trade during the last few years.\n\nTrade.\n\nIn 1868-64 the exports and imports of the province were valued at about four millions sterling. In 1868-69 their value had risen to six and three-quarter millions sterling, notwithstanding that the prosperity of the country had been rudely shaken by the general failure of the crops in 1868.\n\nThe principal articles entering into this trade are cotton, grain, and native cloth among exports; and salt, sugar, and English piece-goods among imports. Cotton is the most valuable item of export, while salt is the\n\n* The course of the mails will be diverted in a few days (from 1st April 1870) to the Narbada valley railway.\nchief import. Since the extension of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway to N\u00e1gpur in 1867 the cotton trade has almost deserted its old routes\u2014northward to Mirzapur, and eastward to Cuttack via the Mahanadi,\u2014and has turned almost entirely in the direction of the western coast, where the bales are delivered \"pressed\" in the shape best fitted for marine transport.\n\nThe excellent quality of the Wardha valley staple, which under its brand of \"Hinganghat\" commands a price equal to that quoted for any other Indian cotton, will always give it a good place in the English market, but for some time to come it does not seem likely that the export will exceed 60,000 or 70,000 bales (of 400 lbs.) per annum. Not only is cotton a very sensitive crop, and therefore one on which cultivators hesitate to stake their whole harvest return, but the prices of food-grains have risen so rapidly of late years that it would not pay to bring more land under cotton at present. The best chance for the extension of the cotton culture is in the improvement of communication with Chattisgarh, now divided from N\u00e1gpur by 174 miles of unfinished road. The Chattisgarh plain is a great granary; the Wardha valley is the best cotton field in these parts of India, and when perfect connection is established between the two, it is only reasonable to suppose that each will be enabled, by the division of labour, to fulfil its natural function, and that the Wardha country, having no concern about its food-supplies, will send to England enlarged consignments of cotton, which, returning in their manufactured shape to Chattisgarh, will set free for grain-production men and land now less profitably employed in providing clothing from an inferior local staple. Meanwhile Hinganghat seed has been largely distributed in the most promising localities, and cotton gardens have been established for the purpose of testing the effects of high cultivation on the local varieties of the cotton plant.*\n\n*Among the Administrative Departments the newly created Cotton Department was not specially mentioned, as its sphere of operations is by no means limited to this province. It is but just, however, to record the debt which the cotton industry of the Wardha valley owes to the Cotton Commissioner for the Central Provinces and the Berars.\nThe native cloth manufacture has been severely tried by the development of the cotton trade. In the first years of the scarcity cotton became almost too precious to be worked up into the coarser native fabrics, and the weavers were undersold by the Manchester manufacturers even in their own villages. On the other hand the finer native fabrics absolutely gained by the \"cotton crisis.\" Great part of the wealth poured into the country by the new trade was absorbed in the cotton-producing districts of Ber\u00e1r and the Decan, where the reputation of the fine N\u00e1gp\u00far cloths stands highest, and thus, while in 1863-64 exports to the amount of 60,352 maunds (of 82 lbs.) of native cloth were valued at \u00a3250,056 only, 52,893 maunds exported in 1866-67 reached the high value of \u00a3560,590. In the next year the quotations for raw cotton fell to 5\u00bdd. per lb., and the native manufacture slightly revived in quantity, at the same time falling in gross value. Last year (1868-69) the effects of a disastrous agricultural season and an advance in the price of cotton resulted in a considerable falling off both in bulk and in value.\n\nThe cotton trade at present attracts most notice, but the grain trade of the province is also important and extensive. The exports have of late years amounted to a million maunds (some 170,000 quarters), but against these must be set imports to about a third of that amount; home-grown wheat being exchanged, especially in the southern part of the province, for millet (jav\u00e1ri), which is both an economical and a popular article of food among the labouring classes. Last year (1869) the imports of grain almost equalled the exports in bulk, an extraordinary importation having set in from Ber\u00e1r late in the year to meet the gaps caused by the failure of the harvest. Notwithstanding two bad seasons, however, the export trade has nearly doubled itself within the last six years, and as the quantity exported does not by the most liberal calculation amount to two per cent. of the gross produce, it is certain that the exportable margin will yet very considerably expand.\nThe remaining articles of produce are of minor importance; among them may be mentioned lac, raw or manufactured, amounting in 1868-69 to 40,282 maunds, valued at \u00a358,426; spices and groceries, including chillies, turmeric, coriander, mustard, and other condiments, valued at \u00a348,108; silk cocoons, valued at \u00a318,470; dyes at \u00a322,692; and ghee (clarified butter) at \u00a388,700. This last trade was entirely created by the opening of the railway to Bombay. The aggregate exports of all kinds in 1868-69 represent a quantity carried, exclusive of all through traffic and Government and railway stores, of 88,099 tons, valued at \u00a32,763,421.\n\nTurning to imports, the chief article is salt. The S\u00e1g\u00e1r and Narb\u00e1d\u00e1 territories procure their supply of this necessary of life from the R\u00e1jput\u00e1na lakes, the N\u00e1gp\u00far country from Bombay, and Chhatt\u00edsgarh from the Eastern Coast. In 1868-69 the opening of the Panj\u00e1b Railway to Umballa, and the closure of the Banj\u00e1r\u00e1 carrying routes, from the effects of the drought, gave an opening to the Panj\u00e1b and Delhi salts which can now be imported so cheaply that they are likely to retain their hold of the market. In the six years for which statistics are available the price of salt has risen from four rupees to six rupees per maund, mainly in consequence of the extension of the Inland Customs Line so as to embrace the greater part of the province. The quantity imported, 856,000 maunds, seems, however, sufficient, at six or seven pounds per head, for the ordinary consumption of the people, but it is doubtful whether it allows enough for cattle.\n\nRefined sugar is another article which, being beyond the manufacturing skill of the province, is imported mainly from Mirz\u00e1p\u00far. The imports ordinarily range from 200,000 to 300,000 maunds per annum; but in 1868-69, owing to the general distress, they fell to 190,651 maunds. Next in importance come English piece-goods, which the statistics show by weight instead of by tale. The\naverage import for the last few years has been 45,000 maunds, and, notwithstanding a steady diminution in prices during the last two years, the trade has remained firm. The largest importations are from Bombay, though, since the opening of the East India Railway to Jabalpur, consignments from Calcutta have increased. Tobacco is imported from the Madras Presidency, from Berar, and from the North-Western Provinces to the extent of some 4,000 or 5,000 maunds, valued at \u00a350,000; Spices, such as cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg, black pepper, &c., to the extent of 66,000 maunds, valued at \u00a3102,420; Silk pieces to the extent of 2,791 maunds, valued at \u00a3186,527; Cocoanuts, mainly from Western Coast, to the value of \u00a3187,085. Altogether the imports for 1868-69 amounted to 120,990 tons, valued at \u00a34,031,842. According to the statistics, they have more than doubled both in bulk and in weight in five years, but allowance must be made for the greater completeness of the later statistics and for some uncertainty in the valuation, which in case of imports is not always reliable.\n\nWithout, then, insisting too much upon the share which the efforts of Sir Richard Temple and his successors have had in forcing the country forward, it is evident that in the rapid extension of trade and communication with the outer world during the last few years, the Central Provinces have been under the influence of stimulating agencies which would have disturbed the sleep of barbarism itself. Under the heights on which the half-tamed aboriginal Kings perched their rude stronghold has grown up a large commercial city, and the centre of the railway system of India. Chattisgarh, till lately only known to orthodox Hind\u00fas as a hateful abode of witchcraft and dissent, is now \"the land of the threshing-floors,\" the granary of Central India. Hinganghat, in the valley of the Wardha\u2014a country so obscure as to be absolutely without a history till within the last century\u2014has become a household word in the markets of Liverpool. Ch\u00e2nd\u00e1, the most remote and wild of all the Gond principalities, is now a familiar name not only\nwith Government officials, but among men of science and men of business, and with her rare combination of coal, iron, and cotton, promises to become one of the chief industrial centres of India.\n\nAll these changes\u2014all this rush of light and air\u2014have taken place within the last decade. The first four-fifths of our half century of rule, after we had once learned that the country was no El-Dorado, but needed careful nursing to restore it even to moderate prosperity, passed in a sort of conservative quiescence, which, in its dread of interference, stereotyped existing customs and institutions. For better or worse our ideal has changed. It was indeed impossible that as Western civilisation crept up by degrees from either coast, even these secluded valleys should in the end escape its influence, and when, owing to that very central position which had so long retarded access to them, they all at once became the keystone of the system of communication between the Eastern and Western seas, the first tumultuous throbbing and pulsation of new life came upon them with almost overwhelming rapidity and suddenness. Within less than ten years the conditions of life to the mass of the people have undergone a complete revolution. The food-grains which were once so plentiful, that in good seasons farmers could hardly get labour to carry their harvests, are now jealously stored for export, and meted out at what would have been thought famine prices. The cotton of the N\u00e1gp\u00far plain, which was worked up by thousands of village looms into a fabric so durable as to make its cost a matter of secondary importance, and yet so cheap as to be within the reach of all, is now eagerly bought up to be packed by steam-presses, and sent across the seas to England, to France, to Germany, and even to Russia. In short, food has trebled and clothing has doubled in price within the last ten years; and a life of rude plenty and implicit dependence on the bounty of nature has been perforce exchanged for a constant exercise of foresight and prudence. On the other hand, if prices are high they are regular; food, though seldom superabundant, at least never runs altogether short, as in the old days of alternate waste and famine; foreign luxuries and adjuncts of civilisation are\ncomparatively accessible, and the standard of wages has fully kept pace with the cost of living. Thus the people have gained new powers of resistance, and live easily under a burthen which would have crushed their fathers.\n\nMany a laudator temporis acti no doubt still looks back to the day when food seemed to drop into his mouth, nine years out of ten, without exertion; forgetting that terrible tenth season when capricious nature held back her hand, and there were no means of procuring aid from without; forgetting the yearly tale of victims yielded without a struggle to cholera and small-pox; and perhaps scarcely caring to remember or appreciate the many roads which competition and progress are daily opening to him out of the dead level to which inexorable custom had hitherto restricted his career. But it matters little now to balance the passive delights of a life of brutish ease, chequered only by the whims of nature, against the higher, if more hardly earned, advantages, which not even toil and forethought can win till a field is opened to their efforts. Events have decided the question for themselves. The interests of the empire required the connection of the two seaport capitals; the empty factories of half the world demanded access to the only cotton fields which bid fair to replace the devastated plantations of the Confederate States. The day had passed even for the most retrograde policy to attempt any check on the advancing tide and struggle of life. It only remained to fit the people for the new order of things, and to ensure them their share in the benefits which it brought, by providing for them an education which should give them a fair standing ground in their dealings with intellects sharpened in a more stirring school, and by showing them practically that the issues of health and prosperity were not altogether beyond human grasp. No criticisms can be more misplaced than those which brand the administrative efforts of the last eight years\u2014made to meet changes so sudden and great as those through which the country is passing\u2014with the charges of precipitancy and over-ambitiousness. If the schools, the hospitals, the post-offices, the roads, the railways, the courts, and the numberless other public\ninstitutions which have sprung up since the formation of the Central Provinces could be doubled in number and efficiency; if the measures of reform to which the governing staff of the province have devoted their energies and abilities\u2014nay sometimes even their health and their very lives\u2014could be enlarged and intensified beyond the most sanguine hopes of their originators, the guardians of the young province would still have but a very incomplete account to render of their stewardship; and indeed they may well feel content if the foundations laid by eight years' labour with untrained instruments, and in a difficult soil, prove wide enough for the wants of a growing people, and stable enough to bear a superstructure worthy of a more advanced civilisation.\n\nCHARLES GRANT.\n\nNagpur, 31st March 1870.\nTHE\n\nCENTRAL PROVINCES GAZETTEER.\n\nABHA'NA'\u2014A village on the Jabalp\u00far and Damoh road in the Damoh district, fifty-two miles from the former and eleven miles from the latter place. There is a large tank here, which abounds in fish and water-fowl. Supplies are procurable, and there is a good encamping-ground in the neighbourhood.\n\nADE'GA'ON\u2014A zamind\u00e1ri in the north-east corner of the Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 district, formerly a portion of the Harai chiefship, and transferred by the Harai family to one Kharak Bh\u00e1rt\u00ed, a Gos\u00e1in, who was s\u00faba of Jabalp\u00far, Mandla, and Seoni in A.D. 1801. His successors still hold it. The bulk of it is jungle and hill; but part of the eastern side is tolerably open, and is well cultivated. It consists of eighty-nine villages.\n\nADIA'L\u2014A small village in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, situated eight miles to the south-west of Brahmapur\u00ed, and possessing a very fine irrigation-reservoir.\n\nA'GAR\u2014A stream in the Bil\u00e1sp\u00far district, which, rising in the Maikal range, flows through the Pandari\u00e9 chiefship and the Mung\u00e9l\u00ed pargana, past the town of Mung\u00e9l\u00ed itself, and falls into the Mani\u00e1ri near the village of K\u00fakusd\u00e1. Except in floods it is a very insignificant stream, and is not navigable.\n\nAGARIA'\u2014A village in the Jabalp\u00far district, about twenty miles to the north-east of Jabalp\u00far near Majhgaw\u00e1n. There is an iron mine here.\n\nAH\u00cd'RI\u2014A zamind\u00e1ri constituting the southern portion of the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district. It is bounded on the north by the Arpall\u00ed and Ghot pargana, east by Bastar, south by Sironch\u00e1 and Bastar, and west by the Pranh\u00edt\u00e1 river; and contains an area of about 2,550 square miles. It is hilly on the east and south, the most noted elevations being the Surj\u00e1g\u00e1rh, B\u00e1mr\u00e1g\u00e1rh, and D\u00e9walmar\u00ed hills; and is famed for its magnificent forests. Much of the teak has been felled, but there still remain thousands of full-grown and half-grown teak trees. The inhabitants are almost wholly Gonds, and the languages spoken are Gond\u00ed and Telug\u00fa. The zamind\u00e1r\u00edn, S\u00e1vitr\u00ed B\u00e1i, resides chiefly at the village of Ah\u00edri, seventy miles south-east of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1. She is the first in rank of the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 zamind\u00e1rs, and is connected with the family of the Gond kings.\nAHIRI\u2014A forest in the chiefship of the same name, in the southern portion of the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, on the left bank of the Pranh\u00edt\u00e1 river. Negotiations are in progress for leasing the forest from the chief on the part of government. Before it can be systematically worked, however, considerable outlay will be necessary to make it accessible from Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 or from some point on the river God\u00e1var\u00ed. Ahiri was first visited by the conservator of forests, Major Pearson, early in 1867, and he then pronounced it to be one of the very finest teak forests in India, and certainly one which, considering the immense amount of timber taken out of it, had suffered as little as any. Although, however, the whole country from the junction of the Waingang\u00e1 and Wardh\u00e1 is covered with teak, the trees in the plains are generally unsound, ill-developed, and crooked, the only valuable timber being found in and around a block of hills which lies between the villages of Kors\u00e9n\u00e1, Bemaram, Jhilmili, and Talw\u00e1r\u00e1. The two blocks of forest which it is proposed to reserve have been named Bemaram and Mirkall\u00fa.\n\nAIRI\u2014A teak plantation in the Mandla district, about five square miles in extent, and now under the charge of the forest department. It is favourably situated in an angle formed by the junction of the Burhner and H\u00e1lon. The planting operations are supervised by a European forester.\n\nAJMI'RGARH\u2014A hill in the Bil\u00e1sp\u00far district adjoining Amarkantak. It is about 3,500 feet above the sea, and has an open surface on the top, but the summit is difficult of access. It has at one time been fortified.\n\nALBA'KA\u2014The chief village of an estate of the same name in the Upper God\u00e1var\u00ed district. It is situated on the God\u00e1var\u00ed, forty miles to the north of Dumagudem. The naib or deputy of the zamind\u00e1r is the chief local authority, and resides here. There is a small thatched travellers' bungalow about half a mile to the south-east of the village. The population is about 250, and consists of Kois and Telingas. The water-supply is from the river and a large tank close to the village. There are some Indo-Scythian remains, Cromlechs, &c. on the hills close to the village and in its vicinity.\n\nALEWA'HI\u2014A small village in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, with a very fine irrigation-reservoir twenty-four miles south-west of Brahmap\u00far.\n\nALIPUR\u2014A village in the Hingangh\u00e1t tahsil of the Wardh\u00e1 district, sixteen miles to the south of Wardh\u00e1. It is perhaps the finest agricultural village in Wardh\u00e1, and contains 3,303 inhabitants, of whom 1,382 are cultivators. There are besides a considerable number of weavers and spinners. Alipur was founded by the Naw\u00e1b Sal\u00e1b\u00e1t Kh\u00e1n of Ellichp\u00far, whose family held the land in j\u00e1gir till about fifty years ago. It is now held in m\u00e1lguz\u00e1r\u00ed tenure by M\u00e1dh\u00f3 R\u00e1o Gang\u00e1dhar Chitnav\u00eds, late chief secretary to the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 government. It is famed for its irrigation and the number of wells in use, and is surrounded by mango-groves and gardens. Here is a mosque at which there is a small semi-religious fair every March. The chief works carried out from municipal funds have been the clearing and levelling of the market-place in the centre of the town, and the construction of a village school, which is well attended. The municipality support their own police and conservancy establishments. There is a good weekly market here every Tuesday for agricultural produce.\n\nALMOD\u2014A chiefship in the Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d district, consisting of twenty-nine villages, situated in and round the Mah\u00e1deo group of hills. The zamind\u00e1r\nis one of the Bhop\u00e1s, or hereditary guardians of the Mah\u00e1deo temples. He receives an allowance from the government of Rs. 200 annually in lieu of pilgrim tax, against which is debited a quit-rent on his estate of Rs. 40.\n\nALON\u2014A river in the Seoni district, which takes its rise near the village of Pemp\u00far (pargana Lakhn\u00e1don) and flows from west to east into the Th\u00e1nwar. It has an affluent called the Panchmon\u00ed. No villages of any note are situated on the banks of the Alon, and the country through which it passes is hilly and wild. This unimportant stream is not to be confounded with the H\u00e1l\u00f3n.\n\nAMARKANTAK\u2014A hill which, though lately transferred to Rew\u00e1, with the Soh\u00e1gp\u00far pargana, naturally forms part of the Bil\u00e1jp\u00far district. It attains an altitude of 3,500 feet above the sea, and has a very pleasant climate. The objects of interest are the temples round the sources of the sacred Narbad\u00e1, and the waterfalls.\n\nAMARW\u00c1RA\u2014A large village in the Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 district, once the capital of the pargana. A police force is stationed here, and there is a pretty good government school. Amarw\u00e1r\u00e1 is on the main road to Narsinghp\u00far, and is about fifty miles from that place. The population amounts to over a thousand souls.\n\nAMB\u2014A river which takes its rise in the hills eastward of Umrer in the N\u00e1gp\u00far district, and, flowing past the town of Umrer, reaches the Waingang\u00e1 at Ambhor\u00e1 in the same district.\n\nAMB\u00c1'GARH CHAUK\u00cd\u2014A zam\u00edn\u00e1d\u00e1r\u00ed situated on the north-east frontier of the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district. It is of considerable extent, and towards the R\u00e1ip\u00far side is fairly cultivated. Most of it is, however, hilly, and large tracts are covered with jungle. Excellent iron ore is found here. Amb\u00e1g\u00e1rh is inhabited by Gonds, with a sprinkling of Gaul\u00eds; and the languages spoken are the Gond\u00ed and the Chhattisgarhi dialect of Hindi. The zam\u00edn\u00e1d\u00e1r, Umr\u00e1o Singh, is the third in rank of the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 chiefs, and resides at Chaukt\u00ed, twenty-two miles north-east of Wair\u00e1garh. An assistant patrol of the customs department is posted at the village.\n\nAMBGA'ON is the north-eastern pargana of the M\u00e1l tahsil in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, and contains, with its dependent zam\u00edn\u00e1d\u00e1r\u00eds (excluding Ah\u00edr\u00ed), an area of about 1,212 square miles. It is bounded on the north by the Wair\u00e1garh pargana, east by Bastar, south by Arpall\u00ed with Ghot, and west by the Waingang\u00e1; and contains 67 villages and 4 zam\u00edn\u00e1d\u00e1r\u00eds. It is hilly, and, except in the vicinity of the Waingang\u00e1, consists of red or sandy soil, covered with dense jungle. It is much intersected with tributaries of the Waingang\u00e1, the largest of which are the K\u00e1men, the Potpur\u00ed, and the Kur\u00far. Its staples are rice, jungle produce, and tas\u00e1r silk; and it carries on considerable trade in salt with the east coast. In the south Telugu is chiefly spoken, which yields to Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 on the north; but the traders all over the pargana are Telinges. Of the agricultural classes the most numerous are Kunb\u00eds, K\u00e1piw\u00e1rs, and Son Tell\u00eds. The principal towns are Garhchirol\u00ed and Ch\u00e1murs\u00ed; and the village of M\u00e1rkand\u00ed is noted for its ancient and beautiful group of temples.\n\nAMBGA'ON\u2014A village in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district. It was once the capital of the pargana, but is now a dreary-looking place, consisting of a hundred huts, shut in by dense jungle. It has two ancient temples, one dedicated to Mah\u00e1dcva, and the other to Mah\u00e1k\u00e1l\u00ed, and possesses also two tanks.\nA'MGA'ON\u2014The chief place in the chiefship of that name in the Bhand\u00e1ra district. It has a large weekly market, and is to some extent an entrep\u00f4t for goods from the Khair\u00e1gah chiefship in R\u00e9p\u00far. Near A'mg\u00e1on itself extend miles of low rocky jungle, infested with panthers, and the chiefship generally is rather noted for the number of man-eating tigers which have been killed within its limits from time to time. Kunbis preponderate among the population, as the zam\u00ednd\u00e1r belongs to that class. The climate is considered unfavourable, and the well-water is usually brackish. The chief resides with his adoptive mother in an old walled enclosure, dignified by the name of a fort, and he is one of the most advanced pupils, and chief supporter of the flourishing government school at A'mg\u00e1on. There are some curious old remains of massive stone buildings in the neighbourhood at a place called Padmap\u00far, but their origin is unknown.\n\nA'MGA'ON\u2014An estate in the eastern portion of the Bhand\u00e1ra district, which originally formed part of that of K\u00e1mth\u00e1. It consists of fifty-three villages, embracing an area of 146 square miles, of which forty-seven are under cultivation. The population numbers 21,543 souls.\n\nA'MLA'\u2014A village in the Bet\u00fal district, situated about eighteen miles from Badn\u00far on the Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 road. It contains 368 houses, with a population of 1,616 souls, and is the head-quarters of a considerable trade in brass utensils. There are some old tombs, said to be those of Gond kings.\n\nA'NDHALGA'ON\u2014A town about sixteen miles north-east of Bhand\u00e1ra in the district of the same name. It had a population by the last census of 3,270 souls. The cotton fabrics manufactured here are in good repute. There is a large and flourishing government school in the town, and conservancy is carried out from the municipal funds. The water-supply is good, and the place is considered to be healthy.\n\nANDHA'RI'\u2014A river in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district; it has three main branches, the first rising in the eastern slopes of the Perz\u00e1gah hills, the second near Bh\u00eds\u00ed, and the third in the Chim\u00far hills. The first and second unite at Karamg\u00e1on, and are joined by the third near Jh\u00e1m; and the river falls into the Waingang\u00e1 a little south of Gh\u00e1tk\u00fal, after a course from north to south, measuring in a straight line, of sixty-five miles.\n\nANDORI'\u2014A large agricultural village in the Huz\u00far tahsil of the Wardh\u00e1 district, containing 1,165 inhabitants, and standing on the bank of the river Wardh\u00e1 about eighteen miles south of Wardh\u00e1 town. Under the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 rule it gave its name to a pargana, but the kam\u00e1visd\u00e1r or revenue officer in charge held his court at W\u00e1ig\u00e1on. It contains a village school and a police outpost.\n\nANHONI'\u2014In the Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d district. Here is a hot spring, nearly due north of the Mah\u00e1deo hills, at the edge of the outer range, which divides the Denw\u00e1 from the Narbad\u00e1 valley; it is said to be good for boils and skin diseases, and is much visited. There is another hot spring south-east of Anhon\u00ed, about sixteen miles off, known as Mah\u00e1ljhir, which is said to be too hot to dip the hand into.\n\nANJII'\u2014A town in the Wardh\u00e1 subdivision of the Wardh\u00e1 district, on the left bank of the river Dh\u00e1m, about nine miles north-west of Wardh\u00e1. It was quite a small village until the time of the Bhonsl\u00e1 rule, when the present mud fort was erected, and the government officials exerted themselves to attract\nsettlers. It then became the principal place of a pargana; but latterly the kam\u00e1visd\u00e1r, or pargana revenue officer under the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 rule, held his court at \u00c1rv\u00ed. It suffered also from being looted by the Pindh\u00e1ris. The population amounts to 2,769 souls, principally cultivators, with a few weavers. Octroi is levied here, and a raised weighing-place, within a gravelled enclosure, for weighing cotton, has been constructed out of the municipal funds. A good weekly market is held here on Thursdays; and the cloth woven and dyed in the town forms a chief object of trade. There is a vernacular town school; and the municipality maintain their own town police.\n\nANKUSA'\u2014A village in the Upper God\u00e1var\u00ed district, seventeen miles from Sironch\u00e1, on the road to Dumagudem. There is a village school here. The water-supply, which is inferior, is derived from two small tanks close to the village. The population is 550, chiefly Telingas; one shop.\n\n\u00c1RANG\u2014A town on the Mah\u00e1nadi, in the R\u00e1jp\u00far district, comprising 1,044 houses and 2,267 inhabitants. It has declined since the tahsild\u00e1r's court was removed from it to R\u00e1jp\u00far, about 1863. There are, however, a good number of commercial residents; and a large trade in metal vessels is carried on. The soil in the neighbourhood is very productive, but the population is scanty. The town contains some ruins of temples and old tanks, as it was formerly one of the seats of the Haihai Bans\u00ed R\u00e1jput dynasty. One of the temples is Jain, and believed to be of considerable antiquity. There are immense groves of mango trees around \u00c1rang, in which tigers to the present day occasionally take up their abode; and to the north of the town are extensive foundations of brick buildings, showing that the place was formerly of greater extent than it is at present. There is a branch dispensary, with a native doctor, here; also an assistant patrol of the customs department.\n\nARJUNI'\u2014An estate in the Bhand\u00e1ra district, consisting of ten villages, traversed by the Great Eastern road, and lying about twelve miles east of S\u00e1kol\u00ed. It has an area of 13,889 acres, of which 2,633 are cultivated. The population amounts to 2,183 souls. The present chief, Anant R\u00e1m, is a Gond by caste: hence this class preponderate. The village of Arjun\u00ed is the chief place in this estate, and possesses an indigenous school and a government police post.\n\nARMORI'\u2014The third town in commercial rank in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, situated in the Wair\u00e9garh pargana on the left bank of the Waingang\u00e1, about eighty miles north-east of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1. Arm\u00f3ri manufactures fine and coarse cloth, country carts, and tasar thread; and is pr\u00e9tendently a mart at which forest produce, cattle, and iron from the wild eastern tracts are exchanged for the commodities of the western countries. Its foreign trade is with Ber\u00e1r, Wardh\u00e1, N\u00e1gpur, Bhand\u00e1ra, Chhatt\u00edsgarh, Bastar, and the eastern coast, and during the rains it carries on some small boat traffic on the Waingang\u00e1. Octroi is levied in the town, the farm of which for 1866-67 realized Rs. 2,000. It possesses a police outpost, and government schools for boys and girls, and a handsome market-place is now in process of construction.\n\nARPA'\u2014A stream rising in the rugged range north of Kend\u00e1 in the Bil\u00e1sp\u00far district. After pursuing a southerly course past the town of Bil\u00e1sp\u00far it falls into the Seo near a village called Urtam in the same district. It is not navigable, though its waters are to some extent utilized for purposes of irrigation. In the dry months the stream is very insignificant, but during the monsoon at floods it carries a large volume of water.\nARPALLI' (with Ghor), the south-eastern pargana of the M\u00e1l tahsil of the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district. It has an area of about 440 square miles. It is bounded on the north by the A'mbg\u00e1on pargana and the P\u00e1wi Mut\u00e1nd\u00ed zam\u00ednd\u00e1ri, on the east by Ah\u00edr\u00ed, on the south by Ah\u00edr\u00ed and the Pranh\u00edt\u00e1, and on the west by the Waingang\u00fa and A'mbg\u00e1on. The formation is granitic and metamorphic; the typical rocks being granite, gneiss, and hornblende schists, through which run masses of quartz, evidently metalliferous. The country is hilly, affording countless sites for irrigation-reservoirs, and is watered by numerous streams, many of which are fed by perennial springs. The soil is chiefly a sandy loam richly impregnated with vegetable mould, for hill, plain, and valley are covered with forest, in which tend\u00fa, mhowa, ach\u00e1r, \u00e1\u00edn, dhaur\u00e1, karam, and bamboo are the most common, while teak and shisham, straight but of small girth, are found in the vicinity of the Pranh\u00edt\u00e1 and on most of the hill spurs. The pargana contains eighty-one villages, the principal being Ghot, which is a thriving place, with a considerable stretch of sugarcane fields; and there are several well-to-do villages along the banks of the Waingang\u00fa and Pranh\u00edt\u00e1 and about Arpalli; but excluding these, most of the villages in the pargana are mere small clearings tenanted by M\u00e1r\u00edas.\n\n\u00c1RV\u00cd\u2014A town in the Wardh\u00e1 district, situated near the head of the Wardh\u00e1 valley, about 34 miles north-west of Wardh\u00e1. Under the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 government the kam\u00e1visd\u00e1r in charge of the \u00c1'nj\u00ed pargana used to hold court here, and now it is the head-quarters of the \u00c1'rv\u00ed tahsil and police circle. It is said to have been founded some three hundred years ago by Telang R\u00e1o Wali, and his name is still associated with the place, which is often styled at length \u00c1'rv\u00ed Telang R\u00e1o. Hind\u00fas claim Telang R\u00e1o as a Br\u00e1hman, and Mohammadans as a fellow-religionist of their own: hence both sects worship at his tomb, which has been converted into a handsome shrine by contributions from the cotton merchants and other townspeople. \u00c1'rv\u00ed at present contains 8,256 inhabitants, of whom the bulk are cultivators and day-labourers; but there are also 294 merchants, besides smaller tradesmen, 578 oilmen, and 249 weavers.\n\nThe following statement of imports and exports for 1868-69 shows that it is a considerable trading town:\n\n| Imports\u2014 | Maunds of 80 lbs each | Value Rs. |\n|----------|----------------------|-----------|\n| Cotton.  | 108,176              | 986,861   |\n| Sugar-cane produce. | 16,211               | 389,445   |\n| Grain.   | 6,683                | 57,724    |\n| Oil Seeds. | 55,622               | 162,824   |\n| Ghee and Oil. | 13,112               | 50,291    |\n| Country Cloth. | 4,860                | 125,916   |\n| English Piece Goods. | 539                  | 53,904    |\n| Spices.  | 181                  | 32,650    |\n| Cattle.  | 991                  | 18,523    |\n| No. 744  |                      | 7,440     |\n\n| Exports\u2014 | Maunds of 80 lbs each | Value Rs. |\n|----------|----------------------|-----------|\n| Cotton.  | 90,326               | 843,084   |\n| Sugar-cane produce. | 16,583               | 392,200   |\n| Grain.   | 4,114                | 30,671    |\n| Oil Seeds. | 36,434               | 103,594   |\n| Ghee and Oil. | 13,679               | 68,420    |\n| Country Cloth. | 6,224                | 143,112   |\n| English Piece Goods. | 256                  | 25,625    |\n| Spices.  | 103                  | 10,300    |\n| Cattle.  | 472                  | 9,340     |\n|          |                      | 14,343    |\nMuch has been done for the town from municipal funds. The main street, which has been widened and metalled, leads into a market-place recently laid out, whence a fine broad street with trees on each side leads past the tahsild\u00e1r's court-house to the Wardh\u00e1 valley road, which passes through the outskirts of the town. A range of dispensary buildings has been constructed after the standard plan, and a substantial sar\u00e1i, with sets of rooms for European travellers, has been commenced. Then a metalled cotton yard has been laid out, with raised platforms for weighing cotton. The avenues and clumps of young trees planted have been well tended, and already begin to add to the appearance of the town. The municipal garden is, next to that at head-quarters, the best in the district. \u00c1rv\u00ed contains more substantial houses than most towns in Wardh\u00e1, even the huts of the poor being generally tiled. There is an Anglo-Vernacular town school here, which is well attended; and the municipality supports a conservancy establishment.\n\n\u00c1RV\u00cd\u2014A revenue subdivision of the Wardh\u00e1 district, having an area of 868 square miles, with 489 villages, and a population of 110,595 according to the census of 1866. The land revenue of the tahsil for 1869-70 is Rs. 1,52,511.\n\nASARALLI\u2014A village in the Upper God\u00e1var\u00ed district, twenty miles to the east of Sironch\u00e1 on the road to Dumagudem. The road from this to Sironch\u00e1 has been well cleared. There is a village school here, also a thatched travellers' bungalow west of the village. From this to Somn\u00far, the junction of the Indr\u00e1vat\u00ed and God\u00e1var\u00ed, it is six miles. The population is about 450. The water-supply is inferior, there being one well only and a small tank. There is, however, a large tank about a mile and a half to the west. A road from this branches to Bh\u00fap\u00falpatnam, distant about twenty-five miles north-east. P\u00e1lk\u00ed bearers can be obtained here if some previous notice be given. A ferry is open, except in the rainy season, to P\u00e1lmil\u00e1, on the opposite bank of the God\u00e1var\u00ed. The village itself is a mile and a half from the God\u00e1var\u00ed.\n\n\u00c1SHT\u00cd\u2014A large town in the Wardh\u00e1 district, containing 5,224 inhabitants. It lies 18 miles north of \u00c1rv\u00ed and 52 miles north-west of Wardh\u00e1, just below the southern offshoots of the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1 range. It is an old town, and tradition says that it was thriving at the time when the Gaul\u00eds were lords of the country, but that when their rule ended the place went to waste. The Emperor Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr gave the \u00c1sht\u00ed, \u00c1mner, Paun\u00e1r, and Tal\u00e9g\u00e1o\u00f1 (Ber\u00e1r) parganas in j\u00e1g\u00edr to Mohammad Kh\u00e1n Ni\u00e1z\u00ed, an Afgh\u00e1n noble who held high rank both under Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr and his predecessor. He restored \u00c1sht\u00ed, and brought the country round under cultivation. He died in 1037 Fasl\u00ed, or 241 years ago, and was buried at \u00c1sht\u00ed. A handsome mausoleum was built over the grave in the Moghal style. Mohammad Kh\u00e1n was succeeded by Ahmad Kh\u00e1n Ni\u00e1z\u00ed, who after ruling over the territories above mentioned for fourteen years died in 1061 Fasl\u00ed. A similar mausoleum was erected over his tomb, but smaller and of inferior workmanship. The two stand side by side within an enclosure, and are the sights of \u00c1sht\u00ed. They are indeed striking monuments of art to find in such a remote spot as this. After the death of Ahmad Kh\u00e1n the power of the Ni\u00e1z\u00eds gradually declined; in time \u00c1sht\u00ed itself passed from their hands into the possession of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 officials, and now nothing remains to them save a few rent-free fields, sufficient merely for their subsistence. The tombs of their ancestors were already falling into disrepair owing to the poverty of the family, when they were taken in hand by the district authorities as worthy objects\nof local interest, and restored from municipal funds. Lately, in consideration of the past history of the family and the local respect which it commands, the Government conferred on Naw\u00e1b W\u00e1hid Kh\u00e1n, one of its representatives in A'sht\u00ed, the powers of an honorary magistrate. The bulk of the inhabitants are agriculturists, but a good trade is carried on in country cloth, grain, saccharine produce, spices, and cotton. The municipal income has been expended on various works, among others damming the stream which passes through the town, so as to retain a supply of water through the hot weather. The dam has been so placed as to bring the reservoir just below the height on which the tombs of the Naw\u00e1bs stand, and the effect is very good; a market-place has also been levelled to the left of this reservoir, and the weekly market there held is well attended. The town contains an Anglo-Vernacular town school, and a suitable school-house has been erected after the standard plan. There is also a police station-house under a head constable.\n\nA'SHT\u00cd\u2014A small block of teak forest in the Wardh\u00e1 district, which from its neighbourhood to well-populated towns has been much exhausted. The tract has been reserved as a State Forest more in view to preserve the large number of teak saplings on the ground than for the sake of any valuable timber which it now contains.\n\nA'SIRGARH\u2014A strong fortress situated on an isolated hill in the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1 range; height 850 feet from the base, and 2,300 feet above the sea level; it is twenty-nine and a half miles south-west from Khandw\u00e1, the head-quarters of the Nim\u00e1r district, and is situated in latitude 21\u00b0 26' and longitude 76\u00b0 20'.\n\nThe following description of the fortress, which holds good to this day, is given by Colonel Blacker, in his history of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 campaigns of 1817 to 1819:\n\n\"The upper fort in its greatest length from west to east is about eleven hundred yards, and its extreme breadth from north to south about six hundred, but owing to the irregularity of its shape the area will not be found more than three hundred thousand square yards (60 acres). It crowns the top of a detached hill seven hundred and fifty feet in height; and round the foot of the wall enclosing the area is a bluff precipice from eighty to one hundred and twenty feet in perpendicular depth, so well scarped as to leave no avenues of ascent except at two places. To fortify these has therefore been the principal care in constructing the upper fort, for the wall which skirts the precipices is no more than a low curtain, except where the guns are placed in battery. This is one of the few hill-forts possessing an abundant supply of water which is not commanded within common range, but it fully participates in the common disadvantage attending similar places of strength, by affording cover in every direction to the approaches of an enemy through the numerous ravines by which its inferior ramifications are separated. In one of these which terminates within the upper fort is the northern avenue, where the hill is highest, and to bar the access to the place at that point, an outer rampart, containing four casements with embrasures, eighteen feet high, as many thick, and one hundred and ninety feet long, crosses it from one part of the interior wall to another, where a reentering angle is formed by the works. A sally-port of extraordinary construction descends through the rock at the south-eastern extremity, and is easily blocked on necessity, by dropping down materials at certain stages which are open to the top. The principal avenue of the fort is on the south-west side, where there is consequently a double line\nof works above, the lower of which, twenty-five feet in height, runs along\nthe foot of the bluff precipice, and the entrance passes through five gate-\nways by a steep ascent of stone steps. The masonry here is uncommonly\nfine, as the natural impediments are, on this side, least difficult, and on this\naccount a third line of works, called the lower fort, embraces an inferior\nbranch of the hill immediately above the pettah. The wall is about thirty\nfeet in height, with towers, and at its northern and southern extremities\nit ascends to connect itself with the upper works. The pettah, which is by\nno means large, has a partial wall on the southern side, where there is a\ngate, but in other quarters it is open and surrounded by ravines and deep\nhollows extending far in every direction.\"\n\nThe chief points in the early history of the fort and surrounding country\nwill be found in the article on the Nim\u00e1r district. The Mohammadan historian\nFarishta* states that the fort was built by a herdsman named A's\u00e1 Ah\u00edr, who\nheld it when the Mohammadans conquered the country (A.D. 1370), and\nwhose ancestors had possessed it for seven hundred years previously. He is\nsaid to have been the landholder of the whole surrounding country, and to have\npossessed large wealth in cattle and grain stores. But it seems probable that\nFarishta invented the story as an ingenious etymological explanation of the\nname A's\u00edr. A's\u00e1 Gaul\u00ed is in fact a fabulous character of Western India, classed\nin the popular idea along with the P\u00e1ndava brothers; and, as all old forts are\nattributed by tradition to the pastoral tribes, who doubtless at an early period\noccupied India, Farishta probably saw no harm in advancing the mythical\nA's\u00e1 a few thousand years to fit his story. We know that A's\u00edr was in fact\noccupied by R\u00e1jputs to within a short time of the Mohammadan invasion, it\nbeing frequently mentioned by name in R\u00e1jput poetry, and Al\u00e1-u-dd\u00edn having\ntaken it from the Chauh\u00e1ns during his Deccan raid in A.D. 1295 (vide article\n\"Nim\u00e1r\").\u2020 Ab-ul-fazl, who wrote a few years before Farishta, says, with more\nprobability, that when the F\u00e1r\u00fak\u00eds established their kingdom of Kh\u00e1ndesh\nthere were only a few people in A's\u00edrgarh, which was a place of worship of\nAsvatth\u00e1m\u00e1. It is so still, and is mentioned as such in the Mah\u00e1bharat.\nA's\u00edrgarh fell into the hands of the F\u00e1r\u00fak\u00ed princes of Kh\u00e1ndesh about A.D. 1400,\nand was by them greatly strengthened, the lower fort called Mala\u00edgarh having\nbeen entirely constructed by A'dil Kh\u00e1n I., the fourth of the dynasty. A's\u00edrgarh\nwas frequently the safe retreat of the F\u00e1r\u00fak\u00ed princes when their territory was\ninvaded by the different independent Mohammadan kings of Gujar\u00e1t and the\nDeccan. It remained in their possession for 200 years, till in A.D. 1600 the\ngreat Akbar, emperor of Delhi, conquered M\u00e1lw\u00e1 and Kh\u00e1ndesh, taking the last\nof the F\u00e1r\u00fak\u00eds, Bah\u00e1dur Kh\u00e1n, in A's\u00edrgarh, after a siege which is thus\ndescribed by the historian Farishta\u2021\u2014\n\n\"When Akbar P\u00e1dsh\u00e1h arrived at M\u00e1nd\u00fa with the avowed intention of\ninvading the Deccan, Bah\u00e1dur Kh\u00e1n instead of adopting the policy of his\nfather in relying on the honour of Akbar, and going with an army to\ncooperate with him, shut himself up in the fort of A's\u00edr and commenced\npreparations to withstand a siege. To this end he invited fifteen thou-\nsand persons, including labourers, artizans, and shopkeepers, into the place,\nand filled it with horses and cattle in order that they might serve for work,\n\n---\n\n* Brigge' Farishta, vol. iv. p. 287. Ed. 1829.\n\u2020 Ain-i-Akbari History of S\u00edba D\u00e1des.\n\u2021 Brigge' Farishta, vol. iv. p. 325. Ed. 1829.\nand eventually for food and other purposes. When Akbar P\u00e1dsh\u00e1h heard of these proceedings he sent orders to Kh\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n\u00e1n and to prince D\u00e1n\u00edl Mirz\u00e1 to continue the siege of A\u2019hm\u00e1dnagar, while he himself marched to the south and occupied Burh\u00e1np\u00far, leaving one of his generals to besiege A\u2019s\u00edr. The blockade of this fortress continued for a length of time till the air became fetid from filth, and an epidemic disease raged, caused by the number of cattle which daily died. At this period a report was spread, and generally believed in by the garrison, that Akbar had the power of reducing forts by necromancy, and that magicians accompanied him for that purpose. Bah\u00e1dur Kh\u00e1n, believing that his misfortunes arose from the abovementioned cause, took no means to counteract the evils by which he was surrounded. He neither gave orders for the removal of the dead cattle, for the establishment of hospitals, nor for sending out useless persons, till at length the soldiers, worn out, became quite careless on duty, and the Moghals stormed and carried the lower fort called Malaighar. Nothing could exceed the infatuation of Bah\u00e1dur Kh\u00e1n, who, although he had ten years\u2019 grain, and money to an enormous amount, still kept the troops in arrears; and they, seeing that no redress was to be expected, resolved to seize him and deliver him over to Akbar P\u00e1dsh\u00e1h. Before this project was carried into effect Bah\u00e1dur Kh\u00e1n discovered the plot, and consulted his officers, who all agreed that it was too late to think of a remedy. The pestilence raged with great fury, the troops were completely exhausted, and nothing remained but to open negotiations for the surrender of the fort, on condition that the lives of the garrison should be spared, and that they should march out with their property. The terms were acceded to, with the exception of the last propositions regarding the Kh\u00e1n\u2019s private property, all of which fell into the king\u2019s hands; and Bah\u00e1dur Kh\u00e1n, the last of the F\u00e1r\u00faki dynasty, humbled himself before the throne of Akbar P\u00e1dsh\u00e1h in A.H. 1008.; while the impregnable fortress of A\u2019s\u00edr, with ten years\u2019 provisions, and countless treasures, fell into the hands of the conqueror.\u201d\n\nA vainglorious inscription cut in the rock near the main gateway records the event above described, but gives the date with more correctness A.H. 1009 (A.D. 1600).\n\nAfter this the fort appears to have remained quietly in the possession of the Delhi Emperors up to the invasion of their kingdom by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. Another inscription near the large tank in the fort commemorates the building of the great mosque in the reign of the Emperor Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n. This mosque has two elegant minarets, but no cupolas\u2014a feature peculiar to mosques in this part of the country. It is now used as a European barrack. Another inscription is near the first-mentioned one at the south-west gate. It records the transfer (apparently peaceful) of the place to the power of Aurangzeb after deposing his father and murdering his elder brother in A.D. 1660.\n\nAnother record of the reign of Aurangzeb is to be found in an inscription on the large gun on the south-west bastion. This piece is a magnificent specimen of native gun-casting, and was made at Burh\u00e1np\u00far in the year 1663. It is made of a kind of gun metal containing a very large proportion of copper (probably the \u201cashtdh\u00e1tu,\u201d which was composed of eight metals, including silver and gold). The casting has been made on a hollow core of iron welded\nin ribands, which now forms the bore of the piece. Its principal dimensions are the following:\n\n| Length, muzzle to breech | Feet | Inches |\n|--------------------------|------|--------|\n| Do. do. to trunnions     | 12   | 9      |\n| Girth at breech          | 7    | 3      |\n| Do. in front of trunnion | 8    | 2\u00bd     |\n| Do. at muzzle            | 6    | 6      |\n| Diameter of bore         | 5    | 7      |\n\nThe calibre is therefore somewhat larger, while the length is considerably greater than those of the 68-pounders of the British service. Its weight cannot be less than seven tons.\n\nThe gun is elaborately ornamented in relief with Persian inscriptions and scroll work commencing from the muzzle; the inscriptions run thus\u2014\n\n1. \"When the sparks of sorrow issue from me, life deserts the body, as grief falls on the world when flames issue from the fiery zone.\"\n\n2. Aurangzeb's seal, with his full title, \"Abul Mu'azzafar Mohyudd\u00edn Mohammad Aurangzeb, Sh\u00e1h Gh\u00e1z\u00ed.\"\n\n3. \"Made at Burh\u00e1npur in the year 1074 A.H.\" (A.D. 1663).\n\n4. \"The gun 'Mulk Haibats'\" (terror of the country).\n\n5. \"In the rule of Mohammad Husen Arab.\"\n\n6. \"A ball of 35 seers, and 12 seers of powder, Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n\u00ed weight.\"\n\nIt is to be noted that an iron shot fitting the bore would weigh about 70 lbs., so that the shot used must have been either hollow or made of some light stone.\n\nThis magnificent old gun has long lain uncared-for on the ground in the south-western bastion, but orders have now been received for its removal to England, to be placed in the museum of artillery at Woolwich. A breech-loading wall-piece was also found on A'sirgarh, and now lies in the Khandw\u00e1 public garden. It is of about one lb. calibre. The breech-loading apparatus is lost, but it seems to have been on the simple plan common in ancient breech-loaders of all countries, namely, a detachable chamber introduced into a slot in the side of the gun, and kept in position by a wedge or bolt. An inscription on it states that it was placed in the fort in A.D. 1589 by Al\u00ed Sh\u00e1h F\u00e1r\u00fak\u00ed.\n\nIn A.D. 1760 the fort passed by treaty into the hands of the Peshw\u00e1 B\u00e9j\u00ed R\u00e1o, and in 1778 it was acquired from him by treaty by Mah\u00e1d\u00ed Sindi\u00e1. In A.D. 1803 it was taken with little resistance from Daulat R\u00e1o Sindi\u00e1 by a detachment of General Wellesley's army shortly after the battle of Assaye; but on peace being concluded with the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s in the same year it was again made over to Sindi\u00e1. It was a second time besieged by the British in A.D. 1819, its castellan having given shelter to A'p\u00e1 S\u00e1hib the ex-r\u00e1j\u00e1 of N\u00e1gpur, and of the famous Pindh\u00e1ri chief Chit\u00fa. After an investment of twenty days the fort capitulated, and during this siege A'sirgarh saw perhaps the only real fighting that had occurred in the course of its history. The following description of the siege is extracted from Thornton's History of India*:\n\n---\n\n* Vol. iv. p. 573. Ed. 1843.\n\"The forces assigned to the attack on the pettah were ordered to assemble at midnight on the 17th of March, and to move a short time afterwards. The column of attack, commanded by Lieut. Colonel Fraser, of the Royal Scots, consisted of five companies of that regiment, the flank companies of His Majesty's 30th and 67th foot and of the Madras European regiment, five companies of the first battalion of the 12th Madras native infantry, and a detail of sappers and miners. The reserve under Major Dalrymple, of His Majesty's 30th, was composed of the companies of that regiment not employed in the column of attack, one company of the King's 67th, one of the Madras European regiment, and nine companies of native infantry from the 1st battalion of the 7th regiment, the first battalion of the 12th, and the second battalion of the 17th, with detachments from the 2nd and 7th Madras native cavalry, and four horse artillery guns. The attacking column advanced along a n\u00e1l\u00e1 running parallel to the works on the southern side, till arriving within a convenient distance of the pettah, they made a rush for the gate, and succeeded in gaining it. The reserve in the meantime, in two parties, occupied points in the n\u00e1l\u00e1 by which the column of attack advanced, and in another running parallel sufficiently near to allow of their rendering eventual support. Sir John Malcolm had been directed to distract the enemy's attention by operations on the northern side, and the duty was performed by a force composed of the 3rd cavalry, the second battalion of the 6th regiment Madras native infantry, and the first battalion of the 14th, the first battalion of the 8th regiment of Bombay native infantry, six howitzers, and two horse artillery guns. The town was carried very expeditiously, and with small loss, the troops finding immediate cover in the streets. In the course of the day a battery for six light howitzers was completed on the pettah, and directed against the lower fort. On the night of the 19th March the enemy made a sally upon one of the British posts which was considerably advanced, but were soon repulsed. In the course of the same night a battery of eight heavy guns was completed. On the 20th at daybreak its fire opened, and by the evening had effected a formidable breach in the lower fort, besides inflicting serious injury on some of the upper works. On that evening the enemy made another sally into the pettah and gained the main street. They were repulsed, but success was accompanied by the loss of Colonel Fraser, who fell in the act of rallying his men. On the morning of the 21st an accidental explosion in the rear of the breaching battery proved fatal to two native officers and about a hundred men. The disaster did not extend to the battery, which continued firing with good effect. In the afternoon a mortar battery was completed, and some shells were thrown from it. For several days little occurred deserving report, except the erection, on the night of the 24th, of another battery, three hundred and fifty yards to the left of the breaching battery. Two other batteries were subsequently erected\u2014one on the south side, to breach in a second place the lower fort; the other designed to silence a large gun* on the north-east bastion of the upper fort.\n\n* \"This gun is said to have been an enormous gun-metal piece cast at Burh\u00e1np\u00far, and to have been thrown over the battlements after the siege, and sold as old metal. A stone shot said to have belonged to it measures 21 inches in diameter, and weighs about 450 lbs. The gun would therefore be (with reference to iron shot) technically a 1300-pounder. This, however, is still only half the size of the great gun of Bij\u00e1pur in the Deccan, cast in A.D. 1549. The French traveller Bernier states that Aurangzeb had French artillerists in his army about the time these guns were cast, so that they may not be wholly the product of indigenous skill.\"\n\"On the 29th two batteries were constructed for an attack on the eastern side of the fort.\n\n\"On the following morning the enemy abandoned the lower fort, which was immediately occupied by the British troops. The batteries which had been solely directed against the lower fort were now disarmed, and the guns removed from the pettah into the place which their fire had reduced. In the situation which had been gained the firing against the upper fort was speedily resumed from various batteries, aided by others below. This continued for several days, and so many shot had been fired that a deficiency began to be feared, and a reward was offered by the besiegers for bringing back to the camp the shot previously expended. This expedient stimulated the activity of the hordes of followers which hover about an eastern camp, and succeeded in producing an abundant and reasonable supply. The operations of the siege were vigorously pursued till the 5th of April, when Yaswantrao L\u00e1r expressed a wish to negotiate. Some intercourse took place, but the efforts of the besiegers so far from being slackened were increased. On the 8th Yaswantrao L\u00e1r repaired to General Doveton's head-quarters, to endeavour to procure terms, but in vain, and on the morning of the 9th a British party took possession of the upper fort, the garrison descending into the pettah, and grounding their matchlocks in a square of British troops formed for their reception.\"\n\nSince then the fort of A'sirgarh has remained in British possession. It is generally garrisoned by a wing of native infantry and two companies of Europeans. There is no artillery, heavy or light, on the fort, except the old guns already mentioned. A gun-road up to the fort is, however, about to be constructed. It is about seven miles from the station of Ch\u00e1ndn\u00ed on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway. The road passes through thick jungle the whole way, and has been put in tolerable order. As a place of residence the fort is very healthy. The approximate mean temperature of the year is 77\u00b0, or 3\u00b0 lower than on the plains of Nim\u00e1r. The nights are always cool and pleasant. It has some other attractions. It commands a fine view over the Tapt\u00ed valley. There is excellent shooting to be had in the neighbourhood, and very fair grapes are grown round the foot of the hill. But on the whole life on the hill is generally found decidedly tedious.\n\nASLA'NA'\u2014A large village, pleasantly situated on the right bank of the Son\u00e1r in the Damoh district, and about thirteen miles north-west of Damoh town. The river here forms a natural \"doh\" or pool, which is always filled with water and overshadowed by trees. This part of the river, extending for some three miles, equals in scenery any part of the Damoh district. The town contains 395 houses, and a population estimated at about 1,500 souls. The inhabitants are mostly Br\u00e1hmans of respectable family (said to be descended from the former Chaudhar\u00eds, or town officers of Damoh), and Chh\u00edp\u00e1s, or cloth-printers. The cloth printed here has a wide sale. There is a government school here, and a good ferry across the river.\n\nASODA'\u2014A perennial stream which rises in the A'nj\u00ed pargana of the Wardh\u00e1 district, and flowing near De\u00f3l\u00ed and Al\u00edp\u00far joins the Wardh\u00e1 below Kh\u00e1ng\u00e1on.\n\nATNER\u2014A village in the Bet\u00fal district, lies due south of the civil station Badn\u00far, and contains 441 houses, with a population of 1,938 souls. There is a large weekly b\u00e1z\u00e1r held here, and a considerable trade is carried on with the\nBer\u00e1rs. A'tner possesses a police station-house, a branch dispensary, and a good school. It is also the head-quarters of an assistant patrol of the customs department. There are the remains of an old Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 fort here, and fine squared stone is even now dug out of it.\n\nA'UNDHI\u2014A portion of the P\u00e1n\u00e1b\u00e1ras zam\u00ednd\u00e1ri in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district.\n\nB\n\nBA'B\u00c1I\u2014A flourishing village in the Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d district on the high-road to Jabalp\u00far, sixteen miles east of Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d, with an excellent weekly market. The road to the B\u00e1gr\u00e1 railway station (six miles distant) branches off at this place. There is a neat school-house and a police outpost.\n\nBADN\u00daR\u2014The head-quarters of the district of Bot\u00e1l, consisting, besides the European houses, of two b\u00e1z\u00e1rs. The largest, the K\u00f3thl B\u00e1z\u00e1r, has 521 houses, with a population of 2,015 souls. The Sadar B\u00e1z\u00e1r, on the Maehn\u00e1, contains 192 houses, with a population of about 728 souls. Both b\u00e1z\u00e1rs are well kept, and have lately been much improved by having good roads made through them. The public buildings are the commissioner's court-house, the district court-house, the jail, the tahsil and police station-house, two government school-houses, one for males and the other for females, the post office, the dispensary, and the government central distillery. There is a good sar\u00e1i for native travellers, and a d\u00e1k bungalow for Europeans and Natives who choose to pay the usual fees. Not far from Badn\u00far is Kherl\u00e1, the former residence of the Gond r\u00e1j\u00e1s, where there is an old fort, now in ruins, which used to be held by them.\n\nBA'GH\u2014A river which rises in the hills near Chichgarh in the Bhand\u00e1ra district, and flows north until it meets with another stream of the same name, when, turning to the west, it forms the southern border of the B\u00e1lg\u00e1h\u00e1t district. Eventually it empties itself into the Waing\u00e1ng\u00e1 at Satona in the Bhand\u00e1ra district. It is not navigable during the rains, owing to a barrier of rocks within ten miles of its mouth, the removal of which has been commenced.\n\nBAGHRA'JI\u2014A village in the Jabalp\u00far district, about eight miles to the south-east of Majhgaw\u00e1n. Here the iron sand called dhao is smelted.\n\nBA'GRA\u2014On the Taw\u00e1 river in the Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d district; is a little fortress of the r\u00e1j\u00e1s who formerly ruled part of the valley below the spur of the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1s on which the fort stands, and who seem to have been extinguished by the earlier Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 invasions.\n\nBAHA'DURPU'R\u2014A town in Nim\u00e1r, four miles west of Burh\u00e1np\u00far, was built by Bah\u00e1dur Kh\u00e1n, the last of the F\u00e1r\u00fak\u00ed dynasty of Kh\u00e1ndesh, about the end of the sixteenth century. It is supplied by water by an aqueduct led under the ground from the neighbouring hills in the manner described in the article \"Burh\u00e1np\u00far.\" The old Deccan road passes through this place, and there is a staging bungalow, now shut up. Bah\u00e1durp\u00far has a Hindi government school, a population of 1,500, and a weekly market held on Sunday.\n\nBAHMANGA'ON\u2014An estate in the B\u00e1lg\u00e1h\u00e1t district, held by a representative of a branch of the Barg\u00e1on family, and consisting of four villages only, eighteen miles south-east of B\u00farh\u00e1.\nBAHMANI\u2014A large village in the Mandla district. It is on the direct road to Seoni, and situated in the most populous part of the district. The inhabitants are chiefly agricultural, but a large number of them obtain their living by carrying grain and salt to and from Seoni and Mandla, and in other directions, on droves of pack-bullocks. There are a school and a police station here.\n\nBAIHAR\u2014A town in the B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t district, situated about fifteen miles east of Parasw\u00e1r\u00e1, in what may be called the east centre of the uplands. It has a good market every Monday. There is a police outpost here. About a mile to the north of the town are some old temples which are worth visiting.\n\nBAIRMA\u2014A river in the Damoh district which rises in the Vindhya range at an elevation of 1,700 feet above the sea. Its source is a small pond or tank in the Gond village of Bargi. It has a north-easterly course of about 110 miles, and falls into the Son\u00e1r (or receives that river) on the right bank in lat. 24\u00b0 20', long. 79\u00b0 55'. About ten miles below the junction the united rivers enter the Ken. The slope of the bed is 700 feet, or about seven feet per mile; its velocity is therefore considerable. The principal places on its banks are Deori, Hatr\u00ed, Naut\u00e1, Jujh\u00e1r, and Gais\u00e1b\u00e9d.\n\nBA\u0141A\u0141GHAT\u2014\n\nCONTENTS.\n\n| General description | 16 |\n|---------------------|---|\n| Geographical do.    | 16 |\n| Hills               | 17 |\n| Rivers and Tanks   | ib. |\n| Forests             | ib. |\n| Wild animals        | ib. |\n| Minerals            | 18 |\n| Agricultural products | ib. |\n| Government revenue  | 19 |\n| Communications      | ib. |\n| Population          | ib. |\n| Settlers            | 20 |\n| History             | 23 |\n\nA district in the Central Provinces, which was, as a temporary measure for two years, constituted a separate charge and attached to the N\u00e1gp\u00far division in 1867. It may be briefly described as consisting of the eastern portion of the central plateau, which divides the province from east to west, supplemented to the south by a rich lowland tract lying in the valley of the Waingang\u00e1. The highlands of B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t, formerly known as the R\u00e1\u00edgarh Bichhi\u00e9 tract, though peculiarly rich in natural resources, had lain, perhaps for centuries, desolate and neglected, owing to their remote position and the difficulty of access to them, when it was determined in 1866 to open them out to the industrious and enterprising peasantry of the Waingang\u00e1 valley. To accomplish this object the parganas of Dhansu\u00e1, L\u00e1nj\u00ed, and Hatt\u00e1 were taken from the Bhand\u00e1ra district and added to the high country of R\u00e1\u00edgarh Bichhi\u00e9 and the Mau t\u00e1luka of Seoni; and the whole tract was placed under a district officer resident at B\u00farh\u00e1 on the Waingang\u00e1. The new district is now bounded as follows:\u2014On the south by the B\u00e1gh n\u00e1d\u00ed; on the west by the Waingang\u00e1; on the north by the Jabalp\u00far and Chhatt\u00edsgarh road and an imaginary line\nleaving that road between Bichhi\u00e1 and the Chilpigh\u00e1t, and joining the Waingang\u00e1 near the place where its course changes from east to south, about sixty miles north of the junction of the B\u00e1gh n\u00e1di; and on the east by the feudatory states of Kaward\u00e1 and Khair\u00e1garh. It lies between $21^\\circ 25'$ and $22^\\circ 30'$ north latitude, and $80^\\circ 5'$ and $81^\\circ$ east longitude. Its extreme length is about seventy-five miles from north to south, and extreme breadth sixty-five miles from east to west.\n\nNone of the country which now forms B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t was much known until quite a recent period. The plains of Hatt\u00e1, the best cultivated portion of the district, have, it is believed, been first brought properly under cultivation within the present century; and the R\u00e1\u00edgarh Bichhi\u00e1 tract with the Mau t\u00e1luka after relapsing from the little prosperity they may have enjoyed during the best days of the Gond dynasty of Mandla, were, it is said, first taken in hand by one Lachhman N\u00e1ik about forty years ago. But it was not until Captain Thomson (then deputy commissioner of Seoni) examined and reported on R\u00e1\u00edgarh Bichhi\u00e1 in January 1863 that its condition and resources came prominently to notice.\n\nGeographically the district is composed of three distinct parts, viz.:\n\n1st.\u2014The southern lowlands, comprising the parganas of Hatt\u00e1, Dhansu\u00e1, and L\u00e1nj\u00ed.\n\n2nd.\u2014The long narrow valley, known as the Mau t\u00e1luka, lying to the north of Sam\u00e1p\u00far between the hills and the Waingang\u00e1 river.\n\n3rd.\u2014The lofty plateau on which is situated the R\u00e1\u00edgarh Bichhi\u00e1 tract.\n\nThe first portion is a slightly undulating plain, comparatively well cultivated, and drained by the Waingang\u00e1, B\u00e1gh, Deo, Gh\u00edr\u00ed, and Son rivers. On its northern and north-eastern edge it is fringed with a belt of forest, which extends from one to five miles from the base of the hills; and at various places along the banks of the rivers, which form its southern and western borders, are small patches of jungle; but elsewhere the country is so open that a clear view of the hills can be obtained from nearly any spot on the edge of the boundary streams. The quality of the land varies from the water-scoured soil on the banks of the Waingang\u00e1 to the rich alluvial black deposits found in the valleys and near the hills.\n\nThe second portion is a long, narrow, irregular-shaped lowland tract, composed of a series of small valleys intersected by light micaceous granite hill ranges and peaks, covered with dense jungle, and trending generally from north to south. From the main range to the Waingang\u00e1 the breadth varies from five to twenty miles. It is drained by the Waingang\u00e1, and its tributaries, the Nahr\u00e1, Masm\u00e1r, M\u00e1hk\u00e1r\u00e1, and Usk\u00e1l. The soil is as a rule of somewhat inferior quality, and requires a full supply of water to produce good crops; but to counterbalance this drawback, the facilities for irrigation, furnished by the undulating surface of the soil, and the proximity of the hills with their perennial streams, are immense.\n\nThe third is a vast undulating plateau broken into numerous valleys by irregular ranges of hills, running generally from east to west. The general level of these valleys is about 800 or 900 feet above the plains below, and nearly 2,000 feet above the sea. By far the greater portion of these highlands is covered with dense jungle. In a few places, such as around Bh\u00edr\u00ed, Parasw\u00e1r\u00e1,\nBaihar, and Bhiml\u00e1t, there are a few villages worthy of the name, but most of the other inhabited spots are mere specks in the jungle, collections of ten or twelve Gond or Baig\u00e1 huts, which remain for about two years, and are then burnt by their inhabitants, who migrate to other places in search of virgin soil. The quality of the soil of this tract is extremely varied, and ranges from the richest alluvium to the stony unculturable soil found in proximity to the higher peaks.\n\nIt is difficult to describe in detail the hills of the district, as the greater portion of it is composed entirely of hill country. The highest points in the district are the peaks above L\u00e1nj\u00ed, which are about 2,300 or 2,500 feet above the sea; the Tep\u00e1garh hill, about 2,600 feet above the sea; and the Bhains\u00e1g\u00e1h\u00e1t range, which in places cannot be much less than 3,000 feet above the sea. In the plains of Dhanusu\u00e1, Hatt\u00e9, and L\u00e1nj\u00ed there are no hills, and in the M\u00e1u t\u00e1luka there are none worthy of particular mention.\n\nThe principal rivers are the Waingang\u00e1, with its tributaries the B\u00e1gh, Nahr\u00e1, and Usk\u00e1l, and some smaller streams, such as the Masm\u00e1r, the M\u00e1hk\u00e1r\u00e1, &c., and the few tributaries of the Narbad\u00e1, which drain a portion of the upper plateau, viz. the Banjar, H\u00e1lon, and Jam\u00fani\u00e1. There are no lakes in B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t worthy of mention; small tanks, however, which hold water just sufficient to irrigate the rice crops at the end of the monsoon, and to supply the village cattle with water during the hot months, abound. In many cases the tanks are purposely and completely emptied soon after the rains, and rab\u00ed crops are sown in their beds.\n\nThe forests of B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t are very extensive. In the low country the bases of the hills are fringed with jungle, containing timber of various kinds, but not of any great value. On the banks of the Waingang\u00e1 are scattered patches of teak; and in various other places in the plains are isolated jungles, containing stunted timber and grass. On the Deo, near the village of Bhagatp\u00far, and on the banks of the Son, between L\u00e1nj\u00ed and Bij\u00e1g\u00e1rh, and at Bij\u00e1g\u00e1rh itself, are found the large katang bamboos, the specimens of which shown at the N\u00e1gp\u00far and Jabalp\u00far exhibitions measured about ninety feet in length. Above the gh\u00e1ts the greater part of the country is covered with forests. At the north-east corner is situated the large s\u00e1l forest reserve of Topl\u00e1, where, according to Major Pearson, \"the trees are truly magnificent, many of them measuring three feet in diameter, and having a height of fifty or sixty feet.\" From Topl\u00e1 to Bhiml\u00e1t and Baihar, s\u00e1l is very abundant. But little teak of value is now to be found in these forests. On the Jam\u00fani\u00e1, near Bhiml\u00e1t, some 3,000 trees are still standing, but of these about forty per cent are as yet less than three feet in circumference, and not fit for the market.\n\nThese forests are tenanted by wild animals * of all kinds, from the bison, which frequents nearly all the hill-crests above L\u00e1nj\u00ed and the Bhains\u00e1g\u00e1h\u00e1t range, to the hare and the fox in the plains below, but they are not easily to be met with, for their numbers are not in proportion to the immense extent of jungle which they frequent. The following statement shows the number of wild animals which were killed, and for which government rewards were paid, in 1867-68:\n\n* There is one wild elephant, which it is believed escaped some fifteen years ago from the establishment of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of N\u00e1gp\u00far.\n| Description of Animals | No. killed | Amount of Reward paid |\n|------------------------|------------|----------------------|\n| Tigers                 | 15         | Rs. 750 0 0          |\n| Do. cubs               | 1          | Rs. 20 0 0           |\n| Panthers               | 19         | Rs. 190 0 0          |\n| Do. cubs               | 3          | Rs. 15 0 0           |\n| Bears                  | 28         | Rs. 140 0 0          |\n| Do. cubs               | 1          | Rs. 2 8 0            |\n| Hyenas                 | 5          | Rs. 10 0 0           |\n| Snakes                 | 398        | Rs. 431 0 0          |\n| **Total**              | **470**    | **Rs. 1,558 8 0**    |\n\nThere is every reason to suppose that the mineral wealth of the highlands is considerable; so much, however, of the whole area is but partially explored that it is impossible to state what the extent of the mineral resources may be. Gold is washed in both the Deo and Son, also in a small stream called the Sonber\u00e1 n\u00e1l\u00e1 near the Pancher\u00e1 gh\u00e1t in the Dhansu\u00e1 pargana, and in the Nahr\u00e1 river of the M\u00e1n tract. The quantity obtainable is, however, so small as scarcely to repay the labour. Iron in large quantities is found in very many places on the hills, and it is extensively worked by the Gonds, who smelt it into rough semi-circular shapes called \"ch\u00falas,\" averaging in weight about 10 lbs. each. These are sold in the b\u00e1zars at the rate of two to four chul\u00e1s for the rupee. Ger\u00fa, or red ochre, is found to the west of the S\u00e1letekr\u00ed hills, and is used by the people for dyeing, &c.; and a few miles to the east of B\u00farh\u00e1, surm\u00e1 (sulphide of antimony) occurs in large quantities. The latter is, however, of no value here, and no one takes the trouble to collect it. Both above and below the gh\u00e1ts mica is abundant. Indeed it is difficult to find any place where its glittering fragments do not at once attract the eye, but no where has it been met with in sheets of such size as to make it commercially valuable. The best specimens as yet brought to light have come from near Chit\u00e1dongr\u00ed and Bamn\u00ed near Baihar, and have measured about two by three or four inches.*\n\nRice is the principal agricultural product, but other crops are grown, as will be seen by the following table for the year 1868:\n\n| Area of Acres under cultivation. |\n|----------------------------------|\n| Rice                             | 188,312 |\n| Wheat                            | 585     |\n| Other food grains                | 8,770   |\n| Oil-seeds                        | 3,486   |\n| Sugar                            | 505     |\n| Fibres                           | 100     |\n| Tobacco                          | 638     |\n\n* Mr. Michea, a French gentleman residing in the Mandla district, has taken an experimental lease of these mines.\nThe number of market-gardens and amount of garden produce is extremely small. Only the commonest descriptions of indigenous vegetable are grown in the fields; but the jungles afford many edible herbs, which are all known by the comprehensive word \"bh\u00e1j\u00ed\" (or greens). There are also many roots and bulbs which are used by the Baig\u00e1s and dahiya-cutting Gonds for both food and medicine.\n\nFor revenue purposes the district is divided into two portions, viz. the B\u00farh\u00e1 tahsil, which consists of the parganas of Dhansu\u00e1, L\u00e1nj\u00ed, including the S\u00edletekri zam\u00edn-d\u00e1r\u00ed and Hatt\u00e1, and the Parasw\u00e1r\u00e1 tahsil which is composed of the southern portions of the R\u00e1ggarh Bichhi\u00e1 tract and the M\u00e4u taluka. The revenues of the district in 1868-69 are shown by the following table:\n\n| Description          | Amount |\n|----------------------|--------|\n| Land revenue         | Rs. 67,543 8 0 |\n| Assessed taxes       | ,, 6,925 0 0 |\n| Excise               | ,, 13,243 0 0 |\n| Stamps               | ,, 11,342 0 0 |\n| Forest revenue       | ,, 18,412 0 0 |\n| **Total**            | **Rs. 1,17,465 8 0** |\n\nThere are no made-roads in the district. For six months in the year (viz. from December till June) the ordinary country tracks are fairly good, but for the remaining five months they are, generally speaking, quite impassable except for elephants and foot-passengers. The passes leading from the low country to the highlands are as follows:\n\n1. The B\u00e1npur gh\u00e1t, to the north of the L\u00e1nj\u00ed pargana, in the gorge of the Deo.\n2. The Warai gh\u00e1t, to the north-east of the Dhansu\u00e1 pargana, near the villages of Odh\u00e1 and Dhansu\u00e1.\n3. The Pancher\u00e1 gh\u00e1t, to the north of the Dhansu\u00e1 pargana, near the villages of Pancher\u00e1 and Dh\u00e1p\u00e9w\u00e1r\u00e1.\n4. The Bhondw\u00e1 gh\u00e1t, in the south-east of the M\u00e4u taluka, near Lamet\u00e1 and Bhondw\u00e1.\n5. The Ahmadp\u00far gh\u00e1t, lying due east of the town of M\u00e4u.\n\nOf these Nos. 1 and 2 are at present bad, No. 3 is nearly finished, and good, and Nos. 4 and 5 are very fair, especially the latter.\n\nThe population is classed under some ninety castes and religious denominations, but most of these are very scantily represented. By far the largest element in the population is the aboriginal, in which the Gonds and their congeners are the most conspicuous. Of the agricultural classes the most numerous are Lodhis and Ponw\u00e1rs, both esteemed to be good cultivators, though the latter have merely a local reputation, while the former are well known through Northern and Central India. It is from the immigration of sturdy peasants of these classes that the reclamation of the forest wastes may be hoped for, and it was with the main object of facilitating their settlement in B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t that the new district was experimentally formed. The trading classes are chiefly represented\nby oil-sellers and spirit-distillers, who, however, combine other trades, and even agriculture, with their hereditary avocations. The artisan class scarcely exists yet, though there is a sprinkling of ordinary village carpenters, blacksmiths, and metal-workers.\n\nThe following extracts from a report on the new district by Captain Bloomfield, the Deputy Commissioner, will show what steps are being taken to induce settlers from below to take up the rich virgin lands of the plateau:\n\n\"Since the beginning of 1867 every effort has been made to induce Ponwars, Kumbis, Marars, and other good cultivating classes to immigrate and take up land in the upland tracts. People applying for land above the ghats have either received grants under the waste land clearance lease rules, where the plot applied for has been entirely waste; or, in cases where the applicant has expressed a desire to undertake the management of small villages composed of a few squatters with a little scattered cultivation, they have been allowed to do so, and inducements have been held out to them to the effect that if they get the village inhabited, and cause the lands belonging thereto to be brought quickly under cultivation, the proprietary right will be given to them, and a regular settlement made. The former of the conditions above described (clearance lease) is termed by the natives 'jangal tarashi' (forest clearing), and the latter 'abadi' (colonisation).\n\n\"Under the clearance lease rules, 46 plots, with a total area of 9,171 acres, have been taken up by 33 Ponwars, 6 Gonds, 1 Marar, 1 Lodhi; and 37 villages, with an area of about 55,583 acres, have been taken up by 9 Ponwars, 2 Kumbis, 3 Gonds, 1 Kayath, 1 Marar, 2 Rajputs, and 1 Sonar. The area thus taken up amounts altogether to about 64,754 acres. The number of men (59) thus shown to have gone to the uplands only represents those well-to-do individuals, who have ventured to immigrate from below in the hope that hereafter they may become malguzars of their holdings. But as a rule, with each of these men several families of cultivators of the same caste, but in poorer circumstances, have gone: thus the total number of persons who have emigrated to the uplands may be estimated at more than 500, exclusive of those who have gone to reside in villages previously settled. Of this latter class I have no certain statistics, but from the number of people I have seen in the act of emigration, and from the great profusion of new houses in the upland villages, I have no hesitation in saying that the numbers of this class of immigrants are very considerable.\n\n* * * * * * * * * *\n\n\"Of all the people who have gone above the ghats these Ponwars promise to be the most valuable and successful. Wherever men of this class have taken up land they have set to work in earnest in embanking up their fields and constructing tanks. In many places where they have settled down, where never sod was turned before, may now be seen fields covering many acres, with their embankments (bandis) three and four feet high, and everything ready for the rains now commencing.\n\n\"The Ponwars and other settlers have perhaps done much, considering the fewness of their numbers and the recentness of their arrival; but their\nexample has, I believe, done more. The former inhabitants of the tracts seem now to have realised the fact that formidable competitors for the rich lands around them are daily becoming more numerous, and they no longer imagine that they alone are the occupiers of the soil. Gonds and others who were formerly satisfied with their rough and shifting cultivation, now vie with each other in raising embankments round their fields, and in constructing tanks where nothing of the kind before existed.\"\n\nThis is only a beginning, but it is regarded as promising by those who know the country. Special causes have been at work during the two years, for which this district has existed, to check immigration, in addition to the ordinary obstacles arising from absence of enterprise among the people. One of the two years has been agriculturally unfavourable, and there has been a question about the rights of the indigenous inhabitants, which, till it was settled, must have deterred many intending immigrants from taking up lands, a clear title to which could not yet be given to them.\n\nIn addition to the direct modes of encouragement above described, considerable efforts have been made to facilitate settlement by improving the very deficient modes of communication between the low country and the rich wastes on the plateau. What has been done in this respect is thus described in a late report by Mr. Bernard, the Commissioner of the Nagpur division:\n\n\"Captain Bloomfield's report describes what has been done, and is still doing, to open good and sufficient intercommunication between the uplands and plains. The villages of the Waingang\u00e1 plain constitute the markets for the produce of the uplands, and it is thence that the people of the highlands draw their salt, their copper vessels, their cotton goods, and their hardware. Yet two years ago there was not a single road by which a laden cart could get from the plains to Parasw\u00e1r\u00e1. Up the tract where the Bhondw\u00e1 gh\u00e1t now is, a few half-laden carts used to struggle; and an occasional cart used to get up the B\u00e1npur gh\u00e1t by dint of being unladen and lifted at five or six bad places on the road. Now there are no less than three good cart roads by which laden carts can go up and down the gh\u00e1ts at all seasons, and two more such gh\u00e1ts will shortly be completed. * * * I have myself seen each of these gh\u00e1t roads once or twice during the present season, and I am able to say that they are most useful and economically constructed works. They may be enumerated thus\u2014\n\n\"The Pancher\u00e1 gh\u00e1t, costing Rs. 15,000, is quite complete. It is now standing the present rainy season. This gh\u00e1t was formerly quite impassable for carts. During the last six weeks of the open season of 1869, 792 carts passed over it, so that the people were fully alive to its convenience as soon as it was opened.\n\n\"The Warai gh\u00e1t, costing Rs. 4,000, was barely completed when the rainy season began. Its side drains, however, were finished, and the work will doubtless stand the monsoon weather. No cart had ever been up this gh\u00e1t before, but during the past season, while work was going on, a few carts got up. Next open season it will be in full working order.\"\n\"The B\u00e1npur gh\u00e1t has been half finished at a cost of Rs. 2,500.\n\nIt was up this gh\u00e1t that carts intended for the uplands used to be carried on mens' heads. Already, now that the most part of the ascent is overcome by zigzags, some seventy laden carts have made their way up this gh\u00e1t.\n\n\"The two other gh\u00e1ts lead from the western edge, while the three above described lead from the southern edge of the plateau.\n\n\"The Bhondw\u00e1 gh\u00e1t has for many years been used by carts; the slope was much more gradual (except for a short piece near the foot of the hills) than on the southern gh\u00e1ts. But the road was extremely rough and uneven, and the proportion of carts which effected the passage of this gh\u00e1t without breaking their axles or wheels was formerly small. The road has now been improved, the steep ascent of the foot has been overcome by zigzags, and the whole gh\u00e1t has been made very passable at a cost of Rs. 1,920.\n\n\"The Ahmadp\u00far gh\u00e1t is of the same character as the Bhondw\u00e1, but it is hardly so important a road as any of the other gh\u00e1ts. Its improvement has not yet been taken in hand, but Rs. 2,000 have been provided for the work in the current year's budget. On most of these gh\u00e1ts the cutting has taken the road down to gneiss or to schists, which make very fair road surface. The banks too for the most part consist of tolerably hard material; no expense, or at any rate very little, will therefore be incurred in metalling the gh\u00e1t roads. But the skeleton of the B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t road system will only be begun when the gh\u00e1t roads are finished. Fair-weather roads will have to be cut from the gh\u00e1t summits to the different valleys and plateaus; no metalling will as yet be attempted on these roads, but the shortest lines will be selected; the jungle will be cut, rocks and stones will be removed, and the banks of streams will be sloped at the approaches to fords. The lie of these roads has already been settled by the deputy commissioner; some of them have been aligned, and two or three have been already cleared. When they shall all be completed, the communications of the B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t uplands will be at least as good as the cross-country roads of the plain country below.\n\n\"Before passing from this account of what has been done to improve the B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t communications it may be well to notice that the deputy commissioner has given some attention to the improvement of the river communication in the B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t lowlands. The B\u00e1gh n\u00e1di, the Deo n\u00e1di, the Son n\u00e1di, and the Waingang\u00e1 traverse the district, and during the flood season a good deal of grain goes down, and some salt comes up in flat-bottomed cargo-boats. At several places on these rivers there are rocky barriers, which impede, or even stop navigation; one of these barriers, at a place named R\u00e1j\u00e1g\u00e1on on the B\u00e1gh n\u00e1di, was opened last May by Captain Bloomfield, who blasted away the rocky curtain at a cost of about Rs. 450. The removal of this barrier has opened out a long extra reach on the B\u00e1gh n\u00e1di, and has also opened the Deo and Son rivers for cargo-boats. During the current season Captain Bloomfield is taking experimental river trips to all the principal barriers in the district, and has ascertained that the Waingang\u00e1 might be made navigable to the very north of the district by the removal of comparatively inconsiderable barriers.\"\nAs yet the district scarcely has a history. The upper part of it belonged to the dominions of the Garh\u00e1 Mandla kings until their subjugation by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, and the lowlands were included either in the Haihai Bans\u00ed kingdom of Chhattisgarh, which was absorbed more than a century ago by the Bhonsl\u00e1 rulers of N\u00e1gpur, or in the Deogarh Gond principality, which fell even earlier before the same power. The high plateau has not, within the memory of man, been so near prosperity as it is at present, and sixty years ago it was almost entirely waste. About that time one Lachhman N\u00faik planted the first villages on the Parasw\u00e1r\u00e1 plateau, and it is to his enterprise, and to the industry of the immigrants whom he introduced, that Parasw\u00e1r\u00e1 and the thirty villages about it are now flourishing settlements, surrounded by excellent rice fields, which never want for water even in the driest seasons. There are, however, traces, in the shape of handsome Buddhist temples of cut stone, of a comparatively high civilisation at some remote period. Further researches may some day throw light on this epoch, which may probably be referred to the days when a Haihaya line of kings ruled over M\u00e1rgarh and L\u00e1nj\u00ed (the present Mandla and B\u00e1lg\u00e1hat). But for the present at any rate the eyes of those interested in the district will rather be turned to the important experiment in colonisation, which is now under trial, than to the almost illegible records of an extinct past.\n\nBALAHI hills, in the Bhand\u00e1ra district, lying about six miles west of Bhand\u00e1ra, are about four hundred feet above the level of the plain. They extend over a space of ground about twenty-four miles in circumference, and are quite bare of vegetation, but afford some pasturage for cattle, and plenty of building material in the shape of large slabs of shale and blocks of laterite.\n\nBALAKOT\u2014A fortified village situated in a very hilly part of the Damoh district, about twelve miles the south-west of Damoh. The inhabitants are Lodh\u00eds, and rebelled in 1857, when the fort was attacked and dismantled by British troops. There is a police post here.\n\nBALIHRI\u2014A town situated about 9 miles to the south-west of Murw\u00e1r\u00e1, and 15 miles due north of Sleeman\u00e1b\u00e1d. It is in all probability one of the oldest towns in the Jabalp\u00far district. The main line of communication between the valley of the Ganges and Narbad\u00e1 used to run through it. All round and in every street of it are to be seen ancient remains, which prove it once to have been a place of some importance, though it now contains only 450 houses. At various times the name of the town has been changed; it is said first to have been called B\u00e1b\u00e1vat Nagar\u00e1 or B\u00e1b\u00e1vati, then P\u00e1p\u00e1vat Nagar\u00e1, and lastly it gained its present name of Balihri, according to tradition, from the defeat here of a R\u00e9j\u00e1 Bal. The inhabitants of the place, however, say that the name of Balihri is derived from a kind of \u2018p\u00e1n\u2019 for which the place was once famous. This may be the case, as even now, notwithstanding the decadence of the place, the \u2018p\u00e1n\u2019 gardens are numerous and beautiful. Again, others say that the \u2018p\u00e1n\u2019 derives its name from the town, and not the town from the \u2018p\u00e1n\u2019. According to tradition B\u00e1b\u00e1vati was many centuries ago a very flourishing city. Its temples were numbered by hundreds; and the pilgrims who flocked from all parts of India to do homage at the various shrines were counted by thousands. It is said that in those days it was (8 coss) 24 miles in circumference. In the centre of the town there is now standing an old building formerly used as a \u201cmarha,\u201d and still called by that name, from which not many years ago was removed a bijak (large stone bearing an inscription), which has only been deciphered so\nfar as to show that this was a very early seat of Jain worship. From the best information now obtainable on the subject it appears that the town of Balihri, and the pargana bearing the same name, consisting of about thirty villages, belonged to the kings of Mandla, in whose possession they continued until Samvat 1838 (A.D. 1781), when they fell into the hands of the Maratha chief of Sagar. In Samvat 1853 (A.D. 1796) Balihri and some other districts were presented to Raghoji Bhonsla I., Rajah of Nagpur, as a reward for services rendered in assisting the Peshwa in a war against the Nizam. In Samvat 1874 (A.D. 1817) Balihri was ceded by the Bhonslas to the British government. In A.D. 1857, during the great Indian mutiny, the fort of Balihri was occupied by a party of rebels under Raghunath Singh Bundela, of Richil in Pannia. So soon as this became known native troops were sent against the place from Jabalpur and Nagod, but before they arrived the rebels had decamped. Soon afterwards the fort was, by the order of government, dismantled, and not only were the outer walls levelled, but the whole place was converted into a chaotic mass of ruins. The present town of Balihri is picturesquely situated among fine groves of mango and other trees, in a fertile country, the surface of which is broken by numerous hills. The large tank (Lachhman Sagar), the many ancient remains, and the fine old baolis in the town itself, are well worthy of a visit from travellers in the neighbourhood.\n\nBALLALPUR\u2014A village in the Chandia district, six miles south of Chandia, on the left bank of the Wardha. It was the seat of the earlier Gond kings. Although now containing only 253 houses, foundations can be traced for a considerable distance in the jungle, showing the large area over which the old city extended. There is a fine stone fort, much of which is modern, having been rebuilt about the end of the last century. Within it are the remains of the ancient palace, among which are two tunnels sloping at a steep angle into the ground. The entrances are a few feet apart, and the tunnels, branching off in opposite directions, lead each to a set of three underground chambers. When these were explored in A.D. 1865 some ancient copper coins and decayed iron rings were found. There is also a perpendicular shaft, the object of which has not yet been ascertained. North of the village are the ruins of a large and elaborately made tank, in which, owing probably to the falling-in of the under-channels, any water collected sinks through the earth, and appears as a stream a little further down. To the east stands a tomb of one of the Gond kings; and in an islet in the Wardha in the same direction there is an exceedingly curious rock-temple which during several months of the year is fathoms under water; it is known as the \"Ram Tirth,\" and in A.D. 1866 was thoroughly cleaned out and explored. A few hundred yards beyond the Ram Tirth, in the bed of the Wardha, is a seam of coal, laid bare by the action of the stream. The situation of Ballalpur is picturesque, the Wardha banks being high and rocky, and the river beneath at all times deep and broad, while ancient groves furnish abundant shade. A police outpost is stationed here, and near the fort is an unfinished English house, which visitors are generally permitted to use.\n\nBALOD\u2014A small town in the Rajpuri district, situated fifty miles southwest of Rajpuri, containing 802 houses and about 1,800 inhabitants; it lies half a mile from the banks of the Tandula, one of the affluents of the Seo. The town is very straggling, and bears signs of having at one time been much more flourishing than at present. There is an old fort in a state of dilapidation, said to have been built at the close of the fifteenth century of our era by\na cadet of the family of the R\u00e1jput kings of Ratanp\u00far. In A.D. 1778 it was taken by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s after a very severe contest. There is an old temple in the town, remarkable more for the large stones which form its basement than for any architectural pretensions.\n\nBA'MRA'\u2014A feudatory state attached to the Sambalp\u00far district, held by a R\u00e1jput family, and formerly subject to Sirg\u00faja, but added to the Garhj\u00e1t cluster by Balr\u00e1m Deo, first R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Sambalp\u00far. It lies between 84\u00b0 20' and 85\u00b0 15' east longitude, and between 21\u00b0 10' and 22\u00b0 15' north latitude. Its formation is extremely irregular, the northern part running up to a point into the Bonai and G\u00e1ngp\u00far states; and two points also extending considerably to the westward, the one into the Lair\u00e1 zamind\u00e1ri, and the other into T\u00e1lcher. It is bounded on the north by Bonai and G\u00e1ngp\u00far, on the south by the Garhj\u00e1t state of Rair\u00e1khol, on the east by T\u00e1lcher and Lair\u00e1, and on the west by the Sambalp\u00far kh\u00e1lsa and the zamind\u00e1ri of Jaip\u00far or Kol\u00e1bir\u00e1. Taking the extreme length north and south it may be some seventy-five miles, while the extreme breadth is about sixty-four miles. The total area may be about 1750 square miles. Notwithstanding the masses of hill and jungle in the southern portion of the state, about three-fifths of the whole are cultivated, the north-western part and the centre being particularly fertile. The soil is light and sandy, except in the immediate neighbourhood of the hills where it is more loamy. There are some splendid s\u00e1l forests in this state; all lost to use, however, for want of means to get the timber to a market. Iron ore is to be found in abundance. The jungles produce a considerable quantity of lac, silk, cocoons, beeswax, and honey. Resin is also extracted from the s\u00e1l trees. The only river of note is the Brahmani. But for certain rocky obstructions that occur at one or two places timber might be floated down this river to the coast, as it empties itself into the sea just north of False Point. An old road to Calcutta, now fallen into disuse, runs through the state from west to east. There are no other roads of importance. According to the census of 1866 the population amounted to 22,456 souls, and was for the most part agricultural. As elsewhere in these parts, rice is the staple produce. Oil-seeds, pulses, cotton, and sugarcane are also cultivated. The principal non-agricultural castes are Br\u00e1hmans, R\u00e1jputs, and Mahant\u00eds, while agriculture is carried on by Chas\u00e1s, Gonds, Khonds, Agari\u00e1s, Kolt\u00e1s, S\u00fads, and Dum\u00e1ls.\n\nThe family is Gang\u00e1-bans\u00ed R\u00e1jput. They do not appear to be in possession of any authentic traditions antecedent to Samvat 1602 (A.D. 1545). In that year one R\u00e1m Chandra Deva was R\u00e1j\u00e1 till Samvat 1635, when he was succeeded by Bikram Deva, who reigned from 1635 to 1682\n\n| Name          | Reign |\n|---------------|-------|\n| Haru Deva     | 1682  |\n| Chandra Sekhar| 1698  |\n| Bhagirath Deva| 1730  |\n| Prat\u00e1p Deva   | 1770  |\n| Sid\u00e1sar Deva  | 1802  |\n| Arjun Deva    | 1836  |\n| Sujal Deva    | 1876  |\n| Tribhuvan Deva| 1876  |\n\nTribhuvan Deva is a man of some fifty years of age; he is quiet and unpretending, but manages his affairs shrewdly and well. He has not hitherto done much for education in his state, but has recently applied for teachers in order to open three schools.\n\n4 CPG\nBANDA'\u2014A town in the S\u00e1gar district, about twenty miles north-east of S\u00e1gar, containing 204 houses and 626 inhabitants. It is the head-quarters of a tahsil, and is supposed to have been founded about 200 years ago. About the year A.D. 1810 the tract of Beher\u00e1, in which Band\u00e1 is situated, formed part of the dominions of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Madan Singh of Garh\u00e1kot\u00e1. After his death his son, Arjun Singh, made over Garh\u00e1kot\u00e1 and M\u00e1lthon to Sindi\u00e1 (see \"Garh\u00e1kot\u00e1\"), and kept Beher\u00e1 and Sh\u00e1hgarh for himself. In 1818, after the cession of S\u00e1gar to the British government by the Peshw\u00e1, the tract under-mentioned, including Band\u00e1, was acquired by the latter in an exchange of territory with the abovementioned Arjun Singh.\n\nPrior to 1861 the head-quarters of the tahsil were stationed at Bin\u00e1ik\u00e1, a town about nine miles north of Band\u00e1, but owing to the central position of Band\u00e1, and the fact of its being situated on the high road from S\u00e1gar to Cawnpore, at no great distance from district head-quarters, the change was decided on. The town itself is a very small and insignificant place. It should, however, now gradually rise in importance. The new tahsil is situated on a small eminence to the west of the village. It is a handsome flat-roofed building. A boys' school has also been established here.\n\nBANDA'\u2014A revenue subdivision or tahsil in the S\u00e1gar district, having an area of 691 square miles, with 299 villages, and a population of 72,066, according to the census of 1866. The land revenue for the year 1869-70 is Rs. 46,494. This division lies to the north-east of the district, and is bounded on the north by Lalatp\u00far, a district in the North-West Provinces, and on the east by the native state of Pann\u00e1.\n\nBA'NDAKPUR\u2014A village in the Damoh district, containing 200 houses and upwards of 600 inhabitants. It is about nine or ten miles to the east of Damoh. A fair is held here twice a year\u2014once during February for the \"Basant\" Hind\u00fa festival, and once in March for the \"Sivar\u00e1tri.\" Large numbers of pilgrims attend these fairs, and the traffic is considerable. In January 1869 the attendance amounted to 20,000 persons. The chief articles brought for sale are piece-goods, hardware, and trinkets of various kinds.\n\nBANDOL\u2014A small village in the Seon\u00ed district, half way between Chhapar\u00e1 and Seon\u00ed. There is a road-bungalow here, and supplies and good water are procurable. It is the first encamping-ground after leaving Seon\u00ed, from which it is nine miles distant.\n\nBANGA'ON\u2014A village in the Hatt\u00e1 tahsil of the Damoh district. It is on the road between Damoh and Hatt\u00e1, and about twelve miles distant from either place. There is an encamping-ground here for troops passing from S\u00e1gar to Naug\u00e1on. Banga'on is also on the Jabalp\u00far and Band\u00e1 route.\n\nBANJAR\u2014An affluent of the Narbad\u00e1, into which it falls nearly opposite Mandla. It rises in S\u00e1letek\u00e1ri in the B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t district, and its course is due north. There are now in the N\u00e1gp\u00far museum specimens of the gold-bearing sand of this river. It has several affluents; the principal on the left bank are the Tannor, Gurr\u00e1r, Bhurbhuri\u00e1, and Bhongi\u00e1. On the right bank the chief affluent is the Jam\u00fani\u00e1, which rises on the Chilp\u00edgh\u00e1t.\n\nBANKHERI'\u2014A small town in the Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d district, on the high-road from Jabalp\u00far to Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d, some fifty miles east of the latter. Here is a railway station; and the road to the Pachmar\u00ed sanitarium runs due south from this point towards Fatehp\u00far.\nBAN\u2014BAR\n\nBA'NPU'R\u2014An estate in the B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t district, comprising fifty-six villages, and an area of 206 square miles, of which little more than five are under cultivation. The population amounted to 2,476 souls by the census of 1866. The chief and only good village, B\u00e1np\u00far, lies twenty-eight miles east of B\u00farh\u00e1.\n\nBA'NSA'\u2014A thriving and rather large village in the Damoh district, containing 541 houses and a population of 1,771 souls. It is situated about fifteen miles to the west of Damoh and three miles to the south of Pathari\u00e1. The estate attached is held in j\u00e1g\u00edr by a Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 family of Pun\u00e1, and was granted on condition of military service. There are here an indigenous school, fairly well attended, and a police station. Kh\u00e1d\u00ed and other coarse cloths are made in the village.\n\nBARBARI'\u2014A village in the Wardh\u00e1 district, three miles south-west of Wardh\u00e1. A small weekly market is held here on Tuesdays, grain and country cloth being the principal articles brought for sale. Barbar\u00ed contains 1,047 inhabitants, chiefly cultivators, with a few weavers.

A police outpost and a village school are the only government buildings here.\n\n**BARPALI\u2019**\u2014A chiefship attached to the Sambalp\u00far district. It was created in the reign of Bah\u00e1r Singh, fourth r\u00e9j\u00e1 of Sambalp\u00far, about three hundred years ago, as a provision for his second son Bikram Singh. It is situated about thirty miles to the south-west of the town of Sambalp\u00far, consists of some seventy villages, and has an area of about twenty-five square miles, nearly three-fourths of which are cultivated. The population by the last census was 17,304 souls, chiefly agricultural, viz. Kolt\u00e1s, Somr\u00e1s, &c., but a sprinkling of all the Hind\u00fa castes is also to be met with. Rice, cotton, oil-seeds, the pulses, and sugarcane are produced. The manufactures are coarse cloth, tasar silk, and brass vessels. The principal place is Barp\u00e1l\u00ed, which has a population of 2,838. There is an Anglo-Vernacular school here, where some one hundred and thirty pupils are receiving instruction, and also a female school with thirty girls. There are likewise some five or six schools of an inferior class in the villages.\n\n**BARU\u2019 REWA\u2019**\u2014A stream in the Narsinghp\u00far district which flows into the Sher at a little distance above the junction of that river with the Narbad\u00e1, after a course of some thirty miles.

It is said to have come originally from Warangal in the Deccan, about the commencement of the fourteenth century. The supposed gross revenue of Bastar is Rs. 36,102, and the tribute paid by the R\u0101j\u0101 to the British government is Rs. 3,056 per annum.\n\nThe extreme length of the Bastar state is about 170 miles, and the extreme breadth about 120 miles; the area may be estimated at 13,000 square miles, and the population at less than 270,000 souls. The general nature of the country is flat towards the east and north-east, while the centre and north-west portions are very mountainous, and the southern parts are a mixture of hill and plain. The eastern portion is an elevated plateau, from 1,800 to 2,000 feet above the level of the sea, while the less elevated country to the west and south portion is from 1,000 to 1,500 feet lower. The highland country may be said to extend on the south to the T\u0101ngri Dongri and Tuls\u012b Dongri hills; on the west as far as the hills between N\u0101gatok\u0101 and B\u0101rs\u016br, beyond which the country falls on the north to where the Mah\u0101n\u0101d\u012b and Seo rivers have their rise; and to the east beyond the boundary of Jaipur, as far as the eastern gh\u0101ts. In this region there are few hills, the streams are sluggish, and the country is a mixture of plain and undulating ground covered by dense sal forests. A fruitful soil, producing rich crops whenever cultivated, covers nearly all the plateau. The principal mountains in Bastar are a lofty range, which forms the boundary between it and the Nugur and Alibek\u0101 talukas of the Sironch\u0101 district, running north-west and south-east, and ceasing abruptly as it approaches the T\u0101l river\u2014a range of about equal height in the centre of the dependency, known generally as the \"Bel\u0101 D\u012bl\u0101\" (from a particular peak near Dantiw\u0101r\u0101), which resembles a bullock's hump, and which extends from the Bijj\u012b taluka in the south to the Indr\u0101vat\u012b on the north; a third range running north and south near Narainpur; a fourth, called the T\u0101ngri Dongri, running east and west; and a fifth, the Tuls\u012b Dongri, which is nearly parallel to, and south of, the preceding, bordering on the Sabar\u012b river and the Jaipur state. There is also a small, but very distinctly\n\n* This article is taken nearly verbatim from a Report on Bastar by Captain Glasfurd, which will be found published in the \"Selections from the Records of the Government of India, Foreign Department, No. xxxix.\"\ndefined range which runs north and south from Kutru on the Indravati, to Parnasila and Durnagudem on the Godavari, where it forms the first barrier on that river. The principal rivers in the dependency are the Indravati, the Sabari, and the Tal or Talper. They are all affluents of the Godavari.\n\nThe soil throughout the greater portion of Bastar may be said to be a light clay with an admixture of sand, better suited for the raising of rice and wet crops than dry cultivation; indeed with a good supply of water it is as fertile, as without water it is poor and incapable of producing rich crops. There is also some good soil of the black description, but of the whole area nine-tenths probably belong to the light clayey class. The hills which separate Bastar from the Nugur and Albata talukas are principally composed of vitrified sandstone, exceedingly hard, and of a pinkish colour. They increase in height as they approach the Tal river, within a mile or two of which they abruptly terminate in high scarped precipices of 50 to 150 feet high, while the height of the hills themselves cannot be less than 3,000 feet above the level of the sea. They are in fact a continuation of the sandstone ranges which run from near the confluence of the Wainganga and Wardha through the chiefship of Ahiri and the Sironcha taluka, with similar ranges on the right bank of the Godavari opposite Sironcha. All these sandstone ranges are parallel to each other, and from five to fifteen miles apart, their direction being invariably north-west and south-east. One peculiarity about them is that as a northern range ceases, a parallel range to the south commences, and when this ceases, a third to the south of it again begins, and so on. The south-eastern falls are generally steep, abrupt, and scarped near their summits, while on the reverse, or north-west side, the slopes are easy. There is but little level space on their summits, little or no water is to be found, and the whole surface is strewn with loose boulders of vitrified sandstone. Eastward from these high ranges of sandstone hills we pass through a narrow valley, on the eastern sides of which there are signs of a change in the formation. Greenslate and hornblende appear near the banks of the Tal, about twenty-five miles from its confluence with the Godavari, mixed with coarse quartzose and felspathic rocks in various stages of decomposition. A small range, which runs from Kutru in the north to the head of the first barrier of the Godavari in the south, seems to be composed principally of gneiss with broad bands of quartz. This range is clearly defined, and has but few spurs.\n\nFrom these hills to the eastward an undulating plain of mixed clayey and sandy soil extends to the Bela Dil\u00e1, which forms a marked feature in the configuration of this part of the country. This chain extends nearly due north and south. From the south bank of the Indravati it is about 200 feet above the plain, increasing in height as it runs southward, till it culminates in two high peaks called Nandiraj and Pitur Ranji, which are between 3,000 and 4,000 feet above the sea. From this point the range slightly bends to the south-east, and extends as far as the Bijji taluka and the right bank of the Sabari, and thence to the junction of that river with the Godavari. After forming the boundary between the talukas of Sunkam and Chintalnir it loses most of its regular and well-defined character, till it is lost in irregular masses of hill as it approaches the Godavari. The formation is for three or four hundred feet granite, then metamorphic shales, and on the surface ironstone and laterite. Leaving the Bela Dil\u00e1 behind we descend into the valley of the Dankani, which abounds with small granitic hills, covered with thin jungle and but scanty vegetation;\nfurther eastward the country rises, till after passing Darkari (between Dantiwara and Jagdalpur) the road gradually descends into the plain in which the capital of the dependency stands. Up to Darkari the formation is granite, and the hills are abrupt and irregular; beyond this point a little vitrified sandstone is seen, which again gives way to clay slate of various colours, from a faint yellow to pink, finely laminated, and covered with the deposit of the clayey soil so common throughout this part of the country. This clay slate extends from the T\u00e1ngr\u00ed Dongr\u00ed range at S\u00edt\u00e1pur to Jagdalpur. Proceeding eastwards it becomes harder and of a blue colour, and continues so to the boundary of Bastar and Jaipur. Blue slate is again found north of Jagdalpur towards Seoni, and on the banks of the N\u00e1rang\u00ed river, where it contains iron pyrites in considerable quantities. A small steep range immediately south of S\u00edt\u00e1pur is composed almost entirely of limestone. Passing southwards we reach the extreme height of the T\u00e1ngr\u00ed Dongr\u00ed, where granite, gneiss, and several varieties of talcoze rocks are found, and descending into the more level parts of the Sunkam t\u00e1luka clay slates, while near Sunkam compact limestone with gneiss occurs. On the eastern boundary of the Bastar dependency laterite is met with, and at Jaipur laterite and steatite. This laterite is shaped into blocks for the foundations of houses in Jaipur. The steatite here is of a whitish-yellow colour; it is quarried and used as a building stone, and is soft enough to enable the workmen to cut and fashion it with an adze.\n\nIron ore is found towards the eastern portion of the dependency in small quantities, but it is not much worked. It is also found in immense quantities on the Bel\u00e1 D\u00edl\u00f3 and in the valley of the Jor\u00edv\u00e1g river. The quality is good, but has hardly ever been worked, there being little demand for it. It also occurs, though not so plentifully, towards the north-western boundary. Gold is found in small quantities in the Kutr\u00ed river and towards Prst\u00e9ppur, as also close to the junction of the Kutr\u00ed and Indr\u00e1v\u00e1t\u00ed rivers.\n\nBastar is divided into two distinct parts\u2014the Zam\u00edn\u1e0d\u00e1r\u00eds or chiefships, and the Kh\u00e1lisa or country held directly by the R\u00e9j\u00e1. Internal divisions and Roads. The former occupies nearly all that portion of the dependency which lies south of the Indr\u00e1v\u00e1t\u00ed, and a small tract to the north of it, while almost all the country to the north of the river is kh\u00e1lisa. There is not a single made road in the state, although the configuration of the country and the nature of the soil are rather favourable than otherwise to the construction of fair-weather cart lines. In many places the country is so favourable for wheeled carriages that if the thick jungle on each side of the present track were cut down and uprooted, the communication would be complete during the fair season. There are, however, at certain points difficulties of a serious nature to be surmounted, and for these, efficient establishments would be necessary. There is one route which as soon as the navigation of the God\u00e1var\u00ed is opened will assume considerable importance, viz. the great Banj\u00e1r\u00e1 line from the southern portion of the R\u00e9j\u00e1pur district, which passes through a portion of Bastar, and thence through the Ahr\u00ed chiefship and the Sironch\u00e1 t\u00e1luka, to the head of the second barrier. At this point one branch leads to the large stations on the south-east coast, the other to Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d. By this route wheat is exported annually in great quantities from Chhatt\u00edsgarh.\n\nThe chief exports are lac, resin, wax, galls, horns, rice, sendri (a reddish dye), tikh\u00far or wild arrowroot, gur (molasses or coarse sugar), teakwood, and cocoons of the tasar.\nsilk-worms. No cotton, and but a very small quantity of wheat and gram, are produced, and what passes through on its way to the coast is exported from the southern portions of the R\u00e1ip\u00far district. Large quantities of rice are, however, exported from Bh\u00fap\u00e1lpatnam to the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s territory. The imports are considerably greater than the exports; they consist of salt, piece-goods, brazen utensils, cocoanuts, pepper, spices, opium, turmeric, &c. from the coast; grain, wheat, and paper from R\u00e1ip\u00far; and cotton, partly from R\u00e1ip\u00far and partly from Wair\u00e1gahr in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district. The coast imports come by the way of Jaip\u00far, Sunkam, and Kaller. In the western portions cloth, tobacco, and opium are imported from the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s territories. All petty sales in Bastar are effected by barter in rice or by cowris; but there is such a scarcity of the latter medium of exchange that barter is generally had recourse to. The money table is\u2014\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n20 \\text{ Cowris} &= 1 \\text{ Bor\u00ed}. \\\\\n12 \\text{ Bor\u00eds} &= 1 \\text{ Dug\u00e1n\u00ed}. \\\\\n12 \\text{ Dug\u00e1n\u00eds} &= 1 \\text{ Government Rupee}.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nManufactures there are absolutely none worth noticing. The weavers make a coarse description of cloth, and the Mah\u00e1rs or Pari\u00e1s weave narrow pieces of an inferior fabric which is used for langot\u00eds by the Muri\u00e1s and other wild tribes. There is also a kind of manufacture of brass-pots from the fragments of old ones by a caste called Gh\u00e1s\u00ed\u00e1s. The common hatchets and knives always to be seen in the hands of the inhabitants are made at Madder, Bij\u00e9p\u00far, and Jagdalp\u00far, as even ironsmiths are scarce in Bastar, while it is said that there is not a carpenter in the whole dependency.\n\nAt Jagdalp\u00far there are only two shopkeepers, who do little or no business. Throughout the rest of Bastar, with the exception of at Bij\u00e9p\u00far, Madder, and Bh\u00fap\u00e1lpatnam, there are none of this class, and necessarily in such a country there is much difficulty in procuring supplies. The system at Jagdalp\u00far, as in Jaip\u00far and K\u00e1l\u00e1hand\u00ed, seems to be for the r\u00e1j\u00e1 to keep up granaries and storehouses filled with all the common necessaries of life. The grain is obtained at the cheapest rate, being in some t\u00e1lukas received in part payment of the land tax; it is then stored up in the r\u00e1j\u00e1\u2019s godowns, and retailed to his own establishments and travellers.\n\nFever is prevalent to a great extent all over the dependency. It is most severe during the months of September, October, and November, and is ordinarily accompanied with dysentery and diarrhoea. There are no native doctors, except in Jagdalp\u00far and in the larger villages, and even they are the most ignorant of their class. The people have but few remedies. The agathotes chirayetus is used by those who live where the plant grows; where it is not to be found, pepper, camphor, and opium are employed. Cholera is a rare visitor, not generally appearing more than once in twenty years, and even then being chiefly confined to the larger villages on the more frequented routes. Small-pox is common, and is greatly dreaded by the inhabitants. This is evident from the number of temples dedicated to the goddess \u201cM\u00e1t\u00e1 Dev\u00ed,\u201d which are to be found in nearly every village throughout the dependency and the neighbouring country. The patient in this disease, into whose body it is supposed the goddess M\u00e1t\u00e1 has entered, is attended to with the most scrupulous regard. On the first appearance of the disease his feet are washed with cow\u2019s milk, and wiped upon the head of his nearest relative. M\u00e1t\u00e1 Dev\u00ed is then prayed to take under her special protection the family which she has honoured with a visit. The patient is placed on a clean\nbed of fresh rice-straw, and a screen is put round him. The visits to the temple of Mata Devi are frequent, and the idol is anointed with \"chandan,\" or ground sandalwood and water, which is then taken and sprinkled over the house in which the patient lies, and signed on his forehead. The patient's diet is confined to fruit, cooling food, and liquids; no medicines are administered. Vaccination too is unknown, but inoculation is practised to some extent. Besides these more serious diseases, dysentery, diarrhoea, and rheumatism prevail, the two former especially in the fever season. Hydrocele is also exceedingly common.\n\nThe tribes and castes in Bastar are numerous.\n\n| Tribes and Castes | The principal are\u2014 |\n|-------------------|------------------|\n| 1.

Gadw\u0101.        |                  |\n\nThe Br\u0101hmans found in Bastar are for the most part congregated at and around Jagdalpur, and are of the following sects:\u2014Kanojas, Jarw\u0101s, and Uri\u0101s or Ukkals. They all eat fish, and are not interdicted from drinking water from the hands of the G\u0101hiras. The Dh\u0101kars are the illegitimate offspring of Br\u0101hmans, and wear the sacred thread. In Bastar and in Jaipur a practice formerly existed of either bestowing this distinction for good service, or selling it to particular persons of certain castes; but it does not follow always that all of those castes are now entitled to wear it. The Halb\u0101s, or Halw\u0101s, are scattered over the more level and cultivated tracts. They are seldom found far south of the Indr\u0101vat\u012b, but constitute a numerous class towards the northern part of the state. They dress and live better, and have a better appearance, than most of the other castes; they do not eat the flesh of cows nor of swine, and wear the sacred thread. The Bhatr\u0101s inhabit the eastern portions of the dependency towards Kotp\u0101d, Por\u0101garh, and R\u0101igarh, but are not a numerous caste. They cultivate the soil, and eat nearly everything except the flesh of the cow. A good number have the hereditary privilege of wearing the sacred thread. The Gadw\u0101s, or Gadb\u0101s, though scarce in Bastar, are numerous towards the east and in Jaipur. They subsist partly by cultivation and partly by labour. The dress of the men is like that of other castes, but that worn by the women is singular and worthy of remark. A cloth, three feet by six, made from the fibre of the bark of the karing tree, with horizontal bands of red, yellow, and blue, each about three inches in width, is secured round the waist by a girdle, then brought over the shoulder and fastened down in front of the upper part of the body. The girdle too is curious; it is composed of from forty to fifty separate cords of about eighteen or twenty inches in length, lashed together at the ends in front. A chaplet of the large white seeds of the \"kusa\" grass strung together is fastened round the hair, as are also sometimes strings of white beads; large earrings of three coils of common brass wire, certainly\nthree or four inches in diameter, are suspended to the upper cartilage of the ear, and hang down to the shoulder; and another earring resembling a brass button with a stalk to it is worn in the lobe of the ear. Nose-rings are seldom worn. At the time of the Dasar\u0101, Holi, and other holidays both men and women dance together to the music of a fife and drum. Sometimes they form a ring by joining hands all round, springing towards the centre and then back to the full extent of their arms, while they at the same time keep circling round and round; at other times the women dance singly or in pairs, their hands resting on each other's waists. When fatigued they cease dancing, and sing. A man steps out of the crowd and sings a verse or two impromptu. One of the women rejoins, and they sing at each other for a short time. The point of these songs appears to consist in giving the sharpest rejoinders to each other; the woman reflects upon the man's ungainly appearance and want of skill as a cultivator or huntsman, and the man retorts by reproaching her with her ugliness and slatternly habits. Like most of lower castes in this country, they are addicted to drinking.\n\nThe Muri\u00e1s inhabit the more cultivated plains around Jagdalp\u016br, and extend on the west from N\u00e1gtok\u00e1 to the boundary of Jaipur, and from S\u00edt\u00e1p\u016br to about thirty or forty miles north of the Indr\u00e1vati. Their dress is a waistcloth, or langot\u00ed, with but seldom any covering on the head; their ornaments are necklaces of red beads and small brass earrings. They are active, hardy, and skilful cultivators, and their villages are generally clean and comfortable. They eat everything except the flesh of the cow, and keep great numbers of pigs. Tag\u00e1r\u00e1s and Parj\u00e1s are found in a small tract of country south of Jagdalp\u016br, extending from S\u00edt\u00e1p\u016br to Sunkam; they are a poor race, subsisting partly by cultivation and partly by hunting, and are not so well clothed as the Muri\u00e1s, Bhatr\u00e1s, or Halb\u00e1s. They eat anything, even snakes and other reptiles. On occasions of festivals they dance like the Gadw\u00e1s, but are not such a characteristic race. The Sund\u00eds, who are spirit-dealers, are a numerous class, and generally dispersed throughout the dependency. Owing to the habits of the people they derive much profit from their calling. The Gh\u00e1s\u00ed\u00e1s are an inferior caste, who serve as horsekeepers around Jagdalp\u016br, and also mend and make brass vessels; they dress like the Muri\u00e1s, and subsist partly by cultivation and partly by labour. The Jhuri\u00e1s are found principally in the north-western parts about N\u00e1r\u00e1inpur and Prat\u00e1pp\u016br, and extend towards K\u00e1nker; they are a numerous class, and subsist partly by cultivation, and partly by hunting and the fruits of the forest. Their dress resembles that of the Muri\u00e1s, with whom they may be said to constitute more than one-third of the population of the Bastar dependency, and whom they resemble in customs and appearance.\n\nThe M\u00e1ri\u00e1s are the most numerous caste in Bastar. They inhabit the densest jungles, and are a shy race, avoiding all contact with strangers, and flying to the hills on the least alarm. In appearance they are more uncivilised than the Muri\u00e1s, Bhatr\u00e1s, Halb\u00e1s, Parj\u00e1s, and Tag\u00e1r\u00e1s, about the same in height, but far surpassing them in strength and agility. Their dress depends a good deal on their proximity to civilization, and upon the accessibility of the localities they inhabit. Near Bh\u00fap\u00e1lpatnam and Bij\u00e1pur they are tolerably well clad, but in the wilder and more unfrequented parts, such as the valleys of the Bel\u00e1 D\u00edl\u00e1, and towards the Indr\u00e1vati and the Kutru t\u00e1luka, their clothing is of the very scantiest description. They seldom wear any covering on their heads, and they rarely possess a dhot\u00ed; if they do, it is usually wrapped\nround their loins. Generally speaking they are exceedingly averse to the use of cold water; and as they wear but little clothing, and sleep on the bare ground (in cold weather between two fires), they are often begrimed with dust and ashes. They shave the head all but the top-knot, and as they use an iron knife for this purpose, it is not surprising to find that they dread the disagreeable operation, and have recourse to it as seldom as possible; consequently their hair, which gets excessively matted, is all gathered up into one knot behind or on the crown. Necklaces of beads, red and white, frequently worked into collars of an inch or two in width, are suspended round the necks of the younger men, but seldom worn by the elders. The ears of all are pierced from the upper part of the lobe, and are ornamented with small earrings of brass and iron. On the wrists the men wear brass bracelets, and round the waist is often a girdle of cowrie, double or single, for which is sometimes substituted a belt of about ten or fifteen cords in the same form, but smaller than those already described as worn by the Gadw\u00e1 women. Attached to the girdle is generally a tobacco-box, made of a small hollow bamboo, with a stopper attached by a string. A small knife, without any sheath, made of iron, slightly tempered, is invariably stuck in the girdle behind. They sometimes wear sandals made of the skin of the bison or wild buffalo, and of the rudest description and shape, being secured round the instep and great toe by cords made of grass. A hatchet hanging from the shoulder, or a bow and arrows, complete the costume of the M\u00e1ri\u00e1 as seen in his native wilds. The M\u00e1ri\u00e1s seldom have matchlocks, their weapons being bows and arrows and spears. The bow is generally made of bamboo or of the *grenrica elastica*, and is about five feet in length. The string of the bow which, owing to the impossibility of procuring catgut, is composed of a carefully cut slice of the outside of the bamboo, and secured by cords to the ends of the bow, answers the purpose exceedingly well. All the M\u00e1ri\u00e1s are expert in its use; they often use the feet in bending the bow, while they pull the string with both hands. An arrow discharged in this manner, it is said, would almost pass through the body of a man or deer; but it is only used from elevated positions, such as the tops of rocks, hills, and precipices, upon any object below. The arrows are of many forms, shapes, and sizes, but are all pointed with iron. There are arrows for tigers and big game; arrows for fish and for small birds; and arrows for boys to practice with.\n\nThe M\u00e1ri\u00e1s carry very heavy loads on k\u00e1war sticks, and badly as they are fed, no class of men can surpass them in this respect. They are a timid, quiet, docile race, and although addicted to drinking, are not quarrelsome. Amongst themselves they are most cheerful and light-hearted, always laughing and joking. Seldom does a M\u00e1ri\u00e1 village resound with quarrels or wrangling among either sex, and in this respect they present a marked contrast to the inhabitants of more civilised tracts. In common with many other wild races they bear a singular character for truthfulness and honesty; and when once they get over the feeling of shyness, which is natural to them, they are exceedingly frank and communicative. Curious, like all savages, the commonest article of domestic use is to them an object of interest; they are quick to observe, and apt to learn. Their food consists of rice, where they cultivate it, but generally it is of kosr\u00e1, m\u00e1ndi\u00e1, and other inferior grains, with the dried flowers of the mhowa tree and the fruits of the forest. They are also fond of tobacco, but opium, g\u00e1nj\u00e1, and drugs are generally unknown among them. The dress of the women is of the scantiest description, and consists of a single fold of cloth about one to two feet in depth round their loins. Where cloth is cheap and easily procurable they wear a small sheet wrapped carelessly around them, extending from the shoulder to\nthe knee, but this is rare. They are tattooed on the face, arms, and thighs, which greatly disfigures them. They wear small brass earrings, and large bunches of beads, generally white, round their necks; also sometimes an iron hoop about five inches in diameter, on which are strung small brass and iron rings. They seem more careless regarding personal cleanliness and appearance than the men.\n\nThe M\u00e1r\u00eds, who inhabit the wild and difficult country called \"M\u00e1di\u00e1n,\" or \"Abajm\u00e1rd,\" are of the same class as the M\u00e1ri\u00e1s; but from living in a wild tract to which few venture, and which, from its remoteness, is quite unknown, they are even poorer and more uncivilised than the M\u00e1ri\u00e1s, who live in the more level country. The connection between the two is, however, kept up by intermarriage. The revenue is paid in kind in \"kosr\u00e1\" (panicum italicum), an inferior grain, which is their chief food. The collection is made by the ch\u00e1lk\u00ed (s\u00e1rk\u00ed in Telugu), a person whose express duty it is to go round and collect it for the zamind\u00e1r. He is the only person who is acquainted with the villages, the sites of which are continually being changed, as one patch of dahy\u00e1 cultivation is forsaken for another. The Tells of a frontier village called P\u00e1rkel\u00e1 form a sort of connecting link between the M\u00e1r\u00eds and the outside world, as they are the only persons who venture into Abajm\u00e1rd for the sake of trade. They take coarse cloths, beads and salt; and return with kosr\u00e1, castor-oil seeds, and wax. In these wild tracts the M\u00e1r\u00eds have the greatest fear of a horse, or of an unusual number of people coming suddenly upon their villages. The course pursued by Captain Glasfurd, the deputy commissioner of the Upper God\u00e1var\u00ed district, who first thoroughly explored this part of the country in company with Captain F. G. Stewart, the explorer of forests, was to leave his camp some two or three days' march distant, and go forward accompanied with as few people as possible, and without tents or other incumbrances. On approaching a village he used invariably to dismount, take a guide from among the few M\u00e1r\u00eds who accompanied him as coolies, proceed quietly to the village, and order the rest of the people to follow. In this manner the inhabitants were reassured, and never ran away, as they would certainly have done on the sudden appearance of the whole party. The M\u00e1r\u00ed villages are all built of grass, the walls being composed of a strong high grass neatly put together, and afterwards daubed with mud. Captain Glasfurd found the men more scantily clothed than any he had hitherto seen, but in all respects very similar to the M\u00e1ri\u00e1s. They did not appear to shave the head. They seemed to be of the same size as the other wild tribes, viz. about five feet four inches in height, and well made, with large and muscular limbs. Most were of an exceedingly light copper colour, while others were actually fair. The dress of the females, like that of the men, was even scantier than those of the M\u00e1ri\u00e1 women, consisting merely of a very small cloth wrapped once round the loins. Their hair was tied in a knot behind, and secured with a bamboo comb with four teeth. As for ornaments, they had few beads and fewer earrings, but were tattooed, which gave even those who might have had some pretensions to good looks a disagreeable appearance. Their practice is to tattoo themselves when about ten years old: the skin is pricked with a thorn, and ground charcoal mixed with the oil of a certain berry is rubbed in. Some of the elder women and children wore only a square patch of cloth, suspended on a cord fastened round the waist, upon which bamboo rings were strung. All the M\u00e1ri\u00e1s seen by Captain Glasfurd seemed healthy, and there was a fair percentage of old people. Like the M\u00e1ri\u00e1s, the M\u00e1r\u00eds seemed quiet, truthful, and honest, and though timid, they are readily reassured by kind treatment.\nThe portion of the M\u0101di\u00e1n country which is under Kutru is very hilly, but towards the north it is said to be of a more accessible nature. Perennial streams of fine clear water are numerous in these hills, the sides of which are covered with a fertile red soil of some depth. On these slopes the M\u0101ri\u00e1s cultivate kosr\u00e1, and on the more level places castor-oil seeds and tobacco. They possess no buffaloes, bullocks, or cows, and do not use the plough, their only agricultural implement being a long-handled iron hoe, which they use in the patches where they cultivate tobacco and castor-oil seeds. They are not so much addicted to drinking as the M\u0101ri\u00e1s in the lower country, for no mhowa trees grow in those hills, and the m\u0101d\u00ed palm (caryota urens) is scarce. They know nothing of opium and other drugs.\n\nThe population of Bastar is divided into castes in about the following proportions:\n\n- M\u0101ri\u00e1s and Jhuri\u00e1s ..... 45 per cent.\n- Halb\u00e1s and Muri\u00e1s ..... 15 per cent.\n- Bhatr\u00e1s and Parj\u00e1s ..... 15 per cent.\n- Tag\u00e1r\u00e1s and other castes ..... 25 per cent.\n\nThe M\u0101ri\u00e1s and Jhuri\u00e1s are probably a subdivision of the true Gond family. The Halb\u00e1s are possibly a superior offshoot of the same tribe, while the Bhatr\u00e1s and Muri\u00e1s may be a somewhat inferior one. The Tag\u00e1r\u00e1s and Parj\u00e1s are the lowest perhaps of all the many branches of this wide-spread race.\n\nThe dialects in Bastar are numerous, nearly every caste having its own, but they are most of them so similar that they cannot be considered as distinct languages. Omitting Telugu, they may be roughly classed as the M\u0101ri\u00e1, or aboriginal dialect, and the Halb\u00e1. The last closely resembles the Chhattisgarh\u00ed dialect. There is a great admixture of Mar\u00e1th\u00ed in it, or rather there are many Mar\u00e1th\u00ed affixes, and it often happens that a pure Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed word is taken, and a Mar\u00e1th\u00ed termination is added. Indeed the whole language in this part of the country is a jargon of Mar\u00e1th\u00ed and Hind\u00ed words\u2014grammar and idioms all jumbled up in indescribable confusion. It is spoken by the Halb\u00e1s and Muri\u00e1s, and may be said to be subdivided into the Parj\u00e1 or Tag\u00e1r\u00e1, and Bhatr\u00e1 dialects. It is spoken by all in Jagdalp\u00far, from the R\u00e1j\u00e1 to the lowest of his subjects. The Muri\u00e1s, Bhatr\u00e1s, Dh\u00e1kars, Gadw\u00e1s, M\u0101ri\u00e1s, &c. all worship \u201cDanteswar\u00ed,\u201d or, as she is sometimes called, \u201cM\u00e1uli,\u201d with \u201cM\u00e1t\u00e1 Dev\u00ed,\u201d \u201cBhang\u00e1rm\u00e1\u201d or \u201cDholl\u00e1 Dev\u00ed,\u201d \u201cG\u00e1m Dev\u00ed,\u201d \u201cDangan Deo,\u201d and \u201cBh\u00edm.\u201d The higher castes worship \u201cDanteswar\u00ed\u201d and \u201cM\u00e1t\u00e1 Dev\u00ed,\u201d with the other well known deities of the Hind\u00fa Pantheon. Danteswar\u00ed, who is the tutelar divinity of the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Bastar, and generally of the Bastar dependency, is the same as Bhaw\u00e1n\u00ed or \u201cK\u00e1l\u00ed.\u201d She is represented to have taken the ancestors of the reigning family under her particular protection from the time of their leaving Hind\u00fast\u00e1n and during their stay at Warangal, and to have directed and accompanied them in their flight when driven out of the kingdom of Telingana by the Mohammadan as far as Dantiw\u00e1r\u00e1, where she took up her abode. The temple dedicated to her is at the confluence of the Sankan\u00ed and Dankan\u00ed upon a narrow point\nof land between the two rivers. The original building was erected by Anam R\u00e1j, and several additions have been made to it at subsequent periods by other R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Bastar. In appearance it is a mere shed, and the sculpture, except of some small idols brought from the ruins near B\u00e1sur, is wretchedly done. Inside the temple enclosure the P\u00faj\u00e1ri resides. This person's office is hereditary, and his ancestors are said to have followed Danteswari from Warangal. Two blocks of steatite which stand in the temple bear inscriptions* commemorating a prince of the N\u00e1gban\u00ed line.\n\nIt is said that Meria sacrifices were formerly practised at this place, but the fact was never satisfactorily brought home to the late R\u00e1j\u00e1 or his brother, the present diw\u00e1n, Dalganjan Singh. The latter was called up to N\u00e1gpur in 1842 to be examined regarding the matter, and a guard was placed over the temple, which has up to the present time been continued. If the abominable rite ever existed, which is doubtful, it has altogether fallen into disuse, and the R\u00e1j\u00e1 has been made personally responsible for any recurrence of the practice. Most travellers, however, sacrifice a goat as they pass the shrine Danteswari. The grovelling superstition with which the worshippers of this goddess are imbued, and the awe with which she is regarded by the inhabitants, especially in the vicinity of Jagdalp\u00far, and particularly by the R\u00e1j\u00e1's family, relatives, and attendants, is not to be surpassed in any part of India. Nothing is done, no business undertaken, without consulting her; not even will the R\u00e1j\u00e1 or diw\u00e1n proceed on a pleasure party or hunting excursion without consulting \"M\u00e1t\u00e1\" (mother). Dalganjan Singh, who is in everything but name the ruler of the dependency, is her most bigoted devotee. Flowers are placed on the head of the idol, and as they fall to the right or to the left, so is the reply interpreted as favourable or otherwise.\n\nThe temples to \"M\u00e1t\u00e1 Devi\" are perhaps as numerous, or more so than those dedicated to Danteswari. Of the remaining deities, Bh\u00edmsen, or Bh\u00edm Deo, is the principal. He is represented by a post about four or five feet high with a knob on the top. The first grain of the season is always offered to him. He is worshipped greatly in seasons of drought, when pilgrimages are made to certain places, and turmeric, mud, and oil are smeared over his effigy. In seasons of sickness a small effigy of Danteswari is brought from Dantiw\u00e1r\u00e1 to Jagdalp\u00far and is there worshipped, and after the sickness has abated is sent back again. On these occasions it is carried in a palankeen.\n\nThroughout the dependency the grossest ignorance and superstition prevail, Superstitions. and hold the minds of the people, from the highest to the lowest, in miserable thraldom. The simple and unsophisticated Gond tribes are believed to be expert necromancers, and on the most intimate footing with evil spirits. Considering their seclusion from civilised life, their gross ignorance, and the solitary jungles in which they live, it is perhaps not to be wondered at that the people invariably impute their misfortunes to witchcraft. If a man's bullock dies, he puts it down to witchcraft; if his crops fail, it is because the land has been bewitched by some one who is at enmity with the owner; a lingering sickness or painful disease is laid at the door of an enemy; and in short every evil that befalls a family, from the most common affairs of everyday life to the most serious calamity, is thus accounted for. In such an unhappy state of degradation and ignorance it is not surprising\n\n* Vide Selections from Records of Government of India, Foreign Department, No. xxxix. page 63.\nthat persons suspected of witchcraft are most cruelly treated. The wonder is that many should be found to confess that they have the power of which they are accused. The usual course of procedure, when any one is suspected and accused of being a sorcerer, is as follows. On the accused person being arrested, a fisherman's net is wound round his head to prevent his escaping or bewitching his guards, and he is at once subjected to the preparatory test. Two leaves of the pipal tree\u2014one representing him and the other his accusers\u2014are thrown upon his out-stretched hands; if the leaf in his name fall uppermost he is supposed to be a suspicious character; if the leaf fall with the lower part upwards, it is possible that he may be innocent, and the popular feeling is in his favour. The following day the final test is applied; he is sewn into a sack, and, in the presence of the heads of the village, his accusers, and his friends, is carried into water waist-deep, and let down to the bottom; if the unhappy man cannot struggle up and manage to get into a standing posture with his head above water, he is said, after a short pause, to be innocent, and the assembled elders quickly direct him to be taken out; if he manages, however, in his struggles for life to raise himself above water, he is adjudged guilty, and brought out to be dealt with for witchcraft. He is then beaten by the crowd, his head is shaved, and his front teeth are knocked out with a stone to prevent him from muttering incantations. All descriptions of filth are thrown at him; if of good caste, hog's flesh is forced into his mouth; and lastly he is driven out of the country, followed by the abuse and execrations of his enlightened fellowmen. Women suspected of sorcery have to undergo the same ordeal; if found guilty, the same punishment is awarded them; and after being shaved, their hair is attached to a tree in some public place.\n\nBATIA'GARH\u2014An old town and fort in the Damoh district, formerly the residence of a Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 \"A'mil,\" and the head-quarters of a considerable tract. It is situated on the right bank of the Biak, twenty miles north-west of Damoh. There are here a police station and a district post-office. The population is about 1,000 souls.\n\nBATKA'GARH\u2014A zam\u00ednd\u00e1r\u00ed in the Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 district. It joins Hara\u00ed and Sonp\u00far to the northward and westward, and is bounded on its northern face by the district of Narsinghp\u00far. It lies almost due north of Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1, and is situated partly on the lofty range of hills that intersects the northern portion of the district, running from near A'd\u00e9g\u00e1on on the east to A's\u00edr on the western border, and thence to Sh\u00e1hp\u00far in the Bet\u00fal district, and partly on the lesser ranges that intervene between it and the valley of the Narbad\u00e1. It consists of eighty-one villages, sixty-five of which are inhabited. The zam\u00ednd\u00e1r, who is a Gond by caste, receives an allowance of 960 rupees per annum from government in commutation of rights formerly enjoyed by him, from which is deducted a quit-rent of twenty rupees.\n\nBAURGARH\u2014A hill in the Jabalp\u00far district, situated to the south-west of Jabalp\u00far, rising about 500 feet above the valley. It is formed of schistose quartzite, and is separated from the general range of trap hills by a narrow gorge. Coal is found in the neighbourhood. This hill must not be mistaken for another of the same name thirty-three miles south of Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d.\n\nBAURGARH\u2014An isolated granite (or granitoid) hill near Sh\u00e1hp\u00far in the Bet\u00fal district, some twenty-five miles north-west of Bet\u00fal. It is abruptly scarped on all sides but one, and has the ruins of an old fort on the top.\nBAUR\u2014BEL\n\nBAURGARH\u2014A forest range on the northern border of the Betul district, of about one hundred square miles in extent, and containing some fine teak and other timber.\n\nBAZA'RGON\u2014A village in the Nagpur district, situated in a very picturesque country about twenty-five miles west of Nagpur, on the old road to Bisnur and Amrati. It consists mainly of one long broad street lining the road on each side. The houses are remarkably good and substantial, and the whole place is clean and well kept. The number of inhabitants is 1,993, mostly dependent on trading. Many of these traders are Jains. Living on the great road to Berar and Bombay, they were in former days able to forestall the Nagpur traders, and taking advantage of the fluctuations of the markets, to make their own terms with the Banjara tandas bringing salt and other merchandise to Nagpur. Since the opening of the railway the importance of the through traffic by this\u2014the \"Bisnur route\"\u2014has greatly fallen off. An excellent building for police, a good school-house, and other municipal works have recently been constructed by the municipality. On the west side of the town a very fine masonry reservoir was made about twenty-three years ago by the father of Ranoji Naik, the present proprietor of Bazaragon. The grove on its embankment is a favourite encamping place for Banjaras and travellers. There is a fort on the south side of the village, built about sixty years ago by Dvarkoji Naik, a commander of 5,000 mercenaries, and commissary general under Raja Janoji of Nagpur, who also founded the town. His grandson Gauraji succeeded to his lands and honours. Ranoji Naik, the present representative of the family, receives a pension from government.\n\nBEL\u2014A river rising in the high plateau of Multai in the Betul district, and one of the chief affluents of the Kanhan.\n\nBELA' (VELA)\u2014An agricultural town in the Nagpur district, ten miles south of Bor on the left bank of the river Wan. It is within three miles of the borders of the Wardha district. The population numbers 5,092. The local committee have recently constructed here two fine \"baolis,\" school, and police buildings. Strong plain cotton cloth is made at, and exported from Bela; and \"gunny,\" the fabric of which the Banjaras' packs are made, is also largely manufactured. The town, according to the local traditions, was founded in the time of the Gaulis. The fort was built by one Rai Singh Chaudhari, a large landholder in these parts, whose descendants are still malguzars of Bela, and was twice destroyed during the Pindhari troubles.\n\nBELONA'\u2014A town in the Nagpur district, situated four miles north-east of Mowar and fifty-six miles from Nagpur, on the banks of a small tributary of the Wardha. The houses are generally poor. The surrounding country is rich, and the population, which is purely agricultural, numbers 3,492 persons. Since octroi has been levied here some improvements have been taken in hand by the local committee, and Belona now has its school, market-place, and streets.\n\nBELPAN\u2014A small village in the Bilaspur district, situated fifteen miles west of Bilaspur. It is believed that a natural spring here, called \"Narbad,\" is an emanation from the source of the great Narbad at Amarkantak. Some centuries ago, the legend runs, a devout Brahman resided at Belpan, who at an advanced age was constant in his pilgrimages to Amarkantak. Though his sight was dimmed with years, and his body was weak and emaciated, he still persisted\nin these journeys, in the face of all the sufferings and inconveniences they entailed. As a reward, this spring was opened near his own residence, and he was informed that it issued from the great Narbad\u00e1. A temple was then built near the spring, and a large reservoir constructed. Subsequently the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Ratanpur endowed the temple with the revenues of the Belp\u00e1n village, which was granted rent-free to the descendants of the devout Br\u00e1hman. The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s upheld the grant, which continues to be enjoyed under the British government.\n\nBELPATHA'R\u2014A village in the Jabalp\u00far district near Jh\u00e1ns\u00edgh\u00e1t, at which the viaduct of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway crosses the Narbad\u00e1.\n\nBEMARAM\u2014A block of teak forest belonging to the group described under the article \"Ahiri.\"\n\nBENI'\u2014A town in the Bhand\u00e1ra district, situated on the Waingang\u00e1, about fifty miles north-east of Bhand\u00e1ra. It contains 534 houses, with a population of 2,569 souls. There is here a small trade in cotton-cloth locally manufactured; and the dyers of Beni are noted for the excellence of their colours and of their patterns for carpets, &c. There are a small government school and a police outpost in the town. The site is well raised and open, and the climate is considered healthy.\n\nBERIA'\u2014A market-town in the Nim\u00e1r district, about twenty-eight miles N.E. of Khandw\u00e1, containing 1,200 inhabitants. It was founded in the time of the Ghori dynasty of M\u00e1lw\u00e1. A large reservoir was then constructed at L\u00e1chor\u00e1, about two miles south of the town. It had long been breached and useless, when Captain French, political agent, repaired it in A.D. 1846. It now irrigates about two hundred acres of land, and supplies the town with abundance of pure water.

Beyond its western border the Ber\u00e1r country begins. On the north it is bounded along its whole length by the Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d district and the Makr\u00e1i territory, and on the east by Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1; while of its southern border the eastern half touches the N\u00e1gpur district, and the western half marches with Ber\u00e1r. It is situated between 21\u00b0 20' and 22\u00b0 35' of north latitude, and 77\u00b0 20' and 78\u00b0 35' of east longitude; and has a mean elevation above the sea of about 2,000 feet, though some points of course are much higher, reaching to little\nshort of 3,700 feet above the sea level. Essentially a highland tract, but possessing every variety of external feature, it divides itself naturally into several distinct portions, differing both in outward appearance, character of soil, and geological formation. The chief town of Bet\u00fal is centrically situated, and lies in a level basin of rich soil, traversed by the perennial streams of the Machn\u00e1 and S\u00e1mpn\u00e1, and shut in by abrupt lines of stony hills on all sides but the west, where it is bounded by the deep valley of the Tapt\u00ed, clothed on either side with dense jungle. This tract is almost entirely under cultivation, and is studded with numerous and thriving village communities. To the south lies a rolling plateau of basaltic formation, with the sacred town of Mult\u00e1t\u00ed, and the springs of the river Tapt\u00ed at its highest point,\u2014extending over the whole of the southern face of the district, and finally merging into the wild and broken line of gh\u00e1ts which lead down to the lower country of the plains. This part of the district consists of a succession of stony ridges of trap-rock, enclosing valleys or basins of fertile soil of very varying extent and capabilities, to which the cultivation is mostly confined, except where the shallow soil on the tops of the hills has been turned to account. The whole of the culturable soil has now been taken up; there are but few trees; and the general aspect is bare and uninviting. To the north of Bet\u00fal there lies a tract of poor country, thinly inhabited, and sparsely cultivated, terminating in the main chain of the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1 hills, beyond which a considerable fall takes place in the general level of the country. North again lies an irregular plain of sandstone formation, having in places the appearance of a vast park, well wooded, but with a scanty population, and little cultivated land, much of it being virtually unfit for the plough. To the extreme north the district is bounded by a line of hills which rise abruptly out of the great plain of the Narbad\u00e1 valley. The western portion of this tract is a mass of hill and jungle, inhabited almost wholly by Gonds and Kurk\u00fas. It has but a few hamlets, isolated by long tracts of waste land, and when seen from the top of some neighbouring hill presents the appearance of a vast unbroken wilderness.\n\nThe principal rivers of the district are the Tapt\u00ed, the Wardh\u00e1, the Bel, the Machn\u00e1, the S\u00e1mpn\u00e1, and the Moran. The first three of these rise in the high plateau of Mult\u00e1t\u00ed, which thus sends its waters both to the western and eastern coasts. The Taw\u00e1 rises in Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1, and flowing, for a short distance only, through the north-east corner of this district, eventually joins the Narbad\u00e1 above Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d. These are the only rivers of any size; but throughout the district, and more especially in the Mult\u00e1t\u00ed and A\u2019tner parganas amid the trap formation, there are a number of smaller streams which retain water in places all the year round. Some use is made of these for irrigation.\n\nRoads.\n\nFive main roads * radiate from the centre of the district\u2014\n\n(1) From Badn\u00far (Bet\u00fal) towards N\u00e1gpur; partially bridged.\n(2) \u201d \u201d towards Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d; bridged the whole way.\n(3) \u201d \u201d towards M\u00e1n via Hard\u00e1.\n(4) \u201d \u201d towards Ellichp\u00far and Badner\u00e1; partially bridged.\n(5) \u201d \u201d towards Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1.\n\nCarts can travel at all seasons of the year on the above five roads. There is also a branch road from Sh\u00e1hp\u00far towards Soh\u00e1gp\u00far.\n\n* See Appendix A.\nThe only high-level plateau is on the hill of Kh\u00e1m\u00e1, in the south-west corner of the district. This forms part of a range adjoining the hills of G\u00e1walgarh and Chikald\u00e1 in Ber\u00e1r, and attains a height in places of 3,700 feet above the sea. It is almost out of reach of the hot winds, and would no doubt be an agreeable residence during the hot season. The present difficulty is the want of water, all efforts to obtain well-water having hitherto failed, and all supplies having to be brought a considerable distance from the base of the hill. The climate of Bet\u00fal generally, at least to Europeans, is fairly salubrious; its height above the plains and the neighbourhood of extensive forests moderate the great heat of the sun, and render the temperature pleasant throughout the greater part of the year. During the cold season the thermometer at night continually falls to several degrees below the freezing point; little or no hot wind is felt before the end of April, and even then it ceases after sunset. The nights in the hot season are invariably cool and pleasant. During the monsoon the climate is very damp, and at times even cold and raw, thick clouds and mist enveloping the sky for many days together. The average rainfall is forty inches. In the denser jungles of course malaria prevails for months after the cessation of the rains, but the Gonds do not appear to suffer much from its effects. Travellers and strangers are, however, liable to fever of a severe type at almost all seasons of the year.\n\nIn Appendix B will be found a table of observations taken in 1868.\n\nThe geology of Bet\u00fal is very remarkable. The appended extracts, from a description by Mr. Blanford of the Geological Survey*, will give a good idea of it:\n\n\"The tract described consists principally of the upper drainage area of the Tapt\u00ed as distinguished from that of its great affluent, the P\u00edrm\u00e1. A small portion of the country drained by the tributaries of the greater Taw\u00e1, and therefore within the Narbad\u00e1 watershed, is also included.\"\n\n\"All the southern and western portions of this area are of trap. Around Bet\u00fal, and for some distance west of that town, infra-trappean rocks are met with. South of this (the Taw\u00e1 valley) is a belt of high ground upon which Bet\u00fal stands. To the north this is composed of metamorphic rocks; to the south all is trap.\n\n\"The boundary of these rocks from \u00c1'ml\u00e1 to Soh\u00e1gpur and thence westward south of Bet\u00fal is natural and not faulted. Its features are well marked, the traps rising in a continuous range, flat-topped, as usual, to the south, while the very granitoid metamorphics either occupy a level plain or form isolated hills and short ranges. Upon some of the latter outliers of trap occur, but they are of no great size. At one spot there is a small patch of conglomerate between the base of the trap and the metamorphics. Gneiss, rather less granitoid than further east, but still highly crystalline, forms the hills stretching across to the north of the civil station of Badn\u00far. Some crystalline limestone was found in them, but it was so much intermixed with felspar as to be useless for burning into lime.\n\n\"The highly cultivated plain of Bet\u00fal is composed of a thick alluvial deposit, entirely devoid of black soil.\u2020 It is traversed by the upper portion\n\n* Memoirs of the Geological Survey of India, vol. vi. part 3, pp. 108 ff.\n\u2020 This is one of numerous instances in which the boundary of the traps is the boundary of the black soil also.\nof the Machn\u00e1 river, a tributary of the Taw\u00e1. The range of low trap hills already mentioned bound this valley to the south, and form, in fact, the parting ridge between its drainage and that of the Tapt\u00ed.\n\n\"Along this low scarp the beds of trap are in part horizontal, in other places they have a very low southern dip. For some distance along the range there is a bed, and in places probably two beds of intertrappean sedimentary deposits, abounding in fossils. The most eastern locality where this is seen is east of Bay\u00e1wad\u00ed; beyond that to the eastward the intertrappean band probably thins out. An unfossiliferous calcareous mass was met with near Kh\u00e1p\u00e1, still further east, but it was at a higher level, and, if belonging to an intertrappean bed, must have been part of a distinct stratum from that seen at Bay\u00e1wad\u00ed. About Soh\u00e1g\u00far and further east no trace of any intertrappean bed could be found. The fossiliferous bed is best exposed near the village of Loh\u00e1rl, and on the sides of the road from Bet\u00fal to Dholan and Mans\u00fad. At the top of the gh\u00e1t, upon this road, there are many scattered fragments containing shells, wood, cyprides, &c., but no bed is seen in place. On the face of the hill, however, a few feet below the top there is a bed scarcely distinguishable in mineral character from the trap, from the debris of which it appears to have been composed, but abounding in fossils, especially *physa prunseptii*, *lymnea*, *paludina*, *valvata*, and plants. Lower down there is a thin band of very silicious rock resembling hornstone, also abounding in shells. It is not quite clear that this bed is distinct from the upper one, but it has much the appearance of being so, and it is highly probable that the fragments found on the top of the gh\u00e1t are from a still higher bed.\n\n\"The principal sedimentary band was seen in place at Surg\u00e1on, and traced by fragments further. The same or another occurs also south of Ker\u00ed, on the road leading south to the Tapt\u00ed (the Bet\u00fal and Ellichp\u00far road), and again south of the river, near the top of the gh\u00e1t, ascending to the tableland. It abounds in fossils everywhere.\n\n\"The traps south of Bet\u00fal are mostly horizontal until the neighbourhood of the scarp at the verge of the Ber\u00e1r plain.\n\n\"To the west of Bet\u00fal the metamorphic rocks disappear gradually beneath the trap, not being all covered up at once as to the south, but stretching in valley far within the trap hills. Between the two series also in this direction conglomerates and sandstones are met with, which represent similar beds in the Dh\u00e1r forest and elsewhere, and are almost certainly representatives of the B\u00e1gh beds.\n\n\"Commencing north-west of Bet\u00fal the sandstone represented on the very edge of Mr. Medlicott's map near Kopr\u00e1b\u00e1n\u00ed is about 100 feet thick, coarse, and conglomeritic in part, and resembling that on the top of Ratanmal hill, north of Chot\u00e1 Ud\u00e9p\u00far, and that of the Dh\u00e1r forest. Like them it contains small pebbles of red jasper. It forms near Kopr\u00e1b\u00e1n\u00ed, a small plain on the top of a rise of metamorphic rock. It is represented by Mr. Medlicott as Mah\u00e1deva\u2014a circumstance which is in favour of the identification of that formation with the cretaceous beds of B\u00e1gh.\n\n\"At Chiklf, south-east of Kopr\u00e1b\u00e1n\u00ed, there is no sandstone at the site of the present village, and trap rests directly upon the metamorphics. Just south, however, at the old site the sandstone recurs, and extends away to the south towards Alamp\u00far, east of which village it becomes much thicker, and covers a tract of country extending for about three miles along\nthe Chichol\u00ed and Bet\u00fal road. Very little, however, is seen at the surface. A well at Alamp\u00far, sunk just south of the road, passed through a few feet of trap, and was then dug for at least twenty-five feet through argillaceous sandstone, bright brick-red in colour, but in part mottled with white and lilac. The greater part of the sandstone is coarse and conglomeritic, but argillaceous bands, red or purple in colour, occur occasionally.* Some of the sandstones are hard, massive, and white in colour, like those of S\u00e1lbald\u00ed in Ber\u00e1r. The whole thickness must be considerable. * * The areas of sandstone and metamorphics are in reality dotted over with outliers of the higher formations, and the lower beds are exposed frequently within the main boundary of the traps.\n\n\"There must be a great thickness of sandstone in the valley of Khatt\u00e1-p\u00e1n\u00ed and Kh\u00e1m\u00e1p\u00far. The beds are massive, but still distinctly bedded, and have a general dip to the south. On the hills south-west of Khatt\u00e1-p\u00e1n\u00ed a comparatively thin band of horizontal conglomerate is alone met with. This is in favour of the Khatt\u00e1-p\u00e1n\u00ed sandstones being something distinct. Similar beds to the last, and with the same close resemblance to the conglomerates of Chikl\u00ed, are traced between the traps and metamorphics south of the Tapt\u00ed. They are constantly conglomeritic, containing pebbles of various coloured quartzites, red jasper, &c. They are not felspathic, nor do they contain calcareous or ferruginous concretions. At Bor\u00ed close to the road leading through J\u00edn to K\u00edrl\u00ed some of the sandstone is so much mixed with silica as to be in part converted into chert. This has been shown to be a common character in the B\u00e1gh and Lamet\u00e1 beds.\n\n\"There is a peculiar inlier of metamorphics and sandstone exposed in the Tapt\u00ed south-west of Bet\u00fal. To the north about Chikl\u00ed, Alamp\u00far, &c., the traps are horizontal, but they roll over to the south just north of the river, and the lower rocks are for the most part concealed by them. The Tapt\u00ed, however, runs in a deep narrow gorge, in the bottom of which the infratrapean rocks are exposed again. At the eastern extremity, which is near K\u00edrl\u00ed, no sandstone occurs, but a few miles to the west it comes in, and continues to be exposed further to the west than the metamorphics are. On the road from Bet\u00fal to Ellichp\u00far this trough of metamorphic rocks is crossed, and the base of the trap south of the river appears to be decidedly lower than to the north, showing the sharp southern dip of the base of the traps. Here the river runs from east to west, but a little higher up it runs from the south, and just above the turn the traps alone occur in the river bed, the top of the metamorphics having dipped under them.\"\n\nThe most important outcrops of coal in this district will be found thus described in the Memoirs of the Geological Survey of India, Vol. II. Part 2, p. 268:\n\n\"2. Suk\u00ed N\u00e1l\u00e1\u2014Only strings three or four inches thick occur, as noted by Mr. Medlicott.\n\n\"3. About two miles east of Sh\u00e1hp\u00far, in the Machn\u00e1 river, a seam two feet three inches thick is seen associated with shale, and a lower seam three inches thick, as above mentioned. The upper seam can be traced for a short distance, about one hundred yards.\n\n\"4. Mardanp\u00far, on the Machn\u00e1\u2014Mr. Medlicott saw two seams here; one was probably concealed by sand at the time of my visit, but it was only six inches thick; the other amounts to three feet in places, but is extremely\n\n* It is possible that these rocks may be the same as those of K\u00e1mth\u00ed near N\u00e1gp\u00far.\nvariable. The roof is again coarse sandstone. The seam is seen for several yards along the south (right) bank of the stream, but is not seen where, if continuous, it should recur on the north bank. It is possible that there may be a fault, but I could find no indication of one; it appeared to me that the associated sandstone reappeared without the coal seam, and my impression was that the latter had thinned out and vanished completely.\n\n\"5. R\u00e1wandeo, on the Taw\u00e1 river\u2014A careful description and a measured section of this locality are given by Mr. Medlicott at page 154 of the Memoirs; yet such changes have been produced by the stream in ten years that I had much difficulty in recognising several of the beds. I believe the rocks in the upper part of the section to be better exposed on the whole now than they were in 1855, while the lower portion is now comparatively concealed. I counted eleven outcrops of coal, Mr. Medlicott thirteen, of which he considers several to be repetitions caused by small faults. At the same time he mentions that there was no clear evidence of faulting, and I certainly do not think there is any in the upper part of the section, and I think, so far as the number of seams exposed is concerned, that he has underrated the resources of the spot rather than otherwise. Some of the coal is of excellent quality, and one or two seams are four feet thick, in places at all events.\n\n\"On the other hand the roof is frequently, though not always, coarse sandstone. The seams are not of even thickness throughout, some, perhaps all, being very variable. Most of them are only seen for a few feet, and in only two cases could I trace them the whole distance across the river. One so traced varied but slightly in thickness, being about one foot to one foot three inches; the other was two feet thick on one bank of the stream and gradually thinned away, vanishing completely before reaching the other bank, less than fifty yards distant. Both these seams were associated with flags and shales.\n\n\"It will thus be seen that, except at R\u00e1wandeo, not one seam is known to occur exceeding three feet in thickness, and I doubt if any seam of that thickness can be profitably mined in India. I am aware that much thinner seams are worked in England, some, I believe, not exceeding eighteen inches, though that is exceptional. But in England there are three advantages at least which are wanting in India. These are\u20141, A large local demand. 2, Excellence of quality. 3, A skilled mining population.\"\n\nThe forests are very extensive, the whole uncleared region occupying some 700 square miles. Five of the best timber-bearing tracts have been reserved by the government; they contain a vast quantity of young teak, with some fine trees; some magnificent s\u00faj (pentaptera glabra), kaw\u00e1 (pentaptera arjuna), shisham (dalbergia latifolia), s\u00e1lai (boswellia thurifera), and other good timber trees. The unreserved wastes have been divided into lots of 3,000 acres, for sale or grant on clearance leases. The woods are under the management of the district authorities, and are guarded by the forest law.\n\nOf the history of the district we know nothing until we come to quite recent times. We do indeed know that the district must have been the centre of the first of the four ancient Gond kingdoms of Kherl\u00e1, Deogarh, Mandla, and Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1, but except an occasional mention in Farisht\u00e9, no historical information as to the Kherl\u00e1 kingdom remains.\nThe following particulars regarding the Kherl\u00e1 Gond dynasty are taken from Farishta.* These princes are first mentioned in 1398, when they are said to have had great wealth and power, being possessed of all the hills of Gondw\u00e1na and other countries. About that year Narsingh R\u00e1j of Kherl\u00e1 invaded Ber\u00e1r, but was defeated by F\u00edroz Sh\u00e1h, the B\u00e1bham\u00ed king. Twenty years afterwards Kherl\u00e1 was invaded by Sult\u00e1n Hoshang Sh\u00e1h of M\u00e1lw\u00e1, and reduced to the position of a dependency on that kingdom. About 1427 the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Kherl\u00e1 invoked the assistance of the B\u00e1bham\u00ed kings against Hoshang Sh\u00e1h of M\u00e1lw\u00e1, who was defeated, and had to withdraw into his own territories. Six years later, however, in 1433 the M\u00e1lw\u00e1 prince, taking advantage of the war between the kings of Gujar\u00e1t and the Deccan, again invaded Kherl\u00e1, and entirely reduced the fortress and its dependent territories. This conquest was recognised by the B\u00e1bham\u00ed king on the condition that his claim to Ber\u00e1r should thenceforward stand unquestioned. For thirty-four years Kherl\u00e1 remained undisturbedly in the possession of the kings of M\u00e1lw\u00e1, but in 1467 it was again besieged and taken by the B\u00e1bham\u00ed power. It was, however, restored by treaty on the former conditions. A century afterwards the kingdom of M\u00e1lw\u00e1 became incorporated into the dominions of the Emperor of Delhi.\n\nIt is said that a Gaul\u00ed power supplanted the ancient Gond dynasty, and that it again yielded to a second Gond upheaval. Be this as it may, it is not until the commencement of the eighteenth century that we touch upon history at all. At this time (A.D. 1703) the Musalm\u00e1n convert Gond R\u00e1j\u00e1 Bakht Buland reigned at Deogarh, in the present Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 district, and possessed the whole of the N\u00e1gp\u00far country below the gh\u00e1ts. He was succeeded by Ch\u00e1nd Sult\u00e1n, who had two sons, the elder, Burh\u00e1n Sh\u00e1h, and the second, Akbar Sh\u00e1h. When Ch\u00e1nd Sult\u00e1n died in 1739, these two boys being very young, Wal\u00ed Sh\u00e1h, an illegitimate son of Ch\u00e1nd Sult\u00e1n, usurped the throne. The boys\u2019 mother then applied to Raghoj\u00ed Bhonsl\u00e1, the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 ruler of Ber\u00e1r, for assistance; he came with an army, killed Wal\u00ed Sh\u00e1h, released the boys, and put them both on the throne on their promising to pay him half the revenue of their kingdom. Raghoj\u00ed then retired to Ber\u00e1r, but received half the revenue of the Deogarh kingdom, according to agreement, until A.D. 1742.\n\nIn 1743 Burh\u00e1n Sh\u00e1h and Akbar Sh\u00e1h quarrelled, on which the Gonds rose in rebellion and plundered the country for a whole year, but were put down by Raghoj\u00ed, who being again called in, supported Burh\u00e1n Sh\u00e1h and expelled Akbar Sh\u00e1h. Soon after he (Raghoj\u00ed) removed Burh\u00e1n Sh\u00e1h to N\u00e1gp\u00far; and though the country above the gh\u00e1ts was for some time left under the nominal authority of the Gond r\u00e1j\u00e1, yet the eastern part at any rate was virtually annexed to the kingdom of the Bhonsl\u00e1.\n\nIn A.D. 1818, after the defeat and flight of A\u2019p\u00e1 S\u00e1hib, this district formed part of the territory ceded to the British for payment of the contingent, and by the treaty of 1826 it was formally incorporated with the British possessions. Detachments of British troops were stationed at Mult\u00e1i, Bet\u00fal, and Sh\u00e1hp\u00far in 1818, in order to cut off A\u2019p\u00e1 S\u00e1hib\u2019s escape westward from Pachmar\u00ed, but he passed the line and got off. A military force was quartered at Bet\u00fal until June 1862.\n\nThe entire population amounted at the census of 1866 to 258,335 souls, and as the area of the district is about 4,118 square miles, this gives an average rate of about 62\u00b77 to the\n\n---\n\n* Brigg\u2019s Farishta, Ed. 1829, vol. ii. pp. 371 ff., 407 ff., 415, 479; vol. iv. pp. 178, 180, 183, 228 ff.\nsquare mile. In Mult\u00e1\u00ed, however, the population rate is as high as 119 to the square mile, while in the forest reserves and other waste tracts there are often not more than four or five human beings in a similar area.\n\nOf the agricultural community the prevalent caste are the Mar\u00e9th\u00e1 Kunb\u00eds. They occupy the southern parts of the district, and originally emigrated from N\u00e1gpur and Ber\u00e1r. Distinct from them are the Pardesi, or foreign Kurmis, a race from Upper India speaking the Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed language; these are confined to the immediate neighbourhood of Bet\u00fal, whither they immigrated under the grandfather of the present proprietor of Bet\u00fal, Tez\u00ed Singh.\n\nBesides the Pardesi Kurmis above noticed, there are the Des\u00ed or Dholwar Kunb\u00eds, who also speak the Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed language. These are chiefly confined to a few villages of the small t\u00e1luka of R\u00e1mpt\u00far. Next to the Kunb\u00eds in point of numbers come the Bhoyars, a race said to have come originally from Upper India; they are hard-working and industrious cultivators, thoroughly alive to the advantages of irrigation, and generally expending much labour and capital in the sinking of wells. They are unfortunately addicted to drink, which is said to have led many of them into debt and difficulties. They are settled chiefly in the Mult\u00e1\u00ed pargana. R\u00e9jputs are found in the Mult\u00e1\u00ed pargana, in the villages adjoining the Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 district, and also in some few of the villages of the A'tner pargana in the south. Their numbers are very inconsiderable. The most skilful cultivators are the M\u00e1l\u00eds; a sprinkling of these is to be found throughout the whole of the open parts of the district. Kir\u00e1rs are the next in importance of the agricultural community, and are about equal in numbers to the M\u00e1l\u00eds, and are also distributed more or less all over the district. As regards social status they are inferior to the abovementioned castes, who maintain a general feeling of social equality, though, of course, keeping completely apart in all ceremonial observances. They are hard-working and industrious; but the majority of them are poor, and not very good cultivators.\n\nThe other numerous classes, besides the agriculturists proper, are Tel\u00eds (oil-pressers), Kal\u00e1l\u00eds (distillers), Musalm\u00e1ns, and Br\u00e1hmans; these two last live chiefly in the larger villages; Gaul\u00ed\u00eds, pastoral inhabitants of these upland regions, who live by flocks and herds, and by occasional tillage; a low caste Hind\u00fa tribe called Ragars; G\u00e1rpag\u00e1r\u00eds, whose profession it is to avert hail; and the usual miscellaneous society of artisans, shopkeepers, and religious sectarians. The hill tribes of Gonds and Kurk\u00fas demand separate notice, though it must necessarily be short.\n\nThe Gonds are found in all the wild and jungle villages, and also in some of the more open ones, where they live chiefly by manual labour in the fields, following the plough or tending cattle.\n\nThe Kurk\u00fas are almost entirely confined to a few t\u00e1lukas of the S\u00e1ul\u00edgarh pargana, which belong to a Kurk\u00fa proprietor, Gend\u00e1 Patel. Some of them are very industrious in the cultivation of rice, but the majority of them are very similar to the Gonds in character and disposition. Neither class has any idea or wish beyond living from hand to mouth; and thus taking no thought for the morrow, they are often obliged to put up with little food and scanty clothing. Their favourite mode of livelihood is by cutting grass and firewood, which they sell in the nearest market; but they also carry on a little\nagriculture, chiefly in the method termed d\u0101hya. The two tribes are clearly distinct one from the other. The Gonds have a religion and language of their own. They are subdivided into about twenty tribes; and they count twelve and a half religious sects, the separating characteristic being the number of gods worshipped by each. Seven is the number most usually adored. The lowest caste of all worships any number of gods, and indeed anything having been left out (according to popular tradition) when the formal distribution of deities to each sect originally took place.\n\nBirths and marriages are celebrated by certain curious and peculiar customs, and a suitor will serve for his wife during a stated number of years after the manner of Jacob. As a rule they bury their dead, and sometimes kill a cow over the grave; but the more prosperous families now occasionally burn their dead according to the custom of the Hind\u00fas, whose ancient and exclusive rites are invariably imitated by the outcast tribes as they rise in the scale of civilisation. There is some tendency to suppose for the Gonds a Scythian origin,\u2014to view them as the stranded waif of some of the Scythian immigrations, which undoubtedly penetrated very far into India at a period antecedent to the Christian era. The language has certainly some intermixture with T\u0101mil; but this may have been subsequently acquired. The religion of the Kurk\u016bs, or Muw\u0101s\u012bs, is essentially different from that of the Gonds, being imitative of Hind\u016bism. They worship the Hind\u016b Mah\u0101deva, the Sun, and D\u016bl\u0101 Deo. They do not touch cow's flesh, and will neither eat nor drink with the Gonds. They worship their ancestors, as do also the Gonds. They have no priesthood, by class or profession, and their ceremonies are performed by the elders of the family. The rites at births and marriages differ from those of the Gonds, except in the matter of drinking-bouts, which are religiously held on such occasions in either tribe. The Irish practice of waking the dead, or something like it, is also common to the funeral rites both of Gonds and Kurk\u016bs. The latter sometimes bury, and sometimes burn, burial being probably the more ancient custom, as in every nation. The Kurk\u016b language is said to have some affinity with the Santh\u0101l\u012b and Uriya; it has no connection whatever with the Gond, although the habits of life of the two tribes are much the same, and in personal appearance they are not unlike each other.\n\nUnder the old Mar\u0101th\u0101 government each village had its patel, or headman, who collected the rents from the tenants, and paid them into the government treasuries, subtracting his authorised percentage. He had also certain powers to decide criminal charges, and was the general arbiter of village disputes. As long as these duties were satisfactorily performed the office remained in the family, and thus became very frequently hereditary. But the exactions of the Mar\u0101th\u0101 government in its wars at the beginning of this century drove out the race of Watan-d\u0101rs, or hereditary patels, and brought in a swarm of speculating farmers, who took the villages at rack-rents, and who never lasted long. The farms were continually changing hands; one man got hold of several villages, and the old Patel merged into the modern M\u0101lguz\u0101r. This state of affairs seems to have lasted up to 1837, when a light settlement for the long period of twenty years enabled those who then possessed the estates to hold on and prosper; and it is on these men or their descendants that the settlement just completed has finally conferred proprietary right. The present proprietors have full liberty to dispose as they will of their land, subject only to the payment, by the possessor, of the government revenue, and to the recognition of such tenant-right as has been recorded. Many of the cultivators have certain rights\nof occupancy, and of holding at fixed rents under certain conditions. All such claims have been inquired into and determined according to law and custom.\n\nThe principal agricultural products of the district are wheat and pulses, more than three-fourths of the open lands being devoted to these crops. The seed is sown in October, no manure is used, and the fields are very rarely irrigated; the grain ripens early in the spring. The autumn harvest is important only in the hill villages. Cotton is raised, but its cultivation is not well understood; also jaw\u00e1ri (millet), a little rice, kutk\u00ed (an inferior rice), kodo (a kind of rye), and other poor grains. The d\u00e1lh\u00e1 system of cultivation is widely practised by the hill tribes. A new piece of ground, generally on a hill slope or edge of a stream, is selected and cleared of all jungle. The surface is then covered over with logs of wood of varying size, and these again with smaller brushwood. This work goes on during the hot weather to let the new-cut wood get properly dry; just before the rains the wood is set fire to and thoroughly burned to ground, and after the first fall of rain the seed is scattered among the ashes; when the ground is steep it is generally thrown in a lump along the top of the plot, and is left to be washed to its place by the rains. Sugarcane does very well in Bet\u00fal. The Otaheite cane was introduced many years ago by Colonel Sleeman; but the common plant of the country is more extensively grown. It is planted in January and ripens in December.* Opium cultivation is carried on chiefly in the Mult\u00e1i pargana. The sowing usually begins in November; in February the plant flowers, and the pods are ripe about March. The juice extracted is exported in its raw state by the merchants, who buy it up and send it to Indore or elsewhere for manufacture. The area under cultivation is reckoned at 2,400 acres, which are said to give an outturn of 180 maunds of 80 lbs. weight.\n\nThe district is divided for revenue purposes into two tahsils\u2014Mult\u00e1i and Bet\u00fal; and for police purposes into the six station circles of Mult\u00e1i, Bet\u00fal, \u00c1\u2019tner, Sh\u00e1hpur, S\u00e1ul\u00edgarh or Chichol\u00ed, and Bordih\u00ed, and twenty-two outposts. Mult\u00e1i and Bordih\u00ed are within the Mult\u00e1i tahsil, and the other four in the Bet\u00fal tahsil. The revenues for 1868-69 are as follows:\u2014land revenue, Rs. 1,91,592; excise, Rs. 72,188; assessed taxes, Rs. 11,367; forests, Rs. 12,183; stamps, Rs. 27,436.\n\nAmong the objects of interest may be mentioned the fort of Kherl\u00e1, situated on a small isolated hill about four miles east of the civil station. This was the seat of government under the Gonds and preceding rulers, and hence the district was, until the time of its annexation to the British dominions, known as the \u201cKherl\u00e1 Sark\u00e1r.\u201d The local legend is that the fort was built by a R\u00e9j\u00e1 Jayap\u00e1l; and it is more than probable that he and his family were Gonds by origin. The place afterwards fell into the hands of the Mohammadans, for many parts of the buildings now remaining are unmistakeably the offspring of Moslem art. The temple near Bhaisdah\u00ed is supposed to be of Buddhist origin, and was once of considerable extent, as is evidenced by the masses of stone lying about. The entrance, and a portion of the pillars of the fa\u00e7ade in front of it, are still standing, and the carving in many parts is still wonderfully clear, though probably not much under three hundred years old. Additions have been made to the original structure, as is shown by the introduction of palpable obscenities into some of the carvings, the majority of which are quite free\n\n* The total area under cultivation is (1867) about 8,000 acres, and the yield of gur (molasses) is estimated at 80,000 maunds of 80 lbs.\nfrom any such objectionable subjects. A large pipal tree has grown out of the rear of the building and displaced large portions of the masonry, and has also destroyed the dome. As in all similar buildings in this part of India of alike age, no cement of any kind was used in uniting the several layers of stone. The temple near S\u00e1lbaldi is also said to be of Buddhist origin, and is of equal antiquity with that of Bhaisdah\u00ed, but is in an even more advanced state of dilapidation. A number of temples of various ages and descriptions of architecture, but none of any remarkable beauty as regards ornamentation, are found at Mult\u00e1i, surrounding the artificial tank at that place, from the centre of which the river Tapt\u00ed is said to take its rise: hence the reputed sanctity of the locality, and the consequent accumulation of temples in its honour. Another collection of temples, but of more modern construction, is to be found at Muktagiri on the confines of Ber\u00e1r and within ten miles of Ellichp\u00far. They are clustered together on the side of a hill in the immediate neighbourhood of a considerable fall of water; the site is extremely picturesque, and the place one of considerable resort for the residents of Ellichp\u00far. These temples are all in good order. There are also ruins of old forts at Baurgarh and J\u00e1mgarh in the north, S\u00e1ul\u00edgarh in the west, and Jetp\u00far, where was once the seat of a minor Gond dynasty, in the east.\n\nAPPENDIX A.\n\n(BETU'L.)\n\nI.\n\nThe Main Road from Badn\u00far (Bet\u00fal) towards N\u00f3gp\u00far, and information regarding it.\n\n| Miles. | Description |\n|--------|-------------|\n| Badn\u00far | Civil station\u2014sar\u00e1\u00eds in sadar and koth\u00ed b\u00e1z\u00e1r\u2014charitable dispensary\u2014church\u2014d\u00e1k bungalow\u2014town and female school-houses\u2014sad\u00e1r distillery\u2014water from river\u2014three tanks and numerous wells\u2014police head-quarters, and imperial post-office. |\n| Bet\u00fal  | No sar\u00e1\u00ed or covered accommodation for travellers\u2014water from river and wells\u2014several large topes of mango trees for shelter during dry weather\u2014town police post\u2014charitable dispensary\u2014imperial post-office\u2014Bani\u00e1s put travellers up\u2014a patel has a good garden on the English system\u2014vegetables procurable in season\u2014about 5,000 inhabitants. |\n| S\u00e1sundr\u00e1 | Sar\u00e1\u00ed\u2014water from wells\u2014large village\u2014resthouse for Europeans. |\n| Mult\u00e1i | Sar\u00e1\u00ed\u2014water from tank and wells\u2014town\u20145,000 inhabitants\u2014police station-house\u2014district post-office\u2014charitable dispensary\u2014town school\u2014d\u00e1k bungalow\u2014tah\u00e1f\u2014imperial post-office. |\n| Chichend\u00e1 | Sar\u00e1\u00ed\u2014water from river Wardh\u00e1\u2014supplies cannot be obtained here for more than two or three people at a time. |\n### II.\n\n*The main Route from Badn\u00far (Bet\u00fal) towards Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d, and information regarding it.*\n\n| Miles | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| Badn\u00far | Same as route No. I. |\n| N\u00edmp\u00e1n\u00ed | 13-5 Sar\u00e1f\u2014room for Europeans, with khidmatg\u00e1r\u2014water from wells and river\u2014police outpost\u2014supplies plentiful. |\n| Sh\u00e1hp\u00far | 26-6 Water from river Machn\u00e1\u2014shopkeepers give travellers and traders accommodation in their shops\u2014supplies plentiful\u2014police station-house and district post-office\u2014resthause for Europeans unfurnished\u2014charitable dispensary\u2014village school-house\u2014large bridge over Machn\u00e1. |\n| Dh\u00e1r | 35-1 Sar\u00e1f\u2014room for Europeans, with khidmatg\u00e1r\u2014water from a well\u2014supplies very scanty\u2014police outpost\u2014supplies have to come from \u00cdordh\u00e1, eight miles off. |\n| Kesl\u00e1 | 43 Water from wells and river\u2014shed for travellers\u2014supplies plentiful\u2014police outpost\u2014good encampment under trees in fine weather. |\n\n### III.\n\n*The main Route from Badn\u00far (Bet\u00fal) towards Mhow, vi\u00e1 Hard\u00e1, and information regarding it.*\n\n| Miles | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| Badn\u00far | Same as route No. I. |\n| Ch\u00edcholf | 16-6 Police station-house and district post-office\u2014water from well and tank\u2014sar\u00e1f\u2014a good large village\u2014supplies plentiful\u2014a village school-house just built. |\n| Chir\u00e9p\u00e1t\u00edl\u00e9 | 29 Police outpost\u2014water from river and well\u2014sar\u00e1f\u2014a few huts\u2014m\u00e1lguz\u00e1r\u00e1 has just built a substantial house\u2014plenty of Gonds\u2014villages within two miles. |\n| Gaw\u00e1sen | 40 Police outpost\u2014water from well and river\u2014sar\u00e1f\u2014no village at all\u2014a Ban\u00eda's shop established by local fund committee. |\n| Lokhartal\u00e1i | 8 Police outpost\u2014water from river\u2014a large village\u2014supplies plentiful\u2014five miles from Seon\u00e1.

The land revenue for the year 1869-70 is Rs. 1,21,807.\n\n**BETUL (BAITOOL)\u2014** A town in the district of the same name, situated on the S\u00e1mpn\u00e1 nad\u00ed, and four miles distant from Badn\u00far, the district head-quarters. It contains 1,212 houses, with a population of 4,466 souls. The inhabitants mostly belong to the Kurm\u00ed and Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 Br\u00e1hman castes, and live by agriculture; but there is also a brisk trade in pottery. There are here two schools, a police outpost, an old fort, and an English cemetery. The district head-quarters were here before their removal to Badn\u00far.\n\n**BHADRA\u2019\u2014** A chiefship in the B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t district, comprising seventy-eight villages. The area is 128 square miles, and the population 16,293 souls. Thirty-six square miles are under tillage. The estate was given by the Subad\u00e1r of L\u00e1nj\u00ed at the end of the last century in zam\u00edn-d\u00e1r\u00ed tenure to Zainudd\u00edn Kh\u00e1n Path\u00e1n, whose family still retains possession of it. The chief resides in Bel\u00e1, one of the villages of the taluka, which is situated about thirty-eight miles south-east of B\u00farh\u00e1.\n\n**BHADRA\u2019CHALLAM\u2014** The chief town of the estate of the same name in the Upper God\u00e1v\u00e1ri district. It is situated on the banks of the God\u00e1v\u00e1ri, forty miles from Sironch\u00e1 and about fifteen from Dumagudem. This place owes its importance to an old and well-known temple of R\u00e1mchandra, which is situated on an eminence in the village, and is supposed to have been built about\nfour hundred years ago by one Rishi Pratishtha, but has been added to at subsequent periods by various rajas. It consists of one main building covered by a fine dome, and flanked by smaller temples on both sides. The space in the centre is paved, and there is a stone mandap, or open flat-roofed building, in front of the chief shrine. The temples are surrounded by a high wall, and from the river-side are entered by a flight of steps. A good coup-d\u2019\u0153il of the whole group may be obtained by ascending the hill close by, from whence also there is a fine view of the village and surrounding country. Religious observances are supported by a money grant of Rs. 13,000 (Haidarabad currency) per annum. The jewels belonging to the temple are said to be very valuable. There are no manufactures in Bhadrachallam. The trade consists chiefly of imports for the population of the town and surrounding villages. Small country boats come up the river as far as this point from Rajmandri and the coast, but are precluded from proceeding further by the rocks and rapids which form the first barrier of the Godavari.* There is a town school and a police outpost here, and the district post from Dumagudem to Ellor passes through the town and crosses into the Nizam\u2019s territories. A large fair is held here in April each year, at which about 10,000 people assemble from all parts of the country, chiefly from the coast districts. Business to the amount of about Rs. 50,000 is done on these occasions in English and country cloth, sugar, opium, spices, hardware, &c. The population is about 2,000, chiefly Brahmans and Telengas. The estate consists of 137 villages; and the zamindar traces her ancestry to Anap\u00f3 Aswa Rao, who is said to have obtained the grant from the Emperor of Delhi in A.D. 1324.\n\nBHAGWA\u2019NPU\u2019R\u2014A village in the Chanda district, seven miles southwest of Brahmapur, possessing a fine irrigation-reservoir.\n\nBHA\u2019NSA\u2019KHAND\u2014A part of the Kaimur range of hills, situated in latitude 23\u00b0 45\u2032 55\u2033 and longitude 80\u00b0 15\u2032 28\u2033, in the Sleemanabad tahsil of the Jabalpur district.\n\nBHA\u2019ISDAHI\u2014A town in the Betul district, situated on the Purna, thirty-two miles south-west of Badnur. It is said to have been founded by Piraji Haibat Rao Desmukh, whose family was once very powerful; the remnants of a fort erected by them still exist, and the town is now owned by them. There are here a police outpost and a government school. The population amounts to 2,343 souls.\n\nBHA\u2019MGARH\u2014A town in the Nimar district, eight miles east of Khandwa, containing 2,240 inhabitants, chiefly cultivators. Rao Daulat Singh, zamindar of the Bhagramarh pargana, has a fort here, which was captured and burnt by Yaswant Rao Sahi in A.D. 1806. There is also a Hindi school. From the river Bhagram close by are taken excellent fish. A weekly market is held here on Sunday.\n\nBHA\u2019NDAK\u2014Is the eastern pargana of the Warora tahsil of the Chanda district, containing an area of about 384 square miles, with 76 villages. It is bounded on the north by the Chimur and Garhbori parganas, on the east by the Haweli pargana, on the south by the Wardha, and on the west by the Warora pargana. By far the larger portion is hill and forest, and it is intersected from north to south by the Virai and Andhara rivers. In the vicinity of the Wardha\n\n* This has since been partially opened.\nblack loam prevails, on which cotton and dry crops are grown; and beyond this belt the soil is sandy or yellow, chiefly producing rice. Bh\u00e1ndak and Chandan-kher\u00e1 are the two largest towns. The population is Mar\u00e1th\u00e1, with a mixture of Telingas.\n\n**BHA'NDAK**\u2014A town 18 miles north-west of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 and about a mile west of the Southern Road. It contains 470 houses, and is a long straggling place, spread over a large extent of ground, and surrounded, except on the west, by old groves and jungle. Local tradition identifies it with the great city of Bhadr\u00e1v\u00e1t\u00ed, mentioned in the Mah\u00e1 Bh\u00e1r\u00e1t, extending from Bhat\u00e1l\u00e1 on the west to the Jharpat on the east; and the scene of the battle for the S\u00e1mkarna horse, which eventually was borne away by the demi-god Bh\u00edma, for sacrifice by Dharma, the king. The architectural remains in and around Bh\u00e1ndak are of remote antiquity and great interest, among them being the temple-caves at Bh\u00e1ndak and in the Winjh\u00e1sani and Dew\u00e1l\u00e1 hills, the footprint of Bh\u00edma on the latter hill, the temple of Bhadr\u00e1v\u00e1t\u00ed, the site of the king's palace, the bridge over a now dried-up lake, the outlines of forts on the Winjh\u00e1sani and Dew\u00e1l\u00e1 hills, and numerous ruined temples and tanks\u2014proving the existence of a great city in the far distant past. Bh\u00e1ndak now has little trade in itself, but an extensive fair assembles here yearly in February, the transactions at which are very large. The products of the town-lands are chiefly p\u00e9n leaves, turmeric, and rice; and the residents are mostly Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. Bh\u00e1ndak has government schools for boys and girls, a police station-house, a district post-office, and a sar\u00e1i.\n\n**BHAND\u00c1'R**\u2014A village in the R\u00e1jp\u00far district. It is the head-quarters or sanctuary of the Satn\u00e1m\u00ed Cham\u00e1rs of Chhatt\u00edsgarh, and came into importance about twenty-seven years ago, when Gh\u00e1si D\u00e1s, the founder of the new faith, became proprietor of the village. He built in the centre a large square temple-like house, and to this place his followers flock three times a year for confession and absolution.\n\n**BHAND\u00c1'RA**\n\n| CONTENTS. |\n| --- | --- |\n| General description | Page 60 |\n| Geology | 67 |\n| Rivers | 58 |\n| Forests | ib. |\n| Minerals | 69 |\n| Animals | ib. |\n| Tanks and lakes | 60 |\n| Road communications | 61 |\n| Population | ib. |\n| Manners and customs | 62 |\n| Languages | 63 |\n| Diseases | ib. |\n| Agriculture | 64 |\n| Manufactures | 66 |\n| Commerce | ib. |\n| School | 67 |\n| Chiefships | 68 |\n| Tradition and history | ib. |\n| Revenue administration | 69 |\n| Judicial and Police administration | 70 |\n\nOne of the five districts comprised in the N\u00e1gp\u00far commissionership, of which it occupies nearly the whole of the eastern portion. It has an area of about 3,922 square miles, and is bounded on the north by Seoni and B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t, on the south by Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1, on the east by R\u00e1jp\u00far, and on the west by N\u00e1gp\u00far. The station of Bhand\u00e1ra is about thirty-eight miles east of N\u00e1gp\u00far. The district stretches northwards for some miles beyond R\u00e1mp\u00e1il, and from that point to a village called Sower\u00e1 in the south the distance is about eighty miles as the crow flies, while if a line were drawn through the centre of the district it would measure about eighty miles direct from east to west. There are few mountains of any size within the district; but the north, north-east, and east are bounded by\nlofty hills, inhabited chiefly by Gonds and other wild tribes. The west and north-west are comparatively open. Several small ranges\u2014branches of the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1\u2014make their way into the interior of the district, generally taking a southerly direction. Different bluffs and marked elevations in these ranges bear the names of the villages near which they occur, but there is no general name for the whole. These hills are thickly covered with forest trees and bamboos, but they do not contain much valuable timber. Another range of hills, about sixty miles in length, skirts the south of the Ch\u00e1ndpur pargana. Their average height is between 300 and 400 feet above the level of the plain, and they are known by the name of the Amb\u00e1garh, or Sendurjhar\u00ed hills. This range is clothed with very little timber of any size, but it furnishes a fair amount of firewood. In addition to the above ranges there are a few detached hills worthy of mention, viz. the Bal\u00e1hi hills, the Kanher\u00ed hills, and the Naweg\u00e1on hills.\n\nThe formation of these hills is mostly granitic and schistose, with here and there a range of overlying sandstone. Among certain geological papers on Western India, published in 1857 by the Bombay Government, is an article by Messrs. Hislop and Hunter, in which is described the great granitic area within which the whole district lies, and which, beginning from N\u00e1gpur town on the west, is said to extend as far east as the Bay of Bengal. The following extracts make up a brief sketch of the geological structure of the country round the Waingang\u00e1:\n\n\"Granitic and Schistose Rocks.\u2014The plutonic and metamorphic formation, the extent of which I shall now briefly indicate, lies chiefly in the eastern portion of our area. It is intersected by the Waingang\u00e1 for the greater part of its course. The tract on the left bank of the river I have had little opportunity of exploring, but from the cursory examination I have given it, I have reason to believe that there is a large development of granite and its allied rocks, including an extensive outburst of porphyry, which coincides nearly with the upper portion of the course of the B\u00e1gh river. This eruption exhibits crystals of quartz and of white, occasionally red, felspar, imbedded in a dark paste of the same ingredients. On the right bank of the Waingang\u00e1, in the district near its junction with the Wardh\u00e1, the extent of the formation is not so great. It is observed principally in the channel of the Waingang\u00e1, though it may also be traced around the bases of the sandstone chains of hills, which it has been the means of upheaving. In both the districts under consideration the general strike of the strata is north and south, corresponding with the direction of the streams and mountain ranges, and in the last-mentioned the dip is for the most part to the west. But it is on the north that the greatest development of granite and crystalline schists occurs. There we may perceive these rocks rising to the surface (though it would be hazardous to conclude that there are not others of a different character in the hollows covered up by the deep soil) from N\u00e1gpur north-eastward to the L\u00e1nj\u00ed hills.\n\n\"On either side of the Waingang\u00e1 we meet with some isolated remnants of the sandstone formation. One of these, but very limited in its dimensions, lies on the banks of the Sel\u00e1ri, a small stream which joins the Waingang\u00e1 near the town of Pauni. Another, further down the river, extends for some distance, first on the right bank, and then on the left. In the district on the east of the Waingang\u00e1 a little sandstone proper is\nmet with in patches among the hills on the west bank of the G\u00e1rv\u00ed and B\u00e1gh rivers, reaching from Mah\u00e1g\u00e1on as far north as A'mg\u00e1on.\"\u2014Geological Papers of Western India, pp. 254\u2014256.\n\nExtensive beds of laterite, overlying the primary rocks, are found in the district about K\u00e1mth\u00e1, and are again seen near Pauni, whence they stretch southward in a broad belt far into the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district.\n\nThe chief river, and the only one that does not dry up in the hot weather, Rivers. is the Waingang\u00e1, which runs along the whole length of the western border of the district. Its most important affluents in this district are the B\u00e1wanthar\u00ed, the B\u00e1gh n\u00e1di, the Kanh\u00e1n, and the Chulban. There are several other small streams, which serve as affluents to those above mentioned, but they are very insignificant, viz. the P\u00e1ngol\u00ed n\u00e1di and the Katang\u00ed n\u00e1di, running into the B\u00e1gh n\u00e1di, and the S\u00e1t n\u00e1di into the Chulban. The Sur n\u00e1di waters a large tract of land immediately north of Bhand\u00e1ra, and empties itself into the Waingang\u00e1 only about a mile from the station. The Chan\u00ed n\u00e1di waters above a hundred miles of the district, and flowing past R\u00e1mp\u00e1ll\u00ed and Katangtot\u00e1, empties itself into the Waingang\u00e1 at a village called Mah\u00e1g\u00e1on, about ten miles south of R\u00e1mp\u00e1ll\u00ed. The B\u00e1wanthar\u00ed runs through the district for about thirty miles of its course, and waters all the country immediately north of Ch\u00e1ndp\u00far and Amb\u00e1g\u00e1rh, reaching the Waingang\u00e1 at a village called Buper\u00e1, eight miles east of Ch\u00e1ndp\u00far. All the above streams, with the exception of the Waingang\u00e1, dry up in the hot weather. There are no towns of importance on any of them.\n\nOf the entire area about 1,509 square miles, or more than one-third, are covered with jungle. The smaller jungles are in parts of the middle of the district and in the Ch\u00e1ndp\u00far pargana.\n\nNone of these forests contain many valuable timber trees of sufficient girth for large buildings, excepting the mhow\u00e1 (bassia latifolia) trees, which are preserved by the people for their blossoms, as they are eaten by the poorer class, and country liquor is distilled from them.\n\nThe valuable timber trees are\u2014\n\n1. *Tectona grandis* (teak) called S\u00e1y\u00e1 in this district, and S\u00e1j in other parts.\n2. *Pterocarpus marsupium*, called Biwl\u00e1 in this district, and in other parts Bijes\u00e1l.\n3. *Dalbergia latifolia*, called Siras in this district, and in other parts Sh\u00edsham.\n4. *Pentaptera glabra*, called A\u00edn in this district, and in other parts S\u00e1j.\n5. *Diospyros ebenum*, called Temr\u00e1n in this district, and in other parts Tend\u00e1.\n6. *Nauclea cordifolia*, called Hald\u00ed in this district, and in other parts Hardu\u00e1.\n7. *Conocurpus latifolia*, Dh\u00e1ur\u00e1.\n8. *Lagerstroemia parviflora*, Send\u00ed, called also Sehn\u00e1 in this district, and in other parts Kul\u00ed\u00e1 Sej\u00e1.\n9. *Bassia latifolia*, Mhow\u00e1.\nThe jungles also yield gum, medicinal fruits and nuts, edible fruits, lac and honey. The gums considered the best for their adhesive qualities and for edible purposes are those exuded by the \u00e1\u00edn or s\u00e9j, dh\u00e1ur\u00e1, and pal\u00e1s or chint\u00e1. The pal\u00e1s tree is also called dh\u00e1k in other parts. The medicinal fruits are the harr\u00e1 (terminalia chebula), bah\u00e9r\u00e1 (belleric myrobalan), baibrang (a medicinal seed, like a black pepper-corn), and bel (crat\u00e9va). The nuts are the kuchl\u00e1 (strychnos nux vomica), and bhil\u00e1w\u00e1 (semicarpus anacardium). The fruits which are sold in the markets from jungle trees, and which the poorer class of natives eat, are those of the tend\u00fa, ach\u00e1r or chironji (chironia sapida), \u00e1unl\u00e1 (phyllanthus emblica), bhil\u00e1w\u00e1 (semicarpus anacardium), mhow\u00e1 (basia latifolia), plum, k\u00e1rind\u00e1 kawat or kaith\u00e1 (feronia elephantum), bel (crat\u00e9va), custard-apple, umbar (ficus glomerata), and j\u00e1mun (syzygium jambolanum). Lac is produced on the plum, pal\u00e1s (batea frondosa), p\u00edp\u00e1l (ficus religiosa), and the p\u00edpr\u00ed (the small-leafed p\u00edp\u00e1l) trees.\n\nBees settle on all descriptions of trees, and on rocks, where they form their hives and gather honey. The men who generally take down honeycombs and gather other jungle-produce are Gonds.\n\nA little gold is found in the bed of the Son n\u00e1di, but hardly repays the trouble of searching for it, as even after cleaning it is somewhat impure, and only fetches from ten to twelve rupees a tol\u00e1. The separation of the particles of gold from the sand and dirt is effected by washing, and subsequent application of quicksilver. Iron is found to some extent, and the supply is not only sufficient for the local demand, but also constitutes an article of export. The chief mines are situated in the parganas of Ch\u00e1ndpur, Tiror\u00e1, and Pr\u00e1t\u00e1garh, the best being that obtained from Ch\u00e1ndpur. The mines are mere pits, being generally only ten or twelve feet in depth; and the vertical clay-furnaces for smelting the ore are very primitive and inefficient, requiring a great deal of time and trouble to produce a very small result. The people usually engaged in this laborious work are Gonds, Go\u00e1r\u00e1s, Pardh\u00e1ns, and Dh\u00edmars, from whom the middle-men purchase the rough iron slabs. The iron obtained from the mines at \u00c1\u2019gr\u00ed and Amb\u00e1jhari in the Ch\u00e1ndpur pargana is reported to be very tough and malleable. Ger\u00fa, a kind of red ochre, is found in the S\u00e1letekr\u00ed tract of the B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t district, and is used to some extent in this district for staining wood and dyeing cloth. Of stone for masonry, the laterite, shale, and sandstone are found all over the district, though the largest quarries exist near Bhand\u00e1ra, at Koramb\u00ed, and in the B\u00e1l\u00e1h\u00ed hills. Hone-stones and white soft stone for pottery are also found in some quantity in the Kanher\u00ed hill, near Pohor\u00e1.\n\nOwing to the large extent of forest, wild animals abound. The tiger and the panther are the most dangerous and destructive to human life; and during the rainy season many people die from the bites of venomous snakes. Deer of all kinds and wild pigs frequently cause great injury to the crops. Of farm cattle, the bullock of this district is noted for its staunchness and endurance, though rather small in build. The cows generally are excellent, and in some parts of the district are of good size. Bulls are usually imported from Ber\u00e1r, but the government has lately brought in some stock from Nellor in Madras for the improvement of the breed. Sheep-breeding, for the sake of the wool, is carried on to some extent, though suitable pasturage is somewhat limited. The silkworm is also bred in some\nparts of the district with success, producing a coarse kind of silk; but there are very few persons engaged in this culture. The soil and climate generally throughout the district are favourable to the successful cultivation of all grains, as the seasons are mild and the rainfall abundant, though, from sparseness of population and absence of enterprise, nearly half the area of the district is still (1869) waste land.\n\nThis part of the country is chiefly cultivated by means of irrigation from tanks, for which the Bhand\u00e1ra district is famous.\n\nTanks and Lakes.\n\n\"These tanks,\" writes a former chief commissioner,* Sir Richard Temple, \"are so numerous, and some of them so large, being many miles in circumference, that this tract might almost be called the Lake Region of N\u00e1gpur. Here a tank is not a piece of water, with regular banks, crowned with rows or avenues of trees, with an artificial dyke and sluices, and with fields around it, but it is an irregular expanse of water; its banks are formed by rugged hills covered with low forests that fringe the water, where the wild beasts repair to drink; its dykes, mainly shaped out of spurs from the hills, are thrown athwart the hollows, a part only being formed by masonry; its sluices often consist of chasms or fissures in the rock; its broad surface is often, as the monsoon approaches, lashed into surging and crested waves.\" The principal lakes are known by the names of Naweg\u00e1on, Seoni, and Sireg\u00e1on. Besides these are thousands of minor tanks, used for irrigation, many of which retain an ample supply of water throughout the hot season. There are also numerous sites for new tanks of large size, now ruined and requiring repair, though at such an outlay as to render the undertaking one of doubtful advantage.\n\nMajor Pearson, late conservator of forests, Central Provinces, in a report upon the irrigation of the valley of the Waingang\u00e1 submitted to the chief commissioner in March 1863, points out that there are two distinct kinds of tanks in this region. He describes them in the following passage:\n\n\"The first and by far the largest are formed in the undulating country of the lower districts in the valley, by taking advantage of the contour of the ground, and constructing a short dam so as to form a lake or basin from the drainage of the surrounding hills. The second class is that commonly found in the flatter country, and away from the hills, where a long low dam is raised across the upper portion of a gently-sloping plain. These are more or less excavated near the centre, where some n\u00e1la or depression of the ground is taken advantage of to create a reservoir more or less deep. The long arms of the dam collect the drainage, which fills into the centre reservoir, and, when this is full, spreads itself out into a large shallow tank; the water is thence distributed to the rice fields below; and although there is an enormous loss from evaporation, yet, as the rice does not require water for above two months, or at most seventy-five days, the tanks generally suffice for the purpose required. Tanks of the last description are sometimes of very large size, but commonly they are what are called \"bor\u00eds,\" having embankments not more than ten or twelve feet high, and as soon as the rice-crop is gathered the dam is cut, any remaining water let out, and a crop of wheat or linseed sown in the bed. This is almost a universal practice in the northern parganas of Bhand\u00e1ra. Indeed it seems the only means of raising a dry crop which the people possess in those districts. I have seen several very large tanks so drained and cultivated.\"\n\n* Administration Report, Central Provinces, 1862, p. 6, para. 12.\nThere are altogether 3,648 lakes and tanks; some of the rivers also afford facilities for irrigation. The B\u00e1wanthari, for instance, which runs from east to west of the pargana of Ch\u00e1ndpur, supplies water for the cultivation of sugar-cane, which is grown in large quantities on both banks.\n\nThe only road which is raised, bridged, and metalled for any distance is the Great Eastern Road, which enters the district on the west, near the village of Sh\u00e1hp\u00far, and passing through Bhand\u00e1ra, S\u00e1k\u00f3li, Arjun\u00ed, and Deor\u00ed Kishori, crosses the B\u00e1gh n\u00e1di by a substantial bridge into the R\u00e1ip\u00far district, at a point about sixty-five miles due east of Bhand\u00e1ra. This road is nearly completed to a point beyond S\u00e1k\u00f3li, or upwards of twenty-four miles from Bhand\u00e1ra towards R\u00e1ip\u00far, and, with the exception of the Waingang\u00e1, all the important streams and n\u00e1dis are bridged. At the crossing of the Waingang\u00e1 during the dry season there is a raised fascine roadway for the convenience of the traffic across the sandy bed, and a couple of platform-boats during the rains. There is a second class of roads, unmetalled and unbridged (except by temporary contrivances), but smoothed, levelled, and sloped at the crossings of watercourses. Of these the following are the most important, viz. the district road from R\u00e1ip\u00far to Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1, which enters this district on the south-east, and passing through Chichgarh, Pal\u00e1ndur, Naw\u00e9-g\u00e1n, Digor\u00ed, and Paun\u00ed, proceeds to Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 via Brahmapuri; and the district road from R\u00e1ip\u00far to K\u00e1mth\u00e1 via Darekas\u00e9, A mg\u00e1on, B\u00e1g\u00e1rband, and Tumsar. The second route has the heaviest traffic, and where it crosses the Waingang\u00e1 at Umarw\u00e1r\u00e1, there is a raised fascine roadway across the sandy bed of the river during the dry season. The minor communications of the second kind are as follows, viz. to and from R\u00e1mp\u00e1il\u00ed and Katang\u00ed in the Seoni district via Arjun\u00ed; and from R\u00e1mp\u00e1il\u00ed and W\u00e1r\u00e1-Seoni in the Seoni district via Mend\u00edw\u00e1r\u00e1; to and from K\u00e1mth\u00e1 and Mandla via the Samn\u00e1p\u00far gh\u00e1t, which has been cleared and levelled; and to and from the N\u00e1ndg\u00e1on zamind\u00e1ri in the R\u00e1ip\u00far district, and K\u00e1mth\u00e1 via Dh\u00edr\u00ed, Mangl\u00ed, and Nandor\u00e1, by which route most of the traffic is carried on men's heads, owing to the difficult mountain-passes which separate this district from R\u00e1ip\u00far at that point. The whole of the roads belonging to the second class are excellent fair-weather roads, but are almost impassable for wheeled traffic during the rains. When all other routes are closed during the monsoon the water communication on the B\u00e1gh n\u00e1di and Waingang\u00e1 is of great use, and would probably rise to some importance if the dangerous barriers of rocks in the bed of the B\u00e1gh n\u00e1di at Saton\u00e1, and in the bed of the Waingang\u00e1 at Chichg\u00e1on, could be removed. At present, owing to these barriers, the communication by river during the rains is limited to the interior of the district; whereas if they were removed the communication might be extended to the heart of Mandla and into the richest parganas of the R\u00e1ip\u00far district. The carriage used on all these roads is chiefly the common country cart and the pack-bullock; while on the river the boats employed are dong\u00e1s, which are usually large logs of teak scooped out and lashed together.\n\nAccording to the census of November 1866 the population amounts to 608,480 souls. Setting aside the primitive, and (so called) aboriginal tribes of Gonds, Baig\u00e1s, and the like, this population may be generally classed under the two great divisions of Hind\u00fas and Mohammadans, though the latter do not equal five per cent of the former. Of the Hind\u00fas the caste divisions are chiefly as follows, viz. Br\u00e1hmans, \"Pardesis\" or foreigners (generally R\u00e1jputs), Ponw\u00e1rs, Lodhis, Kunb\u00eds, Kor\u00eds, Kal\u00e1l\u00eds, Tel\u00eds, Dh\u00edmars, Kosht\u00eds, Go\u00e1r\u00e1s, and Dhers.\nThe two first-mentioned castes are the most educated and intelligent; the four next are the most industrious and skilful agriculturists, and the last two are the most numerous. The higher castes\u2014such as Br\u00e1hmans and Pard\u00e9sis\u2014are usually landholders and land agents, or are found in government employ; the middle castes\u2014such as Ponw\u00e1rs, Kor\u00eds, Kal\u00e1ls, Lodh\u00eds, Kunb\u00eds, and T\u00e9l\u00eds\u2014are mostly engaged in agriculture, either as farmers or tenants of land; and the lower classes\u2014such as Go\u00e1r\u00e1s and Dhers\u2014furnish the labour for all public or private works, farm service, &c. Besides the above there are a few intermediate classes, which are occupied in commerce\u2014such as the M\u00e1rw\u00e1ris, Bani\u00e1s, and Parw\u00e1rs; and in trades and manufactures\u2014such as Kosht\u00eds, K\u00e1s\u00e1rs, Panch\u00e1ls, Loh\u00e1rs, Barha\u00eds, Beld\u00e1rs, and Kumbh\u00e1rs. Of these the Kosht\u00eds, or weavers, are the most numerous, while the other intermediate castes are comparatively ill-represented, and confined to certain localities, generally large towns and villages. The Dh\u00edmars also are a numerous class, and live chiefly by fishing, and the hire of their boats for carriage. Of the Mohammadan portion the greater part are employed as Pinj\u00e1r\u00e1s, or cleaners and dealers in cotton, and K\u00e1nch\u00e1rs, or makers of glass ornaments; and a few are landholders and cultivators. The lowest section of the people of this district includes the Kaik\u00e1r\u00eds, Holi\u00e1s, Halb\u00e1s, and Pardh\u00e1ns. Among these the Kaik\u00e1r\u00eds are notorious as skilful and determined thieves.\n\nThe inhabitants of Bhand\u00e1ra are rude and unpolished in their manners, and sometimes say and do things in company with each other that would shock the ideas of propriety entertained by any civilised Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed. The higher classes are no exception to this rule, though, from their superior education and intelligence, they might be supposed to be more capable of appreciating the advantages of courtesy. Nor can it be said that these defects are compensated for by a very high standard of truth or manliness, for it must be confessed that the people have no larger share of these virtues than more civilised orientals. However, the Gonds and Baig\u00e1s are generally honest and hard-working when well treated. The Ponw\u00e1rs and Kor\u00eds, too, among agriculturists, are industrious. The two proverbs most current in this district sufficiently indicate the general tone of morals. They are as follows:\u2014\"Charity remains at home,\" and \"Deceit is the perfection of wisdom.\" The higher classes have none of the hardy, active habits of life which are still maintained in Northern India by many persons in good position. They have an indolent dislike of standing if they can possibly sit; and they very seldom mount a horse, using small two-wheeled ox-carts for all journeys, long or short. And it is not easy to get a fair day's work out of the labourer. Cheap food and a stationary population, a mild equable climate, and a land-locked district without roads, are among the causes to which these characteristics may be traced; but with the cessation of the last of these causes some change is already appearing. There are few social customs or religious ceremonies, current in this district, which are not common to all classes of Hind\u00fas in other parts of India; but perhaps nowhere is the marriage-tie less considered than among the lower castes here, more especially among the women, who often divorce themselves from their husbands, and select, of their own will, several mates in succession, without any opposition from their lawful lords. All, except the higher classes of Hind\u00fas\u2014such as Br\u00e1hmans and Pard\u00e9sis\u2014also adopt a ceremony called P\u00e1t, in lieu of a formal marriage, for joining a man and woman who agree to live together. This, however, can only take place after the death of the first husband or wife, and is considered a kind of lawful concubinage. The\nceremony much resembles the \"Nik\u00e1h\" marriage common among Mohammadans. The Ponw\u00e1rs, Lodh\u00eds, and Kunbis are most notorious for these peculiar notions regarding the obligations of marriage. Again, contrary to the custom prevalent in other parts of the country, in this district girls are more honoured than boys, and the ordinary mode of proceeding in betrothal-engagements is reversed, as the father or relatives of a boy are obliged to seek out and humbly supplicate the parents of the girl with whom they wish to marry their son, instead of being sought after themselves. The proportion of educated and influential men of the higher classes among the Hind\u00fas is so small, that in few districts are the mass of the people more ignorant of even the forms and ceremonies attached to their own religion. This leads to a great diversity of ideas on the subject, and very loose notions regarding the worship of the various Hind\u00fa deities. The most common object of worship, however, throughout the district is the lingam, or conventional representation of generative power, symbolising the creative attributes of Mah\u00e1deva. But in addition to this common object of worship, all kinds of quadrupeds, different kinds of reptiles, and even remarkable tombs, are all worshipped by their individual votaries; and a large tomb near the village of Murm\u00e1ri, about ten miles from Bhand\u00e1ra, where rest the remains of an English lady, is held in great veneration by the surrounding villages. The Mohammadans in this district form only a small fraction of the population, and are rather notorious for the neglect of their religious duties and their disorderly dissipated life.\n\nThe language in common use is Mar\u00e1th\u00ed, though, from the neighbourhood of Urd\u00fa-speaking districts, Urd\u00fa is understood generally throughout the district, with the exception of a portion of the villages in the southern parts of the S\u00e1ngarh\u00ed tahs\u00edl. The Mar\u00e1th\u00ed, however, as spoken and written commonly in this district is by no means pure, and is largely mixed with Urd\u00fa. There are also several dialects peculiar to different classes of the people, which are only understood by them; they are used by the Gonds, Baig\u00e1s, Gol\u00e1rs, and Kaik\u00e1r\u00eds.\n\nThe diseases most prevalent are fever, small-pox, and cholera. Under this last title the natives also include without distinction all diseases of the stomach and bowels. Fever prevails throughout the year, but is more general and fatal during the months of September, October, and November, at the time of the ripening of the rice-crops. Among the lower classes the result of an attack is generally delirium and death within two or three days. Scanty food and clothing, and hard work in the rice-fields in water, with a burning sun overhead, are no doubt predisposing causes; but in almost all cases in this district an attack of autumnal fever goes to the head, and is exceedingly prostrating in its effects, even when it is not fatal. Small-pox is also very common, more especially during the months of April, May, and June, when it carries off a number of victims, chiefly among the younger members of the community; whereas fever is more prevalent among the village population and those engaged in agriculture. Vaccination has made but little progress as yet, and the superstition and ignorance of the mass of the people place great obstacles in its way. Cholera is common, and commits great ravages, more particularly during the rainy season; when, however, all deaths occurring from diseases of the stomach or bowels are credited indiscriminately to cholera by the natives. An attack of cholera is almost always followed by a fatal result, as the apathy and superstition of the natives prevent their taking even such remedies as are offered. The\nspread of intelligence by means of education, the practical aid afforded by the establishment of branch dispensaries, and the vigorous measures adopted for the enforcement of simple sanitary rules, will no doubt cause a great decrease in the mortality in future.\n\nAgricultural operations are carried on much in the same way as in the adjoining districts. The implements used are the tifan, or drill-rake, with three shares; the n\u00e1gar, or ordinary drill-plough, with one share; the bakhar, or hoe-plough; and the dauran, or small weeding-plough. The tifan is used for ploughing the ground only when it is sufficiently moist to be drawn over it. The ordinary drill-plough is used when the ground is hard and caked, or when ample time is remaining to complete the sowings. With the bakhar the weeds in field are destroyed, and inequalities partially levelled before either of the drill-ploughs are drawn over it. The dauran is used to weed jaw\u00e1ri (millet) fields between the drills, to loosen the earth at the roots of the plants, to raise the earth at their roots, and thus promote their growth and give them greater stability, and also to thin the field of some of the stalks. These results are obtained by drawing the dauran once over the field. There are two sowings in the year\u2014one at the commencement of the rainy season, and the other at its close. The former sowings are called \"Sy\u00e1rf,\" and the latter \"Unh\u00e1lf.\" The sy\u00e1rf sowings are performed thus: at the setting-in of the rains the bakhar is drawn over the ground a couple of times, after which it is sown with the tifan, which forms three furrows, and drops the seed into them at each turn. The furrows are not deep; but the tifan is well-suited for preparing fields in the rainy weather, when the ground is soft, and the operation of sowing requires to be performed expeditiously. For the unh\u00e1lf sowings the tifan can only be used when the rains continue to the middle of October, about which time these sowings commence. The bakhar is drawn over the fields reserved for spring crops whenever there is an intermission of rain for a week or more, to destroy the weeds, and open out the ground so as to enable it to absorb as much water as possible. If the rains are not favourable, the n\u00e1gar, or drill-plough with one share, is generally used to plough and sow the fields. The furrows formed by the n\u00e1gar are deeper than those made by the tifan, and the seeds sown in the furrows by the former are covered by its operation; that is, the seeds dropped in the first furrow are covered when the second one is formed, and so with the second and every subsequent furrow. Of the drills formed by the tifan, the seeds in the two inner drills, at each turn of that instrument, are left uncovered with earth. In the rainy season this is not of much consequence, as the water, running down the ridges, carries some earth with it into the drills; but in the unh\u00e1lf sowings, when there is no rain, the seeds which are exposed are liable to be picked up by birds. The khar\u00edf (sy\u00e1rf) or autumn crops are the rice, jaw\u00e1ri (holcus sorghum), kodo (paspalum frumentaceum), kutki (panicum milia-ceum,) t\u00fbr (cytisus cajan), cotton, and til (sesamum). The rab\u00ed (unh\u00e1lf) or spring crops are wheat, gram, linseed, mung (phaseolus mungo), l\u00e2kh (pigeon pea), bat\u00e1n\u00e9 (common pea), and popat (dwarf bean). Some of the seeds are sown in drills, and some broadcast. The seeds sown in drills are wheat, jaw\u00e1ri, linseed, gram, t\u00fbr, cotton, l\u00e2kh, mung, bat\u00e1n\u00e9, popat, and til; and those sown broadcast are kodo, rice, and kutki. There is no peculiarity in the mode of sowing any of the seeds but those of rice and sugarcane tubers. The rice is sown in three different ways: one of these is called \"bot\u00e1,\" which is sowing by broadcast; another is called \"kaurak,\" which is by first steeping\nunhusked rice in hot water for a few minutes, after which the rice is taken out and heaped in a dry room. The heap of rice is then covered over with a piece of gunny for three days, when the rice begins to germinate. In the meantime a field is ploughed, water is let into it, and a rake then drawn over, with the teeth downwards, to work up the soil and remove any weeds there may be in it. After this the rake is reversed and drawn on its back over the field to level it. The field being now ready to receive the sprouting seeds, they are removed to it, and sown broadcast. This mode of sowing is only adopted when from some cause the sowing has been delayed. After the fields have been sown, a man keeps off the birds from the seeds till the crops come out. The third mode of sowing rice is called ron\u00e1. A nursery of young crops is first formed by the rice being sown in a small piece of ground, which is previously ploughed and well manured. When the crops have attained the height of a foot they are taken up, put on sledges, and then taken to the field prepared for them, where they are transplanted. The field is prepared in the same way for the ron\u00e1 sowing as for the kaurak sowing. The plants are sown about an inch apart from each other. The first weeding takes place about one month after the transplantation of the crops; the second about the same time after the first weeding. A field intended for sugarcane cultivation is utilised by one of the inferior descriptions of rice which comes early to perfection being first sown in it. These crops ripen by the beginning of October. After they are cut the field is manured, and ploughed with the bakhar three times. The bakhar is then reversed and drawn over the field to break up the clods of earth and level it. The subsequent processes are to divide the field into beds of a square yard each, to water these beds, to cut the upper parts of canes into pieces of three knots each, and then to put these pieces longitudinally into the divided field. After this the field is irrigated till the rains set in. The thick black canes are sown in January and are fit to cut in November. The thin country canes are generally perfect in September. A second crop is not raised from the stumps, as in some parts of these provinces. Manure is only used and irrigation resorted to in the cultivation of vegetables, sugarcane, rice, and betel. At the harvest the crops are cut with sickles, and labourers employed in cutting them receive per diem one and a half p\u00e1l\u00ed (equal to one seer, fourteen chhat\u00e1nks) of grain, either of the description of crops they cut, or of some other kind of grain. When employed in cutting rice and mung crops, however, they receive different rates of remuneration. For cutting rice crops a labourer receives two p\u00e1l\u00ed (two seers and eight chhat\u00e1nks) per diem, but for cutting mung crops only one p\u00e1l\u00ed. The wages of labourers, in kind, are fixed with reference, to the value of the grain cut and the labour of cutting. The labour of cutting rice-crops is as great as that of cutting jaw\u00e1ri, wheat, t\u00fcr, &c., which are all cut in a stooping posture, and the market-value is generally much lower. The labour required to cut mung is comparatively less, as it is cut sitting, which is a less tiresome position than stooping. When the treading-floor of the owner of the field is near, the labourers carry the sheaves of corn to it and stack them there, but when it is at a distance, the owner provides carriage to have them conveyed to it. T\u00far and castor-seeds are beaten off the stalks with a stick, after which the pulse is trodden out of the t\u00fcr pods by cattle, which walk over them round a pole. The til is shaken out of the capsules, as on ripening the capsules open out. All the other kinds of grain are trodden out. The corn is then stored in small cylindrical granaries called band\u00e1s, built on platforms, which are supported on slabs of flagstone, and covered with light roofs thatched with grass. They are of various sizes, according to the quantity of grain required to be put into\nthem, but never very large. The grain is put into and removed from these granaries from the top by lifting the thatched roofs. The cylinders are built on raised platforms of stone, to prevent rats and other vermin from burrowing into them and injuring the corn. Sometimes oblong corn-houses are also built. These are called bakh\u00e1ris. The principal staples of the district are rice and aw\u00e1ri.\n\nThe articles manufactured in the district are native cloth, brass wares, potstone wares, cart-wheels, and straw and reed baskets. Native cloth is made in Bhand\u00e1ra, Paun\u00ed, A\u00b4ndhalg\u00e1on, Moh\u00e1ri, Sih\u00f3r\u00e1, Ad\u00e1r, and Bh\u00e1gri. The finest and best description of cloth is manufactured in the town of Paun\u00ed. This cloth is much prized by the higher class of natives, who sometimes pay a couple of hundred rupees for a turban or dop\u00e1t\u00e1. Cloth of such high value is now made only to order. The original manufacturers of these excellent descriptions of cloth are said to have come to these parts from Paithan on the God\u00e1var\u00ed, and Burh\u00e1npur on the Tapt\u00ed, on an invitation from the R\u00e9j\u00e1 of N\u00e1gp\u00far in the early part of the present century. Very fine ch\u00e1rkh\u00e1n\u00e1 cloth (called also jhilmi) is also manufactured in Paun\u00ed. The cotton-thread used in the manufacture of the Paun\u00ed cloths is spun by a low caste of men called Mah\u00e1rs or Dher\u00eds. The manufacturers of the cloth are called Kosht\u00eds. Red s\u00e1ris, with different-coloured borders of silk and cotton, are fabricated in A\u00b4ndhalg\u00e1on and Moh\u00e1ri. They are dyed with fast colours, and are made of qualities ranging in value as high as twenty-five or thirty rupees for a s\u00e1ri. The town of Bhand\u00e1ra produces turbans and waistcloths of a superior quality, manufactured of white cotton-thread. The waistcloths are generally made with coloured borders. The value of a turban or waistcloth is sometimes as much as fifteen or twenty rupees. In Sih\u00f3r\u00e1, Ad\u00e1r, and Bh\u00e1gri the inferior kinds of native cloth are fabricated. The Bh\u00e1gri kh\u00e1di cloth is of a stout texture, and noted for its durability. Brass-wares are manufactured in the towns of Bhand\u00e1ra and Paun\u00ed, but more extensively in the former. The articles produced are cooking-utensils and water-pots of all kinds used by natives, lamps, drinking-cups, bells, and fountains. These vessels are made by men of the K\u00e1s\u00e1r and Panch\u00e1l castes. They also work in bell-metal, pewter, and copper. Pot-stone wares are manufactured at Kanher\u00ed and Pendr\u00ed, in the S\u00e1koli subdivision, by carpenters and turners. The articles turned are cups, plates, and pipe-bowls. They are generally made thick for the village market, as the stone is soft and chalky, but when ordered, very good and light vessels can be produced. Cart-wheels are made in Tumsar and some other towns. Straw and reed baskets are woven in different parts of the district. They are coarse and rather clumsy, yet good enough to find ready sale among the natives of these parts, who seldom see better baskets.\n\nThe commerce of the district has received a great impetus since its annexation, with the rest of the province of N\u00e1gp\u00far proper, by the British government. The vastly improved condition of the Great Eastern Road and of the district communications, and a well-ordered police, have greatly facilitated traffic. The extinction of the Bhonsl\u00e1 rule has, however, diminished the demand for the superior description of Paun\u00ed cloth; and the competition of English piece-goods, together with the simultaneous rise in the price of cotton, has reduced the sale also of the inferior kinds of cloth; but the export of the cloth from this town is still great, having last year amounted in value to Rs. 50,372. The chief articles imported are cotton, salt, wheat, rice, oil-seeds, hardware, English piece-goods, tobacco,\nsilk, dyes, and cattle; and the articles most extensively exported are country cloth, tobacco, and hardware. The direction of the trade is chiefly to and from N\u00e1gp\u00far and R\u00e1jp\u00far by the Great Eastern Road, and by another route through P\u00e1l\u00e1nd\u00far. Also to and from K\u00e1mth\u00ed by the Tumsar route, and towards Mandla by Hatt\u00e1 and K\u00e1mth\u00e1. Of the articles imported, salt is brought from Ber\u00e1r and the eastern coast; sugar, metal, and spices from Mirz\u00e1p\u00far; hardware from Mirz\u00e1p\u00far and Mandla; European cloth and silks from Mirz\u00e1p\u00far and Bombay; country silks from Burh\u00e1np\u00far; Kh\u00e1rw\u00e1 cloth from Mhow and R\u00e1nip\u00far in the Jh\u00e1nsi district; wheat and rice from R\u00e1jp\u00far; and cattle from the Seoni and Mandla districts. Of the articles exported, country cloth is sent from Paun\u00ed, A'ndhalg\u00e1on, Moh\u00e1ri, Bhand\u00e1ra, and Bh\u00e1gri, to N\u00e1gp\u00far, Puna, and Bombay; hardware from Bhand\u00e1ra and Paun\u00ed to N\u00e1gp\u00far, R\u00e1jp\u00far, and Jabalp\u00far. Articles of traffic are generally conveyed in small country carts and on pack-bullocks.\n\nThough education received no attention or encouragement from the Bhonsl\u00e1 government, yet the people were not insensible of its value. In the district of Bhand\u00e1ra, which was formerly called the Waingang\u00e1 district, there were no less than 55 Mar\u00e1th\u00ed and Persian private schools, numbering in the aggregate 452 pupils, of whom 45 were taught the Persian language, and the rest Mar\u00e1th\u00ed. Twenty-eight of these schools were established in the large towns, and 27 in the villages. The teachers were Br\u00e1hmans, or Vid\u00fars.* The teachers were paid a sum varying from two annas to one rupee per mensem by the parents of each pupil, according to their means. There are now 38 government schools, all of which have been established within the last six years. One of these, which is at the head-quarters of the district, is called the zil\u00e1 school, and has two branches in the town of Bhand\u00e1ra; six are in the large towns and are termed town-schools; 26 are in villages, and are styled village schools; and three are female schools. Many of the old town and village schools served as foundations for some of the existing institutions, on the introduction of the present system of education. In addition to these government institutions, there are 78 indigenous or private schools, 77 of which are Mar\u00e1th\u00ed and one Urd\u00fa. These schools afford instruction to 7,324 children, of whom 7,109 are boys, and 215 girls. Ninety-nine of the boys are taught English, 90 are taught Urd\u00fa, and 6,920 Mar\u00e1th\u00ed. All the girls are also taught Mar\u00e1th\u00ed. Neat and commodious school-houses have now been built for the children; and efficient teachers have been employed to educate them. A girls\u2019 school has been built in Bhand\u00e1ra by Y\u00e1do R\u00e1o P\u00e1nd\u00e9, one of the principal bankers of the town. The Br\u00e1hman and Vid\u00far teachers, who educated the children under the former government, were not scholars, but men who endeavoured to get a living by keeping up schools. Education, before the establishment of the government schools, was generally carried no further than was sufficient to qualify for a profession. The educational establishment of the district consists now of a district inspector, 38 masters, and 23 assistant masters. The annual cost of schools amounts to Rs. 14,016. Of this sum Rs. 4,212 are paid from the imperial revenues, Rs. 6,900 from the school cess fund, and Rs. 2,904 from the local funds. The management is conducted through local committees, composed of respectable natives of the towns and villages in which the schools are established,\n\n* Illegitimate descendants of Br\u00e1hmans.\nThe chiefships are situated near the eastern limits of the district, from the left bank of the Waingang\u00e1 on the north, to the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 boundary on the south. They are 25 in number\u2014eight in the K\u00e1mth\u00e1 pargana, and seventeen in the S\u00e1ngarh\u00ed and Pr\u00e1t\u00e1pgarh parganas of tahsil S\u00e1k\u00f3l\u00ed. Their names are \u00c1\u2019mg\u00e1on, Arjuni, Bijl\u00ed, Chichgarh, Chikhl\u00e9, D\u00e1ngurl\u00ed, Daw\u00e1, Dalli, Gond-Umri, J\u00e1mri, K\u00e1mth\u00e1, Khajr\u00ed, Khari, Kanhar\u00e1g\u00e1on, Karar\u00e1g\u00e1on, Mah\u00e1g\u00e1on, Nansari, Umri of pargana Pr\u00e1t\u00e1pgarh, Purar\u00e1, Palkher\u00e1, Palasg\u00e1on, Parasg\u00e1on, R\u00e9jol\u00ed, Tirkher\u00e1, and Turmpur\u00ed. The most important and extensive of these estates is K\u00e1mth\u00e1, which with Hatt\u00e1 was originally granted by Raghoj\u00ed I., r\u00e1j\u00e1 of N\u00e1gpur, to an ancestor of the present chief of Kirn\u00e1p\u00far, named R\u00e1m Patel, a Kunb\u00ed by caste, to bring into cultivation. The two estates of K\u00e1mth\u00e1 and Hatt\u00e1, together with \u00c1\u2019mg\u00e1on, Bijl\u00ed, Palkher\u00e1, Purar\u00e1, and Tirkher\u00e1 Malpur\u00ed, formed the K\u00e1mth\u00e1 zamind\u00e1r\u00ed till A.D. 1856. Narbad Patel, a Lodh\u00ed by caste, obtained it on its confiscation, in 1818, from Chimn\u00e1 Patel, nephew of R\u00e1m Patel, for the offence of rebellion against the Government. The zamind\u00e1rs of K\u00e1mth\u00e1 and Hatt\u00e1 were styled Patels till A.D. 1843. The Hatt\u00e1 estate was granted by Narbad Patel to his brother Sukal Patel, since which time it has been held distinct from K\u00e1mth\u00e1, but continued in subordination to the elder branch of the family till A.D. 1856. The \u00c1\u2019mg\u00e1on estate was granted away by Gondu Patel, brother of R\u00e1m Patel, more than seventy years ago. The Palkher\u00e1 estate was granted by Chimn\u00e1 Patel, nephew of R\u00e1m Patel and third possessor of the K\u00e1mth\u00e1 taluka, to his nephew Deo Patel. There is no record as to when, and by whom, the Purar\u00e1 estate was sliced off from that of K\u00e1mth\u00e1. The Tirkher\u00e1 Malpur\u00ed estate is said to have been granted in A.D. 1815 by Raghoj\u00ed II. to the father of the present holder. The Kirn\u00e1p\u00far, Bh\u00e1dr\u00e1, and Dasg\u00e1on estates are the next in importance, but the two former have been transferred to B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t, and Dasg\u00e1on has been broken up. The others are small zamind\u00e1r\u00eds, but of more ancient origin. Ten years after Chimn\u00e1 Patel lost the K\u00e1mth\u00e1 taluka by rebellion he received the Kirn\u00e1p\u00far taluka, which has ever since been held by his family. The whole of these zamind\u00e1r\u00eds comprise an area of 1,509 square miles, which are formed into 571 villages, and contain a population of 166,005 souls, each square mile supporting on an average 110 persons. The proportion of area under tillage is about one-fifth. The rest is composed of culturable waste, jungle, and hill. A brief account of each chiefship is given in its proper place.\n\nOf the earlier history of this district nothing is known, but tradition says that the country was visited by some great calamity at a remote period, when a tribe of men called Gaul\u00eds or Gamlars overran and conquered it. The present Gaul\u00eds are a pastoral and wandering race of men, who encamp in the jungles and seldom visit villages, except to sell their cattle, dispose of the produce of the dairy, or purchase provisions. There is a tradition that the country was at one time under the Mohammadan princes of the Deccan, but at the end of the seventeenth century it certainly belonged to the Gond R\u00e9j\u00e1 of Deogarh. Bakht Buland, the founder of this dynasty, turned Mohammadan in order to obtain the support of Aurangzeb. Under his rule a number of Lodh\u00eds, R\u00e9jputs, Ponw\u00e1rs, Kor\u00eds, Kar\u00e1s, and Kunbis were attracted into and settled in the district and the villages in the vicinity of the Waingang\u00e1; Paun\u00ed especially improved in tillage from the industry and agricultural skill introduced by them. The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s under Raghoj\u00ed I. conquered the country about A.D. 1738, but it was not formally administered from N\u00e1gpur until 1743. Under the Bhonsl\u00e1\u00eds a\nnumber of the commercial and soldier classes\u2014M\u00e1rw\u00e1ris, Agarw\u00e1ris, Ling\u00e1its, and Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 Kunbis\u2014came and established themselves in the district. When \u00c1p\u00e1 S\u00e1hib's intrigues brought on hostilities with the British in A.D. 1817, the ladies of his palace, his jewels, and other valuable effects were sent by him for security to Bhand\u00e1ra, whence they were escorted back to N\u00e1gpur by the British troops after the surrender of the city of N\u00e1gpur. In A.D. 1818 Chinn\u00e1 Patel, zamind\u00e1r of the K\u00e1mth\u00e1 and War\u00fad talukas, rebelled against the Government, when Captain Gordon was deputed to K\u00e1mth\u00e1, where he remained for three or four months, to quell the disturbance. In the same year Captain Wilkinson was appointed superintendent of the district, and proceeded to K\u00e1mth\u00e1, where he remained till the end of A.D. 1820, and then removed to Bhand\u00e1ra. Captain Wilkinson continued in Bhand\u00e1ra till A.D. 1830, when R\u00e1j\u00e1 Raghoj\u00ed III. having attained his majority, the management of the country was made over to him. R\u00e1j\u00e1 Raghoj\u00ed III. governed the country till his death in A.D. 1853. On the 11th October 1854 Captain C. Elliot was appointed deputy commissioner of the district, and no incident worthy of note has occurred since. The district continued perfectly tranquil even during the prevalence of the general rebellion in 1857 and 1858. Three companies of infantry and a small body of horsemen were stationed at Bhand\u00e1ra for the protection of the district till A.D. 1860, since when the police is the only armed force which has been maintained here.\n\nUnder the Gond dynasty the country was divided into departments called parganas, varying in the number of villages allotted to them, and in the aggregate amount of revenue demandable from them. The subdivisions were managed by officials called Huddled\u00e1rs, Desmukhs, and Desp\u00e1ndy\u00e1s. These offices were abolished under the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 government, and Kam\u00e1visd\u00e1rs, Pharnav\u00eds\u00e9s, and Bar\u00e1r P\u00e1ndy\u00e1s were substituted. The kam\u00e1visd\u00e1r was the head fiscal officer of the subdivision. An estimate of the annual receipts and disbursements of his pargana was furnished to him in the month of August, according to which he regulated his demands. One or more villages were managed by a patel, who had a kotw\u00e1l and p\u00e1ndy\u00e1 to assist him. The patel fixed and collected the rents payable by the tenants. The patel\u00ed of a village was neither hereditary nor saleable. The sons of patels were, however, often allowed to succeed to the villages held by their father by sufferance, or by a new appointment from government. Leases were only given to tenants for one year at a time, the rent being liable to variation annually. The lands were divided into fields, each having a separate name, by which it was recorded in the village accounts. The lands were let to the highest bidder at the commencement of the agricultural year. In these settlements the patel acted as the government agent. A paper was maintained in each village called the \"l\u00e1gwan,\" which showed in detail the rents of the tenants as concluded for the season. The revenue was divided into two portions\u2014the first payable in three instalments in the months of September, October, and November, and the other in two instalments in the months of February and March. From the beginning of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 rule till A.D. 1792 the country prospered under a fair revenue demand, but thenceforward the oppressive assessments, exaction of large nazars, and the realisation of the rents in advance, brought irretrievable embarrassments on the patels and tenants, and caused much land to be thrown out of cultivation. During the minority of Raghoj\u00ed III. the British government assumed the management of his country, and a new apportionment of the whole province was made into convenient divisions.\nThe district, then called the Waingang\u00e1 district, was divided into thirteen parganas. Captain Wilkinson was appointed superintendent of the whole, and under him a kam\u00e1visd\u00e1r was appointed to each subdivision. The district now contains 1,772 villages, divided into nine parganas, and these again into two tahsils. The parganas of Paun\u00ed, Bhand\u00e1ra, Amb\u00e9garh, Ch\u00e1ndpur, Tiror\u00e1, and R\u00e9mp\u00e1il\u00ed form the Bhand\u00e1ra subdivision, with the head-quarters at Bhand\u00e1ra. This tahsil contains 886 villages, and includes the full half of the district from north to south on the western side. The remaining half on the eastern side forms the tahsil of S\u00e1kolf\u00ed, with the parganas of K\u00e1mth\u00e1, S\u00e1ngarhi, and Prat\u00e1pagarh, and a list of villages exactly equal to that in Bhand\u00e1ra. The head-quarters of this subdivision are at S\u00e1kolf\u00ed, on the Great Eastern Road, about twenty-four miles from Bhand\u00e1ra. A tahsild\u00e1r, with the usual staff of officials, manages each subdivision under the direction of the district officer, besides which there is an independent n\u00e1ib tahsild\u00e1r at Tiror\u00e1, in the Bhand\u00e1ra tahsil. This officer has no treasury, but he assists in the general administration of the northern parganas. In 1867 a settlement of the government demand on account of land revenue for the term of thirty years for the whole district was completed, and the result was an assessment of Rs. 4,08,942. This is payable in two instalments, viz. in April and January. The settlement was made with regard to the present and prospective capacity of each village, and as the rate is very low, there is a large margin left for the encouragement of industry, and already the numerous improvements to tanks and wells, and a general extension of the cultivated area, attest the advantages of a fixed demand. The other revenues of the district are as follows:\u2014Stamps, Rs. 37,749; excise, Rs. 55,921; assessed taxes, Rs. 50,515; forests Rs. 25,535 (1869).\n\nThere were no established courts of justice during the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 reign, but Judicial and Police administration.\n\nKam\u00e1visd\u00e1rs and patels administered justice according to their own notions of right. There was no written law or custom which was either well understood or generally accepted. In matters of succession the Mohammadan law, in the case of Mohammadians, and the Hind\u00fa law, in the case of Hind\u00fas, was usually followed. Suits of above one thousand rupees in value generally came before the r\u00e1j\u00e1, who either decided them himself, or referred them for decision to a panch\u00e1yat. Kam\u00e1visd\u00e1rs were assisted by the pharmavises, bar\u00e1r p\u00e1ndy\u00e1s, and head patels of their subdivisions. A fee of one-fourth, called \u201cshukr\u00e1na,\u201d was levied from the winning party in all suits decided, and an equal sum was imposed on the party who lost, as fine. These sums were paid to the government. A fee of from five to ten rupees, called \u201cbh\u00e1t mas\u00e1lah,\u201d was also paid to the kam\u00e1visd\u00e1r, to defray the expense of summoning the defendants. The person summoned had also to support the man who served the summons on him. In each village there was a mah\u00e1jan, or arbitrator, who was chosen by the patels and cultivators for the adjudication of their disputes. Among the lower classes the heads of the castes, styled \u201csety\u00e1s,\u201d decided disputes referred to them. If the parties were dissatisfied, a panch\u00e1yat of sety\u00e1s was convened, whose decision was generally final. The mah\u00e1jans and sety\u00e1s were always persons of considerable consequence in their respective communities. Civil cases were decided by panch\u00e1yats. These generally assembled at a \u201cchabutr\u00e1\u201d (platform) where an idol of Mah\u00e1deva was placed, which was supposed to give the sanctity of an oath to any statement made there. The plaintiff, if a man of wealth, provided victuals, betel, tobacco, &c. for the members. Among the Gonds he provided liquor. The proceedings of ordinary village panch\u00e1yats were rarely recorded, except in the case of those assembled by the higher authorities,\nwhen the sentences needed confirmation. The duty of seeing the decision carried into effect devolved on the person under whose authority the panch\u00e1yat was assembled. In criminal cases patels imposed small fines for petty offences. Offenders taken to the th\u00e1nas were generally flogged and confined in the stocks for fifteen, twenty, or thirty days, and if they were in a condition to pay, fines were imposed on them. For house-breaking and theft they were punished at times by imprisonment in irons, confiscation of goods, flogging, detention in the stocks, and fine. For second offences they were punished by mutilation of hands, nose, and fingers. If the person robbed was also wounded, the punishment was generally mutilation; if murdered, the award was death. Br\u00e1hmans and women were excepted from this rule. Women guilty of the murder of their husbands were punished sometimes with mutilation of their noses. Pecuniary compensation was sometimes allowed if the relatives of the deceased agreed to the arrangement, the ordinary payment being Rs. 350 to the heirs of the person murdered. Coiners had one of their hands crushed to pieces with a blow from a heavy mallet or pestle. For fornication the person named by the woman was charged with the offence and fined heavily, part of the fine being carried to the government account, and part taken by the officer imposing the fine. The woman was then made over to her caste people, to be dealt with according to their award. The deputy commissioner is now the chief judge in all cases\u2014revenue, criminal, and civil\u2014within the district; he has also general control over all matters executive or administrative. The assistant commissioners exercise the judicial powers of their grade, and take up any share of the administrative business which the deputy commissioner may allot to them. The tahsild\u00e1rs are vested with subordinate judicial and fiscal authority within their circles. The stipendiary officers are assisted on the criminal side by honorary magistrates chosen from the more intelligent and influential residents. The direction and distance of the country criminal courts from Bhand\u00e1ra are given below:\n\nS\u00e1kol\u00ed..........................24 miles east.\nMurd\u00e1r\u00e1.........................30 miles N.N. east.\nTiror\u00e1...........................24 miles N., where an independent naib tahsild\u00e1r, officiating as tahsild\u00e1r, exercises judicial powers within the limits of the northern parganas.\n\nThere are station-houses of the police, each under a chief constable, at Bhand\u00e1ra, K\u00e1mth\u00e1, S\u00e1kol\u00ed, Moh\u00e1r\u00ed, Tiror\u00e1, R\u00e1mp\u00e1il\u00ed, Arjun\u00ed (Prat\u00e1ppgarh), and Paun\u00ed. There are also 16 outposts under the charge of head constables. The district superintendent of police has his office at head-quarters. The old fort is used as the jail of the district. All classes of prisoners\u2014civil, revenue, and criminal\u2014are confined in it, the two first mentioned classes being accommodated in separate wards. There are seldom any revenue, and but few civil, prisoners in it.\n\nBHAND\u00c1RA is the name of a revenue subdivision or tahsil in the district of the same name, having an area of 1,748 square miles, of which 757 are cultivated, 384 culturable, and 607 waste. It contains 886 villages, and a population of 345,870, according to the census of 1866. The land revenue for the year 1869-70 is Rs. 2,80,760. This tahsil consists of two judicial subdivisions with a sub-office at Tiror\u00e1.\n\nBHAND\u00c1RA\u2014The chief station and head-quarters of the district of the same name. It is situated on the Waingang\u00e1, close to the Great Eastern Road,\nabout thirty-eight miles east of N\u00e1gpur. The town contains 2,986 houses, with a population of 12,753 souls, and has a considerable trade in cotton-cloth and hardware locally manufactured. The inhabitants are mostly Dhers, Ko\u00e9ht\u00eds, and K\u00e1s\u00e1rs, with a fair sprinkling of Mohammadans and Br\u00e1hmans. As the head-quarters of the district, Bhand\u00e1ra contains a district office, post-office, government dispensary, jail, police head-quarters, with district and town police station-houses, travellers' bungalow, assistant engineer's office, public library, and government zil\u00e1 school. There are besides a female school and two indigenous schools\u2014one for Mar\u00e1th\u00ed, and the other for Persian and Urdu. The watch and ward and conservancy of the town are provided for from the town duties. The town is kept very clean and well drained, and is considered healthy. It is built entirely upon red gravel soil, so that even the lanes are easily kept dry and in good repair throughout the year. The well-water inside the town is generally brackish, but there are several wells of sweet water and some tanks just outside, while the river Waingang\u00e1 runs at no great distance.\n\nBH\u00c1NRER\u2014A portion of the Vindhy\u00e1 hill system, of which it may be said, in the Jabalp\u00far district and Maih\u00edr state, to form the south-eastern face. The limits of the appellation are not very closely defined, but the Bh\u00e1nrer range may be taken to commence opposite S\u00e1nkalgh\u00e1t on the Narbad\u00e1, in the Narsinghp\u00far district, and to run in a north-easterly direction for some hundred and twenty miles, forming in its last section the upper boundary of the Maih\u00edr valley. The highest peak in these provinces of the Bh\u00e1nrer hills is Kalumb\u00e9 or Kal\u00famar, which is 2,544 feet above the level of the sea.\n\nBHA\u2019PAIL or BHA\u2019PEL\u2014A village in the S\u00e1g\u00e1r district, about ten miles to the west of S\u00e1g\u00e1r, celebrated for its annual fair, which is held in November. In 1868 it was attended by 50,000 people, and merchandise to the amount of Rs. 5,800 changed hands.\n\nBHARDA\u2019GARH\u2014A zam\u00edn\u00e9d\u00e1ri consisting of forty villages, in the north of the Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 district. The zam\u00edn\u00e9d\u00e1r is a Bhop\u00e1 or hereditary guardian of the Mah\u00e1deva temples.\n\nBHATA\u2019LA\u2019\u2014A village in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, situated twenty-six miles north-west of Bh\u00e1ndak, and supposed to have formed part of the ancient Bhadr\u00e1vat\u00ed. On a long hill near the village are the remains of a very fine ancient temple, lofty and in good preservation, and the whole hill bears traces of having been fortified, while at the foot are several tanks which once were approached by long flights of steps. Close by there is a quarry of excellent free-stone.\n\nBHA'TGA\u2019ON\u2014A small zam\u00edn\u00e9d\u00e1ri in the Bil\u00e1sp\u00far district, south of the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed. It is a fairly level tract, overlooked by the Phuljhar hills, and contains thirty-nine villages, covering an area of sixty-two square miles. The extent of cultivation is 10,794 acres, while the culturable area amounts to 12,000 acres. The soil is fully up to the average of the Seor\u00edn\u00e1r\u00e1n\u00ed pargana, and most of the villages are in a fairly prosperous condition. The population is 7,904, falling at the rate of 127 to the square mile. The zam\u00edn\u00e9d\u00e1r is a Bij\u00e1\u00e1 by caste.\n\nBHEDAN or BASAIKELA\u2019\u2014A very old Gond chiefship now attached to the Sambalp\u00far district. It is said to have existed before the Chauh\u00e1n R\u00e9jput dynasty, or some seven hundred years ago. It is situated about thirty miles to the south-south-west of the town of Sambalp\u00far, and consists of twenty-five villages, with an area of some fifteen square miles, the whole extent of which\nis cultivated. The population by the last census amounted to 7,115 souls, and is chiefly agricultural, the principal cultivating classes being Kolt\u00e1s, Saur\u00e1s, Gonds, and Dum\u00e1ls. The staple product is rice, but the pulses, oil-seeds, &c. are also grown. Tasar silk and coarse cotton-cloths are manufactured. The principal village is Bhedan, where the chief resides; it has a population of 1,412 souls. There is an excellent school in this village, where some one hundred and forty pupils are receiving instruction; and there are also schools in the surrounding villages. The father of the present chief joined the rebellion under Surendra S\u00e9, and was killed in an action with our troops. The other members of the family surrendered under the amnesty, and the present chief, Baijn\u00e1th Singh, a young man of some eighteen years of age, succeeded to the estate. He can read and write Uryia, and his relations all attend school.\n\n**BHERA'GHAT**\u2014A village in the Jabalpur district, situated on the banks of the Narbad\u00e1, at a place where that river forces itself through perpendicular magnesian limestone rocks 120 feet in height. The scenery here is magnificent. The best way to see it is to hire a boat in the cold weather, and to proceed up the river, which is as clear as crystal, between rocks that seem to meet overhead. The channel is devious, and every opening presents new features of beauty. In one place the river is so narrow that the natives call the pass the \"monkey's leap.\" There is a myth that \"Indra\" made this channel for the waters of the pent-up stream, and that the footsteps of Indra's elephant are still to be seen. The marks on the surface of the rock which pass for these footsteps still receive the adoration of the ignorant and superstitious. The effect of the scenery is very much heightened by the bright light of the moon, which has a weird effect on these stupendous and sometimes grotesque masses of rock. Near this gh\u00e1t, which is only nine miles from Jabalpur, there are several conical hills, on one of which is rather a remarkable Hind\u00fa temple. The whole hill is covered with wood to the top, except on one side, where a sloping ascent has been made, and steps lined with masonry have been constructed. The temple consists of an inner shrine, and is surrounded by a circular cloister, in which are sculptures of many of the Hind\u00fa gods, among which representations of Siva predominate. Many of these images have been greatly injured by the Mohammadans. There is a tradition that most of this injury was done when a portion of Aurangzeb's army was encamped in the neighbourhood of Sangr\u00e1mpur. Some rude excavations are also shown here in which ascetics are said to have lived. The view from the temple is exceedingly fine. A fair is held at Bher\u00e1gh\u00e1t every year in November, rather for religious purposes than to promote trade.\n\n**BHIML\u00c1T**\u2014A small Gond village in the B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t district, about sixty-four miles due east of Seoni and twenty-eight miles east of Parasw\u00e1r\u00e1, on the Banjar river. Near the village is a curious stone pillar or l\u00e1t, lying on the ground in a grove of mango trees, which is said to be the l\u00e1t of R\u00e9j\u00e1 Bh\u00edm. It is cut out of a peculiarly fine-grained stone, and seems to have been brought from a distance, as no stone of the kind has yet been discovered in the district. It has no inscription on it. Bh\u00edml\u00e1t is also noted for having within its borders one of the finest Banian trees in the Central Provinces. The Banjar and the Jam\u00fani\u00e1 unite upon its borders.\n\n**BHIRI**\u2014A town in the B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t district, lying about four miles to the south-east of Parasw\u00e1r\u00e1. It is not a place of any great pretensions, but is chiefly noted for the best and most frequented market in the upland tracts of B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t.\n\n10 CPG\nBHIRI.\u2014An old village situated to the south-west of the Wardh\u00e1 district, about twenty miles from Wardh\u00e1. The population amounts to 1,236 souls, most of whom are cultivators of the lands round; but there are also a good many weavers. An annual fair of eight days' duration is held here at the time of the Hind\u00fa holiday of Janma Ashtami. Monday is the weekly market day, but the market is not of much importance. A village school has been established at Bhir\u00ed, and the customs department have a salt post here. The principal building is an old temple of carved stone dedicated to Gop\u00e1ldeva.\n\nBHISI.\u2014A town in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e9 district, of 600 houses, eleven miles north of Chim\u00far. It has a boys' school, a girls' school, and a police outpost. There is also a modern temple handsomely carved.\n\nBHITRIGARH.\u2014A range of hills in the eastern part of the Jabalp\u00far district, bisecting the pargana of Kumbh\u00ed. There are remains of a fort on these hills near Bhitr\u00ed.\n\nBHIWA'PU'R.\u2014A town in the N\u00e1gp\u00far district, sixteen miles south-east of Umrer and forty-four from N\u00e1gp\u00far, on the road from Umrer to Paunf in Bhand\u00e1ra. Close to it is a small river named the Mar\u00fa, a tributary of the Waingang\u00e1. The town is closed in on the north and west by fine groves of mango trees and by a large tank. The population amounts to 4,557 persons, and is generally well to do. The octroi receipts have been spent by the local committee in the construction of two good metalled roads through the town, a new school-house, sar\u00e9i, and market-place. A large public baoli, or well with steps leading down to the water, has been made in the market-place. Improvements are now going on in excavating the bed of a fine tank outside the town, and enlarging and converting into a road the high earthen retaining-wall. The appearance of the town is neat and clean, and the houses are generally good. A considerable amount of trade and banking is carried on, this last being mostly in the hands of \u00c1garw\u00e1l\u00e1 M\u00e1rv\u00e1r\u00eds, who have been long settled here. The cloth manufactured is considered inferior only to that produced at N\u00e1gp\u00far and Umrer. Bhiw\u00e1np\u00far was a very early settlement of the Gonds, the original settler having been one Bh\u00edms\u00e1, who, in the middle of the sixteenth century, built the now dilapidated fort, as a protection to his little colony. Around this grew up a thriving town, early noted for its manufacture of silk and cloth. A poor blind Gond, confidently asserted both by himself and by the people to be the lineal descendant of the original founder of the town, still lives in the old fort, and receives a small pension from government. His only son is now a pupil in the government school, the last of his race, and probably the very first to cultivate the art of letters.\n\nBHOMARA.\u2014A village in the R\u00e1ip\u00far district, lying fifty-six miles to the south-west of R\u00e1ip\u00far, in the middle of the jungles of the Sanj\u00e1ri pargana. It is noteworthy as being the place to which the forest produce of a large tract of country is brought.\n\nBHUPALPATNAM.\u2014A zam\u00edn'd\u00e1ri or large estate of the Bastar dependency, containing about 700 square miles and 150 villages. It is the most western of the Bastar zam\u00edn'd\u00e1ris, and lies partly on the Indr\u00e1vati, and partly on the God\u00e1var\u00ed. The zam\u00edn'd\u00e1r is a Gond.\n\nBHUPALPATNAM.\u2014The chief place of the zam\u00edn'd\u00e1ri of the same name in the Bastar state, thirty-two miles east of Sironch\u00e1. The population is\nabout 600, chiefly Gonds, Kois, and Telengas. There is a high hill about eight miles to the south called Krishna Gutta, where a fair is held every February.\n\nBIAS\u2014A river rising in the hills of Sirman in the Bhopal state, close by the south-western boundary of the Saggar district; it flows thence near Jaisinghnagar in a north-easterly direction, passing within ten miles of Saggar, where it is crossed by a beautiful iron suspension-bridge, of 200 feet span, built by Colonel Presgrave, formerly mint-master at Saggar, in the year 1832. From thence it still keeps in a north-easterly direction, and eventually falls into the Sonar near Narsinghgarh in the Damoh district.\n\nBIJERA'GHOGARH\u2014A tract of country in the Jabalpur district. It is bounded on the north by the Maihir state, east by Rewa, and west by the Sleemanabad tahsil and Panna. The area is about 750 square miles. It has been thus described by the settlement officer\u2014\n\n\"The western half is a valley lying between the Kaimur hills on the north, and a low range known as the Kainjua on the south. The central portion of this valley appears to be generally high and arid, but there is a belt of rich land under each hill range. The population here belong chiefly to the Brahman, Kurmi, and Kachhi classes; and the hill tracts of the Kainjua are stated to be inhabited by Gonds. The eastern is the richest half, and contains a good deal of black soil, especially to the north. The southern part consists both of black and light soil, and is interspersed with hill and jungle. Here is a reserved government forest, managed by the forest department of the Central Provinces. The best lands in this portion of the pargana are occupied by Kurmis.\"\n\nThe country is chiefly valuable for agricultural purposes, though there is some fine timber in the portion reserved as a government forest. Iron is also found at several places, and is smelted in the native method. Bijeraghogarh was formerly a protected chiefship belonging to a branch of the family which owns Maihir, but was confiscated in consequence of the excesses committed, in defiance of British authority, by the young chief and his followers in the critical times of 1857. The population amounts to about 70,000 souls.\n\nBIJERA'GHOGARH\u2014The chief town, or rather village, of the tract of that name in the Jabalpur district, containing a population variously estimated at from 1,200 to 1,500. There is a handsome, but comparatively recent, fort here, which was formerly the residence of the chiefs. Its outer defences are now partially dismantled, but the interior buildings have been until lately used as subdivisional revenue and police offices. The grounds attached to the fort are kept up as a public garden. The trade is not great, and there are only two bankers of any means in the town.\n\nBIJERA'GHOGARH\u2014A small sal forest of about thirty-one square miles in extent, lying chiefly on the banks of the (lesser) Mahanadi, in the south-east corner of the pargana of that name in the Jabalpur district. The timber has suffered much in former years from the dalya system of cultivation practised by the aboriginal tribes, and will require rest for some years.\n\nBIJJJI\u2014A zamindari or large estate of the Bastar dependency, with an area of 850 square miles and 150 villages, is noted for its teak forests, which, though very extensive in former years, have been greatly over-worked. Teak is still exported in large quantities, though felling is said to have gone on\ncontinuously here for the last forty years. The timber is dragged either to the God\u00e1var\u00ed at Parns\u00e1l\u00e1, or the Sabar\u00ed river at Kunt\u00e1, and from these points floated down to the coast. The population is scanty, and consists chiefly of Ko\u00eds and M\u00e1r\u00edas.\n\nBIJLI'\u2014A chiefship on the north-eastern border of the Bhand\u00e1ra district, consisting of forty-eight villages, with an area of 140 square miles, of which twenty-one are under cultivation, and a population of 8,704 souls. A good deal of valuable timber is found in its forests. The present holders are Lodh\u00eds, and the majority of the population are Gonds and Lodh\u00eds. The village of Bijli itself is the only one of any size. One of the main district roads to R\u00e1jpur passes through this chiefship, and leaves it by the Dar\u00e9k\u00e1s\u00e1 pass, which has been recently improved and put in thorough repair. Near the pass there are some curious caves in the adjoining hills, partly natural and partly artificial. They are called \"Kachagarh,\" or the fort of safety, and must have been very useful as a refuge in former times, having a good water-supply from a spring of water close by, and being difficult of approach owing to the denseness of the bamboo jungle. Just below the Dar\u00e9k\u00e1s\u00e1 pass there is a large pool of very deep water formed by the fall of the \"Kuard\u00e1s\" stream from a height of about fifty feet. This is a favourite camping-ground of the Banj\u00e1r\u00e1s; and the scenery around is very grand and impressive.\n\nBIJNA'\u2014A river which rises in the Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 district, and flows east, till it meets the B\u00e1ngang\u00e1.

They are composed of metamorphic rock. The highest peak is that of Bichua.\n\nBILATIGARH\u2014A chiefship in the Bil\u00e1sp\u00far district. This estate is similar to that of Bhatg\u00e1on, which it adjoins, namely, a generally level tract broken up by hills on its southern face. It contains fifty villages, and covers an area of 109 square miles. The soil is of average quality, and the staple produce is rice. The cultivated area is 10,977 acres, and perhaps twice as much may be culturable waste. The population amounts to 7,409, and falls at the rate of sixty-eight to the square mile, the low rate being attributable to the partially hilly character of the tract, and to the bad management of the chief, who is a Gond.\n\nBILATIGARH\u2014The head-quarters of the chiefship of that name in the Bil\u00e1sp\u00far district. Here are the remains of an extensive fort and the ruins of some ancient temples, showing that the town held formerly a position of considerable importance. It is now an insignificant hamlet, consisting of a few huts, which hold the personal retainers of the zam\u00edn-d\u00e1r.\nThe most northerly of the eastern districts of the Central Provinces, forms the northern section of that tract of country which is usually known as the Chhattisgarh plateau. It is situated between 21\u00b0 45' and 23\u00b0 10' of north latitude, and 81\u00b0 30' and 89\u00b0 15' of east longitude, and is bounded on the north by the Sohagpur pargana belonging to the native state of Rewa, and by the Kori and Sirguda chiefships subordinate to the Commissioner of Chota Nagpur, on the east by the Ud\u00e9pur estate of Chota Nagpur and the zamindaris of the Sambalpur district, on the south in the main by the open plain of the R\u00e1ip\u00far district, and on the west by the hilly tracts of Mandla and Balaghat. The extreme length of the district north and south is 106 miles, its extreme breadth east and west 136 miles, and it comprises an area of 8,800 square miles. This extensive area possesses, as might be anticipated, marked and varied natural features. If the Chhattisgarh country be regarded as the basin of the Mahanadi, with the tract surrounding the centre open and cultivated, the approaches to the sides wild and woody, and the sides themselves irregular ranges of hills, then the Bilaspur district would be described with fair accuracy as the upper half of this basin.\n\nIt is almost enclosed on three sides, viz. on the north, west, and east by ranges of hills, while its southern boundary, which extends along the line of the R\u00e1ip\u00far district, is generally open, accessible, and cultivated. The outer boundaries of the district are fairly well defined. The western hills, which may best be described as the \"Maikal Range,\" run continuously in a south-westerly direction from Amarkantak, which is situated at the north-western extremity of the district, and\n\n* This article is almost entirely extracted from Mr. Chisholm's Settlement Report on Bilaspur.\nmerge in the S\u00e1l\u00e9tekr\u00ed range of the Bhand\u00e1ra district. From the same point irregular blocks of hills run east, wedging in the district on the north. This irregular chain of hills, though known in each limited locality under special designations, is really a part of the \"Vindhyan range,\"* which stretches from east to west across the whole continent of India. On the eastern boundary the Korba hills, offshoots of the Vindhyas, running south for some distance from the main range, fringe the plain; and although these hills strike east into the Sambalpur district, and leave a break of open country in the vicinity of the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed, no sooner is the river crossed than the Son\u00e1kh\u00e1n block of hills present themselves as a formidable barrier, thus almost completing a semicircle of hills enclosing the plain. Of these different ranges the northern or Vindhya range constitutes, as far as the Bil\u00e1sipur district is concerned, the most important and extensive series of hills. They run along, as it were, the whole face of the plain, here thrusting forth an arm or throwing up an isolated peak, and advancing boldly into the level country, there receding into deep hollows and bays, usually covered with luxuriant vegetation. It is from some of the offshoots of this northern range that the best idea can be formed of the natural features of the country. For this purpose there is perhaps no better point than the \"Dahl\u00e1 hill,\" which stands right out in the plain, isolated and detached, at a distance of fifteen miles east of Bil\u00e1sipur. The sides of this hill are rocky and precipitous, its shape peaky and conical, and it rises very abruptly to a height of 2,600 feet. These peculiarities render it a prominent landmark capable of identification from spots divided and distant, and familiarises it to the people as a silent sentinel of locality. From the summit is seen on one side a great expanse of plain, stretching as far as the eye can reach; on the other this open country is hedged in by irregular ranges of hills, throwing their reflection in dark shadows on the green surface below. The open country is dotted with villages, which are easily distinguishable in the landscape, even when the huts of the peasantry are hid from view by the one or more tanks in their vicinity, the waters of which sparkle in the sunlight, and by the mango, pip\u00e1l, and tamarind trees, more or less numerous, which cluster round the village site and break the dull monotony of level plain.\n\nThe following notice of the geological formation of the district is quoted from the Records of the Geological Survey of India for June 1868, Vol. I. Part I, p. 4:\n\n\"From the Hasd\u00fa and the plains of Bil\u00e1sipur the main mass of the crystalline rocks, which greatly predominate, lies to the north-west, forming the hilly region of M\u00e1t\u00edn, while the numerous and almost detached areas of the secondary rocks (chiefly of the talcheer series) are extensions from the eastwards, where the table-topped hills of Ud\u00e9pur appear to be formed altogether of the sandstones. With this extension of that series of rocks is connected the small coal basin of Korba. On the M\u00e1t\u00edn hills themselves a few remnants of the upper sandstones stand up like old fortresses on the highest summits.\n\n\"Over the area lying between the Korba coal basin and the plains of Bil\u00e1sipur there is no continuous high ground. Isolated ridges, mostly of inconsiderable elevation, and composed of the crystalline rocks, occur.\n\n\"In this region of the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed, as also in that of the God\u00e1var\u00ed drainage basin, the only knowledge we had of the structure of the country\n\n* It is questionable whether the term \"Vindhya\" should be applied south of the Narbad\u00e1.\nwas derived from the Reverend Mr. Hislop's exertions. He had, however, confounded rocks belonging to two distinct series between the deposition of which there had been an immense interval of time. The great plains of Chhattisgarh were coloured as belonging to the same series as the coal field of Korba. In reality, however, the rocks belong to that very much older series to which the general name of Vindhyan has been given. These cover an area of more than 12,000 square miles, limestone being the prevalent rock. On the north they abut against the crystalline rocks; on the west they pass under the Deccan traps; to the south-west stretch to an unknown (as yet) distance in the valley of the Mahanadi; to the south-east they rest upon crystalline rocks, and to the east they are crushed up with, and upon, similar rocks in a complicated manner. The more recent talcheer rocks are filled with debris from these, but nowhere was the actual contact or superposition visible.\"\n\nThe natural divisions of the country have had extended to them from a remote period different modes of detailed revenue management, corresponding in the main with their physical features. Thus, the hilly area, covering 5,800 square miles, is almost entirely held by large landed proprietors called zamindars, who have always occupied a somewhat independent position, while the open country, with an area of 3,000 square miles, is known as \"Khalsa\" jurisdiction, or the tract under direct revenue management through malguzars. All that is wild, picturesque, and beautiful in the district is contained in the former, but in the latter or \"khalsa\" area alone has population advanced, cultivation increased, and anything like material progress been attained. It is usually to the \"khalsa\" that reference is made when points arise in connection with the district, for the zamindaris generally are so inaccessible, so thinly peopled, and so backward that they count for comparatively little in ordinary administration.\n\nThese different tracts may now be briefly described. The \"Khalsa\" comprises three parganas, with a tahsil station at the head-quarters of each. The most westerly is the Mungeli pargana, the eastern boundary of which is the Maniari river. The central pargana is Bilaspur, lying in the main between the Maniari stream on the west and the Lilagar stream on the east, but comprising the tracts of Lormi and Balod\u00e1. Outside the limit of these streams is Seorinara\u00edn, the most easterly pargana, containing the tract of country lying east of the Lilagar stream. This arrangement of parganas is of modern origin, but it renders the jurisdiction of the sub-collectorates in every way convenient and compact. The old division was into talukas. In the margin is given a detail of the old talukas, indicating the manner in which they have been absorbed in the new parganas.\nThe kh\u00e1l\u015ba parganas are closely studded with villages, and, except at two or three points where kh\u00e1l\u015ba and zam\u00edn\u0111\u00e1ri areas adjoin, you may travel over the length and breadth of the entire tracts, encountering\u2014to employ a familiar metaphor\u2014no eminence higher than an ant-hill, and no forest tree bigger than a bramble bush. But although, as thus explained, the villages in kh\u00e1l\u015ba jurisdiction are numerous, and the cultivation extensive, it would be a mistake to suppose that the country presents a generally unbroken and continuous sheet of cultivation. The nature of the surface and soil alike prohibit this result. The whole plain is a series of undulations, sometimes a long stretch of sandy or stony upland, alternating gently with a long expanse of low-lying rice land; at others the alternations are more abrupt, the surface irregularly wavy, and ravines and beds of streams frequent and prominent. A Chhattisgarh village is not ordinarily an inviting object of inspection. A cluster of mud huts packed closely together, with no kind of order or arrangement, and intersected by narrow and circuitous paths which seem to have no proper commencement or end. In most cases \"distance lends enchantment to the view,\" for the best villages have then their baldness hidden by clusters and groves of trees of varied tint and hue, peeping from under which the most conspicuous objects are not always the thatched houses of the people, but the whitened spires or domes of two or three ancient temples. Speaking generally, however, the plain is singularly destitute of shade. Like all tracts where clearance has been going on, it has been cleared too much. In the Bil\u00e1sipur and Seorlhar\u00e1in parganas there are a fair number of villages possessing more or less extensive mango-groves, but in the Mungell pargana such villages are few, and there is consequently no part of the district which in the hot-weather months looks more bleak and desolate, or in which moving about is more trying and irksome.\n\nTurning to the Zam\u00edn\u0111\u00e1ri jurisdiction we find the surrounding circumstances entirely different, and see that in the wilder tracts man is making but feeble way against the forces of nature. The marginal entry shows in detail the zam\u00edn\u0111\u00e1ris of the district. In two instances alone\u2014Sakt\u00ed and Kaward\u00e1\u2014have the chiefs been acknowledged as feudatories.\n\nThe Pendr\u00e1 zam\u00edn\u0111\u00e1ri occupies the north-western corner of the district. It is entirely situated on the hilly uplands of the Vindhyan range, and presents a varied aspect of hill and dale. At one time is met a vast forest, the unvarying shade broken only here and there by seas of high-waving grass, and with no indication far and wide of human habitation; at another a cleared and open valley\n\n| Serial Number | Name of Chiefship | Jurisdiction |\n|---------------|------------------|--------------|\n| 1             | Pendr\u00e1           | Ordinary     |\n| 2             | M\u00e1tn\u00ed            | Do.          |\n| 3             | Upr\u00f3ra           | Do.          |\n| 4             | Kend\u00e1            | Do.          |\n| 5             | L\u00e1ph\u00e1            | Do.          |\n| 6             | Chh\u00far\u00ed           | Do.          |\n| 7             | Korb\u00e1            | Do.          |\n| 8             | Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1           | Do.          |\n| 9             | Sakt\u00ed            | Feudatory.   |\n| 10            | Bhatg\u00e1n          | Ordinary.    |\n| 11            | Bil\u00e1igerb        | Do.          |\n| 12            | Katang\u00ed          | Do.          |\n| 13            | Pandar\u00e1i         | Do.          |\n| 14            | Kaward\u00e1          | Feudatory.   |\n| 15            | Madanpdr         | Ordinary.    |\nis found, from which the jungle has disappeared and been replaced by thriving village communities. The M\u00e1t\u00edn estate lies east of Pendr\u00e1, and further east again is the Upror\u00e1 chiefship. These three adjoining zam\u00ednd\u00e1r\u00eds form together the extreme northern section of the Bil\u00e1sipur district. M\u00e1t\u00edn and Upror\u00e1, like Pendr\u00e1, are situated on the hilly uplands of the Vindhyan range, but, unlike Pendr\u00e1, they contain no open valleys which have been reclaimed and utilised. The majority of the villages that exist convey no impression of permanence, and are only solitary breaks in a vast mountain wilderness. This is perhaps the wildest part of country in Chhattisgarh, and here it is that the shattered forest trees, the broken and crushed bamboo clumps, the hollows and footprints in a hundred marshes and watercourses, indicate the presence of wild elephants. This fact realised, and the paucity of settlers ceases to surprise. The tale is often told how in a night the struggling tenant sees disappear the crop which has occupied the labour of months, and with no food left for himself and family, finds his only alternative is to seek, not figuratively, but literally, a new field for his exertions. Entire destruction of crop, however, is very unusual, for ordinarily the slightest enclosure acts as a protection. It may be said that the wild elephants are confined, as far as the Bil\u00e1sipur district is concerned, to these two chiefships. Occasionally a herd may roam into the adjoining zam\u00ednd\u00e1r\u00eds at that most unwelcome of all periods, when the rice crop is ripening, but from M\u00e1t\u00edn and Upror\u00e1, unless when hunted, they are never absent, and may be seen at any time on the wooded slopes of the Has\u00fa river, in the shady depths of the forest, or near some splashing waterfall, or deep still pool in the bed of a mountain torrent.\n\nAs the chiefship of Pendr\u00e1, M\u00e1t\u00edn, and Upror\u00e1 are in a line\u2014one estate lying east of the other\u2014so south of these, also in a line, lie the chiefships of Kend\u00e1, L\u00e9ph\u00e1, and Chh\u00far\u00ed. The most westerly of these is Kend\u00e1, lying south of Pendr\u00e1, then comes L\u00e9ph\u00e1 falling south of M\u00e1t\u00edn, and finally Chh\u00far\u00ed south of Upror\u00e1. These three zam\u00ednd\u00e1r\u00eds, though largely covered with hill and forest, have yet fair stretches of open country, and as at their southern extremity they abut on kh\u00e1lisa jurisdiction, their waste lands often come to be taken up by the discontented spirits of the plain. From the position of these six chiefships\u2014lying three abreast from east to west\u2014it is clear that from the north, viz. from the side of Rew\u00e1 and Mirzapur, there is no direct access to the open country of the Chhattisgarh plain without passing over several ranges of hills, and encountering difficulties and drawbacks of no ordinary character. A large portion of the eastern extremity of the district is monopolised by the Korb\u00e1 zam\u00ednd\u00e1r\u00ed, which is a very extensive chiefship. It lies to the east of Upror\u00e1, Chh\u00far\u00ed, and Kh\u00e1lisa jurisdiction, extending from the hills and fastnesses of the extreme north to the very heart of the level country. The northern section of the estate is very wild and inaccessible, and though the southern section has large tracts open and well cultivated, yet even here there is a great deal of forest, and frequent interruptions by low ranges of hills. Adjoining Korb\u00e1 to the south are the two small estates of Sakt\u00ed and Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1, which in the main consist of open country, and require no special remark. Leaving Sakt\u00ed and Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1 there is a stretch of kh\u00e1lisa jurisdiction up to the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed river, after crossing which there are, made up with some kh\u00e1lisa villages and government forests, which have been reserved, three small chiefships, viz. Bhatg\u00e1on, Bil\u00e1girah, and Katangi, comprising in each case a compact tract of level country with hills in the background, stretching from this point almost uninterruptedly to the wilds of Bastar. The western zam\u00ednd\u00e1r\u00eds alone remain for description, namely, Kaward\u00e1\nand Pandari\u00e1. They have each a large stretch of level country extending from the base of the Maikal range as far as the Mungeli pargana. This portion of the chiefships is generally open and cultivated. The area covered with hill and forest continues from the margin of the plain right into the mountainous tracts of B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t and Mandla, and thus on the western side, as on the north, these hill-ranges operate as an effectual barrier to easy communication with the Chhattisgarh plain. To complete the roll of zamindaris, it need only be added that the small and divided estate of Madanp\u00far adjoins Pandari\u00e1, and is mixed up with the kh\u00e1s\u00e1 villages of Mungeli. It is settled and cultivated, and possesses no special characteristics.\n\nThis detailed description of kh\u00e1s\u00e1 and zamind\u00e1r\u00ed jurisdiction remains incomplete without a reference to the government wastes. The most important section of these wastes stretches from the base of the Amarkantak range over a vast extent of hill and forest, comprising the tracts known as the Lamni, Lorni, Bijap\u00far, and Kor\u00ed jungles, down to the cultivated plain. All the hilly area lying between the Pandari\u00e1 zamind\u00e1r\u00ed on the west, the Kend\u00e1 zamind\u00e1r\u00ed on the east, the Pendr\u00e1 chiefship on the north, and the open kh\u00e1s\u00e1 lands of the south, constitute a separate government waste at the future disposal of the district authorities. Running east from this point, and skirting the zamind\u00e1r\u00eds of Kend\u00e1, L\u00e1ph\u00e1, and Korb\u00e1, excess wastes have been separated, but these ordinarily are very limited. The most extensive tract is the Bitkuli waste, which contains much valuable timber and extensive resources in bamboos and grass. Independent of these main tracts there are isolated patches, here and there in the plain which, having been entirely cleared of timber, are only useful for grazing purposes. Across the Mah\u00e1nadi, however, there is a large tract of government forest called Son\u00e1kh\u00e1n, the deserted and confiscated estate of a former zamind\u00e1r, 16,000 acres of which have been purchased by an English gentleman under the waste-land rules. Adjoining this tract is the forest department teak-reserve of H\u00e1thb\u00e1ri, and the unreserved wastes of Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00ed. Such, concisely, is the position of the government wastes in the district.\n\nThe traffic routes of the district are five in number, the three most important of which are rugged and inaccessible, quite unfit for wheeled carriage, and only admitting of export or import by means of pack-bullocks during six months of the year. There are the two northern routes, one leading from the Chhattisgarh plain through Kend\u00e1, Pendr\u00e1, and Soh\u00e1gp\u00far to Rew\u00e1, the other through L\u00e1ph\u00e1, Chh\u00fari, Upr\u00f3\u00e1, and Sirgu\u00e1ja to Mirz\u00e1p\u00far. Both these routes are, through a great portion of their length, simply tracks across the hills and through the jungles, along which few traders or travellers would venture alone. They proceed through so difficult a country (part of which is in foreign territory), and extend over so great a distance, that there seems little prospect of much ever being done to open communications in this quarter. The necessity too is not pressing now that, owing to the opening of the Railway from Jabalp\u00far, the trade will tend westward. The construction of a line of road from the plains of Chhattisgarh, through Mandla, to Jabalp\u00far, is the most urgent want of this district, and until this is undertaken as an imperial work, to act as a feeder to the railway, the tract of country here must continue in a comparatively backward and undeveloped condition. At present the line followed by Banj\u00e1ras resembles the northern routes\u2014a circuitous track over hills and valleys intersected by numerous streams, the rocky beds of which present most formidable obstacles.\nThis hilly and difficult country extends over a distance of about one hundred miles, and even if, without being metalled, it were made throughout its length a good cold-weather road, with the gh\u00e1ts properly sloped, and the small streams bridged so as to admit of cart traffic, an outlet would be afforded for the surplus produce of this district, and a great impulse given to its prosperity.\n\nThe whole drainage and river system of the district centres in the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed. The general flow of the streams is from the northern and western hills south and eastwards. These hills, however, constitute a distinct watershed, and are the source of streams which, flowing north and west, and leaving the Chhattisgarh country behind them, gradually gather volume, and assume in their onward course the dignity of rivers. Such are the Son, which first sees the light in a marshy hollow in Pendr\u00e1, and the Narb\u00e1d\u00e1, rushing picturesquely over the rocky heights of Amarkantak. The Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed enters the Bil\u00e1sp\u00far boundary eight miles west of Seor\u00ednar\u00e1n, and as it only flows for twenty-five miles at the south-eastern extremity of the district, it has not much local importance. It is navigable for six months from Seor\u00ednar\u00e1n to the coast, but the frequency of rocky barriers renders the navigation by no means an easy task. In this district, however, there are no barriers, the bed being open and sandy, and banks usually low, bare, and unattractive. In the rains the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed is a magnificent river, attaining in places a breadth of two miles, and during sudden floods a vast volume of water often submerging the low-lying land in its vicinity, and presenting the appearance of a large inland sea. The contrast, however, between the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed in September and the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed in May is something astounding. In the hot-weather months it is nothing more than a narrow and shallow channel in a vast expanse of sand, and is then almost at any point forded with ease. The affluents of the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed partake of its general character, being proportionately mighty and formidable in the monsoon months, and comparatively insignificant during the hot season. The most important of its affluents are the Seon\u00e1th and Hasd\u00fa.\n\nThe minor streams are the Sakr\u00ed, the H\u00e1mp, the Tesu\u00e1, the A'gar, the Mani\u00e1ri, the Arp\u00e1, the Kharod, the Lil\u00e1g\u00e1r, the Jonk, and the Baref.\n\nIn the margin are tables showing the average rainfall and the temperature in each month for some years. As a rule the rains are fairly regular and copious, and drought rarely occurs. The climate, though inveighed against and dreaded by strangers, is not specially unhealthy. Cholera and fever are the great scourges of the plain, so much so as almost to assume an endemic character. But as regards cholera there have been special local and removeable causes acting as aggravating agents, among the chief of which may be mentioned the fact that the pilgrim route to Jagann\u00e1th passed through the plain, and was crowded during the hot-weather months with a throng of weary and exhausted devotees, among whom the\n\n* This will now be undertaken.\ndisease almost invariably broke out, and was disseminated over the whole country. This passage of pilgrims has for two years been prohibited with the best results, there having been during this period no outbreak at all. Then fever, though very prevalent, does not seem of a worse type than that common to almost all parts of the province, and until some kind of reliable mortuary statistics are matured, and have exhibited comparative results for a series of years, it is quite an open question whether the Chhatt\u00edsgarh fever is more than ordinarily fatal. Small-pox prevails about the end of the cold weather months, but not to an extent greater than elsewhere. It must be acknowledged, however, that each season seems to possess its prevailing type of disease. In the hot weather we have generally cholera, though its outbreak at this time seems to be connected, as noted, with the passage of pilgrims, now interdicted. In the close of the cold-weather months small-pox. The climate itself, though relaxing, is not oppressive. From the middle of April till the middle of June hot winds prevail, and the heat is at times very trying. Still it is mild compared with the Upper Provinces, and showers, which are not unusual even at this period, supply a cool day now and again, while the nights, as a rule, are very bearable. After the first heavy fall of the monsoon the climate is cool and agreeable, and pankh\u00e1s can often be dispensed with entirely. There are comparatively few close, muggy, windless days, and the few that are experienced are soon forgotten from the welcome deluge of showers which is sure to succeed them. The cold weather is not bracing, but altogether from November to February is a very pleasant period.\n\nThe towns in the district containing more than 5,000 inhabitants are Ratanp\u00far, Bil\u00e1sp\u00far, and Kaward\u00e1. The names of the small townships, or rather large villages, are given in the margin. By the last census Ratanp\u00far contained 6,190 inhabitants.\n\n### Table of Temperature\n\n| Months | 1864 | 1865 | 1866 | 1867 |\n|--------|------|------|------|------|\n|        | Highest maximum in shade | Lowest maximum | Highest maximum in shade | Lowest maximum | Highest maximum in shade | Lowest maximum |\n| January | 98   | 38   | 97   | 45   | 98   | 37   | 92   | 45   |\n| February | 98   | 45   | 85   | 59   | 99   | 39   | 103  | 51   |\n| March   | 100  | 55   | 105  | 59   | 103  | 62   | 101  | 62   |\n| April   | 120  | 65   | 110  | 60   | 106  | 63   | 101  | 62   |\n| May     | 107  | 65   | 115  | 72   | 116  | 64   | 110  | 72   |\n| June    | 105  | 76   | 101  | 66   | 116  | 75   | 103  | 76   |\n| July    | 96   | 73   | 100  | 69   | 110  | 73   | 99   | 70   |\n| August  | 105  | 74   | 100  | 70   | 99   | 72   | 99   | 68   |\n| September | 100 | 72   | 101  | 67   | 96   | 74   | 100  | 76   |\n| October | 96   | 60   | 96   | 65   | 98   | 59   | 94   | 67   |\n| November | 88   | 49   | 91   | 40   | 98   | 51   | 89   | 61   |\n| December | 95   | 46   | 89   | 38   | 94   | 41   | 88   | 55   |\n\nNote.\u20141868 was an exceptional year, and is therefore not quoted.\nBilaspur 6,110, and Kaward\u00e1 over 5,000. The whole history of the plateau centres as it were in Ratanpur.\n\nThe marked absence of towns soon strikes a visitor to Chhatt\u00edsgarh, and is the more singular that the entire plain is covered with hamlets. It arises from the fact that the people are a simple agricultural community, requiring few of the luxuries which have become necessities in more advanced localities. The tract too possesses but little amassed wealth, having lain for so long a period distant and remote from all the regular channels of trade. All the demands of the people are fully satisfied by the weekly markets, which are very numerous all over the district. There are, however, no less than 170 regular markets, some few of which are held twice a week. The largest baz\u00e1srs are those of B\u00e1mind\u00ed in the Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1 z\u00e1mind\u00e1ri, Gani\u00e1ri and Takhtp\u00far in the Bilaspur pargana, and Mungeli in the Mungeli pargana. These are well known markets at which cattle are largely sold, and are frequented every week by thousands of purchasers, the articles exposed for sale being usually of greater variety than is found at smaller gatherings. The display on the whole at these baz\u00e1srs to an English taste does not seem very inviting; more, however, with reference to the mode of its arrangement and exhibition than actually as regards the articles themselves. There is grain of every description; sweetmeats, fish, fruits, vegetables, glass bangles, and other adornments; baskets, and mat-work; embroidery, spices, sugar, cocoanuts, metal drinking-vessels, and plates; iron, and large supplies of cloth, both of English and Native manufacture. The market is sometimes held in a convenient mango-grove, which affords pleasant shelter and shade to all comers, but more usually in some open space near the village, affording neither shelter nor shade, and consequently both in the hot weather and monsoon many of these baz\u00e1srs are but scantily attended. It is strange that cowries should still be found almost the sole medium of exchange among the great bulk of the people; but, that they are so, is clearly observable on all market days, when it will be noticed that nearly everything purchased is paid for, not in copper, but in cowries. There is no question, however, that while most commodities remain cheap, cowries form a convenient unit for satisfying the petty requirements of the poorer classes, and render them somewhat reluctant to adopt copper, the unit in which does not reach so low.\n\nThe temples in the district are very numerous, verifying local tradition as to the great antiquity of the ancient Hind\u00fa government. They are almost invariably large stone structures, either in the shape of an obelisk or a dome, with a long pillared portico in front of the doorway. The carved images are generally very rude, and if here and there a graceful figure or outline is traced, the whole effect is ruined by the immediate proximity of another figure either grotesque or hideous. The names of the most ancient and noted temples are given in the margin. Most of these are at least from eight hundred to one thousand years old, and are devoted to the service of the different Hind\u00fa deities.

The inscription sets forth that one of the Haihai Bans\u00ed r\u00e1j\u00e1s of Ratanp\u00far tried to prevent its construction, but was repulsed. It is built of large blocks of stone closely set, but without lime cement, and is picturesquely situated on the banks of a tank. The only image it contains is that of a cobra, which in itself points to a very early period, when fetichism in the form of snake-worship was at least common, if not universal, and certainly before Hind\u00faism held complete sway. The P\u00e1l\u00ed temple is the best specimen of ancient native architecture in the district, and is therefore the only one that need be described in detail. It is to be regretted that timely care has not preserved the original structure intact, for, judging from the portion still uninjured, the entire building must have been elaborately and tastefully finished, and is eminently deserving of preservation. Outside there is a dilapidated desolate air, owing to the slabs and other debris of the temple, which are scattered everywhere, telling their tale of desertion and decay. What now remains is a large octagonal dome, acting as a portico to an inner building formerly dedicated to the service of Mah\u00e1deva. As you enter the dome you are at once struck with the minute and elaborate carvings which extend from the floor to the very summit of the building. The dome is supported by pillars, on all of which are images of mythological characters famous in Hind\u00fa legend and song. Above these pillars the lower circle of the dome is a series of minute figures, often chiselled into the most fantastic shapes, the figures running one into another in happy confusion. From this lower circle of petty and fantastic figures to the top of the dome is on all sides a continued line of tasteful carving. The most elaborate workmanship, however, is found at the entrance door to the inner building. Much of the carving here is so minute and so exquisitely executed, that the eye seems ever discovering new beauties. The portals are guarded by two imposing figures, which, in form and proportion, are fair specimens of native art. Above the doorway is much careful chiselling, as of cabinet work, while the panels have carvings of flowers modelled with great care and skill. All round the doorway is a mass of carving almost oppressive from its extent and continuousness\u2014dwarf figures in every variety of attitude; animals, amongst which the sacred bull stands prominent; birds represented by the pigeon and goose,\u2014the whole work a fitting monument to the taste and ingenuity of the sculptor, whose name tradition has not condescended to hand down. This P\u00e1l\u00ed temple is said to have been built by J\u00e1jal Deva, r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Ratanp\u00far, in the tenth century, and from the nature of many of its carvings, as also the name P\u00e1l\u00ed, is not improbably of Buddhist origin, subsequently modified by the Hind\u00fas.\n\nOf the forts in the district the two principal\u2014Ratanp\u00far and L\u00e1ph\u00e1\u2014have already been alluded to. They are the most ancient and the most imposing structures. The great majority of the minor forts consist simply of a high earth embankment surrounded by a ditch, supplying a ready protection at a time when the country was overrun by bands of robbers, who plundered the people. In these peaceful days, when men's swords are turned into plough-shares, these formidable enclosures are no longer tended, and show rents and gaps indicating, happily, the desuetude into which they have fallen. There is some stirring legend associated with each fort, which the village bard recites at times to an admiring audience, belauding perhaps the ancestor of some landholder who is present, or else verifying the omnipotent character of some local god. The grand want, which these forts now supply, is a certain amount of irrigation from their deep ditches.\nfor the sugarcane crop, so that, when situated between two villages, a dispute\nthe settlement department had often to settle was the quantity of water fairly\napportionable to each.\n\nOne prominent feature remains to be alluded to, and that is the great\nnumber of tanks found scattered all over the\ndistrict. All but newly-established and small\nvillages have at least one tank; large villages have five or six, and Ratanp\u00far\nhas; within its boundaries, one hundred and fifty. The settlement statistics\nshow a total of 7,018 tanks, and although these include, under the name of\ntanks, reservoirs of a very petty kind, yet an adequate idea may be formed\nfrom these figures of the extent to which tanks have been constructed. There\nis perhaps no more sacred duty, in the eyes of a comfortable landholder than to\ndevote his surplus to the digging of a tank. Then follows the ceremony of\nmarriage, when the Br\u00e1hmans are fed, and a great high pole is placed in the\ncentre; and this completed, the high embankment is fringed with mango trees.\nThere are very many remarkably picturesque tanks thus lined with shade, but\nnone containing a large sheet of water. In fact tanks of extravagant dimen-\nsions were beyond the means of the people, and the two largest\u2014R\u00e1n\u00ed Tal\u00e1o,\nof Ratanp\u00far, and the tank of J\u00e1njgir\u2014are not really of any note, except by\ncomparison with others in their vicinity. The prevalence of tanks has placed\nwells at a discount, and until within the last three years they were in the\ninterior absolutely unknown. Local effort, however, having been unremitting in\npromoting their construction, there are now several hundred wells, but so\ninveterate are the proclivities engendered by habit, that though demonstrably the\nwell-water is purer, the people stick to their tanks, and declare that, though the\nwater may be muddy from the wallowing of cattle, it is, all the same, sweet\nand palatable.\n\nThe annals of Bil\u00e1sp\u00far go back to a very early age, and are connected\nwith the history of the Haihai Bans\u00ed kings of\nMandla, L\u00e1nj\u00ed, and Ratanp\u00far. The earliest\nrecorded prince of the Ratanp\u00far or Chhatt\u00edsgarh\nline was M\u00farta Dhvaja, whose fabled adventures with Krishna are related in\nthe Jaimini Pur\u00e1na (Jaiminiya Aswamedha). The story runs that Krishna,\ndisguised as a Br\u00e1hman, asked half of M\u00farta Dhvaja\u2019s body to test his faith.\nM\u00farta Dhvaja consented to be sawn in two; but when the operation was com-\nmencing, Krishna revealed himself, and showered blessings on the head of the\ndevout prince. It is said that, in consequence, the use of the saw was entirely\nprohibited in the Chhatt\u00edsgarh country, and was only reintroduced under Mar\u00e1th\u00e1\nrule. It would appear then that from the very earliest period of ascertainable\nhistory until the advent of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s in the eighteenth century this Haihai\nBans\u00ed dynasty ruled over Chhatt\u00edsgarh. The traces of their rule are found in\ntanks and temples scattered over the country, in the ruins of many edifices at\ntheir capital, Ratanp\u00far, and in all the traditions of the people. But unfortunately\nno local annals exist of these princes, from which could be compiled anything\nlike a detailed history. The only sources of knowledge on the subject are to be\nfound in disconnected old documents, many of them worn and tattered, in the\npossession of Rew\u00e1 R\u00e1m K\u00e1yath and Durg\u00e1 Datt Sh\u00e1str\u00ed, the descendants, re-\nspectively, of a former diw\u00e1n and priest of the family, and also in various Sanskrit\ninscriptions, which have been written on tablets from time to time in different\ntemples. The information thus obtained, though meagre and incomplete, has\nbeen thrown into a narrative form as continuous as the materials available\nadmitted.\nThe Chhattisgarh r\u00e1j\u00e1s ruled originally over thirty-six forts, and thus the tract came to be called Chhattisgarh, or the country of thirty-six forts. The thirty-six forts were as follows, and are arranged with reference to the subsequent distribution, rendering them subordinate to the senior and junior branches of the family, ruling respectively at Ratanp\u00far and R\u00e1ip\u00far:\n\n1.

To the original divisions additions were made by conquest, so that in Kaly\u00e1n Sah\u00ed's time a detail is given in his papers of forty-eight forts. As regards the eighteen old Ratanp\u00far divisions, compared with the present district of Bil\u00e1sp\u00far, it may be noted that the first eleven are, and have been ever since Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 rule, kh\u00e1lsa jurisdiction; the following seven were, and are still zam\u00edn\u00e1rd\u00eds; while the eighteenth division, adjoining the Pendr\u00e1 chiefship above the gh\u00e1ts, appears to have been made over to Rew\u00e1, as a marriage dowry to his daughter, by R\u00e9j\u00e1 D\u00e1d\u00fa R\u00e9j about A.D. 1480. Of other tracts now included in Bil\u00e1sp\u00far it would seem that Pandari\u00e1 and Kaward\u00e1, on the west, were wrested from the Gond dynasty of Mandla. Korb\u00e1 was taken from Sirg\u00faja by Bahirsah\u00ed R\u00e9j\u00e1 about the year A.D. 1520, and the small zam\u00edn\u00e1rd\u00ed of Bil\u00e1igahr, &c., south of the Mah\u00e1n\u00e1di, together with the kh\u00e1lsa tract of Kikard\u00e1 on the east, from Sambalp\u00far, by R\u00e9j\u00e1 Lachhman Sah\u00ed about the year 1580. This sufficiently explains the present, as compared with the past position of the Ratanp\u00far half of the Chhattisgarh country.\n\nIn the margin is given a list of the r\u00e1j\u00e1s of the Haihai Bans\u00ed line who are supposed to have reigned at Ratanp\u00far. There are many copies of this list extant, but the\noldest that has been seen seems to have been written in the sixteenth century in the time of Kaly\u00e1n Sah\u00ed. Palpably the detail is too complete to be reliable, but it can safely be asserted that the list is based on fact; that it contains the genealogical tree, cherished as an heirloom by the family themselves, and that where external evidence, such as temple tablets, have been available to verify its entries, these have fairly stood the test both as to dates and names.

This gives the following list:\n   - Prithv\u00eddeva.\n   - J\u00e1jalvalyadeva (his son).\n   - A distant relation (no name given) = Somali\u00e1dev\u00ed.\n\nRatnad\u00e9va.\n\nRatnad\u00e9va (his grand-nephew) Samvat 1041 = 984 A.D.\n\n(2) Ratanp\u00far inscription.\u2014Bengal Asiatic Society\u2019s Journal for 1863, p. 277, gives the following list:\n   - J\u00e1jaladeva.\n   - Ratnad\u00e9va.\n\nPrithv\u00eddeva\u2014who, by computation from the date given for the descendant of his contemporary, in the family whom the inscription commemorates, may have reigned about A.D. 950.\n\nN.B.\u2014Other inscriptions and lists show that this last prince was also called Bir Sinhadeva.\n\n(3) The Ratanp\u00far inscription (mentioned in Asiatic Researches, vol. xv. p. 501) is said to give nine kings, but the inscription cannot at present be traced, and the only king mentioned in\nreferences to the dynasty are given are those at Amarkantak, Ratnapur, Kosgai, Malhar, and Seoramaran. Of course in the earlier years, where we should have expected to find several blanks and find none, we may plausibly presume that the Brahmins have been at work, and have successfully supplied each hiatus with a lucky name, in order to establish in favour of the rajas an unbroken lunar origin; but as we come to more recent times, the detail may be accepted as historically accurate, and altogether the list itself is not devoid of local interest.\n\nIt is in connection with the earlier rajas that the very vaguest traditions exist. Allusion has already been made to Muradhvaja and Tamradhvaja. The Lapha fort already mentioned, the ruins of which show it to have been a formidable work, is said to have been built by Muradhvaja in the early days of Rajput ascendancy. Then tradition assigns the credit of having first established a town at Amarkantak to Chandradhvaja, while the fort of Ajmirgarh, on the hill of that name near Amarkantak, where a partially filled tank and the debris of former buildings are still objects of interest, is attributed to Mohan Pala. Again, the tenth raja, Karnapal, and the seventeenth raja, Bhimdeva, have each a large tank bearing their names, viz. at Ratnapur and a village called Janjgir. These tanks they are said to have excavated, and to have constructed the masonry ghats, the ruins of which alone remain.\n\nIt was on the accession of the twentieth raja, Surdeva, about A.D. 749, that the Chhattisgarh country was divided into two sections. Surdeva remained at Ratnapur and governed the northern section, while his younger brother Brahmadeva moved to Rajpur and ruled the southern section. From this time there continued permanently the rule of two separate rajas in Chhattisgarh; for although after nine generations the direct line from Brahmadeva became extinct, a younger son from the Ratnapur house again proceeded to Rajpur, namely, Devanath Singh, the son of Raja Jagannath Sinhadeva, about the year A.D. 1360, and his issue continued in uninterrupted possession till the arrival of the Marathas. This division of the jurisdiction under the sway of the Hailhai Bansis did not affect the absolute supremacy of the senior branch of the family, which remained at Ratnapur, with whom the final authority still remained, and round whom all the traditional associations centred.\n\nthe Asiatic Researches is Prithvideva, the sixth of the line. The ninth king is shown by the inscription to have reigned in 915. If this be the Saka era his date would be A.D. 993.\n\n(4) The Rajim inscription (Asiatic Researches, vol. xv. p. 512) is much defaced, but apparently records the subjugation of a king, Ratnadeva, and the marriage of Jagat Pala, a foreign conqueror, to the daughter of Prithvideva, by which he acquired the fort of Durga (Drug). The date of Jagat Pala may be either Samvat 796 or 896, and if the king referred to is the first Prithvideva, the Saka era would agree more nearly, with the other dates adopted, than the Vikramaditya Samvat. The second Ratnadeva appears from the above inscriptions to have reigned in the last quarter of the tenth century. But the first Ratnadeva, as we know from the Amarkantak inscription, was his grand-uncle, and the first Prithvideva, was two generations anterior to him (Ratnadeva I.), so that as Jagat Pala was probably the contemporary either of Prithvideva I. or Javalyadeva, his date may be taken as 796 Saka, which + 78 = 874 A.D., which would correspond fairly with the dates computed for Bir Sinhadeva and Ratna Sinhadeva. But there are so many transcripts of inscriptions and so few actual inscriptions extant, or at least now to be found, that the list of kings prior to the sixteenth century can only be regarded as approximately correct.\u2014[Ed.]\nThe son of Surdeva above referred to was Prithv\u012bdeva. He seems to have reigned towards the end of the ninth century. As local tradition is full of his deeds, we may conclude that his rule was a successful and prosperous one. He built the old fort of Ratanpur and the palace, both of which are now in ruins. The Mah\u0101m\u0101 temple\u2014the most ancient building of the kind in Ratanpur\u2014was originally erected by Prithv\u012bdeva, though subsequently renewed seven centuries later by Bahirsah\u012b.\n\nIn the sculptured tablets of Malhar and Amarkantak, the virtues of this r\u0101j\u0101 are sung in all the rhythmic sweetness of Sanskrit verse: thus, he was brave and skilful in battle; a terror to his enemies; a friend to his people; generous to the learned, and himself fond of learning. But beyond this we get little information of any kind.\n\nFollowing Prithv\u012bdeva there are four r\u0101j\u0101s, Brahmadeva, Rudradeva,* J\u00e1jaldeva, and Ratnadeva, whose names are recorded in different temple-slabs as having attained great honour, and who are represented as having discharged in an exemplary manner their duty by their subjects. It would be occupying useless space to give a detail of the tanks and temples attributed to these princes, as none of them are of a sufficiently marked character to necessitate description. Of their mode of government no mention is made in any record, and all through there is a similar silence for some five centuries until we come to the forty-third r\u0101j\u0101, Bahirsah\u012b. He built the fort of Kosg\u0101l, in the Chh\u016br\u012b zam\u012bnd\u0101r\u012b, about the year A.D. 1520, from the tablet in which it would seem that there was during this reign a Mohammadan irruption from the north, which the r\u0101j\u0101 successfully resisted, driving back the invaders. As general history, however, does not show that any Mohammadan army ever visited this part of the country, the Pathans, whom Bahirsah\u012b defeated, must have been a small force under some needy adventurer in search of plunder.\n\nIt is not till the reign of Kaly\u0101n Sah\u012b that the overpowering influence of Mohammadan sovereignty extended into a region so land-locked and isolated as Chhattisgarh. Kaly\u0101n Sah\u012b seems to have reigned between the years A.D. 1536 and 1573. The annual crowd of pilgrims who flocked from the Upper Provinces through Ratanpur to Jagann\u0101th must often have related in glowing language the pomp and splendour of the Moghal court of Delhi. Whether excited by curiosity, or impelled by fear lest his kingdom should be absorbed, it is impossible to decide, but Kaly\u0101n Sah\u012b determined on proceeding to Delhi and having audience of the great Akbar. He made over the management of his country to his son Lachman Sah\u012b, and, accompanied by a large body of followers, proceeded on his mission. He is represented as having been absent eight years, and then returning to Ratanpur laden with honours, having been invested with the full rights of r\u0101j\u0101 and a high-sounding title.\n\nOne of the revenue books of the Kaly\u0101n Sah\u012b period is still extant, and contains much interesting information on the condition of Chhattisgarh some three centuries ago. It is much to be regretted that more books of this kind do not exist, for from a careful comparison of different periods we should have been able to form some idea of the gradual changes which have occurred. It would seem that the\n\n* Rudradeva seems to have been merely a regent\u2014[Ed.]\nRatanp\u00far government, at the time indicated, including R\u00e1jp\u00far, comprised forty-eight \"garhs\" or talukas, yielding a revenue of 6\u00bd l\u00f3khs of rupees, and, including \"s\u00e1yar,\" or transit dues, nine l\u00f3khs of rupees, which, considering the relative value of money in those early days, and now, indicates a large share of prosperity. The jurisdiction of Kaly\u00e1n Sah\u00ed, from the details given, extended over the whole of the country now known as Chhatt\u00edsgarh, with the exception of Kaward\u00e1, Khair\u00e1garh, and the other zamind\u00e1ris skirting the western hills, which are not mentioned, and evidently must at the time have belonged to the Gond dynasty of Mandla. But in addition to the present limits of Chhatt\u00edsgarh it would seem to have included Kori\u00e1, Sirg\u00faja, and other parts of the Chot\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur division, with R\u00e1mgarh, now included in Mandla, and L\u00e1nj\u00ed of B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t. The r\u00e1j\u00e1s named in the margin are noted as subordinates, or rather as feudatories of the Haihai Bans\u00ed house, which, there seems no doubt, exercised paramount authority for a long series of years over this thinly-populated, but extensive eastern tract of the present Central Provinces.\n\nThe army maintained by Kaly\u00e1n Sah\u00ed was not of a formidable character. The following is a detail of its strength:\n\n- 2,000 swordsmen.\n- 5,000 daggermen.\n- 3,600 matchlockmen.\n- 2,600 archers.\n- 1,000 saw\u00e1rs.\n\nTotal...14,200 men.\n\nThere would seem also to have been maintained an establishment of 116 elephants. Such a force was fully adequate for the maintenance of internal order, and considerably greater than could be brought together by any of the surrounding chiefs. As for external enemies, the difficulties of approach, and the comparative remoteness and poverty of the country, made an invasion in earlier years by no means an inviting prospect, and subsequently Kaly\u00e1n Sah\u00ed's shrewdness in proceeding to Delhi, and his acknowledgment by the Emperor Akbar, tended to prolong for years the rule of his dynasty.\n\nOn the death of Kaly\u00e1n Sah\u00ed his son Lachhman Sah\u00ed succeeded, but there is nothing of a recordable character to be noted in connection with his rule. The same may be said of his successors for several generations until we come to Takht Singh who was r\u00e1j\u00e1 between A.D. 1675 and 1689. He built a rude palace at Takhtp\u00far, now in ruins, and a temple, and instituted the weekly market there, which is still an important gathering. R\u00e9j Singh, his son, ruled from A.D. 1689 to 1712, and built a new palace at the eastern limit of Ratanp\u00far, one of the two-storied walls of which now alone remains. He also excavated a large tank in front of this palace, which he ornamented with masonry steps, and a portion of which was enclosed by walls for the convenience of the ladies of the household. The part of Ratanp\u00far, above alluded to is still called \"R\u00e1jp\u00far,\" and the tank \"R\u00e1nk\u00e1 Tal\u00e1o.\" The tank after the rains is a fine sheet of water, well worthy a visit, but the ruins themselves are not of an interesting character.\nR\u00e1j Singh had been married some years and had no offspring. His nearest heir was his grand-uncle Sard\u00e1r Singh, son of Ranjit Singh, but R\u00e1j Singh had no wish that he (Sard\u00e1r Singh) should succeed him, and so he took counsel of his Br\u00e1hman diw\u00e1n, a hereditary servant of the family. After much and frequent discussion the sacred books were appealed to as authorising a special procedure under special circumstances, and it was finally resolved that a Br\u00e1hman, selected by the diw\u00e1n, should visit the favourite R\u00e1n\u00ed. In due time a son was born, who was named Bishn\u00e1th Singh, and the popular rejoicings knew no bounds. Immediately Bishn\u00e1th Singh grew up he was married to a daughter of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Rew\u00e1, intermarriages being frequent between the Rew\u00e1 and Haihai Bans\u00ed families. Some time after the marriage festivities were over the young couple were one day playing together a game of chance. In the course of their play Bishn\u00e1th Singh took several questionable advantages over his fair opponent, and sorely tried her temper by defeating her game after game. At last she made the discovery that the play on his part had been false, and is represented as rising and saying, half in jest and half in scorn, \"Of course I should expect to be overreached, for are you not a Br\u00e1hman and no R\u00e1jput?\" Taunted thus with his birth, of which he had already heard whispers, he went out and stabbed himself.\n\nNo sooner was R\u00e1j Singh informed of what had happened than he resolved to have revenge on his diw\u00e1n, through whose imprudence, or worse, the shame of his house had been circulated abroad. The \"D\u00edw\u00e1n P\u00e1r\u00e1,\" or in English phraseology \"Minister Square,\" of Rat\u00e1npur was at the time in question an imposing part of the town. Here lived the diw\u00e1n, and congregated round him were a crowd of relations, who, however distantly connected, had in eastern fashion come together near the fortunate representative of the family. The r\u00e1j\u00e1 blew down with his guns the whole of this part of the town, and involved in one common disaster every member of the small community, numbering, it is said, over four hundred men, women, and children. At the same time were destroyed most of the papers and records appertaining to the dynasty, which would have been so useful in later days.\n\nSubsequent to these transactions it was generally understood that Mohan Singh, of the R\u00e1jp\u00far house, had been selected by R\u00e1j Singh, as his successor. Mohan Singh is represented as a young man of much physical strength and considerable personal attractions. He frequently remained for months with R\u00e1j Singh, who openly exhibited the greatest attachment for the young man. The death of R\u00e1j Singh, however, was somewhat sudden, and circumstances prevented his carrying out whatever wishes he may have entertained regarding Mohan Singh. A fall from his horse was the immediate cause of his death. He sent for Mohan Singh and also for his two grand-nieces, Sard\u00e1r Singh and Raghun\u00e1th Singh. There was some delay in Mohan Singh's arrival, as he was absent at the time on a shooting expedition. Meanwhile the r\u00e1j\u00e1 was sinking fast, so he took the \"pagr\u00ed\" and put it on the head of Sard\u00e1r Singh, thus acknowledging him as his successor. In a few days Mohan Singh arrived, and found Sard\u00e1r Singh duly installed. He was greatly enraged at being thus superseded, and in leaving said that he would yet return and assume the government. Sard\u00e1r Singh, however, ruled quietly for twenty years, and having no son, was succeeded in A.D. 1732 by his brother Raghun\u00e1th Singh, a man already over sixty, and quite unable to\nencounter with a bold front the trials and difficulties which were shortly to overtake his country.\n\nAt the close of 1740, when Raghun\u00e1th Singh had been some three years on the throne, occurred the invasion of Chhattisgarh by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 general Bh\u00e1skar Pant. At this time Raghun\u00e1th Singh was bowed down with a heavy sorrow. He had lost his only son, and had ceased for nearly a year to take any interest in his government. A feeble man at best, but now worn out with years and afflicted in mind, he made no effort to defend his \"r\u00e1j,\" but waited in the calmness of despair till Bh\u00e1skar Pant had reached his capital. Even then there was no attempt at resistance. Bh\u00e1skar Pant brought his guns to play on the fort, and a part of the palace was soon in ruins. At this juncture one of the R\u00e1n\u00eds mounted the parapet and exhibited a flag of truce. The gates were then opened, and the invading army entered and took possession. In this inglorious manner ended the rule of the Haihai Bans\u00ed dynasty, which, from a period lost in the hazy mists of tradition, had governed Chhattisgarh, and now at the very first summons, and without a struggle, yielded up its heritage. No struggle, however bitter, could have altered results, but history almost requires that the last of a long line of r\u00e1j\u00e1s should die sword in hand defending his country, and leave in the memory of posterity a noble example of patriotism and courage. If, at the time, the whole resources of Chhattisgarh and Sambalp\u00far had been exercised by one central authority, the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s might have encountered a really formidable opposition. But as it was, there was no central authority possessing any vigour, and the Haihai Bans\u00eds merely stood at the head of a number of petty r\u00e1j\u00e1s and chiefs, each of whom was to a large extent independent, and among whom the whole country was divided. It was an essentially weak system, adapted for a peaceful state of society alone, and must have fallen long previously had any well-organised foreign invasion ever been attempted. When the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s came, they marched through the whole country without any opposition, and having substituted their own authority for that of the Haihai Bans\u00ed r\u00e1j\u00e1s, they demanded, and obtained, the allegiance of all the surrounding states.\n\nBh\u00e1skar Pant, having reduced Ratanp\u00far, left a small garrison in it and marched for Cuttack. A fine of a lakh of rupees is mentioned as having been imposed on the town, and all that remained in the treasury was appropriated. The army is said to have consisted of 40,000 men, chiefly horse, who pillaged the country in all directions. No violence, however, was done to Raghun\u00e1th Singh, who in fact was permitted to carry on the government in the name of the Bhonsl\u00e1.\n\nPrevious mention has been made of Mohan Singh, who left Ratanp\u00far disgusted, when, in A.D. 1712, Sard\u00e1r Singh succeeded R\u00e1j Singh, and threatened to return and assume the government. His efforts to raise a party in his favour, strong enough to create a local revolution, proving fruitless, he left for N\u00e1gp\u00far and finally joined Raghoj\u00ed. He became a favourite with this prince, was made a Bhonsl\u00e1, and accompanied Raghoj\u00ed in his expedition against Bengal. In A.D. 1745, when Raghoj\u00ed returned from Bengal, he crossed from Rew\u00e1 to Ratanp\u00far, and finding that Raghun\u00e1th Singh, the late r\u00e1j\u00e1, whom his general, Bh\u00e1skar Pant, had maintained in authority in Chhattisgarh, was dead, he installed Mohan Singh as r\u00e1j\u00e1, and then proceeded with his army through Chhattisgarh to\nN\u00e1gp\u00far. Mohan Singh seems to have ruled in Chhatt\u00edsgarh till A.D. 1758, when, after the death of R\u00e1ghoj\u00ed, his younger son Bimb\u00e1j\u00ed had the Chhatt\u00edsgarh country made over to him. No sooner did this intelligence reach Mohan Singh than he prepared to oppose Bimb\u00e1j\u00ed\u2019s progress. He was taken suddenly ill, however, and died at R\u00e1jp\u00far, where he had collected a force, and thus Bimb\u00e1j\u00ed assumed the government without disturbance.\n\nBefore dismissing the subject of the Haihai Bans\u00ed dynasty it may be noted that the only surviving representative of the family is now a pensioner of the British government\u2014a quiet, simple-minded R\u00e1jput, with no indication of a distinguished ancestry. He represents the junior or R\u00e1jp\u00far branch of the family, the elder or Ratanp\u00far branch being absolutely extinct. It has sometimes been suggested that these Haihai Bans\u00eds might really have been aboriginal \u201cKanwars\u201d (a race somewhat numerous and peculiar to this part of the country), and not R\u00e1jputs, being raised only to the latter dignity by the fertile ingenuity of the Br\u00e1hmans after the country was settled, and their power established. It is possible of course, but the fact of intermarriage with Rew\u00e1 and other R\u00e1jput houses already alluded to renders it improbable, as also the fact that none of the \u201cKanwar\u201d zam\u00edn\u00e1rs have any tradition allying them to the reigning house, which, if a common origin, however remote, had existed, they would certainly have claimed. On the whole, the Haihai Bans\u00ed rulers may be regarded as veritable R\u00e1jputs.\n\nBimb\u00e1j\u00ed Bhonsl\u00e1 ruled at Ratanp\u00far from about A.D. 1758 till his death in A.D. 1787. Though generally regarded as subordinate to the head of the Bhonsl\u00e1 at N\u00e1gp\u00far, he was virtually to a large extent independent. In alluding to the respective position of the elder and younger brothers in the N\u00e1gp\u00far family, Sir R. Jenkins* states \u201cthat the elder brother as r\u00e1j\u00e1 or sovereign had a right to the allegiance of \u201cthe others, and to certain military services on account of their fiefs or appanages. \u201cBut the latter managed their country entirely, and they had their separate \u201ccourts, households, ministers, and armies, subject to no interference whatever on \u201cthe part of the r\u00e1j\u00e1.\u201d This, then, was the position of Bimb\u00e1j\u00ed. He stepped into the place of the old r\u00e1j\u00e1s of Chhatt\u00edsgarh, maintained a regular court at Ratanp\u00far, surrounded himself with a considerable Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 following, and with their assistance maintained his authority. In the earlier years of his reign he was very oppressive, but as time passed on he more and more identified himself with his people, and has left a memory fairly popular and respected.\n\nHe was succeeded (A.D. 1788) by Vyankoj\u00ed, a younger brother of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Raghoj\u00ed II. of N\u00e1gp\u00far. Vyankoj\u00ed though he paid two or three flying visits to Chhatt\u00edsgarh, and went through it in 1811 to Benares, where he died, never entered regularly on the government, being too much mixed up with the more important politics of N\u00e1gp\u00far. A s\u00faba was posted to Ratanp\u00far, but all authority centred in A\u2019nand\u00ed B\u00e1\u00ed, the widow of Bimb\u00e1j\u00ed, one of those strong-minded able women not uncommon in Indian history. It is to her that allusion is made by Sir R. Jenkins in his report, page 80, when he says, \u201cThe only disturbances which existed in \u201cthe country were caused by the widow of Bimb\u00e1j\u00ed in Chhatt\u00edsgarh.\u201d These\n\n* Report on N\u00e1gp\u00far Territories, p. 99. Edition N\u00e1gp\u00far Antiquarian Society.\ndisturbances were of a very insignificant character, and consisted in the repulse of the first s\u016bba, who was ordered by Vyankoj\u012b to assume the government on the death of Bimb\u0101j\u012b. The troops of the latter supported the cause of his widow. A compromise, however, was effected. It was decided that the government should be carried on in the name of Vyankoj\u012b, who should be represented by a s\u016bba on the spot, but that the s\u016bba should be bound to obey all orders of A\u2019nand\u012b B\u0101l\u012b, who should be consulted on all the details of the government. Practically, A\u2019nand\u012b B\u0101l\u012b wielded all authority until her death at the beginning of the present century.\n\nFrom this period up to A.D. 1818, when A\u2019p\u0101 S\u0101hib was deposed, and the administration of the N\u0101gp\u016br country, during the minority of the last Raghoj\u012b, was assumed by the British government, the Chhatt\u012bsgarh province was governed by a succession of s\u016bbas, who exercised in all departments a very extensive authority. The headquarters of the s\u016bba was Ratanp\u016br, the old seat of government, and he was assisted in the interior by sub-collectors called kam\u0101visd\u0101rs. A detail of the Ratanp\u016br s\u016bbas, immediately preceding our assuming charge of the country, is given in the margin. They were subject to very little, if any, control, and as long as they were maintained in power by the central authority at N\u0101gp\u016br, most of them were very unscrupulous as to the means pursued to become rich. They were almost driven to this course by the knowledge that their position would certainly be short-lived, and that they must inevitably, within a short interval, be superseded by some new favourite. The tradition still survives of this early s\u016bba government being a period when a system of universal \u201cloot\u201d was a recognised state policy, and Colonel Agnew, a most reliable authority, writing of the administration of the country at the time, describes* it as presenting \u201cone uniform scene of plunder and oppression, \u201cuninfluenced by any consideration but that of collecting, by whatever means, \u201cthe largest amount possible.\u201d One of the last of the s\u016bbas, Sakhar\u0101m B\u0101p\u016b, was shot by a resident of Ratanp\u016br. He had under false pretences promised to raise the man to a position of independence and dignity as a large landed proprietor, and thus deliberately robbed him of a considerable fortune.\n\nIt was in supersession of a government such as described, where power was only wielded as an instrument of violence and oppression, that in A.D. 1818 the country came under the superintendence of British officers. The change under any circumstances would have been a welcome one, but, as it happened, the chief authority in Chhatt\u012bsgarh was entrusted to an officer whose special qualifications were such as to win the respect and esteem of the whole community. Colonel Agnew, who presided for many years at R\u0101lp\u016br as superintendent of Chhatt\u012bsgarh, still lives as a household word in the memory of the people, and will probably continue, so long as British rule lasts, to represent to the minds of all classes the highest English ideal which their traditions supply. His praises are sung alike by the largest zam\u0101nd\u0101r and the poorest peasant, and there is no corner so remote where \u201cAgnew S\u0101hib\u201d will not be affectionately mentioned if any inquiries are made into the former history of the province. There could be no higher tribute\n\n* Report on N\u0101gp\u016br, by Sir R. Jenkins, p. 149, Edition N\u0101gp\u016br Antiquarian Society.\nto the justice, moderation, and wisdom of the first representative of British rule in these eastern districts, than the respectful gratitude with which his name is still remembered after the changes and trials of forty years.\n\nIt was Colonel Agnew (after the death of Mr. Edmonds, who had first taken charge of the district) who removed the head-quarters of Chhattisgarh from Ratanp\u00far to R\u00e1ip\u00far, as being a more important and central position, and from that time Ratanp\u00far has ceased to be of any administrative importance. Within the present limits of this district there were three kam\u00e1visd\u00e1rs stationed, namely, one at Ratanp\u00far for the central, one at Naw\u00e1garh for the western, and one at Kharod for the eastern talukas. These kam\u00e1visd\u00e1rs exercised very much the same authority as tahsild\u00e1rs under our system, and though their main duty was connected with the settlement of the government demand, and the realisation of the revenue, they also exercised civil and criminal jurisdiction. There were altogether in Chhattisgarh eight kam\u00e1visd\u00e1rs acting under the orders of the superintendent, Colonel Agnew, whose position was somewhat analogous to that of a commissioner of division. Administrative details largely devolved on the pargana official, acting under the general control of the British superintendent. Violence and oppression ceased to exist, while method and order characterised every branch of the administration. It is indeed from the period of the British protectorate in A.D. 1818 that prosperity has revisited Chhattisgarh. In the time of its ancient r\u00e1j\u00e1s, who were bound to the people by ties of tradition and sympathy, there was an extent of peace, comfort, and happiness sadly in contrast with the evil days which followed the wave of Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 conquest. Here was an irruption of soldiers, flushed with victory, among a people whose past history had been singularly free from \u201cwars and rumours of wars,\u201d thus creating a community markedly timid and unwarlike. As a natural result they were trodden down unmercifully, and their country robbed and desolated. To realise what the country must have suffered between A.D. 1740 and 1818, we have to remember that not only was a considerable Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 force permanently maintained in Chhattisgarh, but that large armies were often traversing the country, not only living on the people, but literally fleecing them. Then there were the raids of the Pindh\u00e1ris, whose depredations were connived at by the Bhonsl\u00e1 government, and a regular black mail accepted by the r\u00e1j\u00e1 or his officials from the booty acquired in pillaging the people. Add to all this the exactions and oppressions of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 s\u00fabas, already referred to, who exercised the chief civil authority, and we need not be surprised that during the half century which immediately followed the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 conquest the country materially retrograded, and tracts relapsed into waste which had formerly been reclaimed and cultivated.\n\nThe British protectorate continued from A.D. 1818 till 1830. During the greater portion of this period Colonel Agnew continued as superintendent. From A.D. 1830 till 1854 the country remained under Native administration. The revenue system seems to have continued much the same as during the British protectorate, the post of superintendent being occupied by a Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 s\u00faba. During these twenty-four years Chhattisgarh was governed by s\u00fabas, who resided at R\u00e1ip\u00far, and subordinate to whom were kam\u00e1visd\u00e1rs or sub-collectors in each pargana or cluster of talukas. The time had passed when violence and oppression could be recognised as fixed principles by those in power, for all protests against the action of the local s\u00fabas, if thrown out by the r\u00e1j\u00e1 himself, were almost invariably carried\nto the British Resident at N\u00e1gp\u00far, whose simple edict was usually sufficient to redress any glaring wrong. Judging by the tone of the people in talking of these days, they seem to have been fairly contented and prosperous, and although there were doubtless many individual sufferers from occasional acts of injustice on the part of native officials, yet such cases are not entirely unknown even under more civilised systems. In this district the people were very remote from the central authority; they were not inundated by a swarm of unprincipled subordinates, and so little was really known of them and their country, that practically the masses were little interfered with. On the whole then, in this part of the country, the interval of Native government, as controlled by the British Resident, seems to have been a period of slow but steady progress.\n\nOn the lapse of the N\u00e1gp\u00far province to the British government in 1854, Chhattisgarh was formed into a separate deputy commissionership with head-quarters at R\u00e1lp\u00far. After some years' experience the charge was found too heavy for one officer, and finally, in 1861, Bil\u00e1sp\u00far was constituted a separate district, and, including the additions subsequently made, comprises the northern section of the Chhattisgarh country. Within the jurisdiction are included, as mentioned before, three sub-collectorates, thirteen zam\u00ednd\u00e1r\u00ed estates, and two feudatoryships. With the exception of the two small talukas of Bhuty\u00e1 and Sarsu\u00e1, now forming a part of the eastern pargana of Seor\u00e1nar\u00e1n, and the feudatoryship of Sakt\u00ed transferred from Sambalp\u00far, the district consists of tracts separated from R\u00e1lp\u00far, which, notwithstanding the extensive area thus transferred, still remains the largest district in the Central Provinces.\n\nIn a period less than three years after the introduction of British rule the Son\u00e1kh\u00e1n outbreak. Mutiny broke out, and its disturbing influences extended to Chhattisgarh. A section of the small military force at R\u00e1lp\u00far was mutinous and insubordinate, and it was only by the timely and vigorous action of Major Elliot and Captain Smith that an open outbreak was prevented. The central authority being thus preserved, no local disturbances occurred except at Son\u00e1kh\u00e1n, a hilly estate at the south-eastern extremity of the Bil\u00e1sp\u00far district, the zam\u00ednd\u00e1r of which, having been previously confined, on a charge of dacoity with murder, in the R\u00e1lp\u00far jail, effected his escape, and returning to his fastnesses, openly defied authority. He was of course supported by his own immediate followers, but neither the surrounding chiefs nor people were attracted to his standard. His small estate was wild, remote, and difficult of access, and if the spirit of disaffection had spread, the nature of the country might have necessitated harassing military operations. Captain Smith, however, at once proceeded to the spot with a small force, and the zam\u00ednd\u00e1r, N\u00e1r\u00e1yan Singh, finding resistance hopeless, unconditionally surrendered. He was tried and executed, his zam\u00ednd\u00e1r\u00ed at the same time being confiscated, and this necessary example effectually prevented opposition everywhere. After his capture the villages on his estate were speedily deserted, and the whole tract became waste. It is still in the main a great wilderness, and has consequently been reserved as a government waste, though the best part of the estate\u201416,000 acres\u2014has been purchased by Mr. Meik, an English gentleman. Thus the insignificant rebellion of a petty chief may be the means of attracting English capital to what seems prim\u00e1 facie a very unpromising field, and confer on the country a most unlooked-for benefit. The surviving descendants of N\u00e1r\u00e1yan Singh now hold land in the adjacent zam\u00ednd\u00e1r\u00eds.\nThe census statistics show the population as follows:\n\n**Males.**\n\n- Adults: 211,128\n- Under 14 years: 188,378\n\nTotal: 399,506\n\n**Females.**\n\n- Adults: 215,191\n- Under 14 years: 165,806\n\nTotal: 380,997\n\n### Principal Castes.\n\n| Hind\u00fas | No. of Population | Percentage of each Caste | Aborigines | No. of Population | Percentage of each Caste |\n|--------|-------------------|--------------------------|-----------|-------------------|--------------------------|\n| Cham\u00e1s | 164,388           | 21                       | Gonds     | 120,159           | 15                       |\n| Pank\u00e1s | 72,972            | 9                        | Kanwars   | 30,436            |                          |\n| Ah\u00edrs or R\u00e1uts | 66,574 | 8                        | Bhumi\u00e1s   | 2,264             |                          |\n| Tel\u00eds  | 51,679            | 7                        | Binjw\u00e1rs  | 7,009             |                          |\n| Kurmis | 39,843            | 5                        | Dhanw\u00e1rs  | 3,988             |                          |\n| M\u00e1l\u00eds  | 25,145            | 3                        | Other Aborigines | 9,338 |                          |\n| Br\u00e1hmans | 17,167 | 2                        |           |                   |                          |\n| Bair\u00e1g\u00eds | 11,092 | 1                        |           |                   |                          |\n| R\u00e1jputs | 10,702 | 1                        |           |                   |                          |\n| Bani\u00e1s | 4,873             | ...                      |           |                   |                          |\n| Other Hind\u00fa Castes | 133,833 | 17                      | Mohammadans | 9,041 | 1                      |\n\nTotal: 598,268\n\nGrand total: 780,503\n\nThe total area of the district is 8,800 square miles, so that with a population of 780,503 souls the rate per square mile is 88 persons. This, however, is one of those general deductions from statistics on which no conclusions can be based. Viewed in the abstract, these figures indicate that the district is miserably underpopulated, but this is only true of the hilly tracts which enclose the plain on three sides. The level country is as densely peopled as any other district of the Central Provinces. In order therefore to arrive at any clear knowledge of the facts, it is necessary to deal separately with the hilly and plain tracts. This will be effectually done by showing the figures for kh\u00e1s\u00e1 and zamind\u00e1r\u00ed areas apart. The kh\u00e1s\u00e1 parganas, or tracts which have come under regular settlement with proprietors, village by village, cover an area of 3,000 square miles, and contain a population of 530,541 persons. Here there are 178 persons to each square mile\u2014an average as high as exists in the rich Narbad\u00e1 valley. The above too is a general average, while at special points, of course, the population is much more dense. In the zamind\u00e1r\u00eds on the contrary, owing to the wild and hilly nature of most of the country, there is only a population of 249,962 persons to an area of 5,800 square miles, or an average of forty-eight persons per square mile. Low as this rate is, it is not an unprecedented average for a hilly\narea, for it appears from the North-West census report (para. 40) that in Kum\u00e1on the population only attains a density of fifty-eight to the square mile, while in some of the Swiss cantons the average falls as low as thirty.\n\nThe population, as distributed above, shows Hind\u00fas seventy-six per cent, Aborigines twenty-three per cent, and Mohammadans one per cent. Under the designation of Hind\u00fas are included all those classes who are of Aryan origin\u2014the division has been made with reference to race, not religion, for it so happens that, in this district, among the Aryan tribes there are prominent castes who do not conform to the Hind\u00fa religion. They may be termed Hind\u00fa dissenters. The Cham\u00e1rs, who are twenty-one per cent of the population, call themselves \"Satn\u00e1m\u00eds,\" and are followers of their own priest Gh\u00e1s\u00ed D\u00e1s. The Pank\u00e1s and G\u00e1nd\u00e1s, who are nine per cent of the population, are \"Kabir Panth\u00eds.\" This same \"Kabir\" has numerous followers in other castes, viz. among Ahhrs, Kurmis, Tell\u00eds, &c., but their number it is impossible to compute. Approximately it may be stated that of the seventy-six per cent of recorded Hind\u00fas, half are so in race only. Turning to the Aborigines, the most numerous section consists of Gonds. They are fifteen per cent of the population; then follow \"Kanwars,\" who are four per cent. All other castes are limited in number. The Mohammadan element is insignificant, being but one per cent, and in the aggregate counts for little. Arranged according to creed, the population would stand as follows: orthodox Hind\u00fas, thirty-eight per cent; dissenters, thirty-eight per cent; worshippers of local deities, twenty-three per cent; and Mohammadans, one per cent.\n\nIn describing the specialities of the more important classes of the community, the Cham\u00e1rs should be named first, for almost every fourth man in the district belongs to this section of the people. They have been so long settled in Chhatt\u00edsgarh that they seem to have no kind of tradition, even in the remote past, of any other home. As a body they possess active and well-set figures, are more brown than black in colour, and are less marked in features than the easy and higher classes. They are fairly energetic and industrious cultivators, are somewhat tenacious of their rights, and considerable numbers of them have attained a position of comfort and respectability. A description of the religious movement, which has given prominence to the Cham\u00e1rs of Chhatt\u00edsgarh, may not be out of place. Gh\u00e1s\u00ed D\u00e1s, the author of the movement, like the rest of his community, was unlettered. He was a man of unusually fair complexion and rather imposing appearance, sensitive and silent, given to seeing visions, and deeply resenting the harsh treatment of his brotherhood by the Hind\u00fas. He was well known to the whole community, having travelled much among them, had the reputation of being exceptionally sagacious, and was universally respected. By some he was believed to possess supernatural powers, by others curative powers only, by all he was deemed a remarkable man. In the natural course of events it was not long before Gh\u00e1s\u00ed D\u00e1s gathered round himself a band of devoted followers. Whether impelled by their constant importunities, or by a feeling of personal vanity, or both causes combined, he resolved on a prophetic career, to be preceded by a temporary withdrawal into the wilderness. He selected for his wanderings the eastern forests of Chhatt\u00edsgarh, and proceeded to a small village called Gir\u00f3d on the outskirts of the hilly region, bordering the Jonk river, near its junction with the Mah\u00e1n\u00e1di. He dismissed the few followers who had accompanied him, with the intimation that in six months he would\nreturn with a new revelation, and mounting the rocky eminence overhanging the village, disappeared into the distant forest. Meanwhile the followers, who had accompanied him to the foot of that henceforth mysterious hill were active in spreading through the whole Cham\u00e1r community his farewell message, with the warning that all should appear at Girod, as the termination of the six months' interval approached.\n\nAmong a superstitious people these tidings worked marvels, and created a perfect ferment of expectation. During the period of suspense nothing else was talked of, and the public mind anxiously looked for some revelation. As the close of the appointed time drew near, Cham\u00e1rs from all parts of Chhattisgarh flocked to Girod. The scene as described by an eye-witness was strange and impressive. The roads leading to this hitherto unfrequented hamlet were traversed by crowds of anxious pilgrims. The young and old of both sexes swelled the throng\u2014mothers carrying their infants, and the aged and infirm led by stronger arms. Some died by the way, but the enthusiasm was not stayed. At last the long-looked-for day arrived, and with it the realisation of the hopes of this hitherto despised community. In the quiet of the early morning their self-appointed prophet was seen descending the rocky eminence overhanging Girod, and, as he approached, was greeted with the acclamations of the assembled crowd. He explained to them how he had been miraculously sustained for the period of six months in the wilderness; how he had held communion with a higher Power; and how he had been empowered to deliver a special message to the members of his own community. This message absolutely prohibited the adoration of idols, and enjoined the worship of the Maker of the universe without any visible sign or representation, at the same time proclaiming a code of social equality. It appointed Gh\u00e1s\u00ed D\u00e1s the high priest of the new faith, and added the proviso that this office would remain in his family for ever.\n\nThe simple faith thus enunciated may best be termed a \"Hind\u00faised deism,\" Sat N\u00e1m\u00ed religion, for there were mixed up with it certain social and dietary regulations copied from Br\u00e1hmanism. The movement occurred between the years 1820 and 1830, and is scarcely half a century old. It includes nearly the whole Cham\u00e1r community of Chhattisgarh, who now call themselves \"Sat N\u00e1ms,\" meaning thereby that they are worshippers of \"Sat N\u00e1m\" or \"The True One\"\u2014their name, and a very appropriate one, for God. They would fain bury the opprobrious epithet \"cham\u00e1r\" among other relics of the past, did it not with traditional pertinacity, and owing to the hatred of the Br\u00e1hmans, refuse to forsake them. In the early years of the movement an effort was made to crush its spread, but in vain, and Gh\u00e1s\u00ed D\u00e1s lived to a ripe old age to see the belief he had founded a living element in society, constituting the guide, and directing the aspirations, of a population exceeding a quarter of a million. He died in the year 1850, at the age of eighty, and while the work he accomplished by our clearer light seems darkened with prejudice, ignorance, and imposture, yet there can be no doubt he did a good fight in demolishing, even within a small area, the giant evils of idolatry, and thus perhaps preparing his community for the reception of a higher and purer faith. On the death of Gh\u00e1s\u00ed D\u00e1s he was succeeded in the office of high priest by his eldest son B\u00e1lak D\u00e1s. This B\u00e1lak D\u00e1s carried his feeling of equality to so high a pitch, that he outraged all Hind\u00fa society by assuming the Br\u00e1hmanical thread. Wherever he appeared he offensively paraded the thin silken cord round his neck as an emblem of sacredness, and hoped to defy Hind\u00fa enmity under cover of the\ngeneral security against violence afforded by British rule. So bitter, however, was the hostility he raised, and so few the precautions he took against private assassination, that his enemies at last found an opportunity. He was travelling to R\u00e1ip\u00far on business, and remained for the night at a roadside resthouse. Here a party of men, supposed to be Rajputs, attacked and killed him, at the same time wounding the followers who accompanied him. This occurred in the year 1860, and the perpetrators were never discovered. It exasperated the whole Cham\u00e1r community, and a deeper animosity than ever now divides them from their Hind\u00fa fellow-citizens.\n\nB\u00e1lak D\u00e1s was succeeded nominally by his son S\u00e1hib D\u00e1s, a child, but really by his brother A gar D\u00e1s, who is now virtually high priest. The duties of this office are more of a dignified than onerous character. The high priest decides finally all questions involving social excommunication, and prescribes the penalties attending restoration. For those who can attend on him personally, or whom he can arrange to visit, he performs the ceremonies at marriage and on naming children; at the latter ceremony a bead necklace, in token of entrance into the Sat N\u00e1m\u00ed brotherhood, is placed round the neck of the child. It is not absolutely necessary, however, that the high priest should officiate at any ceremonies. They are sufficiently solemnised by meetings of the brotherhood. Most Cham\u00e1rs once a year visit the high priest, and on these occasions a suitable offering is invariably made. They have no public worship of any kind, and consequently no temples; they have no written creed, nor any prescribed forms of devotion. When devotionally inclined, it is only necessary to repeat the name of the deity, and to invoke his blessing. No idol of wood or stone is seen near their villages. They have a dim kind of belief in a future state; but this does not exercise any practical influence on their conduct. Their social practices correspond for the most part with those of Hind\u00fas. They ignore, however, Hind\u00fa festivals. As a rule they are monogamists, though polygamy is not specially prohibited. Their women are not in any way secluded from public gaze, and are, equally with men, busy and industrious in home and field pursuits. In fact in most of their arrangements, to a superficial observer, the Cham\u00e1rs present nothing peculiar, and it is only after inquiry that many of their distinguishing features are discovered.\n\nThe account thus given has been gathered from oral testimony\u2014a source of knowledge liable to error and exaggeration. In its main features, however, it is accurate; disputed points have not been touched. One is whether B\u00e1lak D\u00e1s was accepted as an Incarnation. Most Sat N\u00e1m\u00eds deny regarding him as such. Another is whether Sat N\u00e1m\u00ed brides associate with the high priest before being taken to their husbands' homes. No Sat N\u00e1m\u00ed will acknowledge this, and the calumny is attributed to Br\u00e1hmanical ingenuity. Some forms of prayer, collated from Hind\u00fa authors, are said to exist among the teachers, but these are quite unknown to the people, and the only act of devotion which a Sat N\u00e1m\u00ed practises is to fall prostrate before the sun at morn and eve and exclaim \"Sat n\u00e1m,\" \"Sat n\u00e1m,\" \"Sat n\u00e1m,\" translated literally \"God! God! God!\" or perhaps implying \"God, have mercy! have mercy!\" Turning to their social practices, it is found that they eat no meat. They will not even drink water except from one of their own caste, and liquor is prohibited. They marry ordinarily at the age of puberty, the parents selecting a bride; the marriage itself is purely of a civil nature, being celebrated by the elders, with a feast given to the friends of the family. They bury their dead without any religious ceremony, and in everyday life their moral\nnotions are not rigid. A fatal split in the community has arisen from a most trivial cause\u2014the use of tobacco. In the first outburst of religious enthusiasm, which animated the followers of Gh\u00e1si D\u00e1s, it would seem that drink and tobacco were simultaneously forsaken. The use of liquor apparently was a weakness which was easily and effectually overcome, but the strange solace which smokers appear to find in tobacco, and more especially a labouring population, possessed irresistible charms. A reaction set in, and finally a considerable portion of the community returned to their pipes. To talk of pipes in connection with an eastern people seems an anomaly, but in Chhattisgarh it is strictly correct. The hooka of Northern India is unknown here, and in its stead the broad \"pal\u00e1s\" leaf is folded into a pipe-like shape with a bowl at one end, in which dry tobacco is placed. It is called a \"ch\u00fang\u00ed,\" is universally indulged in by all classes, and field labourers, by its use, break the dull monotony of their daily toil. The Sat N\u00e1m\u00eds who again took to ch\u00fang\u00eds came to be opprobriously designated \"Ch\u00fang\u00edas\" by their brethren, and retain the appellation. They maintain their orthodoxy, and urge that Gh\u00e1si D\u00e1s had a subsequent revelation conceding the use of tobacco to his people, and that consequently in his latter years he absolutely withdrew his original prohibition. The Sat N\u00e1m\u00eds thus remain divided into two grand sections\u2014the \"smokers\" and \"non-smokers.\" It is said that the smokers eat meat, and are not real Sat N\u00e1m\u00eds, but as a body they perfectly repudiate the insinuation. The Sat N\u00e1m\u00eds thus described are a strange and interesting people, and as a special mission has lately been inaugurated for their enlightenment and instruction, they are perhaps destined in the future to exercise an influence proportioned to their numbers and position in the annals of Chhattisgarh. There is no class more loyal and satisfied with our rule than this community, and if it should happen that, like the Kols, they are favourably impressed with Missionary teaching, a time may come when they will be a source of strength to our government.\n\nThe Pank\u00e1s, who form about a sixth of the population, are another peculiar sect, and are all, as already mentioned, \"Kabfr Panthis.\" The majority of them now are cultivators, though originally they all seem to have been weavers, and correspond with the Kor tribe elsewhere. As it is, a considerable number still stick to weaving, while others weave only during the intervals of field work. The village watchmen are usually of the Pank\u00e1 class, and are then called \"G\u00e1nd\u00e1s,\" being distinct, however, from the men known as \"Bajgari\u00e1 G\u00e1nd\u00e1s,\" the great musicians of Chhattisgarh, who play on festive occasions, but are considered somewhat low in the social scale, as they eat meat, drink liquor, and are in other respects impure. The Pank\u00e1s do none of these things. They are a quiet industrious people, and do not class with the Hind\u00fas, because they make no pretensions to equality, and besides, \"Kabfr panth\u00edsm\" has been so long established, that the most orthodox seem to concede that it rests on a basis of truth. The Pank\u00e1 deity is Kabfr, who is supposed to be god incarnate, and is said to have appeared several times on earth, at least once during each cycle of man's history. During the present historic period he has only appeared once, about A.D. 1060, in the vicinity of the sacred city of Benares. The story runs that the wife of a weaver, in drawing water from a tank in the outskirts of the city, heard to her surprise the cries of an infant. She approached the spot whence the cries proceeded, and there beheld a child struggling among the lotus leaves. Rushing immediately into the tank she rescued the infant, and, returning to the bank, spread a cloth on which she laid her new-found charge,\nwhich gradually assumed the proportions of a man. Terrified, she attempted to fly. Seeing this, Kab\u00edr revealed himself as a deity, who had appeared in the form of man. He accompanied the woman to her house, and from this humble home commenced his divine career. Kab\u00edr worked miracles and had many followers, but the strangeness of his origin, issuing as it were from a weaver's hovel, soon caused the Br\u00e1hmans to stigmatise him as the \"weavers' god.\" It is an up-hill struggle to surmount entirely the shaft of satire, and even in a superstitions age, unfamiliar with the principle of a regular sequence in the laws of nature, and prepared to accept at every turn the unknown action of miraculous interposition, a cutting sarcasm has its influence. The taunt of the Br\u00e1hmans had the effect of keeping off the higher and educated classes, and of confining his mission to the lower and less influential castes. So it has continued. His followers are mainly among the weaver tribe all over India. In this district nearly the whole community of Pank\u00e1s, G\u00e1nd\u00e1s, and Koshf\u00eds, whether at the present time by trade weavers or agriculturists, are in religion Kab\u00edr Panth\u00eds, not Hind\u00fas. Other castes\u2014Ban\u00e1s, Kurmis, Tel\u00eds, Kumbh\u00e1rs, &c.\u2014are Kab\u00edr Panth\u00eds and Hind\u00fas, viz. accepting the Hind\u00fa mythology in all its integrity, and adding thereto Kab\u00edr as one more divinity. Taking all classes, probably one-fourth of the population are more or less followers of Kab\u00edr.\n\nThe cornerstone of the faith may be said to be this, that a deity named Kab\u00edrpanth\u00ed faith. Kab\u00edr appeared on the earth as a man, and during a sojourn of some centuries performed many marvels, underwent trying pilgrimages and privations, led a life of perfect devotion, and then, having firmly planted his religion, voluntarily disappeared, allowing the mantle of earthly apostleship, or representativeship, to devolve on a faithful disciple named Dharm D\u00e1s. Kab\u00edr himself is represented as having remained on earth from A.D. 1149 to 1449,* or three hundred years. He left a list of the succession in the direct line from Dharm D\u00e1s, and the name of each successive holder of the apostleship was recorded. There are to be in all forty-four apostles, each of whom is to govern twenty-five years before his death, and after the list Kab\u00edr himself will again appear on earth. The present chief apostle is Paraghatn\u00e1m S\u00e1hib, resident at Kaward\u00e1, in the Bil\u00e1sp\u00far district, who succeeded to the headship in 1856. He is the eleventh in the succession, and has thirteen years more of his apostleship to run. As 420 years have passed since Kab\u00edr's death, had the twenty-five years' rule for each apostle as instituted been maintained, we should now have found the seventeenth instead of the eleventh succession. Kab\u00edr's prophetic prediction of a twenty-five years' life, after succession to the apostleship, for each individual incumbent, has thus clearly been falsified. The chief apostle is always surrounded by a host of disciples, who in turn travel all over the country, performing religious services, and collecting voluntary contributions for the maintenance of the order. They are the priests of the system. They assume a peculiar dress\u2014a white peaked cloth cap, a loose white tunic, and the usual dhot\u00ed. As a rule these garments are kept scrupulously clean, and in religious processions, following their chief in a long line, two or four abreast, they exhibit considerable order and system. They, in common with all Kab\u00edr's followers, are prohibited from touching flesh, also spirituous liquors and tobacco. Theoretically there seems no caste in the community, but practically the converts from the higher castes of Hind\u00faism, who are numerous among the priesthood, maintain certain distinctions. Celibacy is usual among the priesthood,\n\n* Wilson's \"Essays on the Religion of the Hind\u00fas,\" vol. i. p. 71, Ed. 1862.\nthough not compulsory, and the chief apostle invariably marries in order to maintain the succession.\n\nSetting aside the speciality of a priesthood, who collect from all parts of India round Parghatn\u00e1m S\u00e1hib at Kaward\u00e1, and are appointed by him to their respective posts, there is very little difference between the local and religious practices of Kab\u00edr Panth\u00ed Pank\u00e1s and Sat N\u00e1m\u00eds. They both avoid meat and liquor, marry usually at the age of puberty, ordinarily celebrate their ceremonies through the agency of elders of their own caste, and bury their dead. Practically the one worships a supreme being under the name of \"Kab\u00edr,\" and the other under the name of \"Sat N\u00e1m,\" while in each case there is a high priest to whom special reverence is paid. There is a rhyme very common with the people regarding the change of faith among the Pank\u00e1s, which is regarded by them as pleasing and complimentary:\n\nP\u00e1n\u00ed se Pank\u00e1 bhaye\nB\u00fandan h\u00faa sar\u00edr\nA'ge Jamm men Pank\u00e1\nPichhe D\u00e1s Kab\u00edr.\n\nwhich in English doggrel might be translated thus\u2014\n\nIn former lives the Pank\u00e1\nDragg'd on a mean career;\nNow born again from water,\nHe shines a D\u00e1s Kab\u00edr.*\n\nThe said Kab\u00edr has a very large following in almost every district, and as no loss of caste results from becoming a believer, his sect has made one of the largest rents in Hind\u00faism.\n\nOf the essential Hind\u00fa population it is not necessary to speak in any detail. In all main characteristics they resemble their brethren elsewhere, and have been frequently described. The castes have all northern affinities, and the emigrations to this district have been almost entirely from the north and west. Of southern races there are almost none, and the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 element is nearly exclusively confined to the Br\u00e1hman community. The Kurmis and Tel\u00eds are a very numerous section of the agricultural community, aggregating twelve per cent of the population. In both cases there is the class called \"Jhari\u00e1s,\" from \"Jh\u00e1rkhand\" (the forest), who were settlers here while Chhattisgarh was still a wilderness, and have indeed been so long in the country that they have altogether lost count of the number of generations. This appellation \"Jhari\u00e1\" is found in other castes too, and invariably indicates length of residence. Then there are Des\u00e1h\u00e1 and Kanojia Kurm\u00eds and Tel\u00eds, and a separate class of Kurm\u00eds called \"Chand-n\u00e1h\u00fas.\" These represent the later immigrations about two or three hundred years since. None of these divisions either eat together or intermarry, though practically their social customs are very little at variance. The Kurm\u00eds and Tel\u00eds are the best of all cultivators. They are not so restless and fanciful as Sat N\u00e1m\u00eds, and have to a greater extent an attachment to their holdings.\n\nTurning to the aboriginal population, 'the most numerous class is Gonds, who amount to fifteen per cent of the population. They have mixed here so much with Hind\u00fa races\n\n* Slave or disciple of Kab\u00edr.\nthat they have lost most of their marked characteristics, and have not even retained their own special language. They are thus not ordinarily distinguishable from the other classes of the labouring population, and so great an intermixture has apparently taken place, that the flat forehead, squat nose, prominent nostril, dark skin, and thick lip, indicating an aboriginal type, are not in any way conspicuous. The Gonds as a rule only worship two gods\u2014Bar\u00e1 Deva (the great god), and D\u00fal\u00e9 Deva. They have not the variety of deities mentioned in Hislop's published notes.* There is no image of either deity, but while Bar\u00e1 Deva requires a sacrifice of blood, and is worshipped beneath some sacred tree or by some mound of stones, D\u00fal\u00e9 Deva is supplicated in the house with an offering usually of rice, flowers, or oil. The worship of Bar\u00e1 Deva is therefore a more expensive ceremonial, involving the offering of a fowl, a goat, or a pig, and is only publicly undertaken on special occasions; while D\u00fal\u00e9 Deva, the household god, can be approached at all times, so that devout spirits, especially among the women, make a regular offering from their daily meal. These two deities all Gonds worship, but many in addition take up with Th\u00e1kur Deva, Bhaw\u00e1n\u00ed, and K\u00e1l\u00ed Devi, which generally require a sacrificial offering. The priestly office among the community is discharged by an elder, who receives the respectful appellation of \"Baiga,\" and is called in on all occasions of rejoicing or sorrow, doubt or difficulty. He is deemed as powerful to circumvent a troublesome tiger, as to dispel a lingering disease. Gond marriages ordinarily take place at the age of puberty, and the main ceremony consists in anointing with turmeric, and circling round a post seven times. They are arranged by the parents, and generally something is paid for the bride\u2014a common feature among all aboriginal races. A feast is invariably given, and liquor freely partaken of. A man never marries more than one wife, though polygamy is not absolutely prohibited. A widower may remarry; a widow may not, though she may take up with a brother of her deceased husband, or contract a second-hand marriage with a person of her own caste. The tribe bury their dead, on which occasion there is a gathering of friends, who indulge freely in the good things provided, and then disperse.\n\nFollowing Gonds, the Kanwars are the next largest section of the aboriginal population. They number over thirty thousand souls, and occupy an influential position, as all the northern zamindars belong to this tribe. It is an eminent weakness among the heads of all aboriginal races, when they come to occupy a good position and are powerful, that, owing to the crafty teaching of the Br\u00e1hmans, they soon become fired with an ambition to link their lineage with the great military caste of the Hind\u00fas. So it is that the upper crust among the Kanwars would fain pass as R\u00e1jputs, and having imbibed all the sacredness which is supposed to attend an assumption of the thread worn by the twice-born, they call themselves \"Tawars,\" \"R\u00e1j Kanwars,\" \"Kanwar Bans\u00eds,\" and so forth. The result of all this is that they have become split up into quite a formidable number of divisions or \"gots,\" like the more aristocratic tribes whom they emulate. There are said to be more than a hundred gots among them. Two\u2014the D\u00fal\u00e9 Kanwar and the Dh\u00e1ngar\u2014have worn the thread for a considerable period; while the Tilasi or Tawar, and the S\u00e1ndil or Sarwaya, have only assumed it within the last decade. None of the others have yet advanced so far, but the affair seems so simple that there is hope for them in the future. Of course those who are now socially elevated will not recognise the poorer and\n\n* Hislop's Papers on the Aboriginal Tribes of the Central Provinces, Ed. 1865, p. 13.\nwilder portions of the tribe as brother caste-men at all, but it is after mixing much with these that the undoubtedly aboriginal type of the whole community is illustrated. There has, however, been a great deal of mixture with Aryan races, and the Kanwars, like the Gonds, have not here any special language. Their great deities are Th\u00e1kur Deva and D\u00fal\u00e1 Deva, already referred to as common among the Gonds. Pah\u00e1r P\u00e1t, the presiding genius of the hill, is worshipped by many, a stone being set aside in some solitary spot, to which at certain intervals offerings are made. R\u00e9tm\u00e1i, alleged goddess of night, is worshipped by some during darkness, in order to avert misfortune. Others worship Lachhm\u00ed, goddess of wealth, by placing a slab near their grain-store, to which offerings are made in order to elicit the smiles of fortune. The higher classes once a year, at the Dasar\u00e1, worship the broadsword as an emblem of power, under the name of \u201cJh\u00e1ra khand\u201d or \u201cJh\u00e1gr\u00e1 khand.\u201d This period is held as a festival, to which followers and retainers are invited, and after procession and offerings the evening is passed under the exciting influence of dance and song. No Kanwar marries in his own \u201cgot;\u201d and so palpable is the thread innovation, that he may seek a bride among subdivisions which have not yet adopted it. In the same way he may even receive food from such classes, though this is being gradually prohibited. Where the R\u00e9jput tendency is dominant, marriage occurs in infancy, and is celebrated by a Br\u00e1hman priest, who avails himself of the opportunity to invest the uninitiated bridegroom with the solemn paraphernalia of the thread. Ordinary Kanwars follow the Gond practice, and marry at puberty, the ceremony of anointing with turmeric, and revolving round a pole, being gone through before relations and elders. Among the poor a money-payment is made to the bride\u2019s father, and runs from five to thirty-three rupees, besides the expenses of the marriage feast and garments, which fall on the bridegroom. A considerable number of the Kanwars eat flesh and drink liquor, while those who have abjured these things are as stringent in diet as Br\u00e1hmans and Sat N\u00e1m\u00eds. In the same way, it is only a small minority who burn their dead, the recognised practice of the caste being to bury. Altogether these Kanwars are a simple, primitive people, found chiefly in the northern and eastern hills of Chhatt\u00edsgarh, alarmingly superstitious, and marvellously obedient.\n\nOther hill tribes scarcely require any detailed mention. The Binjw\u00e1rs and Dhanw\u00e1rs are, in their social practice and worship, exactly like ordinary Kanwars. They have numerous subdivisions, and are probably mere branches of the Kanwar family. The Dh\u00e1ngars are the Ur\u00e1ons of Chot\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur, and have been described in the Journal of the Asiatic Society * by Colonel Dalton. They have their own special tongue, and are not numerous in the district, being scattered here and there, chiefly in service, for which their laborious habits and fidelity are said eminently to qualify them. The wildest class of all that we have is the Bh\u00fami\u00e1. The real genuine Bh\u00fami\u00e1 is only found in remote tracts, for centuries within the shadow, as it were, of Aryan civilisation, yet entirely unaffected thereby. His sole heritage is an axe, and the veriest shred of cloth attached to a string suffices to cover his nakedness. He apparently scorns regular cultivation, and looks upon ploughing as beneath the dignity of man. He rears a crop under the system known as \u201cd\u00e1hya,\u201d which consists in cutting down a patch of jungle, firing it in May, and then throwing seed among the ashes. This germinates, and springs up very fast after the first fall of the monsoon. One patch of jungle\n\n* Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, vol. xxxv. part 2 (1866), pp. 168\u2014198.\nyields in this way for two years, and then a new tract is taken up, while the abandoned land will not recover itself, and be fit to be occupied, for some twelve or fifteen years. This savage and wasteful process has effected the destruction of some of the finest forests, and there seems a very remote prospect of its being abandoned. These Bhumi\u00e1s are one of the Kolarian tribes referred to in Mr. George Campbell's essay on the Ethnology of India,* but a very wild section of them. They do not collect in villages; in fact their style of cultivation is against this; but two or three families are encountered in some rude huts on the hill side, and even here, if disturbed too much, they will at once levant. The rice, kodo, kutki or grain which they sow only lasts for half the year, and they have to eke out the remainder by bartering bamboos for rice, or else doing their best on jungle roots and fruits. They are great hunters, and use their arrows with marked skill. Then their patch of cultivation, which is paled in on all sides, has numerous primitive traps for snaring rats and other vermin, on which, when opportunity offers, they make a good meal. The Bhumi\u00e1s either worship Thakur Deva or Dil\u00e1 Deva, but apparently at very protracted intervals. They marry, like the Gonds, at the age of puberty, and they pay a few rupees for their bride. They bury their dead without any ceremony except a feast. They are a short, slim black race, often with long shaggy hair, and wild looking, but essentially timid.\n\nAt page 24 of Sir R. Jenkin's report on the Nagpur territories (A.D. 1627) two very wild tribes\u2014Bandarw\u00e1s and P\u00e1rdhis\u2014are alluded to as inhabiting the hilly and woody country near Ratanpur. The former are represented as cannibals; the latter as not quite so bad, but still very savage. The P\u00e1rdhis are not known now at all, and the few Bandarw\u00e1s still to be found are not so wild as the hill Bhumi\u00e1s, but would appear to have got their name from the monkey (bandar), which they eat. This very peculiarity may in fact have originated the story of their eating men. A subdivision of them, rumour still asserts, is addicted to living up in trees, and to wandering about, both men and women, in a state of nature. They were said to be in the Korba hills, but when inquiries came to be made, they were not to be found, and it seems likely that the description given of them is somewhat mythical.\n\nIn the kh\u00e1lisa area nearly a fourth of the villages are held by Br\u00e1hmans, and half of these are in the hands of Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 Br\u00e1hmans.\n\nLandholding castes. The preponderating influence of this class, under a Native government, sufficiently accounts for this result. Kanwars follow Br\u00e1hmans, but they hold chiefly in zamind\u00e1ri jurisdiction, and only in a few kh\u00e1lisa villages, adjoining the zamind\u00e1ris. Gonds have a considerable number of villages, chiefly, however, in the hilly tracts. Then Kurmis, Rajputs, Bair\u00e1g\u00eds, Bani\u00e1s, and Cham\u00e1rs hold about an equal number of villages. The proportion of Bair\u00e1g\u00ed and Bani\u00e1 villages is swelled by the fact of a taluka, in each instance, being held by a member of this caste, for Lormi, containing 103 villages, is held by a Bair\u00e1g\u00ed, and Tareng\u00e1, containing 145 villages, by a Bani\u00e1. Two or three other members of these communities hold several villages together, which they obtained as grants for cultivation under the Native government. Tel\u00eds and Mohammadans have a fair position as proprietors, the latter being instances of individuals holding several villages, obtained as reward for service in the old Bhonsl\u00e1 regiments. In the case of other castes no remarks are necessary, except to note how few Pank\u00e1s have obtained proprietary right;\u2014attributable to the\n\n* Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, vol. xxxv. part 2 (1866), p. 34.\nfact that, although forming so considerable an element in the population, they are largely devoted to the occupation of weaving. It is certainly strange that although this class forms about a sixth of the community, they should not have succeeded in obtaining one village in the kh\u00e1lsa parganas. Eighteen villages, shown as held by Sikhs, belong to one member of this community, who is a Banj\u00e1ra trader, and acquired his villages after the mutinies, when relinquished by their original holders.\n\nReference will now be made to some of the peculiarities of the Chhatt\u00edsgarh population as a whole, when compared with similar classes elsewhere. One prominent feature is the scantiness of apparel common to the whole cultivating community\u2014a cloth round the loins, and this often of meagre dimensions, constitutes generally a man's full dress. Those who have advanced a stage beyond this throw a cloth loosely over one shoulder, covering the chest, and assume an apology for a pagri by wrapping a cloth carelessly round the head, leaving the crown generally bare, as if this part of the person required special sunning and ventilation. Among women all the requirements of fashion are satisfied by one cloth, measuring from eight to twelve yards, one half of which envelopes the person in one fold from the waist to below the knee, hanging somewhat loosely. It is tightened at the waist, and then the remaining half is spread over the breast, and drawn across the right shoulder. Sometimes the cloth is left to droop down the back from the right shoulder, but in public it is generally carried over the head, open like a sheet, and then brought over the left shoulder and arm. There is a sculpture-like simplicity about the solitary garment worn by women, which is calculated to display a graceful figure to advantage, more especially on festive occasions, when those who can afford it appear arrayed in tas\u00e1r silk; but to Western ideas it seems more convenient than modest. The most common articles of adornment are bracelets of gold, silver, and coloured glass, according to the pretensions of each individual wearer; as also gold, silver, and bead necklaces. Ear-rings and nose-rings are not usual, nor, except among young Gond ladies, are toe-rings and anklets. By men a gold or silver bracelet is frequently worn; they also affect small ear-rings not a little, and a silver waistband is perhaps a comfortable agriculturist's highest ambition. The ordinary practice with all classes is to have three meals per diem\u2014rice and d\u00e1l at midday, rice and vegetables cooked with ghee in the evening, and rice gruel in the morning before commencing work. This rice is called \"b\u00e1s\u00ed,\" being simply the remains of the night's repast, filled up with water, and taken cold. Some men are said to get through three pounds of rice per diem. The castes who eat fish and flesh have of course a greater change of diet. Wheat is very little used by the community, and in fact flour-cakes are only prepared on special occasions. Sometimes rice is pounded and made into cakes, not unlike the oat-cakes of Scotland, and a similar process is adopted with the coarse-grained kodo. Then those who can afford it have an occasional spread of sweet things, and in most villages milk and gur are very common commodities, out of which a matron of resources can turn out morsels which are deemed marvellously inviting. On the whole, the great body of the people may be said to live comfortably and well, and, as regards quantity, will probably never enjoy greater abundance. The language spoken by the people is a corruption of Hindi, with an admixture of aboriginal words, somewhat confusing to a stranger; but it rests on a strictly Hindi basis, and there are comparatively few Persian words in use. The following words may be quoted as\nspecimens. Man and woman are called \"dauk\u00e1\" and \"dauki,\" a house is called a \"k\u00fari\u00e1,\" a fowl \"kukri,\" while instead of saying \"mat j\u00e1n\u00e1,\" or \"nahin j\u00e1n\u00e1\" (don't go), as in Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed, a Chhatt\u00edsgarhi would say \"jhanj\u00e9 bo;\" or if he were declaring that his field had been forcibly taken, he would never think of saying \"zam\u00edn ham\u00e1ri zabardast\u00ed le li\u00e1 hai,\" but would convey his grievance in the words \"bh\u00faen mor bar p\u00e1l\u00ed har l\u00eds.\" Sufficient has been said to show that the differences in terms are considerable, and this in a limited space is all that can be attempted.\n\nAmong the characteristics of the people their marvellous credulity is the most marked. Hemmed in by continuous hill ranges, their intercourse with the outer world has been limited, so that they still remain victims to the most gross and antiquated superstitions, which the steady contact with new ideas has gradually dispelled among more favourably situated communities. Every hill has its god, every stream its spirit; villages* have generally their protecting deity or deities, who are invariably supplicated when epidemics prevail, when murrain appears among the cattle, when drought threatens the crop, and on all occasions of misfortune or bereavement. A special priest invokes all these deities, excepting D\u00fal\u00e1 Deva, who at all times can be supplicated, and belongs to one of the aboriginal races, thus showing the origin of the superstition itself. He is ordinarily a Gond, and in virtue of his office is called a \"Baig\u00e1.\" The position is generally hereditary, and carries with it not unfrequently a plot of rent-free land, in addition to periodical fees. A successful Baig\u00e1, or perhaps more properly a Baig\u00e1 who has obtained a reputation for success, is a man of great influence, and any injunction he delivers will almost invariably be implicitly obeyed. The most public exemplification of this influence is in cases of witchcraft, for here the most melancholy consequences have resulted in several trials. A common instance is when cholera visits a village. First one falls, then another, and there is something so unaccountable in the origin of the disease, so mysterious in its selection of an apparently arbitrary route, while its attacks are so sudden and fatal, that we can be little surprised if, among an ignorant people, a state of almost abject despair follows its advent. In this temper of the community a Baig\u00e1 is summoned, and, after going through certain ceremonies, he declares what should be done. Sometimes it is a cock or a goat that has to be sacrificed to appease the local deity; and if this is unsuccessful, then the whole community temporarily deserts the village, leaving behind only the dying and the dead. At other times the Baig\u00e1 declares that a witch (locally known as a \"tonh\") is the cause of the suffering of the people. The adult males of the village are then assembled in solemn conclave, while the Baig\u00e1, sitting in their midst, proceeds to ascertain what unfortunate woman is guilty. Of course each individual Baig\u00e1 has his own particular procedure. One of the most noted in this district had two most effectual methods for checkmating the witches. His first effort was to get the villagers to describe the marked eccentricities of the old women of the community, and when these had been detailed, his experience soon enabled him to seize on some ugly or unlucky idiosyncrasy which\n\n---\n\n* The two most common local deities are \"Th\u00e1kur Deva,\" the Preserver of the village, who has often a snug little tabernacle, carefully thatched, made for him outside the village; and \"D\u00fal\u00e1 Deva,\" the Protector of the hearth, to whom a corner inside each house is set apart, and frequent offerings are made. Th\u00e1kur Deva requires annually a sacrifice of blood, while D\u00fal\u00e1 Deva is propitiated by an offering, however humble.\nindicated in unmistakeable clearness the unhappy offender. If no conclusion could be arrived at in this way, he lighted an ordinary earthen lamp (chiragh), and repeating consecutively each woman's name in the village, he fixed on the witch or witches by the flicker of the wick, when the name or names were mentioned. The discovery of the witch soon resulted in her being grossly maltreated, and under the Native government almost invariably in her death. Since the introduction of British rule these cases are becoming year by year rarer, but the belief itself remains strong and universal, and the same class of superstitions pervades everyday life. There is no sudden death that is not attributed to the malignity of some evil spirit. A lingering or strange sickness is often supposed to be occasioned by the glance of an evil eye, while any unfortunate family bereavement is in itself usually accepted as necessitating a change of residence, even though it involve the relinquishment of ancestral fields, and the severance of all early associations and ties. Of course the so-called witches come in for the blame of many misfortunes, and there are marked women in every neighbourhood, who obtain special credit for working charms in secret on their enemies, which inevitably result in sickness or death. The wildest tales are told of their power, and with such earnestness and circumstantiality, that even educated native officials from other districts almost invariably become converts to the popular idea. In some instances, where results have been verified by indubitable testimony, they can only be attributed to animal magnetism or mesmeric influence; and a case lately occurred in which an English police officer stated that he himself saw a girl lying senseless after having been handled by a reputed witch, the girl having been again resuscitated in his presence through the said witch's influence. If the officer in question was not imposed upon, or did not in any way misapprehend the facts, then this solitary example indicates some knowledge of mesmerism, as existing among special portions of the community.\n\nThe extreme credulity of the people exposes them at times to cruel hoaxes. A strange story is current in the Mungeli pargana of a Pank\u00e1 named Mangal, resident in Bhadr\u00e9li village, who some fifteen or twenty years ago gave out that a deity had taken possession of him. This was nothing strange, for both gods and devils are accused of constant interference with mortals. Mangal was credited with the power of curing diseases, and securing to his worshippers future happiness. He used to sit with a light before him, and his devotees approached, saluted, and touched his feet. He was literally inundated with followers, and the offerings of grain, cocoanuts, and such like gifts were something incredible. His influence was confined to a few short weeks, for his advent occurred about the cultivating season, and he had declared that good mens' crops would spring up without sowing. It appears that thousands of cultivators were fools enough to attach credence to this teaching, and, as viewed practically, this simply amounted to a loss of revenue. When the time for collection arrived, the Native government at once arrested Mangal, who was left to ponder over his departed greatness within the walls of the R\u00e1ipur jail. The belief in Mangal's powers vanished with his imprisonment, and against some of the more respectable men who were his dupes (notably the talukadar of Lormi) the whole affair remains a standing joke.\n\nAs strenuous efforts are being made for the education of the rising generation, the cloud of ignorant darkness which now envelopes the people must gradually disappear. The following return shows the number of schools and of children under instruction:\u2014\nWhen the total juvenile population is considered, this can only be regarded as a very small proportion undergoing tuition. The boys under fourteen exceed 188,000, and supposing that a fourth of these are of a teachable age and available for instruction, there are some 45,000 boys as possible pupils. Of these only 3,000 are being taught, so that a vast field exists over which to spread the benefits of education.\n\nAn allusion to crime may not be out of place, as showing that although the people are ignorant, they are not addicted more than their neighbours to crimes of violence. Murders are not numerous, and there has been no case of dacoity for a considerable period. In fact the following figures, from the Police Report of the Central Provinces for 1868, show that crimes of all kinds are less frequent in the Chhattisgarh division than in any other part of the province:\n\n| Population | No. of heinous offences | Petty thefts and burglaries | Total |\n|------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|-------|\n| N\u00e1gp\u00far division | 2,263,062 | 72 | 3,679 | 3,751 |\n| Jabalp\u00far do. | 2,024,645 | 61 | 4,181 | 4,942 |\n| Narb\u00e1d\u00e1 do. | 1,563,912 | 79 | 3,665 | 3,744 |\n| Chhattisgarh do. | 2,104,570 | 40 | 1,797 | 1,837 |\n\nThere are probably two causes which contribute to this result\u2014the degree of rude plenty which prevails, and the general abstemious character of the population; for it is worthy of note that the drinking classes are comparatively few, and even these, living among large masses who absolutely abstain, are insensibly influenced, and thus come to confine their indulgence to festive occasions, which are few and far between. There can scarcely be a population more submissive and obedient than the great bulk of the people in Chhattisgarh. Whether they are constitutionally timid, or a long course of oppression has created the feeling, is immaterial. Certain it is that they have a great dread of authority, and as they are incapable of distinguishing between a regular and irregular exercise thereof, they are liable to suffer for their meekness at the hands of unscrupulous subordinate officials. Any creature with a badge, or some such insignia of office, is quite a magnate in the interior, and will always be fed, usually obeyed, and often fee\u2019d. It cannot but follow that people so ignorant come to be oppressed, for they are afraid to complain, and the only effectual remedy is the gradual spread of intelligence, which will teach individuals to realise their position and rights. The injurious results of over-submissiveness are palpably evident in all roadside villages. Ordinarily the mere approach of a road should be a source of profit, for the constant passage along it creates\na demand for supplies and carriage, which would tend to enrich the resident community. But in Chhattisgarh it is considered a fatal calamity, and there is scarcely a roadside village that is not in a more or less unhappy condition, verging at times on absolute desertion. The reason is obvious. The people, instead of insisting on payment, have a constant drain on them, and it is only when their weakness has been painfully imposed upon, that they represent the fact, and have it remedied.\n\nTo the non-agricultural population the cheapness of living is a fertile source of comfort, and there are a considerable class of pensioners and others who, owing to this cause, have migrated from less favoured regions, and taken up their quarters in the district. With wheat and rice selling often at a maund and a half per rupee, and other articles of native consumption in proportion, a labouring man and family can live comfortably on one anna a day. The classes socially higher in the same way can secure, to an extent, luxury and plenty with means which elsewhere would necessitate stinting and anxiety. Beggars are altogether a rare commodity, and can scarcely ever be pressed hard for food. The greater wealth of the community is a feature which in the future may with certainty be calculated on, but it may be questioned whether the humbler classes will ever be so free from care as they are at present, in regard to the simple necessaries of life. The outward marks of prosperity are, however, few. The passion for display has not yet arisen, and even those, who have means, care not to erect imposing houses, or surround themselves with any of the outward marks of affluence. As the country has only been recently and partially opened out, there is doubtless less accumulated wealth here than elsewhere, and almost no really rich people exist. But hoarding in small sums is a universal habit, and with it all there is an amount of rude comfort among the agricultural population which any one moving among them cannot but perceive. Their grain-stores are generally well filled; cattle exist in great numbers; the luxury of a pony for locomotion is a very common feature; earthen plates have been largely displaced by metal vessels; at all festive gatherings a large portion of the agricultural community are seen to possess jewellery of a more or less expensive character, and on such occasions they are often arrayed in what may be regarded, for Chhattisgarh, as quite a superfluity of clothing; while marriages are said to have increased, and to involve a larger expenditure. These circumstances denote an advancing prosperity. The landholders, as a class, are not indebted, and they have had conferred on them the boon of proprietary right, equivalent, at present rates, to a sum of twenty l\u0101khs of rupees (\u00a3200,000), so that altogether the people may be regarded as in a comfortable and progressive condition. They require in fact only an outlet for their produce, to occupy a position which would compare, not unfavourably, with that of the agricultural classes of other districts in the province.\n\nThe chief wealth of the district consists in its agricultural produce. The adventurous carrier class (Banj\u0101r\u0101s), following their strings of bullocks through the hilly wilds, which shut in the Chhattisgarh plain, in order that they may return laden with grain, have not inaptly termed this \"the land of plenty\" (khalauti).* They find here a surplus produce, which from the absence\n\n* This is more commonly interpreted to mean \"the low country.\"\nof facilities for export, seems almost inexhaustible, for in a great number of villages they cannot fail to observe the prominent and capacious grain-stores, well raised above the ground, walled and thatched, and containing from fifty to two hundred cart-loads of the great staple, rice. Then wheat and oil-seeds and pulses are produced in great abundance, and there is a kind of reckless improvidence in many places in feeding, free of cost, all travellers who pass, that indicates a condition in which it may be said that want, using it in the sense of food, is almost unknown. Of the entire produce sixty-five per cent. is rice. It is grown on all soils, and the average yield is often enhanced more from the lie of the land than the quality of the soil. The prevalent soils are black, mixed, red, and sandy. The black soil, as has been often stated, is the debris of trap; the red is probably decomposed laterite; the sandy, as the name implies, represents deposits from sandstone rocks; while the mixed is allied to the soil, either black or other, which most preponderates in its composition. The black soil is of course the most valuable, because both spring and autumn crops can be grown on it. But it seems a disputed point whether the most abundant yield of rice is generally obtained from black or from red soil. The sandy soil again, when manured and irrigated, is well adapted for sugarcane and all kinds of garden produce, and is much prized, but there is too much percolation in it to suit the rice crop. Looking then at these main divisions of soil, it may be said that the western tracts of the district are the richest, being nearly all black soil. The centre has land of very mixed quality, while the whole eastern parganas are almost entirely (except in patches) either red or sandy soil. A peculiarity of rice-fields in Chhattisgarh is their extreme minuteness. In every village numbers of fields are found not exceeding a few poles, or about the dimensions of a public dining-table. The practice is said to have arisen from the impossibility of obtaining tenants, unless each received a share in the good or best-lying land. Thus land lying near the village is coveted because it is so easily worked and manured, and a low dip, because, when ridged, it best utilises the annual rainfall. These stretches then come to be very minutely divided. Again, now that the custom of small fields has become stereotyped, it is generally urged that in red soil the smaller the surface enclosed, the better the water is stored, and the larger the crop. Thus what originated for convenience is retained for profit. The reason may be that red soil does not retain moisture, though at the same time surface-water does not percolate freely through it. In soil like this it is therefore important to obtain as much surface-water as possible for rice, and this is effected by ridging-in small areas. This trouble is not taken with soil which retains moisture, and in which, if surface-water remains long, the crop is likely to rot. In fact it is always found that, where the fields are large, the soil is black, and that, where the converse is the case, it is on account of the peculiar attributes of the red soil. Under the present system of rice cultivation, small fields in Chhattisgarh are thus not only a convenience, but an absolute necessity.\n\nAnother peculiarity is the practice of changing fields. This would occur periodically, so that no tenants should monopolise the best land. The practice is not universal; it exists in some villages only. The want of attachment, however, to individual holdings is an almost universal feature, and a very trifle will often induce even a hereditary tenant to relinquish his land. The result is that there is little of that minute and persistent care which is so marked a feature in a peasantry\nattached to the soil. Few cultivators feel so deeply rooted as to devote extra labour to permanently enhancing the yield of their fields, and so cultivation generally comes to be desultory, and is carelessly carried out.\n\nWhere an agricultural population depends so entirely on a solitary crop, and that crop one which requires an abundant rainfall, each succeeding season becomes a period of uncertainty and anxiety. A failure of rain involves famine;\u2014a deficiency, widespread scarcity. It, however, fortunately happens that Chhatt\u012bsgarh, being girdled by hills, enjoys a fairly regular monsoon. Thus there are traditions of partial failure of crop, but no tradition of a famine; for if the absence of rainfall has blasted hopes in one quarter, the area is so extensive that at some other point the fall has been adequately abundant. Besides periodical showers, the rice-crop requires four heavy downpours, namely, one in each of the four monsoon months. The September one should be late in the month, and as this is often untimely or deficient, bumper harvests are the exception, not the rule. It is at this time, if bright sunny days persistently succeed each other, that heavy care is portrayed on every countenance, from a horrid dread that the whole season's labour will be lost. Then the village gods are piteously supplicated, while the elders find comfort in relating their experiences, and the weatherwise make their prophecies, scanning every cloud lest haply they may find a hopeful omen. At the same time the country is not entirely dependent on the regularity of the monsoon. There are, scattered over the district, some seven thousand tanks, which the forethought of succeeding generations has contributed to construct. Although not entirely available for watering the fields (for many are strictly preserved to provide water during the heats of summer for man and beast), yet a large number are utilised for purposes of irrigation, and thus some portion of the crop in numerous villages at all times comes to be saved.\n\nBesides rice the most common crops are kodo, wheat, pulses, oil-seeds, and cotton; jaw\u0101r\u012b is not cultivated. Kodo (*paepalum frumentaceum*) is a very poor staple, and has no market value. It is grown generally on inferior soils, and at the same time as rice. The yield, however, is much larger, always exceeding a hundred-fold. It is rarely grown for more than two years in the same land. Wheat, gram, and pulses are only grown on the best land, while oil-seeds and cotton are often produced on the light and poorer soils. Both of these are largely produced, and the yield of oil-seeds is considerable. The cotton, however, is generally inferior, from the character of the soil on which it is usually raised, and the returns are limited. The best cotton is found in the zam\u012bnd\u0101ris of Kaward\u0101 and Pandari\u0101, where the undulating stretches of black soil are eminently fitted for its production. It is never sown alone, but always mixed with arhar or kodo. Of regular r\u0101bf crops a large number of villages have none whatsoever, but where these exist they are tended with considerable care. For both wheat and gram the land is ploughed four times, and for the former some of the fields are regularly embanked to retain moisture and increase the yield. None of the r\u0101bf crops are either irrigated or manured. They are sown in October and November and reaped in March. In fact, excepting garden produce\u2014the favourite pursuit of M\u0101l\u012bs, Mar\u0101rs, &c.\u2014the only crop which is regularly both manured and irrigated is sugarcane. It entails an immense amount of labour, being frequently irrigated, some twelve times ploughed, and manured on two or three\ndifferent occasions. The few acres of sugarcane cultivation, however, which each village undertakes are raised by the joint efforts of the whole cultivating community. Each cultivator receives a small plot proportioned to the size of his general holding, the lion's share falling to the proprietor; and all labour together in preparing the field, tending the crop, and extracting the gur. In the western portion of the district there are villages which produce sugarcane without irrigation, but the crop is uncertain and scant. Instances also occur where it is raised without manure, but this is only in the vicinity of streams which overflow their banks in the monsoon, and leave a deposit that enriches the soil.\n\nIn this district one hears but little of the exhaustion of the soil. Year after year rice is produced in the same fields without any change of crop, or even an occasional fallow, and yet the yield is apparently uninfluenced. It seems from the statements of experienced cultivators that new land falls to the level of old in four or five years, and that, during this interval, the extra yield averages from twenty-five to thirty per cent. There is no further progressive deterioration. Rice is not an exhaustive crop, and then, as has been pointed out, the land is generally manured. This may account for the fact that rice is the only crop with which neither rotations nor fallows are practised. Where wheat is sown, it will be followed by gram or masur one year and then perhaps kodo. And where this is not done, after four or five years the land is left fallow to recover itself. Again, cotton is often succeeded by til or some other oil-seed, so that all through a regular rotation is adhered to, experience having taught the people that their soil is not rich enough, as in some of the Narbad\u00e1 districts, to yield steadily without a change of crop or a fallow, and manure not being available, as it is absorbed by the rice and sugarcane fields.\n\nThe mineral resources of this district are but little known, and owing to remoteness and inaccessibility are not likely to be developed for many years. In the vicinity of the Hasd\u00fa, coal crops up in several places, and it is probable that if a Railway ever be constructed from Calcutta, through the plains of Chhatt\u00edsgarh, to N\u00e1gpur, the Korb\u00e1 coal-beds would yield an invaluable supply of fuel. On the right bank of the Hasd\u00fa, near Korb\u00e1 itself, there is an exposed surface of coal extending for about a hundred yards, and in a drainage channel near this same bed it also crops up in several places. Again, some distance from Korb\u00e1, on the left bank of the Hasd\u00fa, there are the beds of two hill streams\u2014the Bij\u00e1kher\u00e1 and Mundjhari\u00e9\u2014in which coal appears near the villages of Kalw\u00e1 and Sankher\u00e1, and to such an extent that, walking up the Bij\u00e1kher\u00e1 rivulet, the coal is traceable for at least a mile. Exploration would doubtless lead to other similar discoveries. There has been no digging or searching, and what has been traced has simply resulted by the action of the annual rains exposing the surface. This being the case, it is only fair to conclude that the coaly region is very extensive, and if once regularly worked would yield an immense supply. What the quality of the coal is can only be pronounced after careful professional scrutiny. The surface coal is shaly and inferior, but this in itself is not a discouraging fact, for systematic borings might establish the utility of the lower beds. Until this is undertaken no opinion can be formed, and the question will probably remain undecided until the time arrives, by the opening out of the country, for a final verdict to be given. At present no attempt is made to work the coal, though\na few enterprising smelters use it at times for the manufacture of iron after the native fashion.\n\nIn the vicinity of all the hill ranges in the district iron ore is found, and its manufacture is confined to the zamindar\u00ed estates. As far as can be ascertained there are only some forty furnaces at work, the annual outturn of iron being about four hundred maunds. This is miserably inadequate for the requirements of the people, and the result is that a large importation occurs from Mandla and the Sambalpur zamindar\u00ed. With all this, prices range high, and the ordinary selling rate is not more than three seers per rupee, or say thirteen rupees per maund. The consumption of the district cannot be under twelve hundred maunds annually, two-thirds of which comes to be drawn from other tracts. The limited production of iron does not arise from a deficiency of the ore, but from an absence of the class called \"Agari\u00e1s,\" who are employed in its manufacture. If Gonds and other tribes would only acquire the art, they would find in it a fertile source of gain. The profession, however, is scarcely an inviting one, for although the native process of manufacture is extremely rude, the labour involved is very considerable. There is the charcoal to be made, and the ore to be collected. The selected ore is then taken and mixed with charcoal, and is placed in a clay furnace about three feet high. A regular current of air is kept playing on the furnace from the primitive pair of bellows worked by the feet. When the ore is smelted, the manufactured article comes rushing out in a lava-like stream from a crevice at the bottom of the furnace. It is then hammered and run into broad bars fit for sale. The iron which is made is of fair quality, but has no special reputation in the market.\n\nIn connection with mineral products it may not be quite out of place to mention quarries. The best-worked quarries are those near Bilaspur and Seorinhar\u00e1n, which contain sandstone excellently suited for building purposes, to an extent capable of meeting large requirements. Similar facilities exist at many points all over the district, were the people sufficiently advanced to appreciate structures of permanent masonry. For road-making there are everywhere large quantities of suitable gravel; but no regular beds of \"kankar\" (nodular limestone), which experience shows to be more durable, have yet been found.\n\nThe extensive forests of the district are situated in the zamindar\u00ed, and are private property, the only large tracts of government forest being the wastes spreading over the Lormi and Lamni hills on the north-west, and the Sonakh\u00e1n area on the south-east. Besides these two tracts there are several considerable patches of jungle, which have been reserved in the portion of the plain skirting the northern hills. The largest of these are the Kor\u00ed, Bij\u00e1pur, Bitkul\u00ed, and Pantor\u00e1 wastes. Again, out in the plain there are a few isolated patches of waste; of no value, however, except for grazing cattle. The total area of government waste, excluded from the private properties by the operations of the settlement department, is 443,500 acres, or 693 square miles. The chief blocks, as already noted, are Lormi and Lamni 190,269 acres, Sonakh\u00e1n and M\u00e1r\u00e1ji 97,503 acres, Kor\u00ed 20,776 acres, Bij\u00e1pur 48,571 acres, Bitkul\u00ed 25,509 acres, and Pantor\u00e1 13,604 acres. The annual revenue realised at present is about 6,000 rupees. The smallness of the forest revenue, compared with the extent of waste, arises from the fact that\nthe most valuable of the government forests are more inaccessible than some of the zamindari jungles, so that villages in the plain come to indent largely on these latter to meet their annual requirements. Thus the Lormi and Lamni forests are cut off by hills, while Sonakh\u00e1n is isolated by the deep waters and wide-spreading sands of the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed. The nearer jungles on the other hand having been hacked and hewed at for years, are considerably thinned, and do not now furnish adequate supplies to satisfy the wants of the whole community.\n\nS\u00e1l is the only valuable timber which exists in all the forests of the district in great quantities. Good timber of this description is therefore available almost to any extent.\n\nForest products. S\u00e1l too is much met with, but it is not generally of large size. Shisham and bijes\u00e1l are both scarce, while teak is almost unknown, except in the forest reserve of H\u00e1thib\u00e1ri near Sonakh\u00e1n. Of other building timber the most common trees in use are tend\u00fa, shisham, kaw\u00e1, dh\u00e1ur\u00e1, semar, anjan, khair, kalm\u00ed, and bijr\u00e1. There are some twenty other trees which are utilised, but their timber is very inferior. Besides building-timber, the supply of grass and bamboos in the forests is very extensive. Then the valleys of Lormi, Pendr\u00e1, M\u00e1t\u00edn, and Upr\u00f3r\u00e1 afford vast grazing grounds, watered by perennial springs, and verdant even in the heats of summer. Here the cattle from the plain find abundant pasture, and are only brought down when the monsoon has commenced. With edible roots and fruits the jungles are well stocked, and they are an immense resource to the hill tribes, who have not unfrequently to remain content with \"a dinner of herbs.\" The tamarind, the mhowa, the tend\u00fa, the ach\u00e1r, the j\u00e1mun, the gasto, the \u00e1unl\u00e1, and the bel are the fruits in ordinary use, and are the most palatable. Then for medicinal purposes instinct and experience have promoted the use of many plants, and those who are learned in their application are much resorted to. For fever, decoctions are made of n\u00edm, chinh\u00far, donjar\u00ed, and gur; for diarrhoea and dysentery, bel and gindel are used; for weakness, bohar, bari\u00e1rf, gursakrf, and kesarw\u00e1; for indigestion, \u00e1unl\u00e1, dandbehr\u00e1, and s\u00e9t\u00far; for rheumatism, bansam\u00ed and behr\u00e1; for headaches, jasm\u00edr and dasm\u00far, and so on through a host of simple remedies for all ordinary and general complaints.\n\nOf industrial products the most extensively in demand is lac. The insect covers the tiny branches of the kusam tree (schleichera trijuga) with its coral-like protuberances. The crusty material thus formed, including in its recesses several insects, constitutes the stick lac of commerce, and produces, when manufactured, the deep red dye so largely required. Each tree yields from twenty to thirty lbs., a portion being left for seed, or in other words to reproduce the material in demand, and the annual value of a tree runs from three to four rupees. As a consequence the \"kusam\" is very rarely cut down, and is invariably preserved as a valuable property. Following lac, resin is a product in considerable demand. This is extracted from the s\u00e1l tree (shorea robusta), which unfortunately has been generally ringed in the process instead of being punctured. Some magnificent forests have been thus destroyed, for the ringed trees speedily dry up, and then, when the annual conflagrations come, they are enveloped in the sweeping flame and augment its volume. It is truly melancholy to wander over the charred remnants of magnificent timber thus uselessly destroyed, and it is only to be hoped that in the future the mode of procedure hitherto prevalent in extracting resin will entirely disappear.\nOne interesting item of forest resource remains to be referred to\u2014the tasar cocoon, which supply the useful silk so esteemed by the community. The Bhumi\u00e1s and other hill men collect these during the monsoon, and are marvellously active and shrewd in finding them in the jungles. They are found chiefly on the s\u00e1j tree (*pentaptera glabra*). In the month of August the primitive huts of these wild races are invaded by rearers of the tasar worm, from the more open portions of the district. These men come to purchase, and a party usually consists of seven or eight persons. A sufficient stock having been obtained, these rearers return to their selected locality, which is a tract of stunted s\u00e1j trees, covering eight or ten acres near a village skirting the forest. Here in September they tie the cocoons to a series of strings, each string stretching from a branch of one tree to a different branch in another, the cocoons thus suspended looking from a distance like a great row of eggs. By degrees the moths cut through the cocoons, during which process they are closely watched, and after they have paired, the females are placed in earthen vessels (ghar\u00e1s), in which they lay their eggs and die. The males fly away. The eggs are kept in the huts of the people, generally in cloth, and incubated by heat. They are little round dots about the size of mustard seed. In eight or ten days the worm is formed, and as each female moth placed in the vessel deposits about a hundred eggs, a great outturn is obtained. The worms thus incubated are taken out and placed on s\u00e1j trees, on the leaves of which they feed. They are small tiny insects at first, but they grow in size till they attain the thickness of a man's finger, and are perhaps two and a half inches long. At this stage they are very prettily marked; but in three months they have attained their full size, and then commence their cocoons, which are finished in two days. It is quite an interesting spectacle to see these insects busily employed throwing one thread round their bodies and then another, until they are completely encased in their silken home. A period of some four months elapses, viz. from September to December, from the time the moth breaks out of the old cocoon to the formation by the freshly generated worm of the new one, through the processes of incubation, development, &c. The new cocoons are sold to the silk-weavers, who steep them in hot water, mixed with tamarind pods or leaves, in order to communicate to the thread additional strength and elasticity, when the thread is carefully wound off, and manufactured into the light-textured tasar silk. One piece requires on an average some 800 cocoons, and as the probable amount of silk woven may be estimated at 10,000 pieces, the annual supply, to admit of this, must be something like eight million cocoons, the outturn probably of some 80,000 moths. It is strange that the Kewats, who rear the worms, instead of depending annually on the Bhumi\u00e1s' supply from the wilds, do not themselves maintain a permanent stock to breed from. They urge that experience has not proved this process profitable; but the true reason probably is that it would entail too much system to satisfy their tastes. As it is, while employed in rearing they remain away from their homes, confine their diet to rice and salt, and depend on the prayers of the Bhumi\u00e1 \"Baig\u00e1s\" for success. The absence of this last element has in every instance, it is alleged, been followed by failure.\n\nThe following view of the trade of the district is tabulated from the Trade Statistic Returns for the last four years:\u2014\n\n[Table]\n### Imports\n\n|                | 1864-65 | 1865-66 | 1866-67 | 1867-68 |\n|----------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n|                | Maunds of 82 lbs. | Rupees. | Maunds of 82 lbs. | Rupees. | Maunds of 82 lbs. | Rupees. | Maunds of 82 lbs. | Rupees. |\n| Sugar          | 1,791   | 35,820  | 2,262   | 45,240  | 2,188   | 43,640  | 9,637   | 52,740  |\n| Metals and hardware | 2,927   | 1,04,703 | 1,285   | 47,115  | 2,822   | 94,451  | 2,969   | 1,09,853 |\n| English piece-goods | 721     | 64,169  | 310     | 27,590  | 1,841   | 1,18,229 | 1,269   | 1,11,941 |\n| Head           |         |         |         |         |         |         |         |         |\n| Cattle         | 14,220  | 1,27,980 | 16,112  | 1,45,008 | 35,565  | 3,30,085 | 10,268  | 92,899  |\n| Miscellaneous  | 9,237   | 1,29,298 | 5,941   | 83,173  | 15,338  | 1,16,659 | 7,522   | 1,05,308 |\n| Total          | 28,896  | 4,81,970 | 25,890  | 3,43,127 | 57,249  | 7,03,664 | 24,603  | 4,72,241 |\n\n### Exports\n\n|                | 1864-65 | 1865-66 | 1866-67 | 1867-68 |\n|----------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n|                | Maunds of 82 lbs. | Rupees. | Maunds of 82 lbs. | Rupees. | Maunds of 82 lbs. | Rupees. | Maunds of 82 lbs. | Rupees. |\n| Rice           | 544,744 | 5,44,744 | 134,099 | 134,099 | 106,848 | 1,06,848 | 86,591 | 86,591 |\n| Wheat          | 106,017 | 1,06,017 | 43,354  | 43,354  | 18,421  | 18,421  | 68,036 | 68,036 |\n| Other edible grain | 17,313  | 17,813   | 7,645   | 7,645   | 144     | 144     | 1,502  | 1,502  |\n| Cotton         | 13,771  | 1,86,023 | 15,312  | 1,99,056 | 1,724   | 22,312  | 12,621 | 1,64,073 |\n| Gur            | 12,479  | 49,916   | 4,058   | 16,312  | 4,386   | 17,544  | 793    | 2,373  |\n| Oil-seeds      |         |         | 60      | 120     | 45      | 90      | 90     | 180    |\n| Lac            | 26,111  | 4,17,776 | 17,721  | 2,83,536 | 6,169   | 98,704  | 9,752  | 1,56,033 |\n| Miscellaneous  | 4,408   | 48,488   | 12,428  | 1,36,708 | 6,067   | 60,787  | 5,059  | 56,069 |\n| Total          | 723,843 | 13,50,277 | 234,672 | 8,20,730 | 149,709 | 3,30,695 | 184,484 | 5,35,475 |\n\nIn the above table, for purposes of comparison, a uniform unit of value has been maintained for each item in all the years, adopting for this purpose average rates. The imports consist chiefly of sugar, metals, English piece-goods, and cattle. Salt is not shown, as the customs department registers this on its crossing from the coast, including in the return the whole of Chhattisgarh. The exports are mainly rice, wheat, other edible grains, and lac. The great year for the agriculturists here was 1864-65. They then exported over 650,000 maunds (100,000 quarters) of grain, compared with only 150,000 maunds during 1867-68, and 50,000 rupees' worth of gur compared with 3,000 rupees' worth in 1867-68. As a permanent feature, however, a large export cannot be calculated on, for so long as pack-bullocks remain the sole means of transport for produce, the grain from Chhattisgarh only repays carriage when prices westward have risen to a more than ordinarily high rate. Independent of grain the only other large agricultural product that is exported is cotton. The area under cotton cultivation is 83,371 acres, which at a low estimate yields twenty seers or forty lbs. of cleaned cotton per acre, or altogether 41,685 maunds of cotton per annum. The whole trade has a western tendency to the railway at Jabalpur, and, as has already been urged, to connect the Bilaspur district with so near a market is a matter of paramount local importance. Rather less than a fifth of the produce of the district has been calculated to be available for exportation, and of this only a fourth is recorded as having obtained a market. No statistics exist of the trade south via the Raipur district, and east via Sambalpur. The former is very limited, and the latter consists chiefly of wheat, gram, oil-seeds, and cotton. If this be estimated at 100,000 maunds per annum altogether, there still remains a lamentable deficiency; for while the country is capable of maintaining a produce trade of 50,000 tons annually, owing to its land-locked condition, the\ntrade carried on only amounts to some 14,000 tons. The lac trade represents an important item, the average export of the last four years being nearly 15,000 maunds, aggregating in value about two and a half lakhs of rupees. This is not, however, entirely from this district, but from all Chhattisgarh. The grain exports hitherto alluded to appertain properly to Bilaspur, because the Raipur grain export is to the south, mainly along the Great Eastern Road; but this is not the case with lac, which from both districts proceeds over the same lines to Mirzapur and Jabalpur. The stick-lac is purchased up by agents of firms at low rates, and must yield a large profit to the purchasers, compared with the small returns the actual collectors receive. No mere local resident, however, has found it a remunerative process to export on his own account, the manufacture of the dye being almost a monopoly. The whole business therefore is carried on by agents on the spot, who despatch the commodity at the instance of the firms employing them. The expansion of the trade is not a likely contingency, as the demand fluctuates, and the \"kusam\" trees on which the lac insects are fostered are somewhat limited in number.\n\nOf local industries the most important is the weaving trade. There are in the regular weaving trade some 6,000 looms.\n\nThe weaving trade. The average outturn of each loom is a hundred cloths a year, so that the aggregate outturn must be 600,000 dhoots, valued at one rupee each, or six lakhs of rupees. Then all the Pankha caste weave, in addition to cultivation, and nearly half the cloth in the district is made by them. There are among them about 12,000 looms, the average outturn of each being about forty cloths a year, giving a total of say 500,000 dhoots. They are generally small, and made for the cultivators, selling singly for about ten annas each, so that the aggregate value would be about three lakhs of rupees. The total number of cloths made must be at least eleven hundred thousand, valued at nine lakhs of rupees. Besides this some 10,000 pieces of tasar silk are manufactured annually, selling at from five to six rupees a piece. It is estimated that there are 600,000 persons in the district, requiring on an average two cloths each; this would be 1,200,000 dhoots; and now looking at the number of looms we find that the outturn approaches this limit. The estimate given may therefore be accepted as a very close approximation to the real extent of the weaving trade. The great majority of weavers are in comfortable circumstances, but nothing more. They make from two to three annas a day as the price of their labour, which, with grain cheap, is sufficient to support a family. The weavers of the fine cloths make from four to six annas a day, and this is the extreme limit.\n\nAdministration.\n\nThe revenues of the district for the year 1868-69 were\u2014\n\n| Land | Rs. 2,71,956 |\n|------|--------------|\n| Excise | ,, 8,922 |\n| Stamps | ,, 22,338 |\n| Forests | ,, 4,337 |\n| Assessed taxes | ,, 12,220 |\n\nThe executive staff consists of a deputy commissioner with two assistants at head-quarters, and tahsildars or sub-collectors at Bilaspur, Mungeli, and Seorinarain. The police station-houses are at Bilaspur, Mungeli, Seorinarain, Ratanpur, Surgaon, Lormi, and Sargagan.\nBILA'SPU'R\u2014The central revenue subdivision or tahsil in the district of the same name, having an area of 1,674 square miles, with 975 villages, and a population of 223,388 according to the census of 1866. The land revenue of the tahsil for the year 1869-70 is Rs. 1,01,917-2-0.\n\nBILA'SPU'R\u2014The head-quarters of the district of the same name, pleasantly situated on the south bank of the river Arp\u00e1. It has a population of 6,190 souls. The town is said to have been founded rather more than three hundred years ago by a fisherwoman named Bil\u00e1s\u00e1, from whom it takes its name. For a long period it consisted of only a few fishermen's huts, but about one hundred years ago one Kesava Pant S\u00faba, the manager of the district on the part of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, took up his residence here and began to build a fort. This fort was never completed, but a portion of it still exists on the banks of the river, at one extremity of the present town. It is a brick structure, in no respect imposing, and with no pretensions to architectural beauty. As the town became the residence of an important official, and the head-quarters of a military contingent, traders commenced to settle in it. Subsequently, however, the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s fixed their head-quarters at Ratanp\u00far, and Bilasp\u00far dwindled into comparative insignificance. It was in 1862 again constituted the head-quarters of a British district, and is now a rising town. The vicinity is well wooded; there are many gardens and mango-groves; and the view of the distant hills affords a pleasant prospect. The only buildings of any importance are those erected for government purposes. Bilasp\u00far is 69 miles N.N.E. of R\u00e1ip\u00far, 144 S.W.W. of Mandla, and 140 N.W. of Sambalp\u00far.\n\nBILIHRA\u2014An estate in the S\u00e1g\u00e1r district, about twelve miles south of S\u00e1g\u00e1r, consisting of five villages, with an area of fifteen square miles. As mentioned in the account of \"S\u00e1g\u00e1r,\" this estate was assigned by the Peshw\u00e1 to Prithv\u00ed Pat, the original possessor of S\u00e1g\u00e1r. It then comprised twelve villages, which were held at a quit-rent. His descendants remained in undisturbed possession till A.D. 1818, when this, with S\u00e1g\u00e1r, was ceded to the British. At that time Bah\u00e1dur Singh, an adopted son of M\u00e1n Singh, the last lineal descendant of Prithv\u00ed Pat, was in possession. With him an arrangement was made by the government that the quit-rent should be discontinued, and that seven villages out of the twelve should be fully assessed, leaving the remaining five rent-free for ever. The village contains 299 houses, with 1,331 inhabitants. There is a school here for boys.\n\nBILTARA'\u2014A small village in the Damoh district, ten miles and a half from Damoh on the Jok\u00e1i road. Between this and Damoh are no less than sixteen n\u00e1l\u00e1s, fifteen of which are bridged. Water can be obtained from a tank and from a well. The encamping-ground is tolerably good.\n\nBI'NA'\u2014A river which, taking its rise in the Bhop\u00e1l state, enters S\u00e1g\u00e1r in the south-western extremity, and flows almost due north, past R\u00e1hatgarh, where it is crossed by a large stone bridge of fourteen arches. It then turns in a westerly direction towards Bhop\u00e1l, forming the boundary between that state and S\u00e1g\u00e1r for about twenty-five miles, till it passes Eran, and from thence forms the boundary between S\u00e1g\u00e1r and Gw\u00e1l\u00edor, till it falls into the Betw\u00e1.\n\nBINATKA'\u2014In the S\u00e1g\u00e1r district, the chief village of a tract known by the name of \"Bin\u00e1tk\u00e1 P\u00e1tan.\" It is situated about twenty-four miles north of S\u00e1g\u00e1r, and contains 256 houses, with 848 inhabitants. The history of this village\nand tract till the year A.D. 1733 is the same as that of the state of Dh\u00e1mon\u00ed, of which they formed part. In that year R\u00e1j\u00e1 Chhatra S\u00e1l made over Bin\u00e1ik\u00e1 to the Peshw\u00e1, but on the death of the former, his son R\u00e1j\u00e1 Jagat R\u00e1j refused to ratify the transfer, and kept possession himself. Some five years afterwards the Peshw\u00e1 forcibly established his claim, and the tract thus became part of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 territory. The fort was built, and the village was much improved, during the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 occupancy by Vin\u00e1yak R\u00e1o, one of the Peshw\u00e1\u2019s governors of Sag\u00e1r. In the year 1818 the tract formed part of the territory ceded to the British government by the Peshw\u00e1. The tahs\u00edl head-quarters were held in this village from the year 1882 to 1861, having been removed thither from Dh\u00e1mon\u00ed. The fort has been for the most part destroyed since the removal of the tahs\u00edl to Band\u00e1. The village itself is one of no importance, though one of the largest in the Band\u00e1 subdivision. No trade of any kind is carried on. A weekly market is, however, held on Thursdays, at which provisions and cloths are brought for sale.\n\nBINDRA\u2019NAWA\u2019GARH\u2014One of the P\u00e1t\u00e1 group of chiefships attached to the R\u00e1jp\u00far district. It is situated to the south-west of Khari\u00e1r, and adjoins Narr\u00e1 and others of the south-eastern zamind\u00e1ris of Chhatt\u00edsgarh. Only a small proportion of the area is under cultivation. The chief is a Gond by caste.\n\nBIRUL\u2014A large village in the \u00c1rv\u00ed tahs\u00edl of the Wardh\u00e1 district, containing 1,949 inhabitants, chiefly cultivators and oil-pressers. It lies about nineteen miles west of Wardh\u00e1. The village mud fort, now in disrepair, was built by the Desmukh family who founded the village some two hundred and fifty years ago, and still retain a share in it. There is a village school here.\n\nBISNUR\u2014A large village in the \u00c1rv\u00ed tahs\u00edl of the Wardh\u00e1 district, containing 1,493 inhabitants, chiefly cultivators. It is situated on the bank of the river Wardh\u00e1, forty-five miles north-west of Wardh\u00e1. The road from Amr\u00e1ot\u00ed to N\u00e1gpur enters the Wardh\u00e1 district at Bisnur, so a police outpost has been established here to guard the traffic. The Bisnur fort has recently been converted into a sar\u00e1\u00ed. There is a good village school, and a small weekly market is held here every Friday.\n\nBOR\u2014A stream which rises in the N\u00e1gpur district and enters the Wardh\u00e1 district near Hingni. Thence it flows past the town of Sel\u00fa and joining the Dh\u00e1m flows into the Wan\u00e1.\n\nBOR\u00c1SAMBAR\u2014A chiefship which formerly belonged to the cluster of states known as the eighteen Garhj\u00e1ts, and is now classed among the ordinary kh\u00e1lsa zamind\u00e1ris attached to the Sambalp\u00far district. It is about forty miles long by twenty broad, thus having an area of some eight hundred square miles. About one-half is cultivated, and the remainder is jungle and waste. The soil is light and sandy, like the rest of the country in this portion of the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed valley. A long range of hills, which do not, however, rise over 2,200 feet above the level of the sea, forms a natural boundary to the northward between this state and Phuljhar. A still more continuous and lofty range, of which the height varies from 2,000 to near 3,000 feet, forms the boundary between Bor\u00e1samb\u00e1r and P\u00e1t\u00e1na. Nearly one-half of the state is covered with forest. Teak is scarcely ever met with, but s\u00e1l (shorea robusta), s\u00e1j (pentaptera glabra), dh\u00e1ur\u00e1 (conocarpus latifolia), tend\u00fa (diospyros melanoxylon), khalir (acacia catechu), and many other useful woods, as also lac and cocoons of the tasar silkworm, are common. The principal river is the Ong, a tributary of the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed; it rises in the hill range to the westward in the Khari\u00e1r\nzam\u00ednd\u00e1ri, and flows through the whole length of Bor\u00e1s\u00e1mbar from west to east. There is nothing deserving the name of a road in the whole state, but from Khari\u00e1r (Th\u00e1not) there is a track, a good deal used by Banj\u00e1r\u00e1s. This is clearly enough defined, but a laden cart could not go along it. The climate is similar to that of Sambalp\u00far. Tigers, panthers, bears, and wild buffaloes are numerous.\n\nBy the last census (1866-67) the population is shown at 19,203 souls. The principal agricultural classes are the Kolt\u00e1s, Binjh\u00e1ls, Saur\u00e1s, Khonds, and Gonds. There are also a few Br\u00e1hmans, and a sprinkling of the artisan classes. The Binjh\u00e1ls have customs somewhat similar to the Gonds, and have also the same type of countenance, but they are not recognised by any of the tribes of Gonds in these parts as clansmen. It is supposed that they have immigrated from the westward, i.e. from the great Vindhyan range of hills. The manufactures are limited to iron implements and coarse cloths; rice is the chief agricultural product, but the pulses, oil-seeds, sugarcane, and cotton are also grown. The revenue is estimated roughly at about Rs. 2,000 per annum in cash, but nazr\u00e1na payments in kind, &c. would probably increase this by another thousand rupees at least. The chiefship consisted originally of only a few villages, and was known by the name of A'tgarh. By degrees the family, which was a very warlike one, increased in power, and acquired territory from the neighbouring chiefships of Phuljh\u00e1r and P\u00e1tu\u00e1, till Bor\u00e1s\u00e1mbar became an important state, and was deemed worthy of being included amongst the Garbh\u00e1t cluster. It has been in the family of the present holder for some twenty-eight generations.\n\nBORI\u2014A thriving village in the N\u00e1gpur district, on the left bank of the river Wan\u00e1, and lying between the Great Southern Road and the Railway, about eighteen miles from N\u00e1gpur. The population, amounting to 3,371 souls, is mostly employed in agriculture, or in weaving and dyeing country cloths. The Rang\u00e1r\u00eds (dyers) are an important section of the people. Cloths dyed at Bor\u00ed are in especial request, as the dye, of a red brick colour, is very durable. This quality the dyers ascribe to properties possessed by the waters of the Wan\u00e1. There are several fine groves to the north of the town, and some good gardens. Near the railway station is a commodious sar\u00e1i, lately built, and on the Great Southern Road is a good travellers\u2019 bungalow. There is also a government school here. The town was founded by one Safdar Kh\u00e1n, a Path\u00e1n silahd\u00e1r of Bakht Buland. It remained in his family for seventy-five years. It was afterwards held by Main\u00e1 B\u00e1\u00ed Nimb\u00e1lkar\u00edn, who, with a garrison of two hundred men, successfully held her fortress against three raids of the Pindh\u00e1r\u00eds.\n\nBORI\u2014A small forest tract of some thirty square miles in extent, situated south of the Pachmar\u00ed range of hills in the Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 district, and containing some fine teak and other timber. Plantation operations have been commenced in this forest.\n\nBOTEWAHI\u2014A river in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district. It rises in the eastern slopes of the Perz\u00e1g\u00e1rh hills, and after an easterly course of twenty-eight miles falls into the Waingang\u00e1 at Ranmanchan. This stream never dries, and the water is considered peculiarly good for drinking purposes. During the rains its clear current can be traced flowing in, but not intermingling with, the muddier volume of the Waingang\u00e1.\nBRAHMAPURI\u2014The north-eastern revenue subdivision or tahsil in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, having an area of 1,905 square miles, with 449 villages, and a population of 158,114 according to the census of 1866. The land revenue of the tahsil for the year 1869-70 is Rs. 87,802.\n\nBRAHMAPURI\u2014A municipal town in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, and the headquarters of the Brahmapuri tahsil, situated eighty miles north-north-east of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1, in a bend of the Waingang\u00e1. It contains 1,358 houses, and is more a place of residence for the neighbouring landholders than a trading mart. It manufactures, however, fine cotton cloth and thread, excellent brass and copper utensils, and good driving-carts. The town is prettily situated on red gravelly soil, and surrounded with picturesque groves and undulating rocky ground. In the highest part of it is an old fort, the walls of which have been levelled, making a spacious place, from which the whole of the surrounding country is seen stretched out, and in this square stand the government school-house, the tahsil court-house, and the police station-house; while it is hoped before long to complete the work by a handsome tank with a broad flight of steps. There are also here a post-office, a female school, and a branch dispensary. The people are chiefly Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s.\n\nBURHA\u2014The present head-quarters station of the B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t district; well situated on high and dry soil, about ten miles to the north of Hatt\u00e1, and a mile from the Waingang\u00e1. On the north-east and south sides it is sheltered by large groves of mango trees. Before the country lapsed to the British government a kam\u00e1visd\u00e1r or government agent had his head-quarters at this place. At the census of 1866 the population amounted to 1,206 souls, but it has since considerably increased. There is no trade peculiar to the place, the inhabitants being principally agriculturists.\n\nBURHA\u2014At present the only tahsil in the B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t district, having an area of 2,822 square miles, with 859 villages, and a population of 170,964. The land revenue of the tahsil is for the year 1869-70 Rs. 67,987, but the total revenues amount to Rs. 1,18,762. A n\u00e1ib tahsild\u00e1r is stationed at Parasw\u00e1r\u00e1 on the tableland.\n\nBURHANPUR\u2014The southern revenue subdivision or tahsil in the Nim\u00e1r district, having an area of 1,225 square miles, with 133 villages, and a population of 68,914 according to the census of 1866. The land revenue for the year 1869-70 is Rs. 63,924.\n\nBURHANPUR\u2014A town in the Nim\u00e1r district, situated in latitude 21\u00b018' and longitude 76\u00b020', on the north bank of the river Tapt\u00fa, and distant forty-one miles south by west from Khandw\u00e1, the head-quarters of Nim\u00e1r, and two miles from the Great Indian Peninsula Railway station of L\u00e1lb\u00e9gh. It was founded about A.D. 1400 by Nas\u00edr Kh\u00e1n, the first independent prince of the F\u00e1r\u00fak\u00ed dynasty of Kh\u00e1ndesh, and called by him after the famous Shekh Burh\u00e1n-ud-d\u00edn of Daulat\u00e1b\u00e1d. It was held by eleven princes of this dynasty for two hundred years till A.D. 1600, when the kingdom of the F\u00e1r\u00fak\u00eds was annexed by the Emperor Akbar. During this time it was repeatedly sacked by the rival Mohammadan princes of the Deccan, and never seems to have attained to any great state of magnificence. Of the earlier F\u00e1r\u00fak\u00ed works no traces now remain, except a pair of minarets of rude unshapely form in the citadel called the B\u00e1dsh\u00e1h Kil\u00e1. An old I'dg\u00e1h near the\ntown is attributed to the fifth of the line, A\u2019dil Kh\u00e1n.* The tombs of this prince and of some of his successors are also in tolerable preservation, and though not remarkable for great architectural beauty are curious examples of the style of that period. The twelfth F\u00e1r\u00fak\u00ed r\u00e9j\u00fa, A\u2019T\u00ed Kh\u00e1n, greatly improved the city, and built the handsome J\u00e1mia Masjid, still in excellent preservation. The city was greatly extended and embellished during the reigns of Akbar and his successor on the throne of Delhi. In the \u201cA\u2019\u00edn-i-Akbari\u201d it is described as a \u201clarge city with many gardens, in some of which is found sandal-wood, inhabited by people of all nations, and abounding with handicraftsmen.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the summer the town is covered with dust, and during the rains the streets are full of mud and stone.\u201d It formed the seat of government of the Deccan provinces of the empire till the reign of Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n, when (A.D. 1635) it was transferred to Aurang\u00e1b\u00e1d in the Deccan, after which the city was the capital of the large s\u00faba of Kh\u00e1ndesh. The holder of this government was usually a prince of the royal blood. The first was Prince D\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e9l, who drank himself to death here in A.D. 1605. In 1614 Sir Thomas Roe, ambassador from James I. of England to the Great Moghal, thus describes his visit to Prince Parv\u00edz, son of Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr, governor at Burh\u00e1np\u00far \u2020:\n\n\u201cThe cutwall, an officer of the king so called, met me well attended, with sixteen colours carried before him, and conducted me to the seraglio where I was appointed to lodge. He took his leave at the gate, which made a handsome front of stone; but when in, I had four chambers allotted to me, like ovens and no bigger, round at the top, made of bricks in the side of a wall, so that I lay in my tent; the cutwall making his excuse that it was the best lodging in the town, as I found it was, all the place being only mud cottages, except the prince\u2019s house, the chan\u2019s, and some few others. I was conducted by the cutwall to visit the prince, in whose outward court I found about a hundred gentlemen on horseback waiting to salute him on his coming out. He sat high in a gallery that went round, with a canopy over him, and a carpet before him. An officer told me as I approached that I must touch the ground with my head bare, which I refused, and went on to a place right under him railed-in, with an ascent of three steps, where I made him reverence, and he bowed his body: so I went within, where were all the great men of the town, with their hands before them like slaves. The place was covered overhead with a rich canopy, and under foot all with carpets. It was like a great stage, and the prince sat at the upper end of it. Having no place assigned, I stood right before him, he refusing to admit me to come up the steps, or to allow me a chair. Having received my present, he offered to go into another room, where I should be allowed to sit; but by the way he made himself drunk out of a case of bottles I gave him, and so the visit ended.\u201d\n\nTavernier passed through Burh\u00e1np\u00far (or as he wrote it, Brampour) in 1641, and again in 1658 on his journeys between A\u2019gra and Surat. This is how he writes of it in 1658 \u2021:\n\n* The F\u00e1r\u00fak\u00eds were all entitled Kh\u00e1n, a designation bestowed on them by the King of Gujr\u00e1t, to whom they paid allegiance as suzerain; hence, according to some authorities, the name of their country, Kh\u00e1ndesh.\n\n\u2020 Pinkerton\u2019s Voyages and Travels, vol. viii. p. 5.\n\n\u2021 Tavernier\u2019s Travels in India, Part II. Book I. p. 31, Edition 1678 (London).\n\"It is a great city, very much ruined, the houses being for the most part thatched with straw. There is also a great castle in the midst of the city, where the governor lives. The government of this province is a very considerable command, only conferred upon the son and uncle of the king. There is a great trade in this city, and as well in Brampour as over all the province; there is made a prodigious quantity of calicuts, very clear and white, which are transported into Persia, Turkey, and Muscovia, Poland, Arabia, to Grand Cairo, and other places. There are some which are painted with several colours, with flowers, of which the women make veils and scarfs; the same calicuts serve for coverlets of beds and for handkerchiefs. There is another sort of linen which they never dye, with a stripe or two of gold or silver quite through the piece, and at each end from the breadth one inch to twelve or fifteen, in some more, in some less, they fix a tissue of gold, silver, and silk intermixed with flowers, whereof there is no wrong side, both sides being as fair the one as the other. If these pieces, which they carry into Poland, where they have a vast utterance, want at each end three or four inches at the least of gold or silver, or if that gold or silver become tarnished in being carried by sea from Surat to Oormus, and from Trebizan to Mangala, or any other parts upon the Black Sea, the merchant shall have much ado to put them off without great loss. He must take care that his goods be packed up in good bales that no wet may get in, which for so long a voyage requires great care and trouble. Some of these linens are made purposely for swath-bands or sashes, and those pieces are called orris. They contain from fifteen to twenty ells, and cost from a hundred to a hundred and fifty rupees, the least not being under ten or twelve ells. Those that are not above two ells long are worn by the ladies of quality for veils and scarfs, of which there is a vast quantity vended in Persia and Turkey. They make at Brampour also other sorts of cotton linen, for indeed there is no province in all the Indies which more abounds in cotton.\"\n\nThe city is shown by the remains of its mosques, houses, &c. to have extended, at the height of its prosperity under the Moghals, over an area of about five square miles, with a circumference of about 10\u00bd miles. It was plentifully supplied with pure water by a system of water-works exhibiting considerable skill in their construction. There are eight sets of these still to be traced in the neighbourhood. Two of these were channels led off from running streams, partly under and partly above ground. The channels of both are now destroyed, but the dam on the Ut\u00e1ul\u00ed river, south of the city, still forms a fine sheet of water. The remaining six consisted of a number of wells, connected by a subterranean gallery, and so arranged as to catch the percolation of the water from the neighbouring hills towards the centre of the valley. When a sufficient supply has thus been obtained, it is led off in a masonry adit pipe to its destination in the city or its neighbourhood. One set, called the Ph\u00fat\u00e1 Band\u00e1ra, supplied the palace and the centre of the city, and still supplies the greater part of the town. Another, called T\u00edrkhat\u00fa, was made for a suburban garden called L\u00e1lb\u00e1gch. These were both made about A.D. 1640. Three more go to the town of Bah\u00e1durp\u00far, a suburb of the city built by Bah\u00e1dur Kh\u00e1n, the last of the F\u00e1r\u00fak\u00eds, and were constructed between 1690 and 1710. The last of the six goes to a palace erected by R\u00e1o Ratan, r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Haraut\u00ed, who was for some time governor of the city in the reign of Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr. All these channels, where they run underground, are furnished at short intervals with tall hollow columns of masonry rising to the level of the water at the source of the works. They seem to have\nbeen manholes to give access to silt traps, and may have been designed for other purposes as well, regarding which authorities seem to differ. They form a marked feature in the plain around Burh\u00e1np\u00far. The modern city is confined to a much smaller area than this, and is surrounded by a brick wall erected by the Niz\u00e1m A'saf Jah in A.D. 1731. It has numerous bastions, and nine gateways, but does not seem to have been designed to resist artillery. The circumference is about 5\u00bd miles, enclosing an area of 1\u00bd square miles. All the architectural remains of any note, comprising a portion of the B\u00e9dsh\u00e1h kil\u00e1 or citadel, a pleasure-house called the \u00e1h\u00fa kh\u00e1na (deer park) on the south side of the Tapt\u00ed, and numerous mosques and tombs, belong to the period of Moghal rule, and form altogether an exceedingly meagre display, considering the long period during which the city was the residence of princes and nobles. Almost the only one of any merit is the tomb of one Sh\u00e1h Naw\u00e1z Kh\u00e1n, son of the famous Abd-ul-Rah\u00edm Kh\u00e1n (khan\u00e1n\u00ed), a soldier of fortune who married his daughter to the Emperor Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n, and afterwards lived the life of a recluse at Burh\u00e1np\u00far. The tomb was built during his lifetime, and is a really handsome structure.\n\nBurh\u00e1np\u00far continued to play an important part in the wars of the empire, particularly in the reign of Aurangzeb. It was plundered in A.D. 1685 by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, just after that prince had left it, with an enormous army and magnificent \u00e9quipage, to subjugate the Deccan. Repeated battles were thereafter fought in its neighbourhood, until in A.D. 1719 the demands of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s for the \"chauth\" or one-fourth of the revenue were formally conceded. In A.D. 1720 A'saf Jah Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk seized the government of the Deccan, and thereafter resided much at Burh\u00e1np\u00far, where he died in A.D. 1748. He was interred, however, at Aurh\u00e1np\u00far. In 1760 Burh\u00e1np\u00far was ceded by the Niz\u00e1m to the Peshw\u00e1 after the battle of Udgl, and in 1778 was transferred by him to Sindi\u00e1. In A.D. 1803 the army under General Wellesley took Burh\u00e1np\u00far and A'sirgarh; but by the treaty of Surj\u00ed Anjang\u00e1on, concluded in 1804, these places were restored to Sindi\u00e1. In 1860-61 Burh\u00e1np\u00far and the surrounding mah\u00e1ls were ceded by Sindi\u00e1 in consequence of some territorial arrangement, since when the city of Burh\u00e1np\u00far and the pargana of Zain\u00e1b\u00e1d became part of the district of Nim\u00e1r. It is now the residence of an assistant commissioner and sub-collector (tahsildar). There is a post-office in the city, and a travellers' bungalow near the railway station at L\u00e1lbg\u00e1h, two miles north of the town. The L\u00e1lbg\u00e1h is a finely-wooded park, well supplied with roads, nurseries of trees, flower beds, and vegetable gardens. It is always open to the public.\n\nThe city is one of the principal seats of the Bohr\u00e1 trading community\u2014a Gujar\u00e1t\u00ed Mohammadan sect. A mull\u00e1, subordinate to the chief mulla at S\u00farat, resides here. The Bohr\u00e1 burial-place, though celebrated, has nothing architectural to recommend it.\n\nBurh\u00e1np\u00far has long been declining. The removal from it of the seat of native government is one cause of this. Another is the return of peaceful times, which have induced many cultivators of the neighbouring lands, who resided within the walls for protection, to move nearer to their fields. A third is the advent of the Railway, which has knocked Burh\u00e1np\u00far on the head as an entrep\u00f4t for the trade between M\u00e1lw\u00e1, the Upper Narbad\u00e1 valley, and the Deccan. Another, and the\none usually adduced as the sole cause, is the falling off in the demand for the rich fabrics of gold and silks, for the production of which the city was long famous, owing to the breaking up of so many native courts. It now contains 8,000 masonry houses, and a population of 34,137, most of whom are dependent in one way or other on the wire-drawing and cloth-weaving industries of the place, which merit some description. They have already been referred to above as having formed the basis of a highly important trade to places as distant even as Turkey and Poland, about the middle of the seventeenth century. They are said to have continued in high prosperity till the Mohammadan power began to wane before the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, early in the eighteenth century, when they began to decline. The more recent introduction of English fabrics has supplanted here, as elsewhere, the native production of the \"fine, clear calicuts\" mentioned by Tavernier, and now the industry is confined to the manufacture of fine cotton and silk fabrics interwoven with the gold-plated silver-thread drawn in the city, and to the coarser cotton goods, which have not yet been supplanted in the estimation of the people by Manchester piece-goods.\n\nThe value of the fine fabrics depends mainly on the purity of the metals employed in the composition of the wire, and to secure this the wire-drawing has always been kept under government inspection. A hereditary tester called the \"chaukas\" received and assayed all the silver and gold brought to the \"taks\u00e1l\" or mint (where the Burh\u00e1npur rupee was also coined), and here the wire was drawn out to a certain degree of fineness before being allowed to pass again into the hands of the manufacturers\u2014an arrangement still continued by us. The silver after testing is cast into the shape of a square ingot (p\u00e1s\u00e1), weighing from thirty-two to sixty tol\u00e1s, and measuring about two feet long and 1\u00bd inch square, and on this a duty amounting to Rs. 2-6-9, including the fees of the chaukas and some other servants of the place, was exacted during Sindi\u00e1's tenure of Burh\u00e1npur. There were three other places in the neighbourhood where wire-drawing was then carried on, two being in the neighbouring British territory. The duties in these places were somewhat lower than at the Burh\u00e1npur taks\u00e1l. When the city came under our administration the p\u00e1s\u00e1 was fixed at sixty tol\u00e1s (of 180 grains troy each) weight of silver, and the taks\u00e1l duty at three per p\u00e1s\u00e1, subsequently reduced to one-eighth. Two of the four taks\u00e1ls were also then abolished, and the drawing now takes place only at Burh\u00e1npur, and Lodh\u00edpur\u00e1, a suburb of the old city. The silver bars are covered with a thin gold leaf weighing from four to forty-two m\u00e1sh\u00e1s (of fifteen grains troy each) to each p\u00e1s\u00e1, that is from about half to six per cent on the amount of the silver. The number of m\u00e1sh\u00e1s employed is called the \"rang\" (colour) of the wire. The adhesion appears to be effected purely by mechanical skill on the part of the workmen called \"P\u00e1s\u00e1 T\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s.\" It is then passed by the same workmen through a series of holes in steel plates of diminishing size, by manual power, applied by means of a spoked wheel of the rudest construction. It is passed through forty of these holes before it leaves the taks\u00e1l, and is then reduced to about the size of an ordinary sodawater wire. Thence it goes into the hands of another set of operatives called T\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s, who still further reduce it through a gradation of forty more holes, the last of which is as fine as a human hair. Their apparatus is of somewhat more delicate construction, but the work requires neither the same skill nor hard work as the first operation. The wire is drawn by them down to various degrees of fineness, according to the work for which it is destined. The round wire is then given to the Chapr\u00ed\u00e1s, who flatten it into an almost impalpable film, by hammering between two polished steel surfaces, an operation requiring, it is said, superior skill. In this state it is termed \"b\u00e1dl\u00e1,\" and is used for some few\nsorts of work. The greater part of it has, however, to be spun into a thread along with silk, before being woven up. This is done by persons called Bit\u00e1s, who use no sort of apparatus for the purpose, excepting a couple of wooden spindles twirled by the hand. Indeed the beauty of the result obtained by such primitive implements must strike every one with amazement. The layer of gold on the finest wire must be of almost inconceivable thinness. The mixed thread is called \"kal\u00e1bat\u00fan,\" which is woven into the kinkh\u00e1bs and other brilliant fabrics worn by rich natives on high occasions. It is partly exported as thread from Burh\u00e1npur, and partly made into cloth in the city. In either case an export duty of four per cent ad valorem was levied on it by Sindi\u00e1's government, which has of course been taken off by us. The wire-drawers were originally Path\u00e1ns introduced from Upper India by the Emperor Akbar, but now all castes work at the trade. The wages of the most numerous of the classes engaged in this industry are extremely low, varying from about three to six rupees per mensem, or about one-half the ordinary wages of a labourer on the railway works. The P\u00e1s\u00e1 T\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s get about Rs. 1-8 a day; but their work is much more severe, and they do not get steady employment.\n\nAt the recent census (1866) the number of persons employed in this work was set down at\u2014\n\n| Wire-drawers | Flatteners | Kal\u00e1bat\u00fan spinners |\n|--------------|------------|--------------------|\n| 601          | 411        | 412                |\n\nThe cloth-weaving business of the city is quite distinct from the operation of drawing the wire and spinning the kal\u00e1bat\u00fan thread above described. The fabrics are of many different sorts, many of them of great beauty. Kinkh\u00e1b (vulgarly kincob), which is of mixed silk and gold thread, is now little made in Burh\u00e1npur; the Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d and Ben\u00e1ras articles, from being produced both cheaper and nearer the great markets for such stuffs, having driven it out of the field. The same may be said of mahr\u00fa\u00e1\u2014a fabric of silk warp with the woof of cotton thread wrought with a pattern in kal\u00e1bat\u00fan; though made to a small extent, it is greatly inferior to the produce of Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d. The chief fabrics still made in the city are zar\u00ed\u2014a very rich light stuff in which the flattened wire is interwoven with silk in the warp, with a thread woof, chiefly made up into scarves and s\u00e1ris worn by females on wedding and other high occasions. Sel\u00e1ri is half silk and half thread, with brilliant edging and borders of silk and gold thread, mostly in the form of s\u00e1ris and dopatt\u00e1s. Pit\u00e1mbar, all silk with the same edging, is a better sort of the same. Turbans, sashes, &c. are made in all these fabrics. The gold thread also is much woven up with silks into rich borders and edgings, exported to be attached to the cloth manufactures of other places. The silk for these cloths is all imported; it is mostly from China, generally spun and dyed in fast colours at Puna; a little, however, is spun in the city from the material imported raw. The cotton-thread used is extremely fine, and is both English and made on the spot. The former costs in Burh\u00e1npur exactly one-fourth of the latter, but it is greatly inferior both in strength and cleanness. The closely-twisted native thread breaks with a sharp crack, while the English article, from its fluffy open character, parts without any noise. The people attribute this in part to the different nature of the cotton used, the indigenous fibre being hard though short, while the English yarn is made from the much-desired \"long soft staples.\" The English thread, from its greatly superior cheapness, has, however, completely supplanted the native for all but the finest stuffs. The city thread is spun by the families of the\nweavers and others, the best being produced by the Bal\u00e1h\u00ed (Dher) caste. A coarser thread is generally spun throughout the country by the women of almost every caste. It is woven into every description of common cloth by the Burh\u00e1npur weavers, even the best of them, when out of fine work, having to take to the commoner stuffs. The latter now greatly preponderate in quantity, and it is said that every day the demand is getting smaller for the finer qualities. It is not difficult to account for this. The supersession by the rough and ready Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s of the luxurious Mohammadan princes and nobles was probably the first blow to the trade. The courts of Sind\u00eda and the Bhonsl\u00e1 R\u00e9j\u00e1 of N\u00e1gpur were, after them, the greatest customers for rich goods; and both of these have now been lost, the former having ceased to patronise Burh\u00e1npur since its transfer to us, while the same articles can be got cheaper in Upper India, and the N\u00e1gpur court having ceased to exist. But besides the diminution of general demand for such stuffs, the Burh\u00e1npur produce is at a disadvantage compared with other seats of the same industry. The neighbourhood does not produce nearly enough food for the supply of itself and the city, and nearly all the grain, gur, condiments, &c. used have to be imported from considerable distances. Prices therefore range very high in Burh\u00e1npur, and besides, the materials\u2014silk, silver, and gold\u2014have to be brought further, and the goods have to be taken a greater distance to market than those of many other places. It is not to be wondered at then that the commoner stuffs used nearer at hand, and by a lower class of people, are chiefly made. The increased wealth of the mass of the people, due to the cotton demand and other causes, has recently somewhat revived the demand even for fine goods (as shown by the amount of duty received at the taks\u00e1ls), and it is not hopeless to expect that, as this wealth increases, Burh\u00e1npur may at least cease to decline as a manufacturing town, if it does not actually recover its old place.\n\nThe average earnings of the weavers range from about five to ten rupees a month, besides what their families earn by spinning, dyeing, and odd work connected with the trade. They are thus, it appears, a good deal better off than the operatives connected with the manufacture of kal\u00e1b\u00e1t\u00fan, as was to be expected from the greater decay that has occurred in the gold-wire trade than in the manufacture of cloths. A weaver, if out of fine work, can always make common s\u00e1ris, dhot\u00eds, &c., for which there is a steady demand, and for which little capital is required; but a wire-drawer can only draw wire, and can never afford the capital to work on his own account; in fact there is reason to believe that the weaving operatives, like most others at present, are rather improving in their relations to capital than otherwise. Till lately the whole command of both the wire-drawing and weaving trades was in the hands of the merchants of the city. They found all the materials, and merely paid the stated rates for piecework executed by the operatives; the latter were always kept under heavy advances, and under Sind\u00eda\u2019s rule they could not leave their employers while these were unpaid, unless their new masters chose to clear them; in short they were regularly bought and sold like slaves. The employers now complain of their inability to keep them to their work, and seldom now make advances, as the operatives frequently abscond, and being without chattels, debts cannot be recovered from them under our legal procedure. Of course this is altogether advantageous to the operative class; they are thus gradually emancipating themselves from the thraldom of the capitalist merchants, and a good deal of the outcry made by the latter about the decay of the trade may mean only the transfer of a part of their old profits on fine goods to the independent manufacturers of coarser stuffs.\nWe have taken off the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 export taxes on cloths, which amounted to four per cent on their value, and there is now no direct burden on any part of the trade, except the taks\u00e1l fee of Rs. 1-8 on each p\u00e1s\u00e1 of silver made into wire. This the wire-drawers themselves would not desire to be withdrawn, as it is thought to give a sort of protection to the genuine Burh\u00e1np\u00far article against the inferior imitations made at R\u00e1ver in Kh\u00e1ndesh and other places. How it does so, however, it is impossible to understand, for it does not, like the English Hall-mark, impress any stamp on the goods, and there is no law to prevent the importation of the inferior article to be re-exported as Burh\u00e1np\u00far produce, which is in fact already done. Moreover the Burh\u00e1np\u00far wire is itself deteriorating in quality, for while it was seldom made below from thirty to forty-two m\u00e1sh\u00e1s of gold per p\u00e1s\u00e1 of silver, ten to twenty are now much more commonly used, and this only because there is no demand for the more costly sort.\n\nThe census statements show that there are in Burh\u00e1np\u00far\u2014\n\n| Occupation                  | Number |\n|-----------------------------|--------|\n| Silk spinners               | 45     |\n| Cloth dyers                 | 457    |\n| Kal\u00e1b\u00e1t\u00fan weavers           | 382    |\n| Other weavers               | 4,437  |\n\nBurh\u00e1np\u00far offers a singularly promising field for the establishment of a factory, on English principles, for the production of the coarser cotton fabrics worn by the common people. With so many hands available who are already skilled in thread-spinning and weaving by hand, steam machinery on a moderate scale would certainly enable such an establishment to supply better and cheaper goods of this description than either the imported Manchester cloth, which has neither the strength nor substance looked for by the common people for their every-day wear, or than the hand-wove native fabrics now in vogue. His Highness Holkar is now establishing such a factory at Indore, and, if possible there, its chance would certainly be much better at Burh\u00e1np\u00far.\n\nBURHN\u00c9R\u2014A river in the Mandla district. It rises thirty miles to the south-west of Amarkantak, and before its junction with the Narbad\u00e1 at Deog\u00e1on in the Singh\u00e1rp\u00far estate, it receives the H\u00e1l\u00f3n river at Ghughr\u00ed. It has a devious, but generally westerly, course, about a hundred miles long.\n\nC\n\nCHAKRA'R\u2014A river rising in a lofty plateau some thirty miles to the south-west of Amarkantak. It has a due northerly course, and up to its junction with the Narbad\u00e1 may be about forty miles in length.\n\nCHA'MPA'R\u2014A chiefship in the Bil\u00e1sp\u00far district, containing forty-seven villages, with an area of 120 square miles. The country is level and fairly open, and the population is 18,666 souls, or 155 to the square mile. The zamind\u00e1r belongs to the Kanwar caste.\n\nCHA'MPA'R\u2014The head-quarters of the chiefship of the same name in the Bil\u00e1sp\u00far district. It is little more than a collection of miserable mud huts; but there are resident here a considerable number of weavers, whose manufactures find ready sale in the adjoining market of Bamnidehl.\nCHAM\u2014CHAN\n\nCHAMURSI\u2014A town in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, situated near the left bank of the Waingang\u00e1, forty-four miles east of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1. It contains 750 houses; and the inhabitants are chiefly Telinges. The number of wells is noticeable, there being at least a hundred within the town, and their water is peculiarly good. A market is held here on Saturdays, at which groceries, salt, tobacco, and vegetables are retailed. There is also a trade in castor-seed from the Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d territory, and in ghee, tasar cocoons and tasar thread, and salt from the East Coast. Ch\u00e1mursi possesses government schools for boys and girls, a post-office, and a police outpost.\n\nCHAND\u2014A thriving village in the Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 district. It was formerly the head-quarters of a tahsil, which was abolished five years ago. It is situated on the right bank of the Kolb\u00edr\u00e1, seventeen miles east of Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1. A police force is stationed here, and there is a small fort.\n\nCHANDA or CHANDRAPUR*\u2014\n\nCONTENTS.\n\n| Page | Page |\n|------|------|\n| General description | 183 |\n| Rivers | 184 |\n| Hills | ib. |\n| Geological features | 185 |\n| Minerals | ib. |\n| Forests | 186 |\n| Natural products and animals | ib. |\n| Climate | ib. |\n| Population | 187 |\n| Language | 189 |\n| Manufactures | 140 |\n| Trade | 140 |\n| Lakes | 141 |\n| History | ib. |\n| Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 rule | 144 |\n| British rule | 147 |\n| Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 interregnum | ib. |\n| Incorporation of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 in British dominions | ib. |\n| Administration | 148 |\n| Revenue | ib. |\n| Local institutions | ib. |\n\nA district lying between 19\u00b0 7' and 20\u00b0 51' north latitude, and 78\u00b0 51' and 80\u00b0 51' east longitude. Its extreme length, north and south, is 120 miles; its extreme breadth, east and west, 130; and the area contained is about 10,000 square miles. In shape it is an irregular triangle, with the northern angle resting on the R\u00e1jp\u00far district, and the western on the junction of the W\u00e1n\u00e1 and the Wardh\u00e1, while the southern angle on Sironch\u00e1 is cut off. It is bounded on its northern side by the districts of R\u00e1jp\u00far, Bhand\u00e1ra, and Wardh\u00e1; on its western side by the Wardh\u00e1 and Pranh\u00edt\u00e1, which divide it from Ber\u00e1r and the Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d territory; on its southern apex by Sironch\u00e1, and on the east by Bastar and R\u00e1jp\u00far.\n\nIt is divided into eleven parganas or revenue subdivisions:\n\n1.

To this point Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 mainly consists of a great central valley, the southern portion of the basin of the Waingang\u00e1, and of the left slope of a smaller valley trending from the north-west, the eastern half of the Wardh\u00e1 basin. Below Seoni the Pranh\u00edt\u00e1 valley\u2014a prolongation of that of the Waingang\u00e1\u2014commences, and has the southernmost part of the district on its eastern face. This description shows the country according to its most salient features, but going more into detail we find that the north-east corner lies within the basin of the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed, while the eastern side of the Waingang\u00e1 and Pranh\u00edt\u00e1 valley is divided into two portions running north and south, the western of which is by those drained rivers, and the eastern by the Indr\u00e1v\u00e1t\u00ed, which flows from the east. Thus the lines of drainage in the two portions are at right angles to one another. Numerous large streams fall into the five main rivers, watering the country abundantly in their course, and fed by almost countless rivulets. The principal of these tributaries are: of the Waingang\u00e1, on its eastern bank\u2014the G\u00e1rhv\u00ed, the Kobr\u00e1garh\u00ed, the K\u00e1men, the Potpuri, and the Kur\u00far; on its western bank\u2014the Botew\u00e1hi and the Andh\u00e1ri; of the Wardh\u00e1\u2014the Vir\u00e1l and the Sfr; of the Pranh\u00edt\u00e1\u2014the Din\u00e1; of the Indr\u00e1v\u00e1t\u00ed\u2014the Bond, the Parlakot, and the P\u00e1ml\u00e1 Gautam; and of the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed\u2014the Seoni\u00e1th.\n\nExcept in the extreme west, hills are thickly dotted over the whole face of the country, sometimes in detached ranges, sometimes rising isolated from the plain, but all with\na southerly trend. East of the Waingang\u00e1 they increase in height, and form a broad tableland some 2,000 feet above the sea at the highest point. Among the most noticeable are the Virg\u00e1on, Amb\u00e1garh, P\u00e1n\u00e1b\u00e1ras, Kotgal, Kor\u00e1ch\u00e1, Muramg\u00e1on, Dh\u00e1nor\u00e1, A'undh\u00ed, Khutg\u00e1on, J\u00e1rond\u00ed, Bh\u00e1mr\u00e1garh, Chim\u00far, and M\u00fal ranges, and the Tep\u00e1garh, Surj\u00e1garh, Perz\u00e1garh, and Dewalmar\u00ed hills.\n\nThe general configuration of the country, the strata of its elevations, where Geological features. these are of sedimentary origin, their position, and line of direction, appear to point to the conclusion that the detached ranges and isolated hills have chiefly resulted from denudation, and that their summits now mark what was once the level of the surface. East of the Waingang\u00e1 the formation is mainly plutonic and metamorphic; granite, gneiss, hornblende, schist, mica-schist, and massive quartz being the typical rocks. Sandstones occur rarely, and when met with are much indurated. West of the Waingang\u00e1 sandstones of the Dam\u00fad\u00e1, or true coal-bearing series of India, intermixed with those of other series, form a belt along the Wardh\u00e1, fairly parallel with its course, from a little above the village of Ekon\u00e1 to the head of the third barrier (of the God\u00e1var\u00ed navigation scheme) below Kirmiri. This tract is seventy-five miles long, and varies in breadth from eight to twenty-two miles, comprising an area of about one thousand square miles. Seven seams of coal have already been discovered, one of which is thirty-three feet thick. The varieties of sandstone included in this series and in series associated with it are very numerous, the strata in some places being extremely thick-bedded, in others thin bands of flagstone, and in others again mere laminae not a tenth of an inch thick, while the texture ranges from coarse conglomerate to a stone of the finest grain, and the colours shade from white to purple, and from yellow to red. Fire-clay and other valuable clays are interstratified in the system; and in the boulder and conglomerate beds of the T\u00e1lch\u00edrs, which underlie the Dam\u00fad\u00e1s, limestone occurs in great abundance. Bounding these carboniferous sandstones on the north, and surrounded on three sides by granitic, metamorphic, and trap rocks, stretches a larger area occupied by another series of sandstones, all more or less indurated, some very highly so. Along the north of this altered group lie beds of serpentine and steatite of considerable thickness. A large portion of the Brahmapuri, Garhbor\u00ed, and R\u00e9jargarh parganas is covered with laterite, which hero shows unmistakeable signs of aqueous deposition, and its thickness must once have been great, as is testified by the height of the laterite hills scattered about.\n\nCh\u00e1nd\u00e1 is peculiarly rich in iron ores, which occur from the extreme north Minerals. to the extreme south, and as far west as the eastern side of the Chim\u00far pargana. The ore varies in appearance from a bright steely substance to a dull red brown rock, and from a ferruginous earth to a black sand. Gold particles are found in the sand of some of the hill streams, and it is probable that the metamorphic rocks in the south-east contain this metal in considerable quantity, while in the north copper ore is believed to exist; indeed tradition points out the places where it is said once to have been mined. Diamonds and rubies were formerly obtained near Wair\u00e1garh, but the mines have long since been abandoned. The ochres and plastic clays of the district are numerous and excellent. There is also in the vicinity of the Wardh\u00e1 a layer of silicious sand, as fine in grain as the finest flour, which is not without value. The soil over the greatest portion of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 is red or sandy, streaked with patches of black or yellow earth,\nwhich, as the Wardh\u00e1 and Waingang\u00e1 are neared, change into belts of heavy black loam, and of yellow loam on the left bank of the Pranh\u00edt\u00e1.\n\nDense forests clothe the country, girdling or intersecting the cultivated lands, and feathering the highest hills. Teak grows everywhere, but it is only along the eastern frontier that it is now found of any size. There large trees are sprinkled along the entire line from north to south, the most valuable reserve being in Ahf\u00ed, where at present there are standing many hundred thousands of full-grown and half-grown trees. Bijes\u00e1l (pterocarpus marsupium), shisham (dalbergia latifolia), and s\u00e9j (pentaptera glabra), are widely distributed, the latter in great numbers. Kaw\u00e1 (pentaptera arjuna) is plentiful in the vicinity of water; and mhowa (basia latifolia) and ach\u00e1r or chironi (buchanania latifolia) grow profusely in all red and sandy soils. Great tracts of bamboo jungle exist; some of the canes are of immense size; and rohan (soymida febrifuga), haldi (curcuma longa), khafr (acacia catechu), t\u00edwas (dalbergia ogeinensis), sh\u00edwan (gmelina arborea), kusum (stechera trijuga), dh\u00e1ur\u00e1 (conocarpus latifolia), bel (crat\u00e6va religiosa), tend\u00fa (diospyros melanozylon), and wood-apple are common.\n\nCh\u00e1nd\u00e1 is also rich in wild fibres, lac, tasar cocoons, beeswax, mhowa, and other forest produce; in useful stone of various colours and composition, from the hardest granite to the softest soapstone; in coal, ochres, plastic clays, and iron ores. Rice and gur (raw sugar) are the chief agricultural staples; but excellent cotton, jaw\u00e1ri, oil-seeds, wheat, gram, and pulses are also grown, and the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 p\u00e1n gardens are famous throughout the province. Horned cattle are bred in great numbers, but are not possessed of any special good qualities. Large flocks of sheep abound, principally kept for their wool and manure, and are of three distinct breeds, which are locally known as the Waror\u00e1, M\u00fal, and God\u00e1var\u00ed sheep; the last have hair instead of wool, and are found only in the extreme south. Goats and poultry, both good of their kind, are plentiful. To a sportsman Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 offers a magnificent field, for game of every description swarms in the forests, hills, and lakes of the district.\n\nIn the hilly wooded region on the east the temperature is cooler and more moist than is found further west, but the climate of the district generally does not differ materially from that of other parts of the N\u00e1gpur country below the gh\u00e1ts. The annual rainfall in Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 registered during the last eight years averages 44\u00b767 inches, but on the eastern frontier it must be much more. The principal rains are from the middle of June to the end of September. Showers are also looked for in November and December, and on these depends much of the success of the dry crops and sugarcane. From the middle of September to the close of November fever of a malarious type prevails all over the district, few escaping an attack, and special care should be taken to avoid exposure to the night air during the period named. Cholera frequently occurs, and in some places with severity; but as a rule the presence of dense jungle appears to arrest its spread. Many villages of the eastern forests, for instance, have never known the disease. Small-pox carries off yearly a large number of children, attacking but few adults, probably because the great majority of these were infected in their youth.\nIn the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 country three distinct nationalities meet\u2014the Gond, the Telinga, and the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1; and every town possesses a proportion of the three. Still, intermingled as they are, the great mass of each may be broadly said to inhabit different tracts\u2014the Gonds lying chiefly east of the Waingang\u00e1 and the Pranh\u00edt\u00e1, the Telingas along the east, centre, and south, and the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s in the northern and western parganas west of the Waingang\u00e1. The numerous castes included in these great divisions are described in Sir R. Jenkins\u2019 report on the N\u00e1gpur territories; and it will be sufficient here to note the races of the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district that are believed to be aboriginal.\n\nThese are\u2014\n\n1. The Gond, Pardh\u00e1n, and Halb\u00e1\u2014of the Gond type.\n2. The Kohr\u00ed and M\u00e1n\u00e1\u2014of the Kohr\u00ed type.\n   The first are famous for the construction of tanks, the second as agriculturists.\n3. The Golkar and Gow\u00e1ri\u2014of the Gaul\u00ed type.\n\nThe Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 Gonds are divided into four tribes\u2014\n\n1. M\u00e1ri\u00e1 or Kohit\u00far Gond.\n2. N\u00e1ik or Dhurwe Gond.\n3. R\u00e1j Gond.\n4. Khatolw\u00e1r Gond.\n\nThe M\u00e1ri\u00e1s, or as they are called towards the north the Kohit\u00fars, inhabit the wild wastes of hill and forest which lie beyond the Waingang\u00e1, and are in all probability the purest type of Gond. Whether they are the root from which the other tribes have sprung can, in our present state of knowledge, be mere matter of speculation, but it is worthy of note that in villages bordering upon the more cultivated tracts the change of name from M\u00e1ri\u00e1 to Kohit\u00far, then to Jangl\u00ed Gond, and then to Gond, can be seen in progress, and it is easy to imagine that a well-to-do M\u00e1ri\u00e1 family calling themselves Gond might in two or three generations adopt the more fashionable style of R\u00e1j Gond. Then again, until a recent period, marriages occasionally took place between members of different tribes, and it is only Hind\u00fa example which tends in these latter days to harden the difference of tribe into distinction of caste. The M\u00e1ri\u00e1s have a language, called M\u00e1ri, of their own, which is quite distinct from Gond\u00ed. They are divided into the following twenty-four families or houses:\u2014\n\nI.\n\nWorshippers of seven minor deities.\n\n1. Dud\u00e1. 5. Tand\u00fa.\n2. Hind\u00e9k\u00fa. 6. Taland\u00ed.\n3.

P\u00e1tul.\n\nIV.\n\nWorshippers of four minor deities.\n\n1. Dond\u00e9.  \n2. Kondo.  \n3. Mohondo.  \n4. Pug\u00e9t\u00ed.\n\nThe N\u00e1ik or Dhurwe Gonds are found in the south of the district, but their numbers are very small. They appear under the Gond kings to have been employed as soldiers, and at the present day they prefer service with a zamind\u00e1r to agricultural work. Their language, called \"N\u00e1ik,\" is a dialect of Gondi, but is so dissimilar that a R\u00e9j Gond often fails to understand it. They are divided into seventeen families or houses, viz:\n\nI.\n\nWorshippers of seven minor deities.\n\n1. A'tram.  \n2. Kurn\u00e1to.  \n3. Kor\u00e1p\u00e1.  \n4. Wuik\u00e1.\n\nII.\n\nWorshippers of six minor deities.\n\n1. Karn\u00e1k\u00e1.  \n2. Kohach\u00e1r.  \n3. Kumr\u00e1n.  \n4. Mar\u00e1n\u00ed.\n\nIII.\n\nWorshippers of five minor deities.\n\n1. A'd\u00e1.  \n2. Paigam.  \n3. M\u00e1ldongre.  \n4. Kurseng\u00e1.\n\nIV.\n\nWorshippers of four minor deities.\n\n1. Kawachi.  \n2. Kow\u00e1.  \n3. Mark\u00e1m.  \n4. Parch\u00e1k\u00ed.  \n5. Tekam.\n\nThe R\u00e9j Gonds rank first of the four tribes, and the epithet of R\u00e9j may have originally been used to designate members of royal and noble families, from whom it may have spread to their followers and the governing classes generally, or it may describe the tribe which in ancient days conquered the land from the other aboriginal races. The R\u00e9j Gonds speak \"Gondi,\" which is a distinct, though unwritten, language. They are divided into twenty-seven families or houses, viz:\u2014\nI.\n\nWorshippers of seven minor deities.\n\n1. Kusn\u00e1k\u00e1.  \n2. Mesr\u00e1m.  \n\n3. Mar\u00e1wi.  \n4. Marskol\u00e1.\n\nII.\n\nWorshippers of six minor deities.\n\n1. A'tr\u00e1m.  \n2. Ger\u00e1m.  \n3. Kurmet\u00e1.  \n4. Kopal.  \n5. Uret\u00e1.  \n\n6. Pend\u00e1m.  \n7. Sal\u00e1m.  \n8. Tor\u00e1l.  \n9. Velod\u00ed.\n\nIII.\n\nWorshippers of five minor deities.\n\n1. Alam.  \n2. Dhurwe.  \n3. Gaure.  \n4. Jugn\u00e1hk\u00e1.  \n\n5. Karpet\u00e1.  \n6. Kumr\u00e1.  \n7. Kirn\u00e1hk\u00e1.  \n8. Soiy\u00e1m.\n\nIV.\n\nWorshippers of four minor deities.\n\n1. Kow\u00e1.  \n2. Nait\u00e1m.  \n3. Sar\u00e1t\u00ed.  \n\n4. Sir\u00e1m.  \n5. Sirn\u00e1hk\u00ed.  \n6. Taland\u00ed.\n\nThe Khatolw\u00e1r Gonds have the same family names as the R\u00e1j Gonds, but they wear the \"Jane\u00fa,\" and try hard to believe that they are of R\u00e1jput descent. They are found in the north-east of the district, and speak Gond\u00ed and the Chhatt\u00edsgarh dialect of Hind\u00ed. They come originally from the R\u00e1sp\u00far plains. All Gonds of whatever tribe worship one Supreme God, called by them Phars\u00e1 Pen, and they also all acknowledge a minor deity named Bh\u00edm Pen; but there is no sufficient reason to suppose that this Bh\u00edm is identical with the second of the five P\u00e1ndavas.\n\nThe so-called out-castes are the Kh\u00e1tik, Cham\u00e1r, Mh\u00e1r or Dher, M\u00e1dg\u00ed, and Bhang\u00ed. Of these the Mh\u00e1rs play no unimportant part in the polity of the district, for they are very numerous and widely spread; they form the chief thread-spinners and weavers of coarse cloth in the country, and the village watch and ward are mainly in their hands. It may be surmised that they are in fact an aboriginal race which, conquered by more warlike tribes, and forced to perform degrading offices, sank at length into the position they now hold. Few foreigners, beside those of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 and Telinga nations, have settled in Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1. Deccan Musalm\u00e1ns are the most numerous; and M\u00e1rw\u00e1ris, Bundel\u00e1s, and men from northern India are occasionally met with, but the aggregate of all these classes is small.\n\nThe Gond, Telinga, and Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 each speaks his national language, and Language. the two latter have generally in addition an acquaintance with each other's tongue, or with Hind\u00ed. Neither M\u00e1r\u00ed, N\u00e1\u00edk\u00ed, nor Gond\u00ed is a written language, and for their documents the Gonds in the south use Telugu, in the centre Mar\u00e1th\u00ed or Hind\u00ed, and in the\nnorth Hind\u00ed. All the Gond chiefs have a knowledge of the latter. Sir R. Jenkins mentions that in A.D. 1826 Telugu and Marathi were spoken in nearly equal proportions; but the ratio now is in favour of Marathi, which is also the language of the courts.\n\nThe chief manufacture of the district is coarse and fine cotton-cloths, which are largely exported to Western India, and formerly found their way as far as Arabia. The Telenga weavers turn out cloths of coloured patterns, some of which are in very good taste; and cotton-thread of a wonderful fineness is spun, chiefly for export. Silk fabrics are well made, though the demand for them is not great; and there are also stuffs manufactured of a mixture of silk and cotton. Large numbers of tasar silkworms are bred in the forests, and the wound silk obtained, both in a dyed and undyed state, forms an important item of export. In some places it is woven into pieces for local consumption. Great quantities of excellent iron are smelted, alike for home and foreign use, the industry employing a considerable body of men. Carts for driving purposes and for the carriage of goods are extensively made, as may be gathered from the fact that the value of those sold at the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 fairs during 1865-66 amounted to Rs. 3,38,700. Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 was formerly distinguished for workers in precious and in baser metals, but much of that fame has now been lost. The district still, however, has a few good goldsmiths, silversmiths, and cutlers; and the Brahmapur\u00ed braziers turn out utensils of combined brass and copper of a superior sort. The Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 stone-cutters are skilful as a body; some possess no mean talent for carving, and others gain their livelihood by shaping bowls and platters out of the Jambulgh\u00e1t\u00e1 soapstone. Good carpenters are found only in Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 itself, and are scarce even there; but some of these are excellent workmen. In minor trades the district possesses a reputation for native slippers, which are made chiefly in the city of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 and at Brahmapur\u00ed, and its basket-work and matting hold a high place.\n\nThe external trade of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 is principally with the Wardh\u00e1, N\u00e1gp\u00far, Bhand\u00e1ra, and R\u00e1ip\u00far districts, with Bastar and the Eastern Coast, and with the Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d territories and Ber\u00e1r. The sales of the year are mostly transacted at fairs, which assemble annually at Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1, Bh\u00e1ndak, Chim\u00far, M\u00e1rkand\u00ed, and Warh\u00e1, the two first being by far the most numerously attended. They are held in the following order:\n\nChim\u00far, in January,\nBh\u00e1ndak, in February,\nM\u00e1rkand\u00ed, in February,\nCh\u00e1nd\u00e1, in April,\nWarh\u00e1, in November,\n\nand are frequented by visitors from distant parts of India. The sales actually effected at them in 1868-69 amounted to Rs. 15,22,238 (\u00a3152,224). Subsequently to the Marath\u00e1 conquest of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 trade gradually dwindled away, and the capital, being on no highway of traffic, felt the change with special severity. Within the last few years, however, trade has wonderfully revived, and the position of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 now promises to be of great commercial value, for in all probability a few years will see the city connected by railway with Bombay on the west and Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d on the south, while water communication will open out traffic with the Eastern Coast. The resources of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 in coal, cotton, and iron\nwill then doubtless create great manufacturing industries, and the district may in time become the Lancashire of India.\n\nCh\u00e1nd\u00e1 is thickly studded with fine tanks, or rather artificial lakes, occurring in greatest number in the Garhbor\u00ed and Brahmapur\u00ed parganas; indeed thirty-seven can be seen at once from the heights of Perz\u00e1g\u00e1rh. These lakes are formed by closing the outlets of small valleys watered by a stream, or throwing a dam across sloping land intersected by rivulets; and the broad clear sheets of water thus created are often most picturesque in their surroundings of wood and rock and hill. Among the finest are those at R\u00e9j\u00fal\u00ed, Ady\u00e1l, \u00c1lew\u00e1h\u00ed, Dongarg\u00e1oon, Palasg\u00e1oon, M\u00e1ngr\u00fal, J\u00e1n\u00e1l\u00e1, Ek\u00e1l\u00e1, Tekr\u00ed, T\u00e1rob\u00e1, Sindew\u00e1h\u00ed, Nawarg\u00e1oon, Gunjew\u00e1h\u00ed, Jun\u00f3n\u00e1, Naukh\u00e1l\u00e1, J\u00e1mni, Mohar\u00edl, K\u00e1twal\u00ed, Madn\u00e1g\u00e1rh, R\u00e9jgh\u00e1t\u00e1, Kunghar\u00e1, Saigh\u00e1t\u00e1, Bhagw\u00e1npur\u00ed, and Mhes\u00e1.\n\nThe chief architectural objects of interest are the cave-temples at Bh\u00e1ndak, Winjb\u00e1san\u00ed, Dew\u00e1l\u00e1, and Ghug\u00fas; the rock-temple in the bed of the Wardh\u00e1, below Ball\u00e1lp\u00far; the ancient temples at M\u00e1rkand\u00ed, Neri, Bhat\u00e1l\u00e1, Bh\u00e1ndak, Wair\u00e1g\u00e1rh, \u00c1mbg\u00e1oon, W\u00e1ghnahkh, and Kesl\u00e1bor\u00ed; the monoliths near Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1; the forts of Wair\u00e1g\u00e1rh and Ball\u00e1lp\u00far; and the walls of the city of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1, its system of water-works, and the tombs of the Gond kings. The following places are also worthy of visit:\u2014the rapids of the Wardh\u00e1 at Soft; the junction of the Wardh\u00e1 and the Waingang\u00e1 at Seon\u00ed; the R\u00e1mdigh\u00ed pool near Kesl\u00e1bor\u00ed; the Mugd\u00e1\u00ed spring and cave in the Perz\u00e1g\u00e1rh hills, about a mile from Dom\u00e1; the coal seams near L\u00e1t\u00ed, Ghug\u00fas, and Ball\u00e1lp\u00far; the quarries in the vicinity of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 and J\u00e1mbulgh\u00e1t\u00e1; and the iron mines at Lohar\u00e1, Amb\u00e1g\u00e1rh Chauk\u00ed, Dewalg\u00e1oon, Wagarpeth, P\u00edpalg\u00e1oon, T\u00e1tol\u00ed, and P\u00e1wi Mutand\u00e1.\n\nThe characters which trace the early history of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 are her ancient temples, but as yet we can only read their meaning dimly. Three eras, however, are distinctly marked\u2014the first by the cave-temples; the second by the massive unadorned temples, put together without mortar, and clamped with iron; and the third by the temples of a construction similar to the second, but richly carved. Turning to tradition we find narratives connecting these temples with events recorded in the sacred books of the Hind\u00fas. We hear the wide-spread legend that great kings once reigned over the land; that some fearful and unknown calamity swept them away, devastating their cities and leaving them unpeopled; and that a dark age succeeded in which forests overgrew the silent land. Lastly we hear that as late as A.D. 800 the country was one vast wilderness in which a few savage tribes lived and warred, and that none of the temples of the three eras were constructed by the race which then rose to power.\n\nA curious and romantic chronicle of the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 Gond dynasty, whose own annals carry them back to A.D. 870, has been compiled from extinct genealogies, and various oral and written traditions, by Major Lucie Smith, deputy commissioner of the district. Although, like most of these family histories, the story of the Gond dynasty is almost entirely made up of extravagant legend, and the periods assigned to the various reigns are often of almost incredible length, the genealogy need not be altogether rejected. It has been collected from so many concurrent sources that it may be accepted as a fairly correct list of the princes of this line, though some names are probably omitted. From A.D. 870 to A.D. 1751 nineteen reigns only are recorded, which would give more than forty-six years to each. Making the ordinary allowance of twenty years for a reign, there would only be names sufficient to carry back\nthe dynasty to A.D. 1371, but we find in the A'in-i-Akbari that a prince named Bubjeo was ruling, when the list of Akbar's territories was compiled, towards the end of the sixteenth century. This Bubjeo is evidently the B\u00e1bj\u00ed Ball\u00e1l S\u00e1 or Sh\u00e1h who is recorded as reigning from 1442 to 1522. He is therefore placed in the lists about a century too soon, while, as they only give him five successors up to 1751, he should, according to the doctrine of averages, be brought down to the middle of the seventeenth century, or nearly three-quarters of a century after his real date. The probable explanation is, that not only some names may have been omitted, but that an average, calculated from the reigns of powerful princes, who were exposed from the prominence of their position to constant dangers, does not apply to the case of these Forest chiefs. No one under whose notice many of these genealogies have come can fail to have been struck by the regularity of the successions, and the long average duration of the reigns or tenancies, in even the best authenticated examples. Fathers are almost invariably succeeded by sons, family assassinations are rare, and, as may be imagined, insurrections are scarcely known against the authority of princes, who were recognised by their subjects as their natural and tribal chiefs. Therefore in the absence of more exact information, the reigns of the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 kings may be fairly assumed as equalling in average length the usually accepted term for a generation, or $3\\frac{1}{2}$ years. On this assumption, and allowing for the possibility of occasional omissions, the origin of the dynasty would be carried back to the eleventh century. Sir R. Jenkins,* it is true, says that \"the reigning family at Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1, termed Balhar Sh\u00e1h\u2014probably a remnant of the Warangal race of kings\u2014were supplanted by successors of the Gond tribe.\" But he gives no authority for his historical sketch, and his information must have been imperfect, for the Balhar Sh\u00e1h line, which he thinks may have belonged to the Hind\u00fa stock of Warangal, was in fact the very Gond dynasty which he mentions as having succeeded to the earlier race. This will be clearly seen from the following list of names as given by Major L. Smith:\n\n| Name                  | Reigns |\n|-----------------------|--------|\n| Bh\u00edm Ball\u00e1l Sinha     | 870-895|\n| Kharija Ball\u00e1l Sinha   | 895-935|\n| H\u00edr Sinha             | 935-970|\n| Andra Ball\u00e1l Sinha    | 970-995|\n| Talw\u00e1r Sinha          | 995-1027|\n| Kesar Sinha           | 1027-1072|\n| Dinkar Sinha          | 1072-1142|\n| R\u00e1m Sinha             | 1142-1207|\n| Sarj\u00e1 Ball\u00e1l Sinha    | 1207-1242|\n| Sher Sh\u00e1h or Ball\u00e1l Sh\u00e1h | 1242-1282|\n| Kh\u00e1ndki\u00e1 Ball\u00e1l Sh\u00e1h  | 1242-1282|\n| H\u00edr Sh\u00e1h              | 1282-1342|\n| Bhum\u00e1 and...          | 1342-1402|\n| Lokh\u00e1, jointly        | 1402-1442|\n| Kondi\u00e1 Sh\u00e1h           | 1402-1442|\n| B\u00e1bj\u00ed Ball\u00e1l Sh\u00e1h     | 1442-1522|\n| Dhund\u00ed\u00e1 R\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h      | 1522-1597|\n| Krishna Sh\u00e1h          | 1597-1647|\n| B\u00edf Sh\u00e1h              | 1647-1672|\n| R\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h              | 1672-1735|\n| Nilkanth Sh\u00e1h         | 1735-1751|\n\n* Report on N\u00e1gpur Province, Edition of N\u00e1gpur Antiquarian Society, p. 22.\nAlthough no one who has seen the curious old city of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1, with its six miles of stone walls and battlements, its fine gates\u2014with the Balhar Sh\u00e1h\u00ed cognizance engraved upon them,\u2014and its regal tombs, can suppose that the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 princes were nothing more than petty aboriginal chiefs; their history is even more obscure and uneventful than those of the kindred dynasties of Kherl\u00e1, Garh\u00e1 Mandla, and Deogarh. From amid the mass of fable which represents their annals it may be inferred that up to the time of H\u00edr Sh\u00e1h, the eleventh of the line, who may have lived in the end of the fifteenth century, and is said to have built the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 citadel and founded the city walls, the Balhar Sh\u00e1h\u00ed kings were tributary to some great power, for it is expressly stated of him \u201cthat he paid tribute to no one.\u201d There is, however, nothing in Farishta to show that the dominions of the B\u00e1hman\u00ed kings, whose power collapsed when H\u00edr Sh\u00e1h\u2019s is supposed to have risen, extended east of the Wardh\u00e1. In none of the descriptions of their territories is any place on this side of the river mentioned. From the prominent manner in which his grandson Kondi\u00fa, or Karn Sh\u00e1h, is represented as having summoned large numbers of Telinga and other Br\u00e1hmans, set up lings of Mah\u00e1deva, and built numerous temples, it is not improbable that he was the first of his line to relinquish the Gond deities and to adopt the Hind\u00fa faith; though not until the days of Bhr Sh\u00e1h, the last of the line but two, was the yearly sacrifice of cows to Pharsa Pen, the great god of the Gonds, entirely abolished. It is the son of this Karn Sh\u00e1h who is mentioned in the A\u2019\u00edn-i-Akbar\u00ed as an independent prince, paying no tribute to Delhi, and having an army of 1,000 cavalry and 40,000 infantry. His territories are also stated to have included the lately conquered territory of \u201cBeersagarh\u201d (Wair\u00e1garkh), in which was a diamond mine, and eight parganas properly belonging to \u201cSark\u00e1r * Kallem\u201d of Ber\u00e1r. The only mention\u2020 of this line in Farishta seems to be more than a century earlier, in A.D. 1437, when a R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Gondw\u00e1na is recorded as having helped N\u00e1sir Kh\u00e1n, ruler of Kh\u00e1ndesh, in an attack on Ber\u00e1r. As the Kherl\u00e1 Gond line was extinguished in 1438, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 mentioned was probably one of the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 kings, who were at that particular time the only Gond dynasty in power, and if so the contemporary name in the lists would be that of Kh\u00e1ndki\u00e1 Ball\u00e1l Sh\u00e1h, the father of the H\u00edr Sh\u00e1h, who is stated to have raised his dynasty to an entirely independent position.\n\nFrom the time of Akbar until the days of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 princes seem to have been tolerably independent and powerful, for both in their own annals, and in those of the Deogarh line, we find them recorded as gaining an important victory over that rising Gond power in the middle of the seventeenth century. Indeed the conversion of the Deogarh princes to Mohammadanism is said to have been due to their hope of obtaining the aid of the Emperor Aurangzeb in re-establishing their power after its temporary subversion by the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 kings. Probably it is to this period that may be referred the carvings of the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 device\u2014a winged lion\u2014which have lately been found on the walls of G\u00e1walgarh, a famous hill fortress on the southern brow of the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1 range, which was for long the stronghold of Ber\u00e1r.\n\nSir R. Jenkins observes\u2021 that if the Mohammadan historian of the Deccan, K\u00e1ff Kh\u00e1n, is to be believed, the amount of tribute in cash, jewels, and elephants taken in Aurangzeb\u2019s time from the Gond r\u00e1j\u00e1s of Deogarh and Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1\n\n---\n\n* Gladwin\u2019s A\u2019\u00edn-i-Akbar\u00ed, S\u00faba of Ber\u00e1r.\n\u2020 Briggs\u2019 Farishta, vol. ii. p. 427, Edition 1829.\n\u2021 Report on Nagpur, by Sir Richard Jenkins, Edition N\u00e1gp\u00far Antiquarian Society, p. 22.\nindicates considerable opulence. According to Captain Smith's chronicle, the r\u0101j\u0101 contemporary with Aurangzeb was R\u0101m Sh\u0101h, who is known to have built the Ram\u0101l\u0101 tank and the R\u0101m b\u0101gh, the latter near the present Ch\u0101nd\u0101 court-house. The Govindpur suburb and the Nag\u012bn\u0101 b\u0101gh (on part of which the Ch\u0101nd\u0101 public garden now stands) were constructed by Govind Sh\u0101h, father to R\u0101m Sh\u0101h.\n\nIn A.D. 1718 we find the R\u0101j\u0101 of Sat\u0101r\u0101 attempting to obtain from the Delhi Emperor the cession of Ch\u0101nd\u0101; and about the same year the former sent K\u0101nhoj\u012b Bhonsl\u0101 to invade Gondw\u0101na. K\u0101nhoj\u012b met with no military successes in the Ch\u0101nd\u0101 kingdom, and latterly betook himself to plundering, chiefly west of the Wardh\u0101. He appears subsequently to have been recalled, but the summons having been disregarded, Raghoj\u012b Bhonsl\u0101 was ordered to enforce his return, and about A.D. 1730 Raghoj\u012b captured him near Mandar, in the Sirp\u016br pargana (now of Ber\u0101r), and forwarded him to Sat\u0101r\u0101. Raghoj\u012b then proceeded to the city of Ch\u0101nd\u0101, where he was courteously received by the king; and tradition states that the Mar\u0101th\u0101 soldier was so awed by R\u0101m Sh\u0101h's calm mien and bearing, that, in place of seeking pretext for quarrel, he did him homage as a god. R\u0101m Sh\u0101h was gathered to his fathers in A.D. 1735, and he still lingers in the memory of the people as a saint-like man, unruffled by the cares of earth, inspiring a love not unmixed with solemn dread. His son N\u012blkant Sh\u0101h, who now succeeded to the throne, was an evil and cruel prince. He put to death his father's trusted d\u012bw\u0101n, Mah\u0101doj\u012b Vaidya, and dismissed with contumely all the high officers of the former reign. The people he ground to the dust; and he interfered in the political disputes of Deogarh. Retribution overtook him swiftly, for in A.D. 1749 the Mar\u0101th\u0101s were at his gates and the city fell, not by the award of battle, but by the treachery of an estranged court. Raghoj\u012b thereupon dictated a treaty of partition, by which two-thirds of the revenues were alienated to the Mar\u0101th\u0101s; but the remnant of power then spared soon vanished, for in A.D. 1751 Raghoj\u012b took entire possession of the kingdom, and made N\u012blkant Sh\u0101h a prisoner. The latter afterwards died in confinement,* and thus ended the dynasty of the Gond kings of Ch\u0101nd\u0101. Originally petty chiefs of a savage tribe, they spread their sway over a wide dominion, reclaiming and peopling the wild forests in which they dwelt, and, save a nominal allegiance to the Delhi throne, preserving their soil for several hundred years inviolate from foreign rule. When at length they fell, they left, if we forget the few last years, a well-governed and contented kingdom, adorned with admirable works of engineering skill, and prosperous to a point which no after-time has reached.\n\nFrom this time Ch\u0101nd\u0101 became a province of the Bhonsl\u0101 family, and it will be sufficient to record only those events which directly affected the former.\u2020 In A.D. 1755 Raghoj\u012b died, leaving four sons, J\u0101noj\u012b, S\u0101b\u0101j\u012b, Mudhoj\u012b, and Bimb\u0101j\u012b. J\u0101noj\u012b, the eldest, succeeded; but the succession was disputed by Mudhoj\u012b, who was supported by the court of Puna, and several encounters took place between\n\n* Report on the Territories of the R\u0101j\u0101 of N\u0101gp\u016br, by Sir Richard Jenkins, Edition N\u0101gp\u016br Antiquarian Society, pp. 73, 74 et seq.\n\u2020 Both in architectural remains and in local tradition there is a complete absence of the Mohammadan element.\n\u2021 In the narrative of events from A.D. 1755 to A.D. 1819 Sir R. Jenkins's Report and Grant Duff's History of the Mar\u0101th\u0101s have been largely drawn upon. Where the two authorities differ the latter has been usually followed.\nthe brothers. Mudhoj\u00ed having been worsted, the matter was referred to the Peshw\u00e1, who confirmed J\u00e1n\u00f3j\u00ed in the government of N\u00e1gpur with the title of Sen\u00e1 S\u00e1hib S\u00faba, while Mudhoj\u00ed was granted Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 and Chhatt\u00edsgarh, with the appellation of Sen\u00e1 Dhurandhar.* Mudhoj\u00ed was wasteful and rapacious, and did much to ruin the country under his rule. In A.D. 1758 he left Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 in the hands of his creditors, and proceeded to Hindust\u00e1n with Raghun\u00e1th R\u00e1o, the uncle of the Peshw\u00e1. J\u00e1n\u00f3j\u00ed died in 1773, and during the struggle for power between the two brothers Mudhoj\u00ed and S\u00e1b\u00e1j\u00ed, who both claimed the regency on the death of their elder brother, Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 was not undisturbed. Ball\u00e1l Sh\u00e1h, a son of N\u00edlkant Sh\u00e1h, escaped from confinement in the Ball\u00e1lpur fort, and collected a considerable force of Gonds, with the intention of seizing Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 and M\u00e1nikdr\u00fag. The insurgents, however, were routed at Ganp\u00far, in the Gh\u00e1tk\u00e1l pargana, by Mahipat R\u00e1o, the s\u00fabad\u00e1r of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1; and Ball\u00e1l Sh\u00e1h, after receiving a gunshot wound, was captured and sent in to N\u00e1gpur.\n\nAbout this time a party of the Puna ministerial forces penetrated to Chormor\u00ed near Bh\u00e1ndak, and made prisoners of the ladies of Mudhoj\u00ed's family. Vyank\u00e1t R\u00e1o, zamind\u00e1r of Ahf\u00edr, and his brother Mohan Sh\u00e1h, were at the time military governors of the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 city, and a third brother, Visv\u00e1s R\u00e1o, was in charge of the M\u00e1nikdr\u00fag fortress. These three attacked the Puna troops, and rescued the ladies, who were escorted into Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1. Mudhoj\u00ed finally defeated his brother, whom he killed with his own hand in battle. He himself died in A.D. 1788, and his son Raghoj\u00ed II\u2014till then but titular r\u00e1j\u00e1\u2014assumed the government. He obtained from the court of Puna, for his younger brother Vyank\u00e1j\u00ed, the title of Sen\u00e1 Dhurandhar, and allotted to him Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 and Chhatt\u00edsgarh. In A.D. 1789 he released Ball\u00e1l Sh\u00e1h, and granted him a yearly pension of Rs. 600. Vyank\u00e1j\u00ed, commonly called N\u00e1n\u00e1 S\u00e1hib, resided at Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1, and was of a quiet and religious disposition. He rebuilt the Ball\u00e1lpur fort and the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 citadel, both of which had fallen to ruin, and he erected a palace, a fragment of which forms the present kotw\u00e1li. Several temples owe their construction to him, the handsomest being the new building over the shrine of Achaleswar, and the Murldhar temple within the palace precincts.\n\nIn September A.D. 1797 the Vira\u00ed rose to an extraordinary height, flooding the entire city of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1, and submerging numerous dwellings.\n\nIn A.D. 1803 Raghoj\u00ed II, by the treaty of Deog\u00e1on, lost Cuttack, and the provinces west of the Wardh\u00e1\u2014M\u00e1nikdr\u00fag and Sirp\u00far, the ancient seat of the Ball\u00e1l Sh\u00e1h dynasty thus passing away from Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1. About this time the Pindh\u00e1ris first made their appearance in the district, and gradually overran the country, few villages escaping pillage, and many being rendered wholly desolate. Their visits roused the plundering classes into action, and the injury inflicted, directly and indirectly, was incalculable.\n\nIn A.D. 1811 Vyank\u00e1j\u00ed died at Benares, and his son Mudhoj\u00ed, known as \u00c1p\u00e1 S\u00e1hib, succeeded to the title of Sen\u00e1 Dhurandhar. \u00c1p\u00e1 S\u00e1hib appears to have been born and brought up at Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1, but no act of his, prior to his becoming the head of the N\u00e1gpur state, has left its mark on the district. In A.D. 1816\u2020 Raghoj\u00ed II died, leaving but one son, Parsoj\u00ed, who was imbecile in mind and\n\n* Grant Duff's History of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, Indian Reprint, vol. ii. p. 53.\n\u2020 Do. do. do. vol. iii. pp. 280\u2014317 et seq.\nbody. After some opposition A'p\u00e1 Sahib was declared regent, and sedulously courted the British alliance. In January 1817 he proceeded to Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1, and during his absence from N\u00e1gpur Parsoj\u00ed died\u2014murdered, as it was subsequently learnt, by A'p\u00e1 Sahib's secret orders. The latter, as nearest heir, now became R\u00e1j\u00e1 of N\u00e1gpur. Avowedly a warm friend of the British, he privately intrigued against them in all directions, until November following, when he threw off the mask and declared hostilities. The battles of Sit\u00e1baldi and N\u00e1gpur followed, in which he was signally defeated, and was forced personally to surrender and agree to terms, which rendered him wholly dependent on the British.\n\nIn January 1818 he was permitted to resume the government, and immediately recommenced his intrigues. He invited the Peshw\u00e1, B\u00e1j\u00ed R\u00e1o, to move on N\u00e1gpur, stirred up the Gonds to oppose the British, and ordered the Kil\u00e1d\u00e1r of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 to recruit, intending to escape to that city; but the Resident, Mr. Jenkins, was watching his plans, and on the 15th of March caused him to be seized and brought a prisoner to the Residency. In the meanwhile his adherents were hastily making efforts to garrison Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1. Bhujang R\u00e1o, zam\u00ednd\u00e1r of Ahf\u00edr, and his brother Kondo B\u00e1p\u00fa, zam\u00ednd\u00e1r of Arpall\u00ed, threw themselves with their followers into the place, and every able-bodied citizen of the lower classes was pressed into the ranks. On the 2nd April the van of B\u00e1j\u00ed R\u00e1o's army reached Warh\u00e1, ten miles west of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1, on the left bank of the Wardh\u00e1, but was there checked by Lieutenant-Colonel Hopeton Scott, who had been despatched from N\u00e1gpur to prevent B\u00e1j\u00ed R\u00e1o getting into Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1. Colonel Adams, with a second division, shortly arrived in the vicinity, and on the 17th April the combined forces attacked and routed B\u00e1j\u00ed R\u00e1o at Pandarkonr\u00e1, west of the Wardh\u00e1. The British troops then laid siege to Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1, one brigade taking ground at Kosar\u00e1, on the right bank of the Vir\u00e1l, north-west of the city, while the second was massed south-east of it, at the junction of the Jharpat and Vir\u00e1l. Batteries were posted on an eminence (called the M\u00e1nch hill) in the latter position, and fire being opened, a breach was soon made in the line of curtain between the Path\u00e1npur\u00e1 gate and the Hanum\u00e1n wicket. On the morning of the 2nd May the storming parties moved to the assault, and were met in the breach by the regular garrison, who are said to have fallen to a man in its defence, while the kil\u00e1d\u00e1r, Gang\u00e1 Singh, was also slain, rewarding with his dying breath one Ali Kh\u00e1n, who claimed to have shot an English officer. The struggle, however, was of short duration, and the British were quickly masters of the place, which was given up to sack; but in the general plunder which ensued, the kil\u00e1d\u00e1r slain protected his home far better than his living arm could have defended it, for the English, in admiration of his conduct at the assault, caused his house to be scrupulously respected.\n\nA'p\u00e1 Sahib's repeated treachery having proved him unworthy of trust, the British Government decreed his deposition, and placed Raghoj\u00ed, a grandson of Raghoj\u00ed II., at the head of the N\u00e1gpur state. As the new R\u00e1j\u00e1 was only some nine years old, a regency was appointed under his grandmother B\u00e1k\u00e1 B\u00e1j\u00ed, and the administration of the country was conducted by the Resident, acting in the name of the R\u00e1j\u00e1, and assisted by British officers in charge of each district and department. The mean, rapacious spirit which characterised the Bhonsl\u00e1 in all dealings with their subjects had caused infinite harm to the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, and from A.D. 1803 constant disturbances and lawlessness had added their evil fruits. It is on record that the population in A.D. 1802 was double that in A.D. 1822, and that the houses in the city of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 had decreased during that period in nearly the same proportion.\nThe able men * who from A.D. 1818 to A.D. 1830 now administered the district in succession did much, each in his time, to restore the former prosperity of the country. The Gond chiefs who had rebelled were brought to submission; plundering was stopped, and order established; the heavy assessments on land were reduced; deserted villages repopulated; and ruined irrigation works repaired. Education was encouraged, and during this period Sud\u00e1j\u00ed B\u00e1pu, a Telenga Br\u00e1hman of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1, gained an Indian reputation by his published works in Mar\u00e1th\u00ed, Telugu, and Sanskrit, the scientific value of which, particularly of his treatise on the Copernican system, was warmly acknowledged by the Government of India and the Asiatic Society of Bengal.\n\nBut in June A.D. 1830 the management of the country was made over to the r\u00e1j\u00e1, Raghoj\u00ed III, and progress stayed. Short-sighted, grasping measures took the place of a broad and generous policy; men without interest found their lands taxed to almost their full return, while those with influential friends paid less than their just due; many of the old proprietors were ejected, and the best villages bestowed on relatives and favourites of the r\u00e1j\u00e1, or on official underlings. Thus sprang up a body of absentee proprietors, holding the richest estates in the district, but knowing nought about them, and having hardly an interest in common with the country or its people, anxious only to obtain the largest possible income, and utterly careless of the well-being of their tenantry\u2014a striking contrast to the policy pursued by the Gond kings. Plundering revived in spite of military parties posted thickly over the district; and as late as A.D. 1852 a Government treasure escort was attacked and robbed by Gonds on the M\u00e1l road, not sixteen miles from Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1.\n\nIn A.D. 1853 Raghoj\u00ed III died heirless, and the N\u00e1gp\u00far province was then incorporated into the British empire, the administration being conducted by a commission under the Supreme Government. The first deputy commissioner of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1, Mr. R. S. Ellis, of the Madras Civil Service (since created a Companion of the Bath) assumed charge of the district on the 18th December A.D. 1854.\n\nThe swell of the great wave of rebellion which swept over India in A.D. 1857-58 was felt in Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1; and the wild nature of the country, the predatory habits of the Gonds, and the proximity of the Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d territory, combined to render the management of the district during this period a task of peculiar anxiety; but Captain W. H. Crichton (the then deputy commissioner) prevented any outbreak until March 1858, when B\u00e1bu R\u00e1o, a petty chief of Monampalli in the Ah\u00edr\u00ed zam\u00edn-d\u00e1r\u00ed, commenced plundering the R\u00e9jgarh pargana, and was shortly afterwards joined by Vyankat R\u00e1o, zam\u00edn-d\u00e1r of Arpall\u00ed and Ghot. These two leaders then openly declared rebellion; and collecting a mixed force of Rohillas and Gonds, withstood the troops sent against them. On the night of the 29th April a party of the insurgents attacked Messrs. Gartland, Hall, and Peter, telegraph employ\u00e9s, who were encamped near Chunch-gund\u00ed on the Pranh\u00edt\u00e1, and killed the two first. Mr. Peter escaped into the Ah\u00edr\u00ed keep, and as soon as possible joined Captain Crichton, who was in the vicinity, directing operations. Subsequently, when it was desired to communicate with Lachhm\u00ed B\u00e1\u00ed, the zam\u00edn-d\u00e1r\u00edn, Mr. Peter disguised himself as a native, and\n\n* These were Captain G. N. Crawford, Captain Pew, and Captain L. Wilkinson.\nsafely delivered to her Captain Crichton\u2019s letter. The rebels made a stand at several points, but never with success; and at length, by the exertions of Lachhmi B\u00e1i, B\u00e1bu R\u00e1o was captured, and was immediately sent in to Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1, where he suffered death on the 21st October 1858. Vyankat R\u00e1o escaped to Bastar, but in April A.D. 1860 he was arrested by the r\u00e1j\u00e1 of that dependency, and on being handed over to the British authorities was sentenced to transportation for life, with forfeiture of all property.\n\nOn the 2nd March 1861 the N\u00e1gp\u00far province and the S\u00e1g\u00e1r and Narbad\u00e1 territories were formed into the government of the Central Provinces, and Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 then became a district of the N\u00e1gp\u00far division. The administration of the district is conducted by a Deputy Commissioner, assisted by a District Superintendent of Police, an Assistant Commissioner, an Extra-Assistant Commissioner, a Medical Officer, and three Tahsfid\u00e1rs; the five first having their head-quarters at the station of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1, and the three last being located at M\u00e1l, Brahmapur\u00ed, and Waror\u00e1 respectively. The imperial customs line runs through the district, and is officered by one patrol and two assistant patrols. The station is garrisoned by a detachment of Native infantry, and in military matters is under the officer commanding the N\u00e1gp\u00far force. It is occasionally visited by the chaplain of S\u00edt\u00e1bald\u00ed.\n\nThe revenues for the year 1868-69 were\u2014\n\n| Imperial. | Rs.     | Local. | Rs.     |\n|-----------|---------|--------|---------|\n| I.

Of the former there is a first-class dispensary in the city of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1, with branch dispensaries at Armori, Brahmapuri, and Waror\u00e1. The government schools for boys consist of a high school at the head-quarters of the district, where pupils are carried as far as the matriculation standard of the Bombay University; three Anglo-Vernacular and three Vernacular town schools; eleven branch schools subsidiary to the high and town schools; twenty-seven village schools; and one police school, making forty-six in all. For girls there are twenty-five schools, and one normal school for the training of mistresses. There are also eighteen indigenous schools, which declare themselves open to government inspection. In addition to five imperial post-offices, seven district post-offices, with the necessary establishments of runners and delivery-peons, are distributed over the district. Lastly, at the station of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 a museum and an extensive public garden are being formed, and a Protestant church will shortly be completed.\nCHANDA.\u2014The capital city of the Chanda district, situated in 19\u00b0 57' north latitude and 79\u00b0 22' east longitude, in the angle formed by the junction of the Vira\u00ed and Jharpat. For its history the reader is referred to the article on the Chanda district. It is surrounded by a continuous line of wall crowned with battlements, five and a half miles in circuit, of cut stone, in perfect preservation, with crenellated parapet and broad rampart, traced in re-entering angles and semicircular bastions. It is pierced with four gates, called Jatpur\u00e1, Bimb\u00e1 or Ghormaid\u00e1n, Path\u00e1npur\u00e1, and Mah\u00e1k\u00e1l\u00ed or Achaleswar; and five wickets, named Chor, Vithob\u00e1, Hanumant, Mas\u00far, and Bagar. Inside the walls are detached villages and cultivated fields, interspersed with buildings more worthy of a city; and without the walls are the suburbs of Jatpur\u00e1, Govindpur, Hiwarpur, L\u00e1lpeth, and B\u00e1d\u00fapeth, the whole having a total of 4,326 houses. The population is chiefly Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 and Telinga, the traders, shopkeepers, and craftsmen (notably the masons) being generally the latter. The city was formerly famous for the learning of its Br\u00e1hmans, and this fame has not been wholly lost. The principal products and manufactures are p\u00e1n leaves, sugarcane, and vegetables, and fine and coarse cotton-cloths, silk fabrics, brass utensils, leather slippers, and bamboo-work. A considerable trade is carried on, the imports and exports in 1868-69 amounting in value to Rs. 17,80,444 (\u00a3178,044), and Rs. 11,43,424 (\u00a3114,842) respectively, mainly in cotton, grain, country-cloths, metals, and hardware, cotton, spices, English goods, tobacco, sugar and gur, timber, carts, oil-seeds, and salt. A large portion of the transactions occur at the Chanda fair, which commences in April and lasts for about three weeks. The booths and sheds, which cover a large area, are erected east of the city, near the Mah\u00e1k\u00e1l\u00ed temple; and it is a remarkable fact that, though this fair is held during the height of the hot weather, no instance is remembered of cholera having spontaneously broken out at it. Goods brought to the fair are free of municipal tax, and the town duty receipts are consequently somewhat small; the octroi farm, for instance, in 1866 only realised Rs. 12,100. The appearance of the city from without is most picturesque. Dense forest stretches to the north and east; on the south rise the blue ranges of M\u00e1nikdr\u00fag, and westward opens a cultivated rolling country with distant hills. Set in this picture sweep the long lines of fortress wall now seen, now lost, among great groves of ancient trees; in front glitters the broad expanse of the Ram\u00e1l\u00e1 tank; and the Jharpat and the Vira\u00ed gird either side.\n\nThe objects in Chanda which a visitor should inspect are the city walls and gates, the Ram\u00e1l\u00e1 tank, with its system of water-works, the tombs of the Gond kings, the citadel (now enclosing the jail) with its large well and underground passage, the latter leading no one knows whither, the Achaleswar, Mah\u00e1k\u00e1l\u00ed, and Murldh\u00e1r temples, and the massive monoliths at L\u00e1lpeth. The public buildings consist of the kotw\u00e1l\u00ed, the zil\u00e1 school-house, the dispensary, the jail, the travellers\u2019 bungalow, and the sar\u00e1i. In front of the kotw\u00e1l\u00ed is the kotw\u00e1l\u00ed garden, and nearer the Jatpur\u00e1 gate the Victoria market (under construction), while between the city and the station a public park, called by the natives Nag\u00edn\u00e1 B\u00e1g\u00ed, is being formed.\n\nThe civil station, or head-quarters of the district, is situated north of the city, having the military cantonment at the west end, with the civil lines in the centre and east. The public buildings consist of the district court-house, the head-quarter police station-house, and a Christian cemetery, to which a Protestant church will shortly be added, and the usual military buildings for a regiment of Native infantry. There are also an imperial post-office and a district post-office.\nCHANDALA\u2014A small zamindari, containing seven villages, attached to the Ambagon pargana, in the Chand\u00e1 district. It is of recent creation, having been granted to the first holder by Captain Crawford, about A.D. 1820.\n\nCHANDANKHERA\u2014A large village in the Chand\u00e1 district, situated on the Vira\u00ed, twenty-eight miles north-north-west of Chand\u00e1. It was founded by a branch of the Ball\u00e1l Sh\u00e1hi dynasty, and from this branch descended R\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h, who by adoption became King of Chand\u00e1 in A.D. 1672. Chandankheri possesses two forts, now in ruins, and is under the protection of the Gond demi-god named \"Daiyat,\" who has an invincible antipathy to women, and to mud, stone, and brick walls. The latter dislike is unfortunate, as in consequence the best houses are mere structures of grass and bamboo.\n\nCHANDRAPUR with PADMAPUR\u2014A chiefship which was formed from two kh\u00e1s\u00e1 parganas of the Sambalpur district in A.D. 1860, under the following circumstances. One R\u00e1i R\u00fapsingh, a Rajput, who had held the position of Deputy Collector in this district for some eight or ten years, had certain estates made over to him in 1858, the owners of which had joined the Surendra S\u00e1\u00ed rebellion. When, however, the amnesty was extended to the district, the landholders in question represented to the authorities that they could not take advantage of it unless their lands were restored to them. The annual profits accruing to the landholders were roughly estimated at Rs. 3,000, and as the revenue payable to Government from the parganas of Chandrapur and Padmapur at that time was Rs. 7,548, the late deputy commissioner, Major Impey, recommended that, in lieu of the lands above specified, these parganas should be made over to R\u00e1i R\u00fapsingh at a fixed demand of Rs. 4,130 for forty years, so that the outlawed landholders might come in under the amnesty, and be restored to their possessions. The proposal was sanctioned by the Government, and the parganas have since been held in zamindari tenure. Some arrangement will, however, have to be made at the time of settlement to secure the rights of proprietors of long-standing.\n\nPadmapur is situated about forty miles N.W. of the town of Sambalpur, and Chandrapur is some twenty miles further westward. Both are on the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed, but a portion of the R\u00e1igarh feudatory state intervenes between the two parganas. In Padmapur there are fifty-seven villages, with an area of about twenty-five square miles, nearly the whole of which is cultivated. The population numbers 14,959, and is chiefly agricultural. In Chandrapur there are 182 villages, with an area of about ninety square miles, and a population, also chiefly agricultural, of 36,157 souls. At both places tasar silk and cotton-cloths are manufactured. Some very pure limestone rock is also to be found near Padmapur in the bed of the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed. It is the most fertile tract of the whole of the Sambalpur district. Rice, cotton, the pulses, oil-seeds, and sugarcane are the chief products, and in parts of Chandrapur wheat and gram are also grown. There is a good Anglo-Vernacular school at Chandrapur, where some eighty pupils are receiving instruction. At Padmapur there is a good Vernacular school with ninety-two pupils. There are also several other schools distributed throughout the villages. The present chief is Harihar Singh, son of the aforementioned R\u00e1i R\u00fapsingh. He is still a minor, being only some fifteen years of age, and is a student at the Sambalpur zil\u00e1 school. He has had a good vernacular education, and has also acquired a fair knowledge of English. His two younger brothers are also pupils at the same school. The estate is managed by his maternal uncle Nak\u00fal Sah\u00ed.\nCHAN\u2014CHAU\n\nCHANDU'R\u2014A thriving and somewhat picturesque village in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, fourteen miles west of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1. In the bed of a small stream, about a mile south of the village, a seam of coal shale strikes the surface.\n\nCHANWARPATHA'\u2014The northern revenue subdivision or tahsil in the Narsinghp\u00far district, having an area of 269 square miles, with 179 villages, and a population of 44,348 according to the census of 1866. The land revenue of the subdivision for the year 1869-70 is Rs. 57,379-14-0.\n\nCHANWARPATHA'\u2014A village in the Narsinghp\u00far district, containing a population of 1,230 souls. It lies twelve miles distant from Narsinghp\u00far, on the right bank of the Narbad\u00e1, and is the residence of the tahsild\u00e1r of the subdivision of Chanwarp\u00e1tha'.\n\nCHARLA'\u2014The chief village of the estate of the same name in the Upper God\u00e1var\u00ed district. The n\u00e1ib or deputy of the zamind\u00e1r resides here, and is the chief local authority. There is a police outpost and a small travellers' bungalow at Teg\u00e1d\u00e1, three miles distant. Here are also the remains of a small mud \"garh\" or fort, and of a large tank. There is a limestone quarry, worked by the public works department, Upper God\u00e1var\u00ed works, about a mile and a half to the east, at a place called Bum\u00e1lank\u00e1. Charl\u00e1 is distant about twenty-one miles from Dumagudem, ninety-nine from Sironch\u00e1, and three from the river God\u00e1var\u00ed. The estate consists of thirty villages. The chief is of the family of the Sardes-mukhs of the Aramgir Sark\u00e1r of the Niz\u00e1m's territories, whose ancestor, Jagpati R\u00e1o, obtained the estate about A.D. 1698.\n\nCHARWA'\u2014A small town in the Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d district lying west of Hard\u00e1, on the old highroad to Bombay. There are one or two substantial traders here, and a police station and good weekly market; but the place lies away from the railroad and the main routes north or south. It is best known as giving a name to a very extensive tract of scrub jungle.\n\nCHAURA'DA'DAR\u2014A hill plateau in the eastern gh\u00e1ts of the Mandla district. Its height is between 3,200 and 3,400 feet above the level of the sea, being nearly equal to that of its celebrated neighbour and rival, Amarkantak, on which are the sources of the Narbad\u00e1. On the plateau of Chaur\u00e1dad\u00e1r in the winter months the nights are intensely cold, while in December and January the thermometer often registers 6\u00b0 or 7\u00b0 of frost, and in the hottest days of April and May the heat is not oppressive. Water is abundant near the surface, and but for its inaccessibility Chaur\u00e1dad\u00e1r might be an eligible spot for a sanitarium.\n\nCHAURA'GARH\u2014A ruined fortress in the Narsinghp\u00far district, situated on the crest of the outer range of the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1 tableland, and twenty miles southwest of Narsinghp\u00far. It embraces within its circle of defences two hills, and the plateau enclosed is eight hundred feet above the level of the Narbad\u00e1 valley. There are three approaches to it\u2014one from the little village of Chaug\u00e1n to the east; another by a road, which winds at the foot of the northern face of the fort, known as the artillery road, and joins the first road near the fort gate; and the third from the south, by the hills on a level with the fort. The northern, eastern, and western faces of the fort are scarped for several hundred feet. Water is to be found all the year round inside, for numerous tanks enclosed by stone walls have been constructed to catch the rainfall and receive the drainage of the two hills enclosed, which are divided by a dip of about one hundred yards. A place is shown to the south of the fort called \"Bundel\u00e1 Kot,\" commemorating a traditionary Bundel\u00e1 attack. On the enclosed hill to the west are ruins of the palaces of the old Gond r\u00e1j\u00e1s, and in many places the colours\npainted on the walls are still very fresh. On the hill to the east are remains of buildings erected by the N\u00e1gp\u00far government for infantry, cavalry, and artillery. The exterior walls of the fort are still good in many places, but all the interior buildings are in ruins, and the place is very seldom visited. To the south a small hill has been fortified as an outwork.\n\nCHAU\u2014CHHAT\n\nCHAURAI\u2014A large village in the Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 district, situated about twenty-four miles east of Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1. A police force is stationed here. The soil is black for miles around, and great quantities of wheat, grain, &c. are exported from the neighbourhood. The number of inhabitants is 1,248, most of whom are cultivators.\n\nCHAURIA\u2014A chiefship in the B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t district, consisting of some twenty-five square miles of country, only 705 acres of which are cultivated. The grant appears to have been made on condition of guarding the neighbouring passes. The chief village, L\u00e1fr\u00e1, is thirty-eight miles east by south of B\u00farh\u00e1.\n\nCHHAPARA\u2014A decayed town in the Seoni district, on the road to Jabalpur, about 22 miles to the north of Seoni. The past history of Chhapara will be found described in the article on the Seoni district. It has never recovered the sack of the Pindb\u00e1ris under Wazir Mohammad Kh\u00e1n of Bh\u00f3nd, and the removal of the head-quarters of the tahsil to Lakhn\u00e1don. There are here an excellent encamping-ground under a grove of trees, a travellers' bungalow, a road bungalow, and a fair school, attended by about sixty pupils. The bridge over the B\u00e1ngang\u00e1 (Waingang\u00e1) is worth looking at, and the remains of the old Gond fort still exist.\n\nCHHATER\u2014A chiefship or zam\u00ednd\u00e1r\u00ed in the north of the Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 district, consisting of fourteen villages. The zam\u00ednd\u00e1r is a Gond.\n\nCHHATTISGARH\u2014\n\n| CONTENTS. |\n|-----------|---------|\n| General description | 152 |\n| Chiefships | 153 |\n| Natural divisions | ib. |\n| Climate | 154 |\n| Wild animals | ib. |\n| Character of surface | 155 |\n| Population | ib. |\n| Agriculture | 156 |\n| Superstitions | ib. |\n| Education | 157 |\n| Communications | ib. |\n| Carriers | 158 |\n| History | 159 |\n| Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 rule | 160 |\n\nThis forms the south-eastern division or commissionership of the Central Provinces, and comprises the districts of R\u00e1lp\u00far, Bil\u00e1sp\u00far, and Sambalp\u00far. The first two\u2014R\u00e1lp\u00far and Bil\u00e1sp\u00far\u2014constitute Chhattisgarh Proper, and will be found noticed separately.\n\nChhattisgarh lies between 80\u00b0 30' and 88\u00b0 15' of east longitude, and 16\u00b0 50' and 23\u00b0 10' of north latitude. On the north it is bounded by Soh\u00e1gp\u00far in the Rew\u00e1 territory, and the Sirg\u00faja and Ud\u00e9p\u00far states subordinate to the Chot\u00e1 N\u00e1gp\u00far agency of the Bengal presidency; on the east by Sambalp\u00far; on the south by the territory of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Bastar, a feudatory of the Central Provinces; on the west by the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1, Bhand\u00e1ra, B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t, Seoni, and Mandla districts. On the north-west corner of Chhattisgarh, being the terminal ridge of the Maikal range, which is the continuation of the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1 range, stands Amar-kantak. From the side of this well known hill rises the Narbad\u00e1, flowing\nnearly due west to the Bombay coast, and the Son, a tributary of the Ganges. From Amarkantak the hills run in an easterly direction, inclining slightly northwards in a semi-circular form till a point is reached near Korb\u00e1, eastward of the Hasd\u00fa river; from thence they run due south till they reach the valley of the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed eastward of Seon\u00e1r\u00e1n; then, reappearing on the opposite side of the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed, they continue close to the eastern branch of that river till they connect themselves with that great southern range from which the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed takes its rise, and which bears its name. Again, from Amarkantak running south-west are the hills of Chilpi and R\u00e1j\u00e1dhar, forming part of an offshoot of the Maikal or S\u00e1tpur\u00e1 range, commonly called the L\u00e1nj\u00ed hills, but which should more properly bear the name of S\u00e1l\u00e9tekri, their principal point; while below these, and still running south-west, are several irregular ranges, which become blended in the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed range. These several mountain boundaries form a vast watershed drained by the \"Great River\" and its tributaries; the enclosed area consists chiefly of plains generally open, for the most part culturable, partly cultivated, partly inhabited by a considerable population, in places very rich, and on the whole offering an enormous field for improvement. The plateau is called Chhatt\u00edsgarh, which means \"thirty-six garhs\" or subdivisions of territory. They, with the rest of the N\u00e1gpur districts, were annexed to the British dominions in 1854. During Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 rule the Chhatt\u00edsgarh country did not improve, in some respects it probably deteriorated. During the twelve years that have elapsed since the introduction of British rule the rate of progress has been nothing like what may in future be obtained. Cultivation and population are universally believed to be increasing; but still at this moment Chhatt\u00edsgarh is probably the most backward of all the plain or champaign districts of British India. The whole of this great plateau is under British rule, but parts are not exactly under British administration.\n\nAt the base of the various hills, which have been described as forming the four boundaries of Chhatt\u00edsgarh, there run tracts which constitute what are called zam\u00edn\u00e1d\u00e1ri estates, managed by their own chiefs or zam\u00edn\u00e1d\u00e1rs. The zam\u00edn\u00e1d\u00e1rs are of ancient origin, and some have held a feudal and partly independent position under our predecessors as well as ourselves. They are in some respects subject to the British civil authorities, but in several important particulars, especially those concerning the land revenue and landed tenures, they are masters in their own territories, and within those limits they receive all the revenue ordinarily leviable by the state, paying a fixed tribute to the Government, and maintaining some sort of police and establishments at their own expense. The zam\u00edn\u00e1d\u00e1rs form a sort of girdle round the plateau. The chief of them in the north are Pendr\u00e1 and M\u00e1tn; on the east, Korb\u00e1 and Kauri\u00e1; on the south, K\u00e1nker and Loh\u00e1r\u00e1; and on the west, N\u00e1ndg\u00e1on, Khair\u00e1g\u00e1rh, Chhui Khad\u00e1n, Kaward\u00e1, and Pandari\u00e1. The last-named are strips of noble country between the base of the S\u00e1l\u00e9tekri hills and Seon\u00e1th river, and are in fact the very finest portions of all Chhatt\u00edsgarh. There remains the centre and heart of the plateau\u2014British territory\u2014administered in the usual way. It is divided into two civil districts, viz. Bil\u00e1sp\u00far, comprising the northern portion of the tract, and R\u00e1\u00edp\u00far, comprising the southern.\n\nNatural divisions. In respect of productive resources the plateau may be regarded in four different sections:\n\n1st.\u2014The valley of the Seon\u00e1th, and the tract between that river and the S\u00e1l\u00e9tekri hills.\nThis class of deistical Cham\u00e1rs now numbers at least 200,000. They are a thriving and industrious race, occupying a very important position as cultivators and village headmen in the Bilaspur district. They are regarded naturally with hatred and contempt by the Br\u00e1hmans and other castes of Hind\u00fas, which their ever-reiterated assertion of equality only tends to aggravate. The idea that such social refuse as Cham\u00e1rs should, by any change of religious belief, acquire a higher social standing is galling and painful to the Br\u00e1hman mind. On the other hand there can be no doubt that this change in their faith has practically changed their character, by creating an independence of spirit to which they were formerly strangers. In many respects the feeling of antagonism which exists between them and the higher castes of Hind\u00fas is to be regretted. It has, however, engendered among Satn\u00e1m\u00eds a wish to learn, in order to remove one formidable barrier which degraded them in the eyes of the enlightened class, hitherto the repositories of all knowledge. This desire is a good omen as regards future progress and improvement among the community, and indicates the field as a favourable one for Christian Missionary enterprise.\n\nIn addition to Cham\u00e1rs there is a large sprinkling of Br\u00e1hmans, R\u00e9jputs, Kurm\u00eds, and R\u00e1uts. These, however, have no distinctive peculiarity. The Mohammadan element exists to a very limited extent, and in a very modified form. The Mohammadans are poor and unimportant, and borrow largely the customs of Hind\u00fas\u2014celebrating Hind\u00fa festivals, and respecting Hind\u00fa traditions. Turning, however, from the plain to the hilly tracts of the district we find a complete change in the nature of the community. In the latter, Gonds, Bh\u00fami\u00e1s, and Baig\u00e1s are the sole inhabitants. The Gonds are partially civilised, and carry on to some extent a rude system of cultivation. The Bh\u00fami\u00e1s, on the other hand, seem thoroughly uninfluenced by the progress of events at their very thresholds. Their home is the wilderness; they mix little with other classes; they rarely approach the open plain; they migrate into more remote forests if their hamlets are resorted to; they hunt much, being adepts with the bow and arrow; they cultivate little; they relish largely the spontaneous products of the woods; and they live more as isolated families than as communities. Thus then, though the people generally are in a backward state, we have in striking contrast to the bulk of them still ruder and more barbarous races, who fly from the approach of the white man.\n\nAgricultural arrangements are of the most primitive character; thus it is customary for the landlord of a village to change the fields of his tenants every third or fourth year in order that every man may have his turn of the best piece. If this were refused, the tenant would migrate to another village, so little regard have the tenantry for the occupancy of particular fields, and so great is the demand for their labour on the superabundant land.\n\nA belief in witchcraft and in evil-spirits is universal, leading not unfrequently to the commission of the most atrocious crimes. When unusual numbers of deaths have occurred in any village or in any particular family, they are attributed to witchcraft, and the following method is adopted for discovering the witch or wizard. A pole of a particular wood is erected on the banks of a stream, and each suspected person after bathing is required to touch the pole, and it is supposed that when this is done the hand of the person in whom dwells the evil-spirit\nswells. No rules are laid down for attaching suspicion to any particular person, for persons of all ages and both sexes (though women are generally the victims) are selected, and accused upon the most whimsical and arbitrary grounds; while the treatment which they receive varies according to the amount of inventive genius for torture possessed by the inhabitants of the village. Shaving the head with a blunt knife, knocking out two front teeth, firing the buttocks, tying the legs to a plough-share, seating in the sun and administering a potion of the water of a tannery, are the usual orthodox methods of exorcising the evil-spirit; and scourging with rods of tamarind tree or castor-oil plant is never neglected, as these are supposed to possess some peculiar virtue for the detection of witches.\n\nEducation up to 1862 was almost unknown. When an educational system was commenced there was nowhere found in Chhattisgarh, save in the town of R\u00e1ip\u00far itself, one institution that could be called a school, or a single person who could be called a schoolmaster. There are now, however, in Chhattisgarh government schools for boys, schools for girls, and indigenous schools affording education to children. The language of the people of the plains is a corrupt dialect of Hind\u00ed, commonly called Chhattisgarhi. The Gonds and some of the other hill tribes have languages peculiar to themselves.\n\nThe existing traffic connected with Chhattisgarh follows several land routes. The principal of these is that now known as the eastern line, which runs from N\u00e1gp\u00far to the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed. By this line the cotton and surplus grain of Chhattisgarh is conveyed on carts to N\u00e1gp\u00far. After leaving the Chhattisgarh limits it passes through the jungle country in a westerly direction till it reaches the Waingang\u00e1, and crossing that river at Bhand\u00e1ra proceeds due west to N\u00e1gp\u00far. During the winter months this road is literally blocked and choked up with endless strings of carts laden with cotton and all sorts of cereal produce. From Chhattisgarh the line proceeds eastward till it touches the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed at Sambalp\u00far, having a branch to Bink\u00e1, also on that river. For the greater portion of this line\u2014from N\u00e1gp\u00far to the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed\u2014surveys, plans, and estimates have been prepared by the public works department, and several sections of it are under construction. There are also two other roads\u2014one north and the other south\u2014running parallel to the main line, by which the produce of the valley of the Seon\u00e1th is conveyed to N\u00e1gp\u00far. One of these passes from the north-west corner of the valley through Khair\u00e1garh, and skirting the apex of the S\u00e1l\u00e9tekri plateau proceeds a little south of A'mg\u00e1on and T\u00edror\u00e1, in the Bhand\u00e1ra district, and passing the Wain-gang\u00e1 near Moh\u00e1ri proceeds direct to K\u00e1mth\u00ed. This route is traversable by carts after the rice is off the ground, and is much used. The other passes from the south of the valley of the Seon\u00e1th through the hilly country of Chichgarh, and crossing the Waingang\u00e1 below Bhand\u00e1ra, proceeds direct to N\u00e1gp\u00far. The latter route is difficult, and only available for pack-bullocks; but both are much used. At present the Great Eastern line, with its northern auxiliary route, is the only one on which the principal carriage consists of carts.\n\nFor the other lines now to be mentioned the carriage consists chiefly of pack-bullocks. Of these lines the first to be noted is that from R\u00e1ip\u00far to Jabalp\u00far by the Chilp\u00ed pass, which leads from the north-west corner of the Chhattisgarh plateau across the mountains to Mandla, on the Narbad\u00e1, and thence to Jabalp\u00far. This has heretofore been an unimportant line; it is now in parts under survey and in parts under construction, and it has recently been made passable for carts in fair weather. Again, from the upper extremity of\nChhatt\u012bsgarh, near Ratanp\u016br, there run northwards two hilly routes, one of which, winding round the Amarkantak mountains, falls into the valley of the Son near Soh\u0101gp\u016br, and thence proceeding onwards joins the Great Deccan road near Rew\u0101 en route to Mirz\u0101p\u016br; while the other, passing the mountains which overlook the plains of Chhatt\u012bsgarh, and the undulating and upland country of Sirguja, crosses the Son near Mirz\u0101p\u016br, and so reaches that great mart. These last named routes are used solely by pack-bullocks. Another route follows the banks of the Mah\u0101n\u0101d\u012b downwards from Seor\u0101nar\u0101in, and passing by the towns of Chandrap\u016br, Padmap\u016br, Sambalp\u016br, Bink\u0101, Sonp\u016br, Bod, and Kant\u0101lu, so reaches Cuttack. This road has been more or less roughly made throughout, and in the section below Bod it has been greatly improved under orders of the Bengal government. Portions of it are traversed by carts at certain seasons. There is a direct road from Seor\u0101nar\u0101in to Bink\u0101 and Sonp\u016br, on which at certain times of the year there is some traffic; it passes through the Garhj\u0101t state of S\u0101rangarh, and is greatly frequented by pilgrims from the North-Western Provinces going to Jagann\u0101th. There is also a direct road from Sambalp\u016br to Cuttack via Ang\u016bl. This was partly made for purposes of postal communication; and it has not any traffic worthy of mention. Again, there is a route from R\u0101jp\u016br across the countries of Khari\u0101r, P\u0101tn\u0101, and K\u0101l\u0101sand\u012b to Ganj\u0101m on the eastern coast; and it is by this that the supplies of salt for all Chhatt\u012bsgarh are brought. It is one of the wildest and most unhealthy routes in all India, though it is at present a most important one. Lastly, there is the route from Dhamtar\u012b, south of R\u0101jp\u016br, which crosses the wilderness of Bastar, a most inhospitable country, and joins the God\u0101var\u012b at Sironch\u0101. The improvement of this latter route is in contemplation.\n\nThese routes, even the most wild and unhealthy, are traversed by troops of pack-bullocks, often several hundreds in number, and sometimes numbering even thousands. They belong to a peculiar class named Banj\u0101ras, who are both traders and carriers. These men are of a daring and adventurous character, and are habituated to the most insalubrious climates. In order to exhibit at one glance the extent to which land carriage, generally over rugged country, is made use of in this part of India at considerable expense, at some risk of human life and health, and with great wear and tear of cattle and carriage, it may be worth while to state the distances of the various routes above mentioned:\n\n| Route Description | Miles |\n|-------------------|-------|\n| From R\u0101jp\u016br via \u0100rang and Sonp\u016br to Cuttack | 339   |\n| R\u0101jp\u016br to N\u0101gp\u016br | 183   |\n| R\u0101jp\u016br to Sambalp\u016br direct | 163   |\n| R\u0101jp\u016br to Sonp\u016br | 180   |\n| R\u0101jp\u016br via Mandla to Jabalp\u016br | 218   |\n| Khair\u0101garh to N\u0101gp\u016br | 130   |\n| Seon\u0101th river via Chichgarh to N\u0101gp\u016br | 125   |\n| Ratanp\u016br via Soh\u0101gp\u016br to Mirz\u0101p\u016br | 305   |\n| Ratanp\u016br via Sirguja to Mirz\u0101p\u016br | 299   |\n| Seor\u0101nar\u0101in via Sambalp\u016br and Sonp\u016br to Cuttack | 313   |\n| Sambalp\u016br via Ang\u016bl to Cuttack | 155   |\n| R\u0101jp\u016br to Ganj\u0101m | 339   |\n| R\u0101jp\u016br to Sironch\u0101 | 230   |\nOn the early history of this part of the country even tradition throws no light. It seems probable, however, that the aborigines were Gonds, and that the country passed from them to the R\u00e1jput Haihai Bans\u00ed dynasty which ruled at Ratanp\u00far. For many years there seems to have been a perpetual struggle between the Hind\u00fas, who under their R\u00e1jput chiefs had migrated here, and the wilder inhabitants of the country. As a result we find that the primary characteristic of the first positions taken up by the Hind\u00fas is one of security. They built fortresses on high plateaus, from whence they could descend for a raid on the plains, and, returning with their spoil, lodge it in safety with their women. The increasing strength of the Hind\u00fas and their greater resources, as representing a higher civilisation, in time ensured their triumph over the wilder and weaker race, and this led to the establishment of a capital which was fixed at Ratanp\u00far. This event occurred under a r\u00e1j\u00e1 named Prithv\u00ed Deva, in the latter half of the ninth century. From that period the gradual clearance and cultivation of this part of the country commenced. Tracts were given to warriors to whose valour the chief owed his position, to favourites of various kinds, and to aboriginal Gonds of position and influence whose good-will it was important to secure. In this way the Haihai Bans\u00ed dynasty of Chhatt\u00edsgarh became consolidated, and hamlets and towns began to spring up where hitherto there had been nothing but the solemn silence of the forest.\n\nIn common with other Hind\u00fa dynasties the origin of the Haihai Bans\u00ed r\u00e1j\u00e1s is carried back to the most remote antiquity, i.e. through the seventeen hundred thousand years which comprised the Satyayuga epoch, to the origin of mankind by the creative act of the great Brahma. After the lapse of the Satyayuga period, and before the commencement of the Samvat era, 3,044 years of the old Hind\u00fa calendar, or \u201cYudhishthir\u201d era elapsed. During this period, as shown in the Haihaya genealogical table, only eight rulers are supposed to have reigned, which would give to each r\u00e1j\u00e1 on an average a reign of over three hundred years. In fact some of them are recorded as having ruled for nearly five hundred years. Such marvellous longevity accorded to those who lived in the remote past is not peculiar to the chronicles of the Haihaya dynasty, and is attributable to that great respect for the past which characterises all nations in certain stages of civilisation, and makes them concede to the ancients virtues and powers which the pigmies of the present cannot achieve.\n\nTradition asserts that at the end of the Satyayuga period a monarch named Sudhyum presided over the destinies of the East. Of his descendants one son, N\u012bla Dhvaja, got the throne of Mah\u00edsmat\u00ed (Mandla or Maheswar); a second, Hansa Dhvaja, became monarch of Chandrap\u00far, supposed to be Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1; and the third received the kingdom of Ratanp\u00far, then called Manip\u00far, by which name it is known in some of the Pur\u00e1ns. The two former kingdoms of Mandla and Chandrap\u00far, after the lapse of some generations, were overthrown by the Gonds, and the Manip\u00far or Ratanp\u00far kingdom alone survived till the advent of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. The first r\u00e1j\u00e1 of whom anything of a veritable character is recorded is Karnap\u00e1l, the tenth of the line, who reigned from Samvat 172 to 251 (A.D. 115 to 194). He made a city at Amarkantak,* and raised temples there. He consecrated the spot as the source of the Narbad\u00e1, and from that time it has been considered a holy and worthy object of pilgrimage among Hind\u00fas. Between Samvat 367 and 427 (A.D. 310 to 370) a successor of\n\n* This is also attributed to Chandra Dhvaja, the fifth of the line.\nKarnap\u00e1l, called Mohanp\u00e1l, built a city called Dhanp\u00far on a high flat hill between Pendr\u00e1 and Amarkantak. There was a formidable fort erected here called Ajmirgarh, and the place was for many years a great stronghold, and thickly peopled. Although centuries have passed since its greatness vanished, there can still be seen on this plateau, amidst the towering sal trees, remains of walls, tanks, and enclosures, which evidence the prominent position it formerly occupied. In the eighth century, on the death of Mohan (or Moha) Deva, his two sons Sur Deva and Brahma Deva divided the kingdom, the elder branch remaining at Ratanp\u00far, and the younger proceeding to R\u00e1ip\u00far. The latter, however, was to a certain extent subordinate to the former. The Ratanp\u00far r\u00e1j\u00e1 ruled over Bil\u00e1spur, Sirg\u00faja, and Sambalp\u00far; the R\u00e1ip\u00far ruler held the present district of R\u00e1ip\u00far, with Bastar and K\u00e1rond. These seem to have been the limits of the Haihai Bans\u00ed r\u00e1jas for many years, in fact until the arrival of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s.\n\nThe change of capital to Ratanp\u00far above adverted to is the next event of any importance. Ratanp\u00far was built and made the capital by Prithv\u00ed D\u00e9va. The old capital Manip\u00far was situated on the top of the L\u00e9ph\u00e9 hill, about fifteen miles north of Ratanp\u00far. There is a large expanse of tableland on the top of this hill, which stands at an elevation of about 3,400 feet above the sea. The remains of a fort, tanks, temples, and buildings are still apparent, and the position possessed the advantages of prominence and security. From Samvat 895 to 1620, beyond the record of some temples erected and towns established, of which now no traces remain, the Br\u00e1hmanical narrative is occupied with the imaginary virtues of different rulers. In Samvat 1620 (A.D. 1568), however, the influence of the Mohammadan emperors of Delhi was felt even here; and R\u00e1j\u00e1 Kaly\u00e1n Singh proceeded to Delhi with the view of being acknowledged as ruler of the Ratanp\u00far territory. He was acknowledged, and he and his successors continued to pay tribute to the royal house of Delhi.\n\nThe Haihai Bans\u00ed dynasty continued in undisturbed possession of the Ratanp\u00far r\u00e1j till A.D. 1741-42, when the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 authority was partly established in Chhatt\u00edsgarh during the expedition of Bh\u00e1skar Pant to Bengal. In 1745 R\u00e1j\u00e1 Raghoj\u00ed Bhonsl\u00e9 sent an expedition into Chhatt\u00edsgarh under Viswandhar Pant, who conquered and deposed the last of the R\u00e1jput kings named Raghun\u00e1th Singh, but afterwards entered into a treaty with him by which the affairs of the country were to be conducted conjointly by Raghun\u00e1th Singh and himself. Shortly afterwards Vishwandhar Pant, having occasion to proceed to Calcutta, nominated one Kaly\u00e1n G\u00edr Gos\u00e1in to act for him in his absence, but he died on the road; and his locum tenens (Kaly\u00e1n G\u00edr Gos\u00e1in) was thrown into prison by Raghun\u00e1th Singh, the old r\u00e1j\u00e1. These proceedings having come to the knowledge of Raghoj\u00ed, while on his way to Calcutta in 1745, he finally deposed Raghun\u00e1th Singh, allowing him a small j\u00e1g\u00edr for maintenance.\n\nThe Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 rule of Chhatt\u00edsgarh may be considered to commence from 1745, the year in which Raghun\u00e1th Singh was deposed. His place was taken by Mohan Singh, an illegitimate son of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Raghoj\u00ed, who administered the affairs of the district for eight years, and died in A.D. 1753. In this year Raghoj\u00ed also died after reigning seventeen years, leaving four sons: J\u00e1n\u00f3j\u00ed, S\u00e1b\u00e1j\u00ed, Mudhoj\u00ed, and Bimb\u00e1j\u00ed; and during a difference regarding the succession between J\u00e1n\u00f3j\u00ed and Mudhoj\u00ed (sons of Raghoj\u00ed by different wives) one R\u00e1n\u00f3j\u00ed, the brother-in-law of Mohan Singh, assumed charge of Chhatt\u00edsgarh, which he held for a year. In A.D. 1755 J\u00e1n\u00f3j\u00ed sent his youngest brother Bimb\u00e1j\u00ed to Chhatt\u00edsgarh,\nwhich he allotted to him as an appanage; and the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 rule was now extended over the whole of Chhatt\u00edsgarh, Sambalp\u00far, and the neighbouring zam-\nfnd\u00e1r\u00eds. Bimb\u00e1j\u00ed held the district for not less than thirty-two years, when he died in the year A.D. 1787, leaving a widow, R\u00e1n\u00ed \u00c1\u0301nand\u00ed B\u00e1\u00ed, who managed it for a year. She was then relieved by one Yashwant R\u00e1o Bhaw\u00e1n\u00ed, appointed s\u00faba from N\u00e1gp\u00far. Since that time the district has been under s\u00fabas, with the exception of the interval during which the province of N\u00e1gp\u00far was under the superintendence of the British Government\u2014from 1818 to 1829\u2014until its annexation in 1854. In A.D. 1803 Raghoj\u00ed having united with Sindi\u00e1 to oppose the objects of the treaty of Bassee, two victories, obtained over the united armies of these chiefs at Assaye and \u00c1rg\u00e1on, led to the treaty of Deog\u00e1on with Raghoj\u00ed, by the provisions of which he was deprived of a great part of his terri-\ntories, and among others of Sirg\u00faja, Sambalp\u00far, P\u00e1t\u0144\u00e1, Khari\u00e1r, and Naw\u00e1gargarh-\nBhendr\u00ed, attached to Chhatt\u00edsgarh, and bordering on its present northern and western limits. Although these districts were in A.D. 1806 restored and re-annexed to the N\u00e1gp\u00far state, they were resumed during the arrangements consequent on the defection of \u00c1p\u00e1 S\u00e1hib in 1818, and transferred to Chot\u00e1 N\u00e1gp\u00far.\n\nThe R\u00e1jp\u00far branch of the family shared the same fate. Amar Singh, the r\u00e1j\u00e1, however, carried on the government subordinate to the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s till 1812 Samvat (A.D. 1755), when Bimb\u00e1j\u00ed Bhonsl\u00e9 assumed the government himself, and allowed Amar Singh a grant of one rupee from each village. This allowance, as also a rent-free village, was continued to Amar Singh's son Mu\u00e1j Singh in Samvat 1879 (A.D. 1822). Mr. Jenkins granted to the successor of Mu\u00e1j Singh, Raghun\u00e1th Singh, five rent-free villages in lieu of the allowance of the one rupee from each village enjoyed by his father. Raghun\u00e1th Singh still survives, and is now the representative of the Haihai Bans\u00ed line\u2014a quiet, simple-minded Rajput, showing no indications of a distinguished ancestry.\n\nThe recognised extent of the Ratanp\u00far kingdom included the present dis-\ntricts of R\u00e1jp\u00far, Sambalp\u00far, and Bil\u00e1sp\u00far, with Sirg\u00faja. The Ratanp\u00far Br\u00e1hmans certainly believe that many centuries back Bengal, Cuttack, and the Carnatic were also subject to the sway of the Ratanp\u00far r\u00e1j\u00e1s, but there is no evidence to support their traditions, and their accounts of so extensive an empire are very visionary. The districts above mentioned, in all probability, alone formed the territory of the Haihai Bans\u00ed sovereigns. These rulers do not seem to have been a powerful race, possessed of standing armies, and capable of carrying on extensive warlike operations. The long existence of the dynasty must be attributed to the geographical features of the country, and partially perhaps to its poverty. The territory was surrounded on all sides by ranges of hills, and offered formidable obstacles to an invading force, either from the north or the south. When at last the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s invaded Chhatt\u00edsgarh on their way to Bengal, the Haihai Bans\u00eds fell almost without a struggle. The only existing remains of the former dynasty now existing consist of temples scattered over the country, and the ruins of former forts and buildings. None of these seem to have possessed any architectural beauty, nor do they exhibit any traces of refined taste. They show that the people had arrived at a certain rude state of civilisation, but there are no signs of any progressive tendency. In fact it is not improbable that we found the people at the commencement of our rule very little changed in their social feelings, habits of thought, and general acquirements from the condition of their ancestors six centuries before.\nCHHINDWA'RA'\u2014\n\nCONTENTS.\n\n| General description | Page |\n|---------------------|------|\n| Geological formation | ib. |\n| Coal                | 163  |\n| Forests             | 165  |\n| Climate             | 166  |\n| Population          | ib.  |\n| History             | ib.  |\n\n| Administration     | Page |\n|--------------------|------|\n| Revenue            | 168  |\n| Education          | ib.  |\n| Agriculture, cattle, and wild animals | ib. |\n| Roads              | 169  |\n| Towns and trade    | ib.  |\n\nA district with an area of 3,852 square miles, lying between 21\u00b0 25' and 22\u00b0 50' north latitude, and 78\u00b0 and 79\u00b0 30' east longitude. It has two distinct natural subdivisions\u2014the hill country above the slopes of the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1 mountains, called the B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t; and a tract of lowland beneath them to the south, and called the Zergh\u00e1t. The B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t may be roughly described as that section of the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1 range which lies between the districts of Seoni to the east and Betul on the west. Northwards the district does not extend beyond the outer line of the hills south of the Narbad\u00e1 valley, and on the north-west it stops at the Denw\u00e1 river within the hills; but on the south its boundary extends into the plain, and includes three parganas which form the Zergh\u00e1t, touching upon N\u00e1gp\u00far and Ber\u00e1r.* The high tableland of the B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t lies for the most part upon the great basaltic formation which stretches up from the south-west across the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1s as far east as Jabalp\u00far. The country consists of a regular succession of hill and fertile valley, formed by the small ranges which cross its surface in a general direction east and west. The highest of these ridges commences on the confines of the Harai j\u00e1gir, and runs westward across the district, with a mean breadth of about eight miles. Throughout its extent this ridge can be approached from the south and north only by ascending passes more or less difficult, the ascent from the south being much the easiest. A beautiful valley skirts the southern base of this highland, and is again divided by an ill-defined range of hills from a tract of broken country, through which is the descent to the plains of N\u00e1gp\u00far by the gh\u00e1ts. The average height of the highest uplands is 2,500 feet; but there are many points very much higher: Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1, on the second level, is 2,200 feet; and the third step above the gh\u00e1ts is about 1,900 feet, or 800 feet above N\u00e1gp\u00far. The appearance of the Zergh\u00e1t below the hills is generally open and undulating. The country is intersected by several streams, of which the Kanh\u00e1n is the most considerable, and is chequered by isolated hills and low ridges covered with nodular trap and limestone. Near the hills and along the streams are strips and patches of jungle, while the villages are often surrounded with groves of tamarind, mango, and other shade-giving trees.\n\nThe following is a short geological description from the pen of the late Mr. Hislop, but hitherto unpublished:\n\n\"The district of Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 presents a considerable variety of rocks. Around the chief station, and in a strip of country to the west of it, as well as below the gh\u00e1ts, granite occurs with the usual metamorphic strata,\n\n*This description of the physical features of the district is taken for the most part from Sir R. Jenkins' Report on the N\u00e1gp\u00far Province.\nincluding marble. The greater part of the district, however, is covered with trap, which on the south rests directly on the plutonic rocks, and in the north on sandstone. Enclosed in the trap there is found an interesting fresh-water deposit which at But\u00e1ri\u00e1, east of Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1, and Misl\u00e1nw\u00e1r\u00e1, south of it, and various other localities, yields shells, &c. of the Eocene epoch. The strata next to this in age are of iron-banded sandstone, which constitutes the mass of the Mah\u00e1deo hills to the north-west of the district. From the locality where these arenaceous beds are so largely developed Dr. Oldham has given the name of 'Mah\u00e1dewa' to this group, which I am inclined to consider the equivalent of the upper cretaceous rocks of Europe. Underlying the ferruginous sandstone there are met, in beds of argillaceous sandstone, shale, and coal, the last of which is wrought at Bark\u00f3\u00ed north of Umreth.\n\n\"The soil is black where it overlies the trap, and red where it rests on sandstone or plutonic rocks. There is nothing particular about the water, except the hot spring at Mah\u00e1ljhir on the east of the Mah\u00e1deo hills.\"\n\nThe only important mineral product as yet discovered is coal. The oldest-known coal-field in the district is at Bark\u00f3\u00ed, and has been experimentally worked since 1860, though hitherto with little success, owing to the high cost of carriage. It was first discovered in 1852, and was mentioned by the late Reverend Mr. Hislop in his Memoir \"On the age of the Coal strata in Western Bengal and Central India,\" published in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, Vol. XXIV. p. 347, and republished in the quarterly Journal of the Geological Society of London, 1855. The mine was visited by Colonel Harley Maxwell, Chief Engineer of the Central Provinces, in 1861, when he reported that \"the extent of the present known coal is decidedly limited; it measures about two feet in thickness, one foot of which may be considered good coal, the remainder has much lignite mixed with it; but still the whole burns freely together, and will be invaluable for brick-burning and other building operations. For three miles this seam is traced along the bed of a stream; and allowing this spot to extend one and a half mile on each side of the stream, there will be about nine square miles, or thirteen and a half million tons of coal.\" Since the date of Colonel Harley Maxwell's visit our knowledge of the coal resources of the district has been much extended. The seam at Bark\u00f3\u00ed, at first believed to be two feet only in thickness, one foot alone of which was thought to be good coal, is now known to yield over five feet of good coal, with the certainty of another seam below the one now explored. The chemical analysis of this coal goes to prove that it, as a fuel, is superior to any of the yield produced in the \"Dam\u00fad\u00e1\" valley, and that its heating qualities are equal to two-thirds of the best Welsh coal. There would seem also to be a great extent of coal-bearing strata extending to the east from Bark\u00f3\u00ed as far as Sirgor\u00ed, a distance of ten miles, and to the west stretching not less than forty miles in a direct line, within which distance the actual presence of coal has been detected in forty-one distinct localities, in many of which the outcrops are numerous and extensive. It is estimated that the area over which coal may be said to be in plenty is more than 250 square miles, the width of some of the seams being as much as eighteen feet.\n\nIn the beginning of 1866 Mr. W. T. Blanford, of the Geological Survey, visited the Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 district, and drew up a report on the Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 coal-\nfields after examining the out-crops of coal at eleven different places, (1) Sirgor\u00ed, the most eastward locality where coal was found; (2) A second coal-seam to the west-north-west of Sirgor\u00ed; (3) A seam in the bed of the Pench river, four miles west of Sirgor\u00ed, and half way between the villages of Chend\u00e1 and Digaw\u00e1n\u00ed; (4) Haral\u00ed, two miles south-west of Digaw\u00e1n\u00ed; (5) A seam about a mile north of the Haral\u00ed seam and half a mile south-west of the village of R\u00e1vanw\u00e1r\u00e1; (6) A second seam a mile west of R\u00e1vanw\u00e1r\u00e1; (7) A seam three-quarters of a mile west-south-west of the village of P\u00e1r\u00e1si\u00e1; (8) A second seam rather more than a mile southwest of P\u00e1r\u00e1si\u00e1 and on the boundary of the village lands of P\u00e1r\u00e1si\u00e1 and Bhand\u00e1r\u00ed\u00e1; (9) A seam about a mile west of the village of But\u00e1r\u00ed\u00e1 and half a mile east of Bhand\u00e1r\u00ed\u00e1; (10) Barkol; (11) A seam near a small shrine dedicated to Hingl\u00e1 Dev\u00ed Gogri. In this report he writes as follows:\n\n\"The above details will, I think, serve to show that these discoveries of coal-seams are the most important that have been made in India for many years. Amongst all the previously known coal localities in Central India to the west of the parallel of Jabalpur there are but two seams, both at Mohp\u00e1n\u00ed, in Narsinghp\u00far district, which exceed four feet in thickness. Near the Pench, within an area of sixteen miles in length from east to west, no less than six (or including Bhand\u00e1r\u00ed\u00e1 seven) localities have now been discovered in which seams exceeding that thickness occur, and when it is borne in mind that, with two exceptions only (Barkol and Hingl\u00e1 Dev\u00ed) the whole of these localities have been discovered since the month of October last, and solely through the researches of Major Ashburner, I think it is only reasonable to believe that many other workable seams may still remain undiscovered in this neighbourhood, and that there is every probability that this portion of the great Narbad\u00e1 coal-field equals in mineral wealth the coal-fields of the Dam\u00fad\u00e1 valley in Bengal.\n\n\"The circumstances under which the coal occurs appear in most instances to be favourable to mining enterprise. The dips are very low, and, so far as a judgment can be formed from the very imperfect sections exposed at the surface, there appears good reason to anticipate that both the quality and thickness of most of the seams will be found constant, at all events over a considerable area. Faults are numerous, but the majority do not appear to be of sufficient amount to affect mining operations injuriously. It is probable that these faults will be found to decrease in number, the greater the distance from the fault, bounding the coal measures to the south.\n\n\"The quality of the coal, so far as judgment can be formed by inspection and by burning it in heaps, is similar to that of the coals of R\u00e1niganj and other mines in that neighbourhood. It is a free-burning, non-coking coal. It is decidedly inferior to the better qualities of English coal, both on account of the larger proportion of ash, and of the lower percentage of fixed carbon. At the same time I see no reason for doubting that for railway purposes the Pench river coal is perfectly adequate: it is just as well suited as the R\u00e1niganj coal, with which the East Indian Railway is worked for some\nhundreds of miles, and I believe that for all local purposes, or for fuel for stationary steam-engines, it is excellently adapted; while for the manufacture of iron, the freedom from pyrites possessed by the Sirgori seam, if found to be constant, should give that coal advantages over most other Indian coals with which I am acquainted.\n\n\"There is one circumstance connected with the Barkof coal (and the Coke from Barkof coal. other seams are probably similar in this respect) which renders it possible that it may excel the coals of R\u00e1niganj in the kind of coke produced. Mr. Stanbrough's agent at Barkof, Mr. Adams, showed me some heaps of coke which he had made from the Barkof coal in pits. True coke it was not; none of the non-coking coals will yield by heating the same description of coke which the highly bitumenous coking-coals will produce. But the result was very much more compact, and apparently contained more carbon than any specimen I ever saw of coke obtained from the coals of the R\u00e1niganj field.*\n\n\"The question may possibly arise whether some or all of the seams discovered may not be identical. Without a much closer examination of the country than it has been possible to make hitherto it would be impossible to answer this question precisely in every instance, and even were an exact survey made, the large area of ground covered and concealed by trap and other formations more recent than the coal-bearing rocks would render the tracing of each seam a hopeless task until mining operations had advanced considerably. But there can, I think, be no question that the majority of the seams are quite distinct from each other, and I have not been able in a single instance satisfactorily to ascertain that any seam examined was identical with one seen elsewhere.\n\n\"Amongst the localities I have described above I am disposed to Localities best suited for believe that those best suited for mining purposes are Sirgori, But\u00e1ri\u00e1, and Barkof; but further explorations by boring, as I have shown above, are desirable in every instance. The availability of the splendid seam on the Pench, at Chend\u00e1, depends, as I above stated, on its continuance to the north, beneath the trap in the river. Further exploration is required at P\u00e1r\u00e1si\u00e1, and it is extremely desirable that the thickness of the seams there and at But\u00e1ri\u00e1, and above all at Sirgori, should be ascertained at once.\"\n\nThe forests of Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 are very extensive, and lie principally on the southern slopes of the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1s. They contain teak, s\u00e1j, sh\u00edsham, kaw\u00e1, and most of the commoner jungle trees. In the extensive forest which stretches from Deogarh eastward to the Pench river the large teak had all been cut down before it was taken in hand by the Forest department, but some fine s\u00e1j timber has escaped. These\n\n* \"I am inclined to believe that this coke, at all events if mixed with coal, might be well adapted for railway purposes. From its much smaller weight the cost of transport would of course be greatly diminished by using it. It has the advantage too of being to a great extent desulphurised.\"\ntracts, measuring in the aggregate upwards of 250 square miles, have now been reserved by the Forest department, which is taking efficient steps to check the system of burning for cultivation, and of indiscriminate felling.\n\nThe climate above the gh\u00e1ts is temperate and healthy. In the cold season the thermometer falls low, the average temperature being from $47^\\circ$ to $82^\\circ$ in the four cold months during the past five years. Frosts are not uncommon; and ice is frequently seen in the small tanks at an elevation of about 2,000 feet. Until May the hot wind is very little felt, while during the rains the weather is very cool and agreeable. The average rainfall is about thirty-six inches.\n\nThe total population of the district, according to the census of 1866, is 327,875 persons. In the towns are the usual non-agricultural castes and classes of this part of India, with a few M\u00e1rw\u00e1rs and Agarw\u00e1ls among the richer shopkeepers. Above the gh\u00e1ts the country-people are chiefly Kumb\u00eds, Lodh\u00eds, Ponw\u00e1rs, R\u00e9jputs, and a few Kanojia Br\u00e1hmans, with Tel\u00eds and a sprinkling of Mohammadans in the larger villages. Along the edge and slopes of the gh\u00e1ts the hamlets are inhabited by Gonds and a few Gaulfs. The language generally prevailing in the B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t (or montane) portion of the district is a mixture of Hindi and Mar\u00e1th\u00ed, while the Gonds and Kurk\u00fas speak dialects of their own. The Br\u00e1hmans of the district and some of the agricultural tribes seem to have come down from Hindust\u00e1n about 180 years ago, when the first Gond r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Deogarh visited Delhi and induced some of the more civilised classes to emigrate to his dominions. The M\u00e1rw\u00e1rs and Agarw\u00e1ls came in with the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. The Gaulfs are herdsmen and shepherds. The Gonds and Kurk\u00fas are the descendants of the wild tribes who, whether aboriginal or not, inhabited this country before the Aryan immigrations. Of these two primitive races the language, customs, and system of worship are quite distinct. The Gond\u00ed tongue seems somewhat allied to T\u00e1mil, while the Kurk\u00fa seems to have some affinity with Santh\u00e1l\u00ed *; but these languages have never hitherto been scientifically studied. Any long digression about these curious tribes would be out of place in this article. Their physiognomy classes them apart from other races; they have usually broad flat noses and thick lips. They are simple, truthful, and good labourers; and nothing about them is more remarkable than the docility with which they have turned from a life of thieving and gang-robbery under the Native rule to settled habits and honest labour under the British Government.\n\nThe following account of the Deogarh Gond dynasty, taken principally from Sir R. Jenkins' report on the N\u00e1gpur province, contains in outline almost all that is known of the history of these obscure hill tracts before they were annexed by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. Tradition says that most of the country of Deogarh above and below the gh\u00e1ts, after being ruined and devastated by some great calamity, had been overrun and conquered by tribes of Gaulfs. Farishta \u2020 indeed mentions A's\u00e1 Ahfr, the Gaulf chief and founder of A'sirgarh, as having ruled over Gondw\u00e1na; but how he acquired it is not hinted at. J\u00e1tb\u00e9, a Gond, subverted the Gaulf power above the gh\u00e1ts, and his descendant Bakht Buland carried his arms south beyond N\u00e1gpur, and made conquests and acquisitions both from Mandla and Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1.\n\n* The affinity between the Kurk\u00fa as spoken in Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d and Santh\u00e1l\u00ed is very great, especially in the pronouns and nouns denoting familiar objects.\n\u2020 Briggs' Farishta, vol. iv. p. 287, Edition 1829.\nThe origin of this family, and the steps by which it rose to be a powerful dynasty, are lost in obscurity. It is known, however, that Bakht Buland visited Delhi in the time of Aurangzeb and turned Mohammadan, in order to obtain the imperial protection, taking at the same time the name by which he is known. His rule was an era of great improvement in the country which he governed. He employed Mohammadans and Hind\u00fas of ability to introduce order and regularity into his immediate domain; industrious settlers were attracted from all quarters; and agriculture and manufactures made some progress. Bakht Buland usually remained in the districts above the gh\u00e1ts, except when prosecuting his military expeditions. Towards the latter end of Aurangzeb's reign he plundered in Ber\u00e1r, and extended his devastations over the districts held by the Moghals to the southward and westward of N\u00e1gp\u00far. The Gond R\u00e1j\u00e1s up to this time, it appears, paid a tribute to the Emperor of Delhi, and an officer resided at one of their hamlets for the purpose of collecting it on the part of the Fanjdar of Paun\u00e1r, which was the chief seat of the Musalm\u00e1n government east of the Wardh\u00e1. The next r\u00e1j\u00e1, Ch\u00e1nd Sult\u00e1n, resided principally in the country below the gh\u00e1ts at N\u00e1gp\u00far. On his death the government was usurped by an illegitimate son of Bakht Buland, whom the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 chief, Raghoj\u00ed, put to death, and replaced by two legitimate sons of Ch\u00e1nd Sult\u00e1n. When these two brothers, Burh\u00e1n Sh\u00e1h and Akbar Sh\u00e1h, quarrelled, Raghoj\u00ed took the side of Burh\u00e1n Sh\u00e1h, and after expelling Akbar Sh\u00e1h with his adherents, the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 leader gradually usurped the whole territory of the Gond prince whom he had supported. About the middle of the last century the Gond r\u00e1j\u00e1s' sovereignty above the gh\u00e1ts became virtually extinct. The earlier Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 princes are said to have managed the country well, and to have improved it; but Sir R. Jenkins records that when the districts above the gh\u00e1ts came under British superintendence they had suffered much from the ruinous rack-renting which had been carried to its highest excess under Raghoj\u00ed II. It should be mentioned that the mountainous parts of the country above the gh\u00e1ts had long been occupied by petty Gond or Kurk\u00fa chiefs, who were under feudal subjection, first to the Gond r\u00e1j\u00e1s, and afterwards to the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. When A'p\u00e1 S\u00e1hib, the N\u00e1gp\u00far r\u00e1j\u00e1, escaped in May 1819 from the custody of a British escort, he made his escape to the territories of these chiefs, and was there joined by the Pindh\u00e1ri leader Chit\u00fa. A'p\u00e1 and Chit\u00fa were well received and supported by the Gonds; they ravaged the neighbouring districts, and gave some trouble before the leaders could be expelled and the country pacified. When order had been permanently established, the British agents adopted the policy of allowing the petty r\u00e1j\u00e1s to retain their lands and rights as tributaries, and of making them responsible for the peaceful management of their estates. This system was entirely successful, and was still continued when the whole district finally lapsed to the British empire in 1854. In 1865 the j\u00e1girs of A'lmod, Pagar\u00e1, and Pachmar\u00ed in the Mah\u00e1deo hills were transferred from the Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 to the Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d district. There remain with Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 the j\u00e1gird\u00e1rs of Harai, Batk\u00e1g\u00e1rh, and others.\n\nThe district is now under the charge of a Deputy Commissioner and his assistants, whose head-quarters, fiscal and judicial, are at the station of Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1. The subdivisions of Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 and Sausar are under tahsild\u00e1rs, who exercise petty judicial and revenue powers. Sausar lies below the gh\u00e1ts. The stations of the district police are at Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1, Kham\u00e1rp\u00e1n\u00ed, Bordeh\u00ed, P\u00e1ndhurn\u00e1, Sausar, Mohkher, Ch\u00e1nd, Chaura\u00ed, and Amarw\u00e1r\u00e1. There are likewise outposts of police\nat Sing\u00e1ri, Bijogor\u00e1, J\u00e1bmai, Belpeth, Jhilmil\u00ed, Mohg\u00e1on, Lodh\u00edkher\u00e9, Bichu\u00e1, Ghor\u00e1r, R\u00e1m\u00e1kon\u00e1, R\u00e1jn\u00e1, Amber\u00e1, Mo\u00ed, and Sali\u00e1.\n\nThe annual revenue derived from land for the year 1868-69 amounts to Rs. 2,10,729; from \u00e1bk\u00e1ri (excise on liquor and drugs), Rs. 46,368; p\u00e1ndhr\u00ed and certificate taxes, Rs. 5,412; stamps, Rs. 32,138; forests, Rs. 15,764.\n\nThere are in the district four town schools * and twenty-seven village schools, which are periodically inspected by a district official, and visited as opportunity offers by all the officers of the district. Education is, it is believed, beginning to make some impression upon the masses, and the movement is becoming more popular. The number of children now voluntarily attending the government schools is 1,312.\n\nThe system of agriculture is in no way peculiar to the district; it is rude of its kind; and chiefly owing to the absence of system in the rotation of crops, and the non-employment of manure, the produce is less than it should be. The crops depend entirely on the seasons, as, with the exception of the sugarcane, there is little cultivation aided by artificial irrigation. The harvests are the khar\u00edf and r\u00e1b\u00ed\u2014the former gathered between September and, in some places, as late as February; the latter reaped from February up to the close of May, according as the season may be an early or late one. The area under cereals is about 450,000 acres; but this estimate is exclusive of the j\u00e1gird\u00e1r\u00eds, wherein the cultivation is very inconsiderable, and the population sparse. The cotton cultivation may be estimated at about 15,000 acres, and this crop is for the most part confined to the Sausar subdivision. Sugarcane again is chiefly grown above the gh\u00e1ts, whilst the wheat-producing country is mainly in the valley of the Pench, and in the neighbourhood of Mohkher, Chaurl, and Kham\u00e1rp\u00e1n\u00ed; the pulses are grown generally near Ch\u00e1nd; and the oil-seeds are nearly confined to the high tablelands near the Pench and in the Umreth pargana. The cultivation of potatoes has been introduced for many years; indeed in the time of Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 rule it was practised; and the tuber is not only appreciated and readily eaten by the natives, but its cultivation is steadily increasing. The produce is chiefly exported to K\u00e1mth\u00ed, but in every village b\u00e1z\u00e1r it is to be seen exposed for sale; it amounts annually to about 3,000 maunds. The best breed of cattle is that produced in the pargana of Kham\u00e1rp\u00e1n\u00ed; their colour is usually white, and they have all the attributes of a pure race; in size they are large, with no great bulk of body, and more adapted for draught than for slaughter purposes. The dewlap is unusually large, and the cattle appear to be allied closely to, if not identical with, the pure Gujar\u00e1t breed. The breed is much esteemed in this part of the country for its tractability, and staunchness in yoke; they are hardy, and easily kept in condition, and are quite distinct from what are called locally the Gond cattle, which are a much smaller breed, but famous as being good milk-producing animals. The animals which are destructive to human life are the tiger, panther, and bear, occasionally the hy\u00e6na; there are in addition the hunting ch\u00edt\u00e1, the wild dog, and the wolf, which prey upon flocks and herds. The wild boar, and deer of all kinds,\n\n* Including a school at the station of Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 under superintendence of the Missionaries of the Free Church of Scotland.\nincluding the s\u00e1mbar, n\u00edlg\u00e1i, and chital cause incessant damage to the crops. There are other wild animals, such as foxes, jackals, and lynxes, &c., which keep down so successfully the quantity of small game in the district that it is disproportionately scarce. But there are hares, partridges, and quails; and in the cold season the district is visited by the migratory birds, such as snipe, wild-fowl, and the kulang, which latter disappear after the gathering of the rab\u00ed harvest. The bustard and florican are to be met with occasionally, but in no great numbers. In the Kham\u00e1rp\u00e1n\u00ed jungles the bison is to be seen, and also in the hills forming part of the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1 range.\n\nThere is only one so-called imperial road; it runs between Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 and N\u00e1gp\u00far. All the other communications have been classed as local. The N\u00e1gp\u00far road has made some progress towards establishing a permanent communication: many bridges have recently been built, and the greater portion of the earthwork has been laid as far as R\u00e1m\u00e1kon\u00e1. The descent into the low country by the Sil\u00e1w\u00e1n\u00ed gh\u00fat has been rendered easy, and the road there has been remarkably well chosen. The greater number of the bridges on the gh\u00fat have been constructed, but the line of road between R\u00e1m\u00e1kon\u00e1 up to the limits of Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 district to the south is over a very difficult country\u2014black cotton soil, crossed and cut up incessantly by n\u00e1l\u00e1s or watercourses, with deep channels and muddy beds. The remaining roads in the district are only fair-weather ones, but at that season they are all quite practicable for wheeled conveyances, except towards Narsinghp\u00far. Nothing has been done yet to reduce the natural difficulties of the latter route, and consequently it is rarely attempted as a line of traffic by any but camels, pack-bullocks, or buffaloes. D\u00e1k bungalows (rest-houses) are kept up at R\u00e1m\u00e1kon\u00e1 and Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 on the imperial line, at Umreth and Bordh\u00ed on the Bet\u00fal road, and at P\u00e1ndhurn\u00e1 on the road between Bet\u00fal and N\u00e1gp\u00far. There are sar\u00e1\u00eds at R\u00e1m\u00e1kon\u00e1, Lodh\u00edker\u00e1, Sausar, and Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1.\n\nThe chief towns are Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1, about seventy-six miles north of N\u00e1gp\u00far; Lodh\u00edkher\u00e1, on the same road about midway, situated on the J\u00e1m river; Mohgi\u00f3n, about ten miles direct west of Lodh\u00edkher\u00e1, which, under the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 rule, was always the head-quarters of the Zergh\u00e1t (submontane) country; P\u00e1ndhurn\u00e1, on the direct route from N\u00e1gp\u00far to Bet\u00fal; and lastly Sausar, now the residence of the tahs\u00edld\u00e1r. Nearly all the houses are built of mud, and until very recently were thatched; in this latter respect much reform is being worked by the substitution of tiles for grass. The greater portion of the district trade is internal, but the surplus takes the direction of N\u00e1gp\u00far, the Ber\u00e1r country, and Bombay.\n\nCHHINDWAR\u00c1.\u2014The northern revenue subdivision or tahs\u00edl in the district of the same name, having an area of 2,167 square miles, with 1,479 villages, and a population of 201,354 according to the census of 1866. The land revenue for the year 1869-70 is Rs. 1,14,375.\n\nCHHINDWAR\u00c1.\u2014The head-quarters of the district of the same name. It is situated on the banks of the Bodr\u00ed n\u00e1l\u00e1, one of the affluents of the Kolbf\u00edr\u00e1, which again falls into the river Pench, about seventy-six miles north of N\u00e1gp\u00far. The site is on high ground, elevated 2,200 feet above the sea, and surrounded by ranges of low hills, the landscape being filled up midway by cultivated fields interspersed with groves of mango trees. The soil is excellent for a station, being composed of light gravelly red earth, which never remains long moist. The site of the European station extends nearly two miles\nin length, and in parts is well wooded. It is generally considered to be very healthy, and is resorted to by European visitors from N\u00e1gp\u00far and K\u00e1mth\u00ed during the hot weather. A public garden is kept up by local funds, and is a great attraction. The supply of water is plentiful; but most of the wells inside the town contain brackish or bad water; the best are nearly all outside the town. A large masonry tank is in course of construction, and will, when finished, be a great boon to the people. The conservancy arrangements are good, and the town is clean and cheerful. The principal public buildings are the district courthouse, the commissioner's circuit house, the jail, the tahs\u00edl, and the police buildings. The charitable institutions are the dispensary, the Free Church Mission native school, the poorhouse, and the sar\u00e1\u00ed. The number of inhabitants is 8,185.\n\nCHHINDWA'RA'\u2014A small town on the Ebn\u00e1 n\u00e1l\u00e1 in the Narsinghp\u00far district, twenty-three miles east of Narsinghp\u00far. The main road from Jabalp\u00far to Narsinghp\u00far passes through the town, and the Great Indian Peninsula Railway has a station here. The population amounts to about 1,500 souls, and a large cattle market is held here weekly. Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 was established by Sir W. Sleeman about 1824 for the convenience of travellers through the Narbad\u00e1 valley.\n\nCHHU'IKHADA'N or KONDKA'\u2014A feudatory chiefship attached to the R\u00e1ip\u00far district, situated to the north of, and contiguous to, Khair\u00e1g\u00e1rh. It consists of three talukas, separated from each other by the Gand\u00e1l, Parpor\u00ed, and Barbasp\u00far zamind\u00e1r\u00eds, and lying at the foot of the S\u00e1l\u00e9tekri hill. The area in the plains is not large, but it is well cultivated and fertile. It comprises 101 villages, and the chief pays a tribute of Rs. 11,000 per annum to Government. The town in which he resides is situated ten miles north of Khair\u00e1g\u00e1rh and forty-eight miles west by north of R\u00e1ip\u00far, and contains 400 houses, with 1,000 or 1,200 inhabitants. The chief's own house is a substantial stone building, standing in a fortified square, and is in strange contrast to the thatched mud huts of his people. He is a Bair\u00e1g\u00ed, but belongs to a sect among whom marriage is permitted. The grant was obtained by his family in the reign of Mudhoj\u00ed, r\u00e1j\u00e1 of N\u00e1gp\u00far, in A.D. 1750.\n\nCHHU'R\u00cd\u2014A chiefship in the north-east of the Bil\u00e1sp\u00far district, covering an area of 320 square miles, and containing 120 villages. The country is a mixed tract of hill and plain, with a population of 13,281 souls, at the rate of forty-one to the square mile. The extent of cultivation is 27,907 acres, and the culturable area is estimated at 48,538 acres. The chief is a member of the Kanwar caste.\n\nCHHU'R\u00cd\u2014The head-quarters of a chiefship of the same name, in the Bil\u00e1sp\u00far district. It is a small town, situated at the foot of the Vindhyan range, south of Upror\u00e1, east of Kend\u00e1, and about thirty-five miles north-east of Bil\u00e1sp\u00far. The chief's residence is a mere mud structure with thatched roofs, and there are no indications that his ancestors were in a more flourishing condition than himself.\n\nCHICHGARH (CHEEZGURH)\u2014An extensive but poor estate situated near the south-eastern borders of the Bhand\u00e1ra district, on the road leading from Singarh\u00ed, by the Naweg\u00e1on lake, to the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district. The area is 237 square miles, of which twenty-one and a half square miles are cultivated; the rest consists of culturable waste, and barren hill and forest lands. The population, numbering 8,371 souls, is very small compared with the enormous area of this\nestate, and consists chiefly of Gonds, Go\u00e1r\u00e1s, and Halb\u00e1s. The forests abound in valuable timber, and there is a good deal of fine young teak well cared for. The two chief villages are Chichgarh and Pal\u00e1nd\u00far, each of which possesses an indigenous school; besides which there is a government police post at Chichgarh. One of the main district roads passes through this chiefship by a formidable pass near Chichgarh, more than three miles in length, and bordered by dense bamboo jungle. At the foot of this pass the chief has dug a well and built a sar\u00e1\u00ed for the convenience of travellers. The holding is believed to be a very old one, and the chief is a Halb\u00e1 by caste.\n\nCHICHLI'\u2014A large village in the Narsinghp\u00far district, only noticeable as giving its name to a taluka which has been held for many generations by a family of R\u00e1j-Gonds, whose hereditary representative still resides here. The estate comprises thirty-nine villages, and lies in the main to the south of G\u00e1darw\u00e1r\u00e1, on the left bank of the Chit\u00e1-Rew\u00e1, extending down to the hills. When Amir Kh\u00e1n invaded this country in 1809, R\u00e1j\u00e1 Sangr\u00e1m Singh of Chichl\u00ed stood manfully by the defeated representative of the N\u00e1gp\u00far government, and distinguished himself in a skirmish whereby the Pindh\u00e1ris received a decided check. Brass vessels are largely manufactured here.\n\nCHICHOLI'\u2014A small agricultural village in the Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 district, on the main road from Bet\u00e1l to N\u00e1gp\u00far, and forty-four miles south of Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1. Here is a wonderfully-spreading bargat or banian tree, with a large ba\u00f3l underneath it. The tree covers several acres of land, and it is said that 500 horses can be picketed underneath it. A fak\u00edr receives a small allowance from Government to keep the place in proper order.\n\nCHICHOLI'\u2014A large village in the Bet\u00e1l district, lying twenty miles to the west of Badn\u00far, on the Wardh\u00e1 road. It has a population of 1,776 souls. There are a police-station and a government school here.\n\nCHIKHLI'\u2014An estate in the Bhand\u00e1ra district, which, though ranking as a zam\u00ednd\u00e1r\u00ed or chiefship, consists of two villages only. The present holder is a Halb\u00e1 by caste. Chikhl\u00ed is situated to the south of the Great Eastern Road, about nine miles south-east of S\u00e1koll.\n\nCHIMU'R\u2014The northern pargana of the Waror\u00e1 tahsil of the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, bounded on the north by the N\u00e1gp\u00far district, on the east by the Brahmap\u00far and Garhbor\u00ed parganas, on the south by the Garhbor\u00ed and Bh\u00e1ndak parganas, and on the west by the Bh\u00e1ndak and Waror\u00e1 parganas and the Wardh\u00e1 district. It contains an area of about 416 square miles, and has 158 villages. It is hilly along the east and south, and branches of the Andh\u00e1ri and the Vira\u00ed intersect it from north to south. The southern half is largely covered with forest, which also extends along the west and east. The soil is principally red, sandy, or yellow, with considerable stretches of black loam. Rice, sugarcane, oil-seeds, wheat, cotton, gram, and jaw\u00e1r\u00ed are largely grown; and there are many fine tanks, chiefly under the eastern hills. Mar\u00e1th\u00ed is the prevailing language. The principal towns are Chim\u00far, Ner\u00ed, and Bhisti, and midway between them is the village of J\u00e1mbulgh\u00e1t\u00e1, where the largest weekly market in the district assembles.\n\nCHIMU'R\u2014A town in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, situated on a branch of the Andh\u00e1ri, forty-eight miles north of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1. It is the fourth town in commercial rank in the district, and contains 1,000 houses, the population being Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, with a sprinkling of Telinga traders and artisans. The manufactures are fine\nand coarse cotton-cloths, chiefly the former, which have a local reputation for peculiar durability, also carts, both for travelling purposes and for carriage of goods. The principal trade is in cotton, grain, cotton-cloths, sugar and gur, oil-seeds, and carts; and a large portion of the sales are effected at the annual fair which is held in January. There are some fine groves in the vicinity of the town, and it possesses several temples worth visiting. There are also here a town school for boys, a girls\u2019 school, a police station-house, and a district post-office. A handsome place has been nearly completed on the raised area of the old fort; and here, facing the river, stands the town school-house. East of Chimir commences a range of hills, which runs due south as far as Moharli, and is twenty miles long by six broad. Both slopes and summits are covered with thick forest, and the range forms a striking feature in the scenery of the surrounding parganas. In a basin in the south-west is the T\u00e1rob\u00e1 lake, and all along the foot of the hills run numerous springs, which never fail.\n\nCHINTALN\u00c1R\u2014A zamind\u00e1r\u00ed or chiefship of Bastar, with an area of 480 square miles, and 100 villages. The zamind\u00e1r resides at Jigargund\u00e1. The estate has some fair teak forests, the timber from which is exported by the Chint\u00e1l\u00f3ng\u2014a small stream flowing into the T\u00e1l river. The population consists of Telingas, Ko\u00eds, and M\u00e1ri\u00e1s. Chintaln\u00e1r, one of the principal villages in the zamind\u00e1r\u00ed, is situated 105 miles south-east of Sironch\u00e1.\n\nCHIT\u00c1\u2019 REWA\u2019 or SIT\u00c1\u2019REWA\u2019\u2014An affluent of the Shakar. It rises in the Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 district and joins the Shakar, after a course of some fifty miles or more, about a mile above the railway bridge at P\u00e1t\u00f3n in the Narsinghp\u00far district. The coal, now worked by the Narbad\u00e1 Mining Company, crops out in the gorge through which this river leaves the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1 tableland.\n\nCHULBAN\u2014A river in the south-east part of the Bhand\u00e1ra district, which, rising in the hills about twenty miles south of \u00c1\u2019mga\u00f3n, and passing near S\u00e1ngarh\u00ed, joins the Waingang\u00e1 at a village called A\u2019ul\u00ed.\n\nD\n\nDA\u2019BHA\u2019\u2014A town in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, situated forty miles south-east of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1, and containing 416 houses. It is built on both banks of a broad and shallow tributary of the Wardh\u00e1, and is surrounded by numerous groves. The manufactures are tasar silk, handkerchiefs, and coloured cloths, and the place is noted for the production of neat silver snuff-boxes. It formerly turned out handsome woollen rugs, but this industry has died out. There is a small trade, principally in cotton-cloths, groceries, and salt. The population is almost wholly Telinga. Until a recent period D\u00e1bhh\u00e1 was subject to constant raids by the wild tribes on the other side of the Wardh\u00e1, and to this day the shopkeepers do not expose their goods for sale. The town possesses a government school for boys, a girls\u2019 school, a police station-house, and a district post-office, and an assistant patrol of customs is stationed here.\n\nDABWARA\u2019\u2014A village in the Jabalp\u00far district, twenty miles to the north-east of Jabalp\u00far. Coal is found here.\n\nDALLI\u2019\u2014An estate in the Bhand\u00e1ra district, composed of seventeen villages, situated on the Great Eastern Road, about midway between S\u00e1kol\u00ed and the eastern borders of the district. The area is 33,506 acres, or nearly fifty-three square miles, of which five and a half only are under cultivation. The population\namounts to 2,331 souls. The holding is an ancient one, and has always been included in the list of chiefships. The present holder is a Gond, and the population mostly belongs to this class. There are no villages of any size, and the cultivation is very rude. The Mundin\u00e1r pass, on the Great Eastern Road, falls within the limits of this estate; and the hills adjoining furnish an abundant supply of bamboos.\n\n**DAMOH**\n\n**CONTENTS.**\n\n| Page | Page |\n|------|------|\n| General description | 173 |\n| Hills and rivers | ib. |\n| Roads and communications | 174 |\n| Principal towns | 175 |\n| Fairs | ib. |\n| Trade | ib. |\n| Climate, temperature, and rainfall | 176 |\n\nA district lying between 22\u00b0 10' and 23\u00b0 30' of north latitude, and 79\u00b0 5' and 80\u00b0 of east longitude. It is situated on the tableland of the Vindhyan range of hills, and in its extreme length measures about ninety miles north to south, with an average breadth from east to west of some fifty miles, being broadest about the centre, and narrowest towards the southern extremity. The total area is 2,457 square miles, and the population 262,641 souls, giving an average of 107 souls to the square mile. To the north Damoh is bounded by the native states of Fann\u00e1 and Chhatrap\u00far in Bundelkhand, to the south by the districts of Narsinghp\u00far and Jabalp\u00far, to the west partly by the Pann\u00e1 state and partly by the S\u00e1g\u00e1r district, and to the east by the Jabalp\u00far district and Pann\u00e1. The general contour is irregular, and in some parts not well defined; there is no well-defined natural boundary to the north, but here the tableland on which the district is situated ends, and an abrupt dip in the surface occurs, beyond which lie the plains of Bundelkhand, visible for many miles. The southern boundary, however, is well defined by a high hill range lying west and east, effectually separating the Damoh from the Narsinghp\u00far and Jabalp\u00far districts. In the east again the boundary line is not definite or regular throughout, as portions of the Jabalp\u00far district and the Pann\u00e1 state in several places run quite into the Damoh boundary. The western limit is somewhat better marked, as in the lower half there are the small hills which hem in the Pitihr\u00e1 r\u00e1j\u00e1's j\u00e1g\u00edr in S\u00e1g\u00e1r; then there is the Bi\u00e1s river for a few miles, and lastly the low broad-backed Vindhy\u00e1-chal hills for the upper half. For fiscal and administrative purposes the district is divided into the two tahsils or subdivisions of Damoh and Hatt\u00e1, each of which is again subdivided into parganas. In the former are included the parganas of Damoh, Narsinghgarh, Pathari\u00e1, Tejgarh, and M\u00e1ngarh, and in the latter those of Hatt\u00e1, Bat\u00e1garh, Pater\u00e1, Mari\u00e1-Doh, and Kont\u00e1 or Kumbh\u00e1ri. A larger number of parganas were recognised before, but several have been abolished since the recent settlement commenced.\n\nGenerally speaking the southern and eastern portions of the district are hilly and wooded, while the rest of it consists of open plains of varying degrees of fertility, interspersed with detached hills and low ranges, the richest tracts lying in the centre. To the former class belong the parganas of Tejgarh, M\u00e1ngarh, and Kont\u00e1, and to the latter those of Damoh, Pathari\u00e1, Bat\u00e1garh, Narsinghgarh, Hatt\u00e1, Pater\u00e1,\n\n*This article is taken mainly from the Settlement Report by Mr. A. M. Russell.*\nand Mari\u00e1-Doh. The river-system is most complete. The two principal streams\u2014the Sun\u00e1r and the Bairm\u00e9\u2014traverse the entire length of the district from south to north, receiving in their progress the waters of the Bi\u00e1s, Kopr\u00e1, Guray\u00e1, and other minor streams. At the extreme northern boundary the Sun\u00e1r takes a bend eastwards and joins the Bairm\u00e9, which, emerging from the district, is met a little further on by the Ken of Bundelkhand, and the united streams then flow into the Jamn\u00e1. There are, besides, three principal and several minor streams in the district. The names of the former, in the order of their importance, are the Bi\u00e1s, the Guray\u00e1, and the Kopr\u00e1. They all take their rise beyond the limits of the district and flow northwards, the fall of the country being in that direction. Among the minor streams may be mentioned the Son in M\u00e1ngarh, the Bakr\u00e1\u00ed, and the Biak in Bati\u00e1garh, the B\u00e1r\u00e1n\u00e9t in Mari\u00e1-Doh, and the S\u00e1jli in Pathari\u00e1, besides several others of lesser note. None of the streams are utilised for irrigation to any extent, although well situated for the purpose in many places. The hills of the district may be described in a few words. To the south there are the offshoots of the Vindhyan range, which, however, are not remarkable here for height or scenery. The Bh\u00e1nver range of hills run along the eastern boundary for some distance, and attain to a considerable height in several places. The Vindhy\u00e1ch\u00e1l hills run along the western boundary for a considerable distance, and in several places open out into broad plains of tableland, thickly wooded with low jungle. Towards the north-east of the Damoh pargana rise the Bhondl\u00e1 hills\u2014a low range, which follows an easterly course until it is lost in the offshoots of the Bh\u00e1nver range. These hills generally consist of the coarse sandstone of the Vindhyan series, but to the west of the district the overlying trap of the S\u00e1gar plateau is met with.\n\nThe district does not at present possess any metalled roads; consequently wheeled conveyances cease to run between July and October, owing to the prevailing nature of the soil being black loam, which becomes quite adhesive after the first fall of rain. The principal road is that which connects the military station of S\u00e1g\u00e1r with the important town of Jabalp\u00far, and, passing through the station of Damoh, runs some forty miles in the district, out of a total length of one hundred and ten miles. It is partly bridged, except the larger streams, which, however, are all fordable during the open season, when much traffic passes this way. The line next in importance connects S\u00e1g\u00e1r with Jok\u00e1i on the Mirz\u00e1p\u00far road, and traverses some thirty miles of the Damoh district, commencing from the town of Damoh itself. This route is considerably shorter for the Mirz\u00e1p\u00far and S\u00e1g\u00e1r traffic than that via Jabalp\u00far, and it should become an important railway feeder. The only other line deserving separate notice is the road from Damoh towards N\u00e1god via Hatt\u00e1, the largest town in the district. By this route all foreign goods from Mirz\u00e1p\u00far and the Upper Provinces are imported, and the surplus cotton produce of the district is exported. The rest of the communications are simply tracks. The most frequented are two lines leading into Bundelkhand from the north-west and north-east of the district, by which a large number of Banj\u00e1r\u00e1s carrying grain, and other traders who employ pack-bullocks, travel during eight months of the year. Another line of the same kind extends southwards, traversing the entire length of the wooded pargana of Tejgarh, and runs down to the Narb\u00e1d\u00e1 valley. By this route a great deal of grain finds its way into Bundelkhand. The only other line which may be mentioned is a direct road from Rehl\u00ed in S\u00e1g\u00e1r to P\u00e1tan in Jabalp\u00far, which is a much shorter route than that via Damoh, but it is very little used, owing to the wild nature of the country.\nThe principal towns in the district are Damoh, Hatt\u00e1, and Hindoria.\n\nPrincipal towns. Those of lesser note are Narsinghgarh, Pathari\u00e1, Pater\u00e1, and Mari\u00e1-Doh. Of these Hatt\u00e1 is the richest, and contains the wealthiest population; it is in fact the emporium of the district for all foreign goods. Hindoria and Pater\u00e1 are manufacturing towns in brass and metals. Mari\u00e1-Doh is noted for its cloth and woollen manufactures, and Pathari\u00e1 and Narsinghgarh for wealthy grain-dealers.\n\nTwo, or more properly speaking three, annual fairs are held, viz. one at Kundalp\u00far and two at B\u00e1ndakp\u00far, with an interval of one month between them. They all have their origin from religious gatherings, but have now in course of time commenced to attract large numbers of visitors and traders from all parts of the country, and occupy a respectable place among the important fairs of the Narbad\u00e1 country. The fairs at B\u00e1ndakp\u00far are held in the latter end of January and February, at the Basantpanchm\u00ed and Sivar\u00e1t\u00ed festivals respectively, when thousands of devotees, both men and women, visit the place for the purpose of pouring Ganges or Narbad\u00e1 water on the image of J\u00e1g\u00e9swar Mah\u00e1deva, in fulfilment of vows made for wishes gratified or favours solicited. Offerings are made on these occasions to the idol, amounting to nearly Rs. 12,000 in the year, three-fourths of which are claimed by the proprietor of the temple, and one-fourth by the priests. The local legend with regard to the origin of this temple is that the father of N\u00e1g\u00f3ji Ball\u00e1l, a respectable Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 pandit of Damoh, in A.D. 1781 dreamed a dream that at a certain spot in the village of B\u00e1ndakp\u00far lay buried under the earth an image of J\u00e1g\u00e9swar Mah\u00e1deva, and that if he built a suitable temple over the spot indicated, the image would make its appearance. On the strength of this dream the pandit built the temple, and in course of time, it is asserted, the image developed itself without the help of man; hence its great fame in the surrounding country. The share of the offerings appropriated by the proprietor of the temple is said to be expended on religious objects. The Kundalp\u00far fair commences with an annual gathering of Jains, immediately after the Holf festival. A Jain temple had been erected there by the Ponw\u00e1r Bani\u00e1s, and all of that sect in the neighbourhood used to visit the place for the purpose of worshipping their idol (Nemin\u00e1th or P\u00e1rsvan\u00e1th), and for settling all caste disputes. These disputes used frequently to be settled by the imposition of fines on the delinquents, and the sums thus realised were thrown into a fund for the repairs of the temple, and for embellishing its vicinity with tanks, groves, &c. In this manner, and from special endowments, the number of Jain temples has greatly increased, and they now attract a large concourse of people, of which traders in the surrounding country take advantage.\n\nThe import trade on the north-east frontier is considerable. It consists of European and country-made piece-goods, betel, cocoanuts, hardware, tobacco, spices, rum, salt, sugar from Mirz\u00e1pur and the north-west. The imports in transit through the district may be valued at thirteen l\u00f3khs of rupees. A great proportion of these is sent to S\u00e1g\u00e1r and Bhop\u00e1l, and merely passes through Damoh. Salt is brought by the Banj\u00e1r\u00e1s in large quantities from the R\u00e1jput\u00e1n\u00e1 salt lakes via S\u00e1g\u00e1r, to supply the markets of Bundelkhand. The value of the salt annually carried through the Damoh district has been estimated at three l\u00f3khs of rupees. The exports consist of wheat, gram, rice, hides, ghee, cotton, and coarse cloths.\nThe climate is on the whole salubrious. Cholera, as in other parts of the country, sometimes does sweep over the district, and small-pox carries off a number of children annually. Fevers too are prevalent about the conclusion of the monsoons, but not to so great an extent as in the adjoining district of Jabalp\u00far. But a decrease in small-pox cases and in fevers may now be confidently looked forward to\u2014in the one from the introduction of vaccination operations, and in the other from an improved system of conservancy, which is gradually being extended even to villages in the interior, which formerly used to be choked up with filth and manure. The disease most common to the district, however, is the guinea-worm. This was supposed to be engendered from the unwholesome water of the tanks in and around Damoh, but as people in the interior of the district are as subject to it as the inhabitants of Damoh itself, the hypothesis must be incorrect. Europeans are seldom or never attacked by it; and it generally breaks out at the commencement of the rainy season. The first attack is severe, but with careful treatment the patient generally recovers in a couple of months. The temperature is lower than in the Narbad\u00e1 valley districts generally, and the hot winds are milder and of shorter duration than in Upper India. The nights especially are cool throughout the year. In the winter it generally rains, and then the weather becomes really cold; heavy frosts too sometimes occur. The atmosphere is not nearly so damp in the rainy season as at Jabalp\u00far or S\u00e1g\u00e1r. The following tables give the average temperature and rainfall for three years:\n\n| Temperature\u2014In the shade. | Rainfall\u2014Average of three years. |\n|---------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Maximum .................. | During 1865 ........ 55\u00b77 inches. |\n| Minimum .................. | \u201d 1866 .......... 37\u00b78 \u201d |\n| Medium ................... | \u201d 1867 .......... 45\u00b75 \u201d |\n\nExposed to the Sun\u2019s rays at 4 p.m.\n\nHighest .................... | 130\u00b0 |\nAverage ................... | 115\u00b0 to 120\u00b0 |\n\nThe early history of an isolated and unimportant district like Damoh is necessarily involved in a good deal of obscurity, especially as no remarkable events would appear to have occurred within the district limits, or in its immediate vicinity, to connect it in any way with the general history of the country. The only sources from which information can now be drawn are local inquiries based on popular tradition, and such fragments of documents as our predecessors\u2014who enjoyed greater facilities of acquiring historical facts\u2014may have left us. In the latter respect, however, Damoh is particularly unfortunate, having lost all its earlier records during the mutinies of 1857. According to the universally accepted tradition, the first known government in these parts was that of the Chandel R\u00e1jputs, commonly called the \u201cChandeli R\u00e1j,\u201d whose seat of government was at Mahob\u00e1 in Bundelkhand, with a local governor stationed at Bal\u00edhr\u00ed in Jabalp\u00far, to whom the territory now comprised in the S\u00e1g\u00e1r and Damoh districts was subordinate. The Chandel rule is supposed to have terminated about the end of the eleventh century, but Durg\u00e1vati, the queen of Sangr\u00e1um S\u00e1, one of the Gond r\u00e1j\u00e1s of Garh\u00e1 Mandla, who reigned in the sixteenth century, is said to have been the daughter of a Chandel prince.\nThe only monuments left by the Chandels are some temples known as \"marhs,\" which are attributed to them, but they are entirely devoid of inscriptions.\n\nAfter the decadence of the Chandels the country seems to have fallen into various hands at different times, but the most definite of the local traditions point to a period of Gond supremacy exercised from Khatol\u00e1 in Bundelkhand, the seat of a long-since extinct Gond principality, and subsequently, as regards the southern portions of the district, from Chaur\u00e1garh in the Narbad\u00e1 valley, one of the capitals of the Mandla dynasty. The Khatol\u00e1 principality is believed to have been subverted at the beginning of the sixteenth century by the notorious Bundel\u00e1 chief, R\u00e1j\u00e1 Barsinghdeva of Orchh\u00e1, who established the head-quarters of his new conquests at Dh\u00e1mon\u00ed in S\u00e1g\u00e1r.\n\nThe Mohammadan power had made itself felt in the district from a very early period. The first indication of it is in a Persian inscription formerly affixed to the principal gateway of the town of Damoh, which purports to have been put up during the reign of Ghly\u00e1s-ud-d\u00edn, and bears the date Hijra 775 (A.D. 1373.) The actual occupation of the district by the Mohammadans did not take place till some two centuries later, and seems to have been accomplished without much opposition, except at Narsinghgarh, where the Gonds made a show of resistance to Sh\u00e1h Taiyab, the commander of the imperial forces. During the Mohammadan occupation, Damoh, Narsinghgarh (the name of which was changed by them to Nasratgarh), and Lakhron\u00ed were their principal centres of authority, and evidences of their presence are still to be found there in the ruins of forts, tombs, and mosques. The Mohammadan element in the population is now very insignificant both in numbers and in position, and though the K\u00e1z\u00eds of Narsinghgarh claim descent from Sh\u00e1h Taiyab, they have fallen so low that they are glad to take occupation as messengers and process-servers.\n\nWhen the Moghal empire began to crumble before the rising Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 power, the Mohammadan hold over such an outlying dependency as this naturally weakened, and Chhatras\u00e1l, the powerful r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Pann\u00e1, took the opportunity to overrun S\u00e1g\u00e1r and Damoh, and to add them to his territory, though he does not seem to have ever established his authority over the Gonds and other wild tribes of the south and east of the Damoh district. In his time was built the fort of Hatt\u00e1, now in ruins. In the year A.D. 1733 * R\u00e1j\u00e1 Chhatras\u00e1l's possessions being threatened by an invasion from the north by the Naw\u00e1b of Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d, he had to solicit assistance from B\u00e1j\u00ed R\u00e1o Peshw\u00e1. This assistance was rendered in good time, and the invader was repulsed. To mark his sense of gratitude R\u00e1j\u00e1 Chhatras\u00e1l ceded a third of his possessions to the Peshw\u00e1. This memorable cession was called the Tehr\u00e1, all the territory held by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Chhatras\u00e1l being divided into three equal parts, one for each of his two sons Hirdo Sh\u00e1h and Jagat R\u00e1j, and one for B\u00e1j\u00ed R\u00e1o Peshw\u00e1, whom also he formally adopted. By this division the districts of S\u00e1g\u00e1r and J\u00falann, and part of Damoh, fell to the share of B\u00e1j\u00ed R\u00e1o Peshw\u00e1; Sh\u00e1hgarh, Garh\u00e1 Kot\u00e1, and part of Damoh to that of Hirdo Sh\u00e1h; Charkh\u00e1ri, Bij\u00e1war, Jetp\u00far, and part of Damoh to that of Jagat R\u00e1j. The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s subsequently wrested the whole of Damoh from the Bundel\u00e1s. It was some time, however, before the petty chiefs and relatives who held the\n\n* Grant Duff's History of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, Indian Reprint, vol. i. p. 370.\ndifferent parganas during R\u00e9j\u00e1 Chhatras\u00e1l\u2019s reign could be induced to vacate and hand them over to the Peshw\u00e1\u2019s officials, and some had to be ejected by force.\n\nDamoh then became subordinate to the governors at S\u00e1g\u00e1r, the first of whom was Govind Pandit, who was killed near Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 rule. Panipat in A.D. 1760*, when his son B\u00e1liji succeeded, and he in his turn was succeeded by his son Raghun\u00e1th R\u00e9o, alias \u00c1b\u00e1 S\u00e1hib, in A.D. 1800. After his death in 1802 his widow Rukm\u00e1 B\u00e1\u00ed conducted the government until the cession of these territories to the British Government in 1817-18. During the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 rule the district was administered by two principal and seven subordinate \u00e1mis or m\u00e1ml\u00e1t\u00e1s. The former were stationed at Damoh and Hatt\u00e1, and the latter at Narsinghgarh, Pathari\u00e1, Paters Bati\u00e1garh, Tejgarh, J\u00fajh\u00e1r, and Kont\u00e1; and there were as many parganas in the district. The \u00e1mis were all Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 pandits, and to each was attached a farn\u00e1vis or accountant of the same class, also a k\u00e1ysth k\u00e1nung\u00f3, who kept the fiscal accounts in Hindi. The authority of the \u00e1mis was supported by a military garrison amounting in all to some 1,600 infantry, 400 cavalry, and 10 guns; but of course the full complement was seldom maintained, although regularly charged for in the annual accounts submitted to S\u00e1g\u00e1r. For the administration of civil and criminal justice no regularly salaried agency was kept up. There were, however, several officials styled \u201cchaudhar\u00eds\u201d who assisted the governors in \u201cdand m\u00e1mil\u00e1,\u201d that is to say in regulating the amount of fine to be divided, and then negotiating for its realisation. These men were paid by fees on the amount thus realised. The only punishments recognised by the Code of Criminal Procedure were (1) fines for the wealthy, (2) banishment and confiscation of household property for the middle classes, and (3) banishment for the poorer classes. Civil suits were neither brought for hearing nor entertained. The revenue system of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s was to keep as many villages as possible under government management, collecting direct from the cultivators. Leases or ij\u00e1ras were, however, frequently given for short terms from one to three years. The terms on which these leases were given left but a very small margin of profits to the lessees, seldom more than one-tenth of the rental assets, and very often the demand exceeded the estimated assets of the village. The profits left to village lessees were called \u201cdupsi,\u201d which would appear to be a contraction of the words do-biswi, and if so would have amounted to two biswis in the bigh\u00e1 of twenty bisw\u00e1s. Thus one-tenth of the whole income constituted the lessee\u2019s profits, and nine-tenths were appropriated by the state. Village lessees, however, had the option of making what they could out of the cultivators, who had no redress at all, as cultivating rights were not recognised. Another method of realising the revenue was to tell off a certain number of troops in arrears of pay to recover the amount of their wages from kh\u00e1lsa villages, or from village lessees, in the best manner they could. The revenue instalments were so regulated that unrealisable arrears of revenue were unknown in the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 accounts. The plan adopted was to fix all the payments, of which there were three\u2014and hence the term \u201ctih\u00e1i\u201d for revenue instalments in this district\u2014before the spring harvest came on, so that if any of them were not made good at the appointed time, there were the standing crops which could at once be seized. Thus the first instalment was taken in \u201cSr\u00e1wan\u201d or July, the second in \u201cK\u00e1rtik\u201d or October, and the third in \u201cPh\u00e1lgun\u201d or February. Under such a system of revenue administration landed property quite lost its\n\n* Grant Duff\u2019s History of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, Indian Reprint, vol. ii. p. 104.\nvalue, the people were demoralised, and the cultivating classes reduced to a hopeless state of poverty.\n\nHalf a century of British administration has now brought about a very different state of things. Although our earlier settlements followed too closely the native models, and for long depressed the agricultural classes, the district now enjoys a light assessment and fixed tenures, the result of which is already evident in the spread of cultivation and the very high market value of land.*\n\nThe mass of the population, which amounts to 262,641 souls, at an average rate of only 107 to the square mile, is Hindu.\n\nPopulation. The Mohammadan element, composed mainly of the lower orders, such as cotton-carders, weavers, and the like, is barely equal to three per cent of the whole. There are upwards of sixty different castes or sects of Hind\u00e1s; but the classes which prevail most among the agricultural population of the Narbad\u00e1 valley\u2014such, for instance, as the Gujar, the J\u00e1t, the K\u00e1ur\u00e9, the Kir\u00e1r\u2014are hardly represented in Damoh. The Kurmis are the most numerous caste. Then follow the Lodh\u00eds, Cham\u00e1rs, Gonds, Br\u00e1hmans, Ah\u00edrs, &c.\n\nThey may be roughly classified thus\u2014\n\n| Caste          | Number |\n|----------------|--------|\n| Kurmis         | 34,907 |\n| Lodh\u00eds         | 31,980 |\n| Cham\u00e1rs        | 28,401 |\n| Gonds          | 26,724 |\n| Br\u00e1hmans       | 23,666 |\n| Ah\u00edrs          | 15,281 |\n| Bani\u00e1s         | 9,788  |\n| R\u00e1jputs        | 9,187  |\n\n179,929 souls.\n\nOther castes..... 82,712\n\nTotal...... 262,641\n\nSome of the castes inhabiting the district are indigenous, and some have immigrated in large bodies from Bundelkhand and the upper provinces at remote periods. Thus the Lodh\u00eds are from Bundelkhand, and have now been established here for nearly three centuries. The principal t\u00e1lukad\u00e1rs and landholders are of the Lodh\u00ed caste, the Mehdel\u00e1 subdivision predominating over all others. The Kurmis too are foreigners, having immigrated here from the Do\u00e1b about two and a half centuries ago. Then there are the aboriginal Gonds and the Ah\u00edrs, who, whatever their origin, appear to have quite lost their nationality and even the peculiar patois, which many castes in the Narbad\u00e1 valley have retained almost unaltered, particularly the Kir\u00e1rs, who to this day speak the broad sort of Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed peculiar to the Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d people.\n\nThe best agriculturists are decidedly the Kurmis, but they seldom occupy the wilder portions of the district, and are found mostly in rich black-soil tracts. It is a common saying that no Kurmi can exist where he is unable to raise r\u00e1b\u00ed crops. They are a most peaceable set of men, and have always been remarkable for their loyalty to the ruling power. They are very tenacious of their ancestral holdings, and seldom alienate rights in land unless under the greatest\n\n* Some villages sold lately by auction realised more than thirty years' purchase.\npressure of circumstances. A Kurmi is rarely known to follow any other profession but that of agriculture, whether as cultivator or farmer; and the real secret of their unfailing success in agricultural pursuits generally does not appear to lie so much in their reputed superior skill, as in the fact of the women as well as men engaging equally in field work, while the women of several other agricultural classes are precluded, from prejudice or custom, from assisting the male population in their labours. Scarcely inferior to the Kurmis as agriculturists are the Lodhis, who, however, are the opposite of the former in natural temperament, being turbulent, revengeful, and ever ready to join in any disturbance. They make good soldiers, and are generally excellent sportsmen. Both among Kurmis and Lodhis there is no distinction between a mistress and wife, provided always that the former is of the same caste as the husband, or better still the widow of an elder brother or cousin, however far removed. The children born from such connexions are on an equal footing as regards inheritance of property, whether personal, real, or ancestral, with those born from regularly married wives. Large numbers of the Gonds and Ahirs too are agriculturists. They are the only tribes which inhabit the wooded and hilly portions of the district, and are generally poor, of unsettled habits, and indifferent agriculturists. In the plains they are principally employed as farm servants.\n\nAmong village proprietors, as among cultivators and the population generally, Lodhis occupy the first place, holding as they do 316 villages out of 1,228, or more than a fourth; the Kurmis come next in order, and hold 154 villages, or fully an eighth; then the Brahmins, who hold 145; then Baniyas, who hold 116; and Gonds, who hold 75. Musalmans hold 71 villages; but of this number 33 are in the possession of one family, to whom a whole taluka was awarded in proprietary right as a reward for loyal services rendered during the mutinies. The remaining 351 are held by various castes.\n\nThe Lodhis abound in the parganas of Tejgarh, Damoh, Mangarh, Batiagarh, and Kumhari; Kurmis in Narsinghgarh, Damoh, Hatt\u00e1, Batiagarh, and Fatehpur; Brahmins in Hatt\u00e1, Damoh, and Narsinghgarh; Gonds in Tejgarh and Fatehpur.\n\nThe district staff consists of a Deputy Commissioner, an Assistant or Extra-Assistant Commissioner, a Civil Medical Officer, and a District Superintendent of Police at head-quarters, with Tahsildars or Sub-Collectors exercising judicial powers at Damoh and Hatt\u00e1. The police number 410 of all ranks; they have station-houses at Damoh, Hatt\u00e1, Mariadoh, Batiagarh, Pathari\u00e1, Tejgarh, Jaber\u00e1, and Kumhari, besides eighteen outposts.\n\nRevenues. The revenue of the district for 1868-69 was\u2014\n\n| Item                  | Amount   |\n|-----------------------|----------|\n| Land revenue          | Rs. 2,55,547 |\n| Excise                | Rs. 4,997 |\n| Stamp duties          | Rs. 24,575 |\n| Forests               | Rs. 8,886 |\n| Assessed taxes        | Rs. 8,218 |\n| Educational cess      | Rs. 5,110 |\n| Road cess             | Rs. 5,110 |\n| Postal cess           | Rs. 1,277 |\n\nTotal Rs. 3,18,720\nDAM\u2014DAWA\n\nDAMOH\u2014The southern revenue subdivision or tahsil in the district of the same name, having an area of 1,787 square miles, with 798 villages, and a population of 168,513 according to the census of 1866. The land revenue for the year 1869-70 is Rs. 1,43,301.\n\nDAMOH\u2014The head-quarters of the district of the same name. Here reside the Deputy Commissioner and his staff. The town contains 1,908 houses and a population of 8,563 souls. Near it are some bluff hills which radiate the heat in the hot weather, and tend to increase the temperature. In spite of the fine tank called the Phutera T\u00e1l, there is a difficulty in obtaining good water. The sandstone on which Damoh is built is of so porous a character that it does not easily retain water, and there are but few wells. Most of the old Hind\u00fa temples here were destroyed by the Mohammadans, and their materials were used to construct a fort, which in its turn has been destroyed, so that few buildings of interest remain. The inhabitants are mostly Lodhis, Kurmis, and Br\u00e1hmans, but there are also some Mohammadans. Damoh is situated on the highroad between S\u00e1g\u00e1r and Jabalp\u00far, and between S\u00e1g\u00e1r and Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d via Jok\u00e1i. It is 45 miles east of S\u00e1g\u00e1r, 55 north-west of Jabalp\u00far, and 775 miles from Calcutta via Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d.\n\nDA'NGURLI\u2014A small estate on the left bank of the Waingang\u00e1 in the north of the Bhand\u00e1ra district, which ranks as a zam\u00ednd\u00e1ri or chiefship. The total area is only 1,905 acres, of which two-thirds are under cultivation. There is only one village on the estate. A very large quantity of the castor-oil plant is grown here. The chief is a R\u00e1jput.\n\nDANTIWARA\u2014The chief village of a subdivision of the same name in the Bastar state. It derives its importance from a celebrated temple to \"Danteswar\" or K\u00e1l\u00ed, the household goddess of the r\u00e1j\u00e1s of Bastar for many generations. There is nothing remarkable about the building, which is unpretentious. It is said that Meria sacrifice used to be practised here in former years, and in front of the shrine is the stone-pillar or block to which the animals now sacrificed are tied up before being killed. The village is situated at the confluence of the Dankan\u00ed and Sankan\u00ed rivers, about sixty miles distant from Jagdalp\u00far, and about one hundred and twenty from Sironch\u00e1, on the direct route between these places to the west of the Bel\u00e1 Dl\u00ed\u00e1s\u2014a large and lofty range of hills. The population amounts to about three hundred souls, and consists of Gonds, R\u00e1jputs, and other castes.\n\nDARSANI\u2014A village in the Jabalp\u00far district, two miles to the north-west of Sihor\u00e1, containing some 743 inhabitants. It is said to stand on the site of a legendary town called A'ndhernagar\u00ed, so called from the vices of its inhabitants.\n\nDAWA\u2014A chiefship in the Bhand\u00e1ra district, about thirty miles north-east of Bhand\u00e1ra and a little north of the Great Eastern Road. It consists of twelve villages, with an aggregate area of twenty-six square miles, of which 4,709 acres are under tillage. The population amounts to 4,085 souls. The present holder is a Halb\u00e1 by caste, and the majority of the population are Gonds and Halb\u00e1s, though there is a strong colony of Kor\u00eds at Kor Seoni. There are only two large villages, in the estate, viz. Daw\u00e1 and Kor Seoni, both of which possess indigenous schools.\nDENWA'\u2014A river in the Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d district, running almost in a rough semi-circle round the scarped cliffs on the eastern and northern faces of the Mah\u00e1deo hills. It winds through a deep glen out into a smaller valley shut off from the main Narbad\u00e1 valley by an irregular line of low hills, and entering the hills again towards the west it meets the Taw\u00e1 a few miles above B\u00e1gr\u00e1.\n\nDENWA'\u2014A forest reserve in the Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d district, with an area of about one hundred square miles, extending close under the Pachmaris along the valley of the Denw\u00e1 river; it is a level tract, with a good deal of fine large sil wood.\n\nDEO\u2014A river in the B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t district, which rises in the Bij\u00e1g\u00e1rh hills and flows westwards, until, arriving at a gorge to the north of B\u00e1npur, it turns southwards and after reaching the plains, maintains a south-westerly course until it empties itself into the B\u00e1gh, about ten miles to the south of Hatt\u00e1.\n\nDEOGARH\u2014A village in the Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 district, situated in the hills, about twenty-four miles south-west of Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1. It was the ancient seat of the midland Gond kingdom. The village at present consists of only fifty or sixty houses, but foundations can be traced, in what is now jungle, for a considerable distance round. These, with the numerous remains of wells, tanks, &c., show that the former city must have extended over a very large area. There are also several old temples. Outside the village the ruins of a fine stone fort are still standing on a high peak. The whole of the buildings are constructed of the finest limestone. The situation of Deogarh is extremely picturesque.\n\nDEOGARH\u2014A state forest in the west of the Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 district, of about ninety square miles in extent, and containing some fine teak and other timber.\n\nDEOLAPAR\u2014A village in the Seoni district, forty miles from Seoni, on the N\u00e1gp\u00far road. There are here a travellers' bungalow, a road bungalow, a police station, and an encamping-ground. The village is small, containing some sixty houses only.\n\nDEOLI\u2014A town in the Wardh\u00e1 district, eleven miles to the south-west of Wardh\u00e1. This has long been a place of importance, and is now the second largest cotton-mart in the district. The weekly market which lasts two days\u2014Saturday and Sunday\u2014is also important; it is well attended, and much property, especially cattle and agricultural produce, changes hands here. The trade returns for the year from 1st June 1868 to 31st May 1869 show the imports and exports of Deoli, thus\u2014\n| Articles          | Imports Quantity | Imports Value | Exports Quantity | Exports Value |\n|------------------|------------------|---------------|------------------|--------------|\n| Cotton           | 23,317 Mds.      | 5,38,437 Rs.  | 22,742 Mds.      | 5,04,348 Rs. |\n| Sugar and gur    | 5,890 Mds.       | 47,721 Rs.    | 482 Mds.         | 5,026 Rs.    |\n| Salt             | 6,200 Mds.       | 26,977 Rs.    | 3,204 Mds.       | 16,418 Rs.   |\n| Grain            | 50,639 Mds.      | 1,26,203 Rs.  | 8,240 Mds.       | 27,683 Rs.   |\n| Oil-seeds        | 14,300 Mds.      | 53,564 Rs.    | 3,135 Mds.       | 11,815 Rs.   |\n| Metals           | 86 Mds.          | 1,672 Rs.     | 31 Mds.          | 325 Rs.      |\n| English piece-goods | 107 Mds.     | 13,722 Rs.    | ...              | ...          |\n| Timber and wood  | 1,510 Mds.       | 4,520 Rs.     | 500 Mds.         | 1,000 Rs.    |\n| Dyes             | 963 Mds.         | 14,620 Rs.    | 73 Mds.          | 1,122 Rs.    |\n| Country cloth    | 1,303 Mds.       | 1,28,281 Rs.  | 306 Mds.         | 3,790 Rs.    |\n| Ghee and oil     | 668 Mds.         | 14,549 Rs.    | 219 Mds.         | 5,624 Rs.    |\n| Cocoanuts        | 127 Mds.         | 708 Rs.       | 8 Mds.           | 69 Rs.       |\n| Tobacco          | 2,399 Mds.       | 36,363 Rs.    | 1,288 Mds.       | 21,210 Rs.   |\n| Spices           | 3,874 Mds.       | 44,910 Rs.    | 506 Mds.         | 8,029 Rs.    |\n| Country stationery | 6 Mds.        | 151 Rs.       | ...              | ...          |\n| Hides and horns  | 71 Mds.          | 2,052 Rs.     | ...              | ...          |\n| Miscellaneous    | 1,915 Mds.       | 16,243 Rs.    | 2,761 Mds.       | 7,011 Rs.    |\n\nTotal: 113,375 Mds. 10,65,693 Rs. 43,495 Mds. 6,13,470 Rs.\n\nNo. Cattle: 6,397 No. 1,43,049 No. 539 No. 12,953\n\nGrand Total: 12,08,742 Mds. ... 6,26,523 Rs.\n\nA large and well arranged market-place has been constructed at Deol\u00ed from municipal funds, consisting of rows of raised and masonry-fronted platforms for the tents and stalls of the traders, with metalled roads between, and ground fenced off for the cattle trade. A special market-place has been set aside for the cotton merchants, the ground being here covered with loose stones to preserve the cotton from dirt and white-ants, and two raised platforms being provided in the centre for the cotton to be weighed at. A fine broad street has been opened up the middle of the town, and a frontage wall with masonry drains built down either side, up to which the principal resident merchants are building their houses. There is a good Anglo-Vernacular town school here, and a government garden has recently been laid out. A sar\u00e1\u00ed has been provided for the convenience of travellers, with a set of furnished rooms for Europeans. A dispensary is now being erected, and the police have an outpost here. The population amounts to 6,333 souls, about a fourth of whom are agriculturists. R\u00e1j\u00e1 J\u00e1n\u00f3j\u00ed Bhonsl\u00e1, the representative of the former rulers of N\u00e1gpur, is the proprietor of Deol\u00ed, at a quit-rent.\n\nDEORI\u2014A chiefship attached to the R\u00e1jp\u00far district, consisting of fifty villages, only nine of which are under cultivation, and they are all poor and unproductive. It is situated on the west of the Jonk river between Kauri\u00e1 and Son\u00e1kh\u00e1n. The revenue demand is only ten rupees. The grant is of very ancient origin, and the chief is by caste a Binjw\u00e1r (one of the aboriginal tribes).\nDEORI.\u2014The chief town of a tract of the same name in the S\u00e1gar district, is situated about thirty-seven miles south of S\u00e1gar, on the Narsinghp\u00far road, at an elevation of 1,700 feet above the sea, in latitude 23\u00b0 22\u2032 north, and longitude 79\u00b0 4\u2032 east. The place is sometimes called Bar\u00e1 Deor\u00ed to distinguish it from another village of the same name. The old name was R\u00e1mgarh \u00daj\u00e1rgarh, and the present name is said to have been derived from a temple, which is still largely resorted to. In A.D. 1713, according to tradition, Durga Singh, the son of Himmat Singh, the Gond ruler of Gaurjh\u00e1mar, took possession of the place. He enlarged the fort, and built it as it now stands, at a cost of about a lakh of rupees. In A.D. 1741 Deor\u00ed was attacked by the troops of the Peshw\u00e1, who took the fort and put Durga Singh to flight. Under the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s the population rapidly increased, and the town grew in importance. In A.D. 1767 Deor\u00ed and the Panj Mah\u00e1l, or five tracts attached to it, were bestowed rent free by the Peshw\u00e1 on one Dhondo Datt\u00e1traya, a Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 pandit. In A.D. 1813 Z\u00e1lim Singh, r\u00e9j\u00e1 of Garh\u00e1kot\u00e9, attacked one of Dhondo Datt\u00e1traya\u2019s descendants named Govind R\u00e1o, and having defeated and killed him, plundered the town and set it on fire, and thus nearly destroyed it; 30,000 persons are said to have perished in the conflagration. He appears, however, to have made no attempt to keep possession of the place, and so R\u00e1mchandra R\u00e1o, the son of Govind R\u00e1o, succeeded his father.\n\nAt the cession of S\u00e1gar to the British Government by the Peshw\u00e1 in 1817, the Panj Mah\u00e1l, with Deor\u00ed, were included in the territory ceded, but they were made over to Sindi\u00e1 by the treaty of 1818 for the adjustment of boundaries,* and another estate was assigned by Government to R\u00e1mchandra R\u00e1o (see \u201cPithori\u00e1\u201d). In the year 1825\u2020 Deor\u00ed was again transferred to the British Government for management by Sindi\u00e1. At that time the country round was in a state of great desolation, a number of the villages were uninhabited, and the town of Deor\u00ed in particular was entirely ruined by the ravages of Z\u00e1lim Singh (mentioned above). The Panj Mah\u00e1l were finally made part of British territory by the treaty of 1860.\u00a7 Deor\u00ed was at first, in 1827, made the headquarters of a tahs\u00edl, including the subdivisions of Gaurjh\u00e1mar and N\u00e1harm\u00e1u. It is now part of the Rohl\u00ed tahs\u00edl.\n\nDeor\u00ed is an essentially agricultural place, and contains no very large houses. The population amounted at the last census to 4,237 souls. The town stands on the southern bank of a small river called the Sukhch\u00edn, and is traversed by the highroad from S\u00e1gar to Narsinghp\u00far. The chief trade is in corn, which is usually procurable here at a cheaper rate than in other parts of the district. A kind of coarse white cloth is also largely manufactured here for export, and a weekly market is held on Saturdays.\n\nThe fort is situated to the west of the town. It must have been a place of considerable strength, and is even now in tolerable preservation. Within the walls is included a space of three acres which was formerly for the most part covered with buildings, but is now a complete waste. In 1857, soon after the beginning of the mutiny, a Gond named Durjan Singh, who owned Singhp\u00far and other villages adjoining Deor\u00ed, took possession of the fort with a band of insurgents, and expelled the officers of government. About a month after this, however, Safdar Husen, the officer in charge of the Deor\u00ed police, having collected\n\n* Aitchison\u2019s Treaties, vol. iv. p. 253.\n\u2020 Do. do. vol iv. p. 262.\n\u2021 Do. do. vol.iv. p. 272.\na number of men from the neighbouring estate of Pitihra, attacked the fort and captured a number of rebels, putting the remainder, with Durjan Singh, to flight. A dispensary was established in 1862 in a small native building on the north side of the river. There are here also a police station, a district post-office, a customs post, and three schools\u2014two for boys, and one for girls.\n\nDEWATLA\u2019\u2014A village in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, six miles west of Bh\u00e1ndak. It is a place of some interest on account of its architectural remains, for an account of which see \u201cBh\u00e1ndak.\u201d\n\nDEWALGA\u2019ON\u2014A village in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, ten miles south-west of Wair\u00e1g\u00e1rh, known by a remarkable hill in the vicinity, from which excellent iron-ore is quarried.\n\nDEWALWARA\u2019\u2014A small village in the Wardh\u00e1 district on the bank of the river Wardh\u00e1, six miles west of \u00c1rv\u00ed. It is noted for the large fair held annually during November in the bed of the river close by. This fair, like most others in India, is of a semi-religious nature: pilgrims congregate to worship there, and advantage is at the same time taken of the gathering to buy and sell. It is said that immediately opposite Dewalw\u00e1r stood Kundinap\u00far, described in the tenth chapter of the sacred book \u201cBh\u00e1gvat\u201d as extending from the bank of the river Vidarbha (modern Wardh\u00e1) to Amr\u00e1oft, which according to the legend was the capital of Bh\u00edmak, king of the Vidarbha country, whose daughter married the god Krishna. The present religious gathering is rather more than a century old; and the great object of attraction is a fine temple of the goddess Rukm\u00ed. The fair lasts from twenty to twenty-five days, and is attended by pilgrims and merchants from N\u00e1gp\u00far, Puna, N\u00e1sik, Jabalp\u00far, &c. The value of business done is estimated at Rs. 1,00,000 or Rs. 1,25,000.\n\nDHAM\u2014A stream which rises in the Dh\u00e1mkund (or pool of the Dh\u00e1m) in the north of the Wardh\u00e1 district, and passing the towns of \u00c1nj\u00ed and Paun\u00e1r finally falls into the Wan\u00e1 near M\u00e1ndg\u00e1on.\n\nDHAMDA\u2019\u2014A town in the R\u00e9fp\u00far district, situated about twenty-four miles to the north-west of R\u00e9fp\u00far. It contains 600 houses, with some 2,500 inhabitants. Around are fine groves of trees, and the remains of some tanks of considerable size, and of an old fort, at one time the head-quarters of a Gond chief, who was subordinate to the kings of Ratanp\u00far. On the conquest of Chhattisgarh by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, the Chief of Dhamd\u00e1 was for some treachery seized by the officers of the R\u00e9j\u00e1 of N\u00e1gp\u00far and blown away from a gun. The fort has two very fine gateways in a fair state of preservation. Dhamd\u00e1 has a town school, a district post-office, and a police station-house. Among the inhabitants are a great number of brass-workers, who manufacture the heavy brass anklets worn by the females of the country.\n\nDHAMONI\u2014A village in the S\u00e1g\u00e1r district, situated about twenty-nine miles north of S\u00e1g\u00e1r, in latitude 24\u00b0 11\u2032 32\u2033 and longitude 78\u00b0 48\u2032 34\u2033. It was founded about four hundred years ago by one S\u00farat S\u00e1, a scion of the great Gond dynasty of Mandla. The Gonds were then rulers of the whole of this part of the country. About the end of the sixteenth century R\u00e9j\u00e1 Barsingh Deva, the Bundel\u00e9 chief of the neighbouring state of Orchh\u00e1, attacked and defeated S\u00farat S\u00e1, and took possession of the fort and country. He completely rebuilt the fort and town on an enormous scale, and made it the capital of a large tract containing 2,558 villages, and including the greater part of the present districts of\nS\u00e1gar and Damoh. He was succeeded by his son Pah\u00e1r Singh, whose rule continued till the year A.D. 1619, when the country became an integral portion of the Delhi empire. The Mohammadans retained it for about eighty years, during which time it was ruled by five successive governors appointed from Delhi.\n\nThe last of these\u2014one Naw\u00e1b Ghairat Kh\u00e1n\u2014was, in about the year 1700, at the time of the decline of the Moghal empire, attacked and defeated by the celebrated Bundel\u00e1 chief, R\u00e1j\u00e1 Chhatras\u00e1l of Pann\u00e1. He at first assigned the subdivision of Beher\u00e1 for the maintenance of Ghairat Kh\u00e1n, but after a short time resumed it. Chhatras\u00e1l died about the year A.D. 1735, and the State of Dh\u00e1mon\u00ed remained under his descendants till the year 1802, when Umr\u00e1o Singh, r\u00e1j\u00e1 of P\u00e1tan, a small place near Dh\u00e1mon\u00ed, obtained possession of the fort and country by treachery. After ruling there some five months he was himself attacked and defeated by the army of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of N\u00e1gpur, who annexed the country. In A.D. 1818, soon after the defeat and flight of A\u00b4p\u00e1 S\u00e1hib, r\u00e1j\u00e1 of N\u00e1gpur, the fort was invested by a British force under General Marshall, who, having ineffectually offered the garrison Rs. 10,000 in payment of arrears of pay, on condition of immediate evacuation, opened batteries against the place with such effect that in six hours it was yielded unconditionally. Dh\u00e1mon\u00ed thus came under British rule, but the tract then had been reduced from its former dimensions to thirty-three villages only.\n\nThe present condition of the place is desolate and miserable in the extreme, the whole population being little more than one hundred souls. The ruins of mosques, tombs, and buildings that may be seen for nearly a mile round the fort and lake show what a large and important town it must have been, especially during the Mohammadan rule. The town is situated to the west of the fort, and the lake, which is of considerable size, to the south-west of the town. The supply of water is very good, and the soil near the village is remarkably fertile, as is shown by the luxuriant and varied vegetation. Inside and close to the fort are large groves of custard-apple trees.\n\nThe fort stands on an eminence at a short distance from the summit of the gh\u00e1ts leading to Bundelkhand, and commands the valley of the river Dhas\u00e1n. It is of a triangular ground-plan, and encloses a space of fifty-two acres. The ramparts are in general fifty feet high, and in most parts fifteen feet thick, with enormous round towers. There are besides interior works strengthening the defences of the eastern quarter, where the magazine and officers\u2019 quarters were probably situated.\n\nDHAMTARI\u2014The southern revenue subdivision or tahs\u00edl in the R\u00e1jp\u00far district, having an area of 2,089 square miles, with 1,140 villages, and a population of 228,575 according to the census of 1866. The land revenue of the tahs\u00edl for the year 1869-70 is Rs. 1,22,169-4-0.\n\nDHAMTARI\u2014The largest and most important town in the southern portion of the R\u00e1jp\u00far district. It is situated thirty-six miles to the south of R\u00e1jp\u00far, and is the head-quarters of a tahs\u00edl (sub-collectorate). It contains 1,500 houses and 4,632 inhabitants. It is not a place of any great antiquity, nor is there anything remarkable connected with it. The main road from the north to the territories of Bastar and K\u00e1nker passes through the town. The country around is level, and the soil of great fertility. The crops of wheat, rice, cotton, oil-seeds, and sugarcane are not surpassed in any other part of Chhattisgarh. Here are a town school, a girls\u2019 school, a dispensary, a post-office, and a police station-house. There are also several lac agencies, which purchase the raw material as brought in by the collectors from the jungles, and export from\n2,000 to 2,400 bullock-loads yearly. The lac is bought on the stick called k\u00e1ri, and is cleaned at the agents' godowns by women. The loss in weight may on the average be put down as four to five maunds in the bojha of twelve maunds. Thus cleaned it is styled d\u00e1l; it is then bruised small, and having been securely packed for export in gunny bags, is removed on the backs of bullocks. Banj\u00e1ras reckon the bojha of lac at eight maunds, or 128 seers, and for each such bojha receive from Rs. 5-12-0 to Rs. 6-4-0 for transport to Mirz\u00e1p\u00far, or Rs. 4 to Jabalp\u00far.\n\nDHANORA'\u2014A zam\u00ednd\u00e1ri in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, situated twenty-three miles east-south-east of Wair\u00e1g\u00e1rh, and containing twenty villages.\n\nDHANORI'\u2014A village in the \u00c1rv\u00ed tahsil of the Wardh\u00e1 district, situated about twenty-six miles north-west of Wardh\u00e1. It contains 1,100 inhabitants, principally cultivators, with some dyers and weavers. Only separated from Dhanori by a small stream (which dries up in the hot season) is the village of Bah\u00e1durp\u00far. The two are so close together that their names are often joined. Dhanori contains a village school and a police outpost. A small market is held here every Friday.\n\nDHAPEWARA'\u2014A small town in the N\u00e1gp\u00far district, bisected by the Chandrabh\u00e1g\u00e1, and in the midst of a plain of great fertility. It is twenty miles north-west of N\u00e1gp\u00far, and equidistant between Kalmeswar and S\u00e1oner. The population amounts to 4,566, of whom a great proportion are Kosht\u00eds, employed in the manufacture of cotton-cloth. The manufacture of cotton goods was established here earlier than in almost any other town in the district, so that the skilled workmen of the place have been in much demand elsewhere. The fort, which stands in a commanding position overlooking the town and the river, was built for protection against the Pindh\u00e1ris about sixty years ago. The town is well-drained, clean, and healthy.\n\nDHASA'N\u2014This river rises in Bhop\u00e1l, a few miles to the north of S\u00edrm\u00e1u, at an elevation of some 2,000 feet. After a course of ten or twelve miles it enters the S\u00e1g\u00e1r district, through which, after flowing about sixty miles, it runs along the southern boundary of the Lalatp\u00far district of the North-West Provinces, and finally falls into the Betw\u00e1. Its total length may be about 220 miles. On the road between S\u00e1g\u00e1r and R\u00e1hatgarh it is crossed by a stone bridge.\n\nDHU'MA'\u2014A village in the Seoni district, situated thirteen miles to the north of Lakhn\u00e1don, and thirty-four miles from Jabalp\u00far on the Northern Road at an elevation of 1,800 feet above the level of the sea. There are here a school, encamping-ground, police station, a travellers' bungalow and road bungalow. The population exceeds 1,000 souls.\n\nDINA'\u2014A river in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, which rises in the north of the Ah\u00edr\u00ed zam\u00ednd\u00e1ri, and after a southerly course of twenty-five miles falls into the Pranh\u00edt\u00e1 a little below Bor\u00ed.\n\nDOMA'\u2014A flourishing village in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, situated under a western bluff of the Perz\u00e1g\u00e1rh range, fourteen miles north-east of Chim\u00far. It is held in mokh\u00e1sa tenure by a Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 sard\u00e1r, whose ancestor was present with Raghoj\u00ed I. at the conquest of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1. About a mile east of Dom\u00e1 is the Mugd\u00e1 spring.\n\nDONGARGA'ON\u2014A prosperous village in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, twenty-six miles south-west of Brahmap\u00far, possessing a very fine irrigation-reservoir.\n\nDONGARGARH\u2014A small village, situated in the south-east of the Khair\u00e1g\u00e1rh zam\u00ednd\u00e1ri, attached to the R\u00e1\u00edp\u00far district. It was once a town of\nimportance, and a large weekly market is still held here. The place is now chiefly remarkable for the ruins of the fort, which must have been a place of considerable strength. Its remains are still visible along the north-east base of a detached oblong rocky hill, about four miles in circuit, near the village. The spurs of the hill, which is very steep, and covered with large boulders, were connected by walls of rude and massive masonry, inside of which tanks were dug; and there are traces of a deep fosse beyond the walls. There are no remains of buildings on the hill, nor can any vestiges of military works on any of its other faces be traced. Indeed no other defences were necessary, as the hill is in most parts all but inaccessible. It must, however, if held for any time have required a very large garrison: and it is hard to see, in the absence of any building for storing grain, how the necessary garrison could have been fed during a long siege.\n\nDONGARTAL\u2014A village in the Seoni district at the foot of the gh\u00e1ts, celebrated for its breed of cattle, and inhabited by Gaul\u00eds. It is situated on the old road between Seoni and N\u00e1gpur, and is not far from Deolap\u00e1r, through which the new road runs. There are here a very fine tank and the ruins of an old fort, both of which are attributed to T\u00e1j Kh\u00e1n, the ancestor of the Diw\u00e1ns of Seoni.\n\nDRU\u2019G\u2014The western revenue subdivision or tahs\u00edl in the R\u00e1ip\u00far district, having an area of 977 square miles, with 516 villages, and a population of 168,403 according to the census of 1866. The land revenue of the tahs\u00edl for the year 1869-70 is Rs. 1,38,131.\n\nDRU\u2019G\u2014A town in the R\u00e1ip\u00far district, situated on the Great Eastern Road, twenty-four miles to the west of R\u00e1ip\u00far; is the head-quarters of the tahs\u00edl (sub-collectorate) of the same name. The fort, now in a dismantled condition, is known to be of great antiquity. The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s made it their base of operations in A.D. 1740-41, when they overran the Chhatt\u00edsgarh country. Besides occupying the fort, they formed an intrenched camp on the high ground on which the town stands, and from which a clear view of the surrounding country is obtainable, thus rendering a surprise next to impossible. Dr\u00fag now contains about 500 houses and 2,200 inhabitants. The cloths manufactured here are celebrated throughout the district for their excellence. The public institutions are a tahs\u00edl, a police station-house, a girls\u2019 school, a town school, a post-office, a travellers\u2019 resthouse, and a dispensary.\n\nDU\u2019DHI\u2014A river rising in the Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 district and flowing into the Narbad\u00e1 after a course of some fifty miles. For the greater part of its course it divides the Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d and Narsinghp\u00far districts. It is crossed by a railway bridge near the village of Junhet\u00e1 in the Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d district.\n\nDUDHMA\u2019LA\u2014A small zam\u00edn\u00e1ri or chiefship in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, situated seventeen miles south-east of Wair\u00e1garh. It contains thirteen villages.\n\nDUMAGUDEM\u2014The head-quarters of the Upper God\u00e1v\u00e1ri navigation works, distant about one hundred and twenty miles from Sironch\u00e1 and one hundred and twenty miles from Ellor. A magistrate resides here permanently, and the place has a post-office, telegraph office, and police station-house. There is regular communication with R\u00e1j\u00e1mandr\u00ed and the coast by river for six months, and more or less for the remainder of the year, by tramway for twenty miles to Gollagudem, and thence by steamer or boat. The Church Mission Society have a branch establishment here, besides several schools in the village and in its vicinity.\nEKA'LA'\u2014A pleasantly situated and thriving village in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, twenty miles south of Brahmapur\u00ed, possessing a very fine irrigation-reservoir.\n\nERAN\u2014The chief village of a tract of the same name in the S\u00e1g\u00e1r district, about forty-eight miles west of S\u00e1g\u00e1r. It contains 107 houses, with 446 inhabitants. The following account of the antiquities for which it is famous was contributed by General Cunningham to the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal* in August 1847:\n\n\"Ehrin, in the S\u00e1g\u00e1r territory, is now a village on the left bank of the Beema near its junction with the Betwah, about twenty-five miles N.E. from Serong; but it appears once to have been a town of some local repute. Small copper coins can still be found after each successive annual denudation of the mounds which mark its site; and several adjoining monuments of stone\u2014remains perhaps of an extensive integral series\u2014make the place well known for many miles around. Some of the coins accompany this letter, but nothing perhaps can be made of them.\"\n\n\"The most remarkable of the monumental remains is Vishnu, manifest as the Boar. The animal stands about ten feet high, with his snout in the air, and it is in length perhaps twelve feet. The body is carved all over with successive rows of small figures, having the short tunic and high cap or head-dress remarked at Oodehghir and Satcheh. A band, ornamented with human figures seated, encircles the neck of the animal. The tongue projects, and supports a human figure erect on its tip. A young female, here as at Oodehghir, hangs by the arm by the right tusk, while the breast is occupied with an inscription, of which a copy has been made as accurately as its mutilated state and the shortness would allow.\"\n\n\"The Boar itself is ill-shaped, but the human figures show more skill in design.\n\n\"To one side of this 'Owtar' stands a four-armed divinity, twelve or fourteen feet high. His habiliments are Indian; that is, his loins are girt. He has a high cap or head-dress, while round his neck and reaching to his feet there is a thick ornamental cord resembling a modern 'boa,' with its ends joined. The vestibule of a small cupola which once probably covered this statue is still standing. On these entrance columns are seen figures who wear the Juneeao or thread of the noble Indian races, in addition to the ornamental cord above described. Other devices consist of twisted snakes, suspended bells, of figures of elephants, fishes, frogs; of women naked, recumbent, and giving suck to children; and of seated Buddhas. There are also many faces of Satyrs filling bosses or compartments.\n\n\"Behind a small pillared temple there still stands a figure with the face perhaps of a lion, but with a human body and with human limbs.\n\n\"The above three figures form one row or series, with, however, other undescribed remains between them or beyond them. In front of them there are three figures of couching lions, and in front of these again\n\n* No. clxxxi. pp. 760, 761.\n\u2020 \"Small, square, and much worn copper coins, with the bodhi tree, swastica, and other Buddhist emblems.\"\u2014[Eds.]\n\u2021 \"This inscription has been published, with a translation, in vol. vii. p. 632 of the Journal.\"\u2014[Eds.]\nare two columns, or rather one pillar and a fragment, and a small temple, half buried in the soil. The column has a broad base; for about fifteen feet the shaft is square, and for about ten feet more it is round. The bell capital, described at Satcheh, occupies perhaps two feet; a second capital, so to speak, adds three feet more to the height, and forms a pedestal for a small double-fronted four-armed statue. On this column there is likewise an inscription, which has been copied as well as time and decay would allow.\n\n\"Among the many figures carved on fallen pillars, the use of the Juneao may be observed; and the whole of the remains are attributed to one Raja Behrat.\"\n\nIt may be added that these remains are principally interesting on account of the inscription on the column, from which the date of Buddhagupta, of the great Gupta line of Magadha, is established.\n\nF\n\nFATEHPU'R\u2014A large village in the Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d district, situated on the outer slope of the low limestone hills which shut in the Denw\u00e1 valley just below the Mah\u00e1deo mountain. The road from B\u00e1nkher\u00ed up to Pachmar\u00ed passes through this place, which was formerly of some importance as being the residence of an old family of Gond r\u00e1j\u00e1s, who held a kind of semi-independent dominion over the surrounding country from the days of the Mandla dynasty down to our own times. The present representatives of the line hold large proprietary estates in the neighbourhood, and still live at Fatehp\u00far. T\u00e1tia Topl\u00e1 passed this way to the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1s in 1858.\n\nFINGESWAR\u2014A chiefship attached to the R\u00e1ip\u00far district, and situated thirty miles to the south of R\u00e1ip\u00far. It is said to have been granted in A.D. 1579 to an ancestor of the present family. It consists of eighty villages, and contains some valuable forests. The chief is by caste a R\u00e9j-Gond.\n\nG\n\nGA'DARWA'RA'\u2014The western revenue subdivision or tahsil of the Narsinghp\u00far district, having an area of 654 square miles, with 361 villages, and a population of 147,280 souls according to the census of 1866. The land revenue of the tahsil for the year 1869-70 is Rs. 1,70,884. G\u00e1darw\u00e1r\u00e1 is the most flourishing portion of the Narsinghp\u00far district.\n\nGA'DARWA'RA'\u2014A flourishing commercial town in the Narsinghp\u00far district, situated on an undulating piece of land on the left bank of the river Shakar, with two main streets, which, though narrow, are well-kept. The supply of water is abundant, there being besides the river Shakar, which has a perennial stream, seven masonry and twenty-eight unlined wells. The population consists of 5,523 souls, the majority of whom are tradesmen and artisans. The preponderating castes are Br\u00e1hmans, R\u00e9jputs, and Kurmis. G\u00e1darw\u00e1r\u00e1 is the centre of a brisk and extensive trade in cotton, salt, and grain. Kh\u00e1rw\u00e1 cloth and \"chh\u00e1nti\" are manufactured here. Some of the bankers are known to be men of means, and among these may be mentioned Seo Baksh and Mohanl\u00e1l S\u00e9th, who have shown their public spirit by building a large resthouse, at a cost of Rs. 5,825. The public offices of the fiscal and judicial officers and of the police inspector are in the small fortress on the banks of the Shakar, the outer walls of which are said to have been built by a family of Gond-R\u00e9jputs.\nfor their own protection in the early part of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 rule. Government offices were built within the quadrangle by Lachhman Sah\u00ed on his appointment by Naw\u00e1b S\u00fad\u00edk Al\u00ed Kh\u00e1n, the governor of the province, as kam\u00e1visd\u00e1r of the district, in Samvat 1863 (A.D. 1806). Thenceforward the town rose in importance, and the population and trade increased. Its position is commercially a good one, being situated on the bifurcation of the roads to Jabalp\u00far and S\u00e1g\u00e1r. There is a boys' school here of the town school grade, with an English class. Two markets are held weekly\u2014one on Monday and the other on Friday. The station of Narsinghp\u00far is distant twenty-eight miles by the main road.\n\nGADHAIR\u00cd\u2014An affluent of the Sun\u00e1r in the S\u00e1g\u00e1r district. On the ground at the confluence of the Gadhair\u00ed and Sun\u00e1r stands the town of Garh\u00e1kot\u00e1.\n\nGAISA\u00b4BA'D\u2014A village in the Damoh district, on the road from Hatt\u00e1 to N\u00e1g\u00f3d, sixteen miles from the former place, on the left bank of the Bairm\u00e1. It now contains only 237 houses, with a population of 874 souls, but was an important place under the Bundelk\u00e1s. An annual fair is still held here, and there are a police outpost and a government school.\n\nGANDAI\u2014A chiefship attached to the R\u00e1ip\u00far district, lying at the foot of the S\u00e1l\u00e9tekr\u00ed hills, about fifty-six miles to the north-west of R\u00e1ip\u00far. It was once much larger, but in A.D. 1828, by the sanction of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of N\u00e1gp\u00far, the estate was divided into three parts, and given to the three sons of the former holder. This portion now consists of eighty-five villages only. The chief is by caste a Gond.\n\nGANESGANJ\u2014A small village in the Seoni district, with an encamping-ground, situated on the Northern Road, 32\u00bd miles to the north of Seoni. There is here a bridge of five arches over the Bijn\u00e1.\n\nGANJA'L\u2014A stream in the Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d district, which rises in the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1 hills, and after traversing the plain between Seoni and Hard\u00e1 falls into the Moran, and so joins the Narb\u00e1d\u00e1. During the rainy season it is a mountain-torrent, impassable when the floods are out, but for the rest of the year it is a clear shallow stream, flowing over a deep gravelly bed.\n\nGARHA\u00b4\u2014In the Jabalp\u00far district, once the capital of the Gond dynasty of Garh\u00e1 Mandl\u00e1, whose ancient keep, known as the Madan Mahal, still crowns the low granite range, along the foot of which the town is built. These hills form a detached group of about two miles in length, and the town extends itself for about the same distance. Tradition gives Garh\u00e1 a great antiquity, and it probably existed before the Christian era. Its decline in importance dates from the removal of the Gond dynasty to Singaurgarh, and subsequently to Mandla. The Mahal was built about A.D. 1100 by Madan Singh, and is now a ruin. Under it, to the west, is the beautiful Gang\u00e1 S\u00e1g\u00e1r tank, and near it is the large sheet of water called the B\u00e1\u00ed S\u00e1g\u00e1r. The trade of Garh\u00e1 is insignificant, though the place consists of 1,045 houses, and has 4,126 inhabitants. There is an excellent government school here, numbering about 100 scholars; and there was formerly a mint in which an inferior rupee called the B\u00e1l\u00e1 Sh\u00e1h\u00ed was coined, which was current throughout Bundelkhand. The mint was in full operation when Mr. Daniel Leckie passed through the place in 1790. Garh\u00e1 is 90 miles S.E. from S\u00e1g\u00e1r, 200 S.W. from Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, 303 S. from \u00c1gra, and 273 W. from Mhow.\n\nGARHA\u00b4KOTA\u00b4\u2014The chief town of a tract of the same name in the S\u00e1g\u00e1r district, situated in an angle formed by the rivers Sun\u00e1r and Gadhair\u00ed, about twenty-seven miles east of S\u00e1g\u00e1r, and two hundred and six miles south-west of\nAllahabad, in north latitude 23\u00b0 47', and east longitude 79\u00b0 12'. It contains 2,553 houses and 10,830 inhabitants, and has an elevation of about 1,435 feet above the sea. The place is supposed to have been founded by the Gonds about four hundred years ago, the whole of the adjacent country being also probably at the time under their rule. They remained in possession till about A.D. 1629, when a Rajput raja named Chandra Sa came down from Bundelkhand and expelled them. He built the fort, which is now standing, between two small streams\u2014the Gadhari and Sunar. His descendants retained the place till A.D. 1703 when Hirde Sa, son of the famous Bundela chief Chhatra Sa, raja of Panna, invaded the country and took the fort, giving the Rajput chief in lieu the single village of Naigawan in Rehli, which is still held on a quit-rent by one of his descendants named Gulab Singh. Soon after this Hirde Sa built another town east of the fort on the other side of the river, and called it after his own name\u2014Hirde Nagar. He also improved and enlarged the fort and town. He died in A.D. 1739, and for three generations after him the territory remained undisturbed. But in the year A.D. 1744, during the reign of Subha Singh, a younger brother named Prithvi Singh, who had failed in obtaining what he considered a proper share of the inheritance, invited the Peshwa to his assistance, promising that, if the territory should be recovered for him, a fourth of its revenues should be paid regularly to that power. This being agreed on, troops were despatched, by whom Subha Singh was defeated, and Prithvi Singh set up as ruler of the town and tract of Garhakota with other subdivisions adjoining. In A.D. 1810, when Mardan Singh, a descendant of Prithvi Singh, was in possession, the Raja of Nagpur invested the fort. After some fighting Mardan Singh was killed, on which his son Arjun Singh begged assistance from Sindiya, promising that if effectual relief was afforded, one-half of the territory should be ceded to him. Sindiya acceded to these terms, and despatched an army under the command of Colonel Jean Baptiste. The latter defeated and put to flight the Nagpur troops, and according to the stipulation retained possession of Malthon and Garhakota, leaving to Arjun Singh the country of Shaghar with other territory. Baptiste remained at Garhakota for some time as governor of the fort. Some eight years after this, in A.D. 1819, Arjun Singh managed by treachery again to seize the fort. After he had been there, however, for about six months he was ejected by General Watson with a British force. The place was taken possession of on behalf of Sindiya, but the management of the country was carried on by the British, the revenues being annually accounted for to the Gwalior darbar, till A.D. 1861, when an exchange of territories was effected, and Sindiya's nominal possession was terminated.\n\nGarhakota is now one of the largest and most flourishing towns in the Sagar district. It consists in fact of two towns, viz. Garhakota and Hirdenagar, the former situated on the west, and the latter on the east, bank of the river Sunar. It is in Hirdenagar that all the trade of the place, which is considerable, is carried on; but Garhakota has always been the name of the combined towns. The chief articles of manufacture are red cloths called \"adhi\" and \"pathi,\" worn chiefly by women. Gur, or coarse sugar, is also largely produced and exported. Grain, especially rice and wheat, is also sent both north and south. A market is held here every Friday, and is well attended. The chief articles of sale are cattle, grain, and cloths, Native and English. A large fair is also held here yearly, generally lasting for six weeks, commencing from the 18th of January. It is essentially a cattle fair, and is usually attended by about 30,000 people, who bring their cattle from Gwalior, Bhopal, Bundelkhand, Nagpur, and most districts of the Central Provinces. Besides cattle,\nfruit and eatables of every description, copper and brass-wares, and cloth of all kinds, are exposed for sale. According to an ancient custom a small fee is levied for the registration of sales of cattle at this fair. The total fees sometimes amount to as much as Rs. 5,000 per annum.\n\nThe accompanying table exhibits the Imports and Exports of the town of Garh\u00e1kot\u00e1 for the year 1868-69:\n\n| Articles                        | Imports |          | Exports |          |\n|---------------------------------|---------|----------|---------|----------|\n|                                 | Quantity| Value    | Quantity| Value    |\n|                                 | Mds.    | Rs.      | Mds.    | Rs.      |\n| Cotton                          | 88      | 1,810    | 6,160   | 83,897   |\n| Sugar and gur                   | 1,375   | 10,500   | 549     | 6,477    |\n| Salt                            | 421     | 3,980    | 7,869   | 5,183    |\n| Wheat                           | 3,713   | 9,253    | 5,319   | 15,949   |\n| Rice                            | 2,261   | 7,782    | 507     | 2,290    |\n| Other edible grains             | 4,768   | 9,391    | 6,414   | 14,818   |\n| Oil-seeds of all descriptions   | 986     | 2,599    | 408     | 1,303    |\n| Metals and hardware             | 226     | 5,322    | 74      | 2,890    |\n| English piece-goods             | 209     | 14,743   | 34      | 4,551    |\n| Country cloth                   | 143     | 9,083    | 588     | 30,028   |\n| Lac                             | 1       | 10       | 76      | 673      |\n| Tobacco                         | 327     | 4,572    | 34      | 351      |\n| Spices                          |         |          |         |          |\n| Country stationery              | 125     | 1,819    | 108     | 1,615    |\n| Silk and silk cocoons           |         |          |         |          |\n| Dyes                            | 102     | 1,442    | 20      | 215      |\n| Hides and horns                 | 22      | 790      | 42      | 570      |\n| Opium                           |         | 40       |         |          |\n| Wool                            | 3       | 91       | 6       | 113      |\n| Timber and wood                 | 183     | 427      | 144     | 2,200    |\n| Ghee and oil                    | 461     | 80,449   | 541     | 9,647    |\n| Cocoanuts                       | 215     | 3,017    |         |          |\n| Miscellaneous                    | 4,617   | 2,463    | 3,108   | 17,912   |\n| Total                           | 20,246  | 1,69,583 | 31,996  | 2,00,682 |\n\n| No.    | Rs.    | No.    | Rs.    |\n|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Horses | 35     | 1,000  |        |\n| Cattle | 1,233  | 6,982  | 245    | 5,400   |\n| Sheep  | 2,220  | 2,275  | 1,825  | 2,173   |\n| Total  | 3,488  | 10,257 | 2,070  | 7,573   |\n| Grand Total | ...... | 1,79,840 | ...... | 2,08,255 |\n\n25 CPG\nTown duties have been collected in this town since the year 1855. The charges for town police, conservancy, &c. are defrayed from the local funds thus raised. The public institutions here are a district post-office, and boys' and girls' schools.\n\nThe fort is situated on a lofty eminence to the east of the town, between the rivers Sun\u00e1r and Gadhair\u00ed. A natural moat is thus formed on three sides of it, and on the fourth side an artificial one has been constructed. The place, both from its natural advantages, and the solidity and excellence of its construction, must have been one of enormous strength, and without large guns almost impregnable. The inner walls enclose a space of eleven acres, the greater part of which is covered with buildings and palaces. These are for the most part now in ruins, as are also the outer walls and bastions. The latter were breached by Sir Hugh Rose in 1858, when the fort was taken, and were afterwards partly levelled by sappers. About two miles north of the town, on the borders of a large forest (the Ramn\u00e1), there stand the remains of what appears to have been a large summer-palace built by the abovementioned r\u0101j\u0101, Mardan Singh. The most remarkable part of these ruins is a lofty tower to the north of the buildings, which is still standing in tolerable preservation, although some of the lower part of the wall has fallen down. The ground-plan of this tower is almost square, each side measuring about fifteen feet. It is built in six stories, each one slightly tapering upwards. The total height amounts to about one hundred feet. There is a winding stone staircase the whole way up. Close by these ruins a large flat-roofed house was built in A.D. 1823 by Sir Herbert Maddock, then Agent to the Governor-General at S\u00e1g\u0101r, as a kind of country residence. This has been lately placed in charge of the Forest department, by whom it is kept in repair.\n\nGARHA KOTA' RAMNA'\u2014A forest of six square miles in extent, in the midst of a highly-cultivated country in the S\u00e1g\u0101r district. The character of the timber and the freedom of the indigenous growth prove the soil to be very favourable for teak.\n\nGARHBORI'\u2014The south-western pargana of the Brahmapur\u00ed tahsil in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, bounded on the north by the Brahmapur\u00ed pargana, on the east by the Brahmapur\u00ed and R\u00e1jgarh parganas, on the south by the R\u00e1jgarh and Haweli parganas, and on the west by the parganas of Bh\u00e1ndak and Chim\u00far. Its area is about 576 square miles, and it contains 129 villages. It is very hilly, being intersected from north to south by four branches of the Andh\u00e1rf; and large tracts are covered with forest. The soil is chiefly red; and the cultivation consists of rice and sugarcane. This is par excellence the lake pargana of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1\u2014the most picturesque, and the one best deserving the visit of a tourist. Here are found the Kohris (or Koris) in greatest numbers, too often dispossessed of the magnificent tanks their forefathers constructed; and here too the M\u00e1n\u00e1s abound. Mar\u00e1th\u00ed is generally spoken, but in the south Telugu prevails. The chief places are Sindew\u00e1h\u00ed, Talodh\u00ed, Nawarg\u00f3n, Gunjew\u00e1h\u00ed, and Garhbori'. In early times the Garhbori' pargana was held by M\u00e1n\u00e1 chiefs, who subsequently were conquered by the Gonds, and the pargana then became an appanage of the Gond princes of Wair\u00e1garh.\n\nGARHBORI'\u2014A town situated sixteen miles north-north-west of M\u00fal, on a branch of the Andh\u00e1rf. The houses cluster round a fortified hill in the centre, and the whole is enclosed by forest. A number of the neighbouring landholders reside here, but the place is in a decaying state, and there is very\nlittle trade. A speciality of the town is a sari (native female garment) of a peculiar pattern, which is only manufactured here; and the Garhbori pan has a high reputation throughout the Nagpur province. In the vicinity are quarries of excellent freestone and limestone. Here are government schools for boys and girls, and a police outpost.\n\nGARHCHIROLI\u2014A town in the Chand\u00e1 district, situated on the left bank of the Wainganga, twenty-three miles east-north-east of M\u00e1l. It has 750 houses, and is the largest trading mart in the A\u2019mbgaon pargana. About one-fourth of the population is Telenga, and the remainder Mar\u00e1tha. Rice and sugarcane are grown in the neighbourhood; and the manufactures are chiefly cotton-cloths, tasar-thread, and carts. The trade is in cotton, cotton-cloths, tasar-cocoons and tasar-thread, jungle produce, carts, and salt. Here are government schools for boys and girls, and a police outpost.\n\nGARH PIHRA\u2014A village in the S\u00e1g\u00e1r district, about seven miles to the north of S\u00e1g\u00e1r, before the foundation of which Garh P\u00e1hr\u00e1 was the principal place in this part of the country.\n\nGARHVI\u2014A river which rises near Chichgarh in the Bhand\u00e1ra district, and after a southerly course of about 150 miles falls into the Wainganga on its eastern bank, a little below Sooni in the Chand\u00e1 district. There is a legend that this stream issued from the earth at the prayer of a holy man named Garga Rishi.\n\nGAROLA\u2014A rent-free estate in the S\u00e1g\u00e1r district, about twenty-seven miles north of S\u00e1g\u00e1r, consisting of one village, with an area of 5,479 acres, and yielding a revenue of Rs. 886 per annum. The village is supposed to have been founded about four hundred years ago. It appears soon afterwards to have risen to some importance, and to have become the head-quarters of a tract of 161 villages, including Khurai, which, together with the tract of Eran, including fifty-two villages, was bestowed by the Emperor of Delhi on one Rao K\u00e1m Chandra as a reward for his services. Shortly before the latter\u2019s death, Khurai, with forty-four villages, was transferred by him to two of his relations (mentioned under \u201cKhurai\u201d), and nineteen other villages to his son Dal Singh. When Rao K\u00e1m Chandra died in A.D. 1705, Garol\u00e1, with the remaining 130 villages, passed to his son Rao Chandj\u00e1. On the death of the latter, his eldest son Bah\u00e1dur Singh obtained the tract of Eran, and the next son, Bishan Singh, that of Garol\u00e1, with ninety-eight villages. The former of these was driven out of Eran soon after this by the Naw\u00e1b of Kurw\u00e1ri, and came to live with his brother. In the year 1746, soon after the acquisition of S\u00e1g\u00e1r by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, the Peshw\u00e1 resumed all the villages belonging to Bishan Singh, giving him back nine, with Garol\u00e1, on a quit-rent. After the cession of S\u00e1g\u00e1r in 1818 the exaction of this rent was discontinued by Government, and in lieu eight villages were resumed, and Garol\u00e1 was secured rent-free to Hind\u00fa Pat and Bhabh\u00fat Singh, the sons of Bishan Singh. Shortly afterwards, on account of Hind\u00fa Pat\u2019s character, the village was assigned to his brother, an assignment of land being made to Hind\u00fa Pat for maintenance. Bhabh\u00fat Singh died in 1826, and the village was soon after bestowed on his son Balwant Singh and his heirs rent-free. The village of Garol\u00e1 contains 413 houses and 1,048 inhabitants. It is of tolerable size, and contains a small fort and the remains of several old buildings. The whole is surrounded by a stone wall. To the east of the village there is a large lake of seventy-six acres in extent. The soil about is very fertile, and\nrice is largely produced close to the lake. Mangoes and plantains also flourish here. There is a government school for boys in the village.\n\nGAUR\u2014A river rising in the Mandla district and emptying itself into the Narbad\u00e1 near Silw\u00e1. It has in the Jabalp\u00far district a westerly course.\n\nGAURJHA'MAR\u2014A large village in the S\u00e1g\u00e1r district, about twenty-seven miles to the south of S\u00e1g\u00e1r, and nine miles to the south-west of Rehli. The road from the latter place lies through dense jungle. This is an ancient village, and is said to have been established by the Gonds, who once held Deori and the Panj-Mah\u00e1l. There are excellent government schools here for boys and girls, and a good encamping-ground in a grove of mango trees.\n\nGEWARDA'\u2014A chiefship in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, situated fifteen miles north-north-east of Wair\u00e1gahr, and attached to the Wair\u00e1gahr pargana. It nominally contains fifty-six villages, but a large number of these are waste. It is of comparatively modern origin, being a Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 grant.\n\nGHANSOR\u2014A village in the Seoni district, some sixty-four miles to the north-east of Seoni, on the direct road from Bargi and Khalaut\u00e1. Here are the remains of some forty or fifty temples, very elaborately ornamented with sculptures carved in a beautiful sandstone. The N\u00e1gp\u00far museum possesses specimens representing the incarnations of Vishnu. The village is now quite insignificant. There is a police post here.\n\nGHATKU'L\u2014The southern pargana of the M\u00e1l tahsil in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, is bounded on the north by the Haweli and R\u00e9jigarh parganas, on the east by the Waingang\u00e1, and on the south and west by the Wardh\u00e1. It contains an area of about 368 square miles, and has eighty-one villages. The western half is very hilly, and the north, west, and centre are covered with heavy forest, the cultivated tracts being chiefly along the Waingang\u00e1. In the vicinity of the rivers the soil is mostly black loam, and in the centre and north red or sandy. Rice, sugarcane, and wheat are the chief products. The people are principally Telingas, but in most cases speak Mar\u00e1thi or Hind\u00ed in addition to their own tongue. The chief places are D\u00e1bh\u00e1, Talodh\u00ed, and Tohg\u00e1n. This pargana in the beginning of the present century was continually overrun by plunderers from the opposite side of the Wardh\u00e1, and numerous villages were in consequence deserted, and have remained desolate to this day.\n\nGHATKU'L\u2014A village in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, situated at the junction of the Andh\u00e1rf and Waingang\u00e1, twelve miles north-north-east of D\u00e1bh\u00e1. This was formerly the pargana town, but is now only a moderate-sized village.\n\nGHE\u015a\u2014A chiefship attached to the Sambalp\u00far district, situated some fifty miles west and a little south of the town of Sambalp\u00far. The area is from ten to twelve square miles, of which about three-fifths are cultivated. It consists of nineteen villages, and the population amounts to 5,333 souls, chiefly of the agricultural classes, such as Kolt\u00e1s, Binjh\u00e1ls, Gonds, and Khonds. Rice is the staple product. The principal village is Ghes, with a population of 652 souls. There is a fine school-house in course of erection here at which some 130 pupils are receiving instruction.\n\nThe chief's family are Binjw\u00e1rs (or Binj\u00e1ls) and were much mixed up in the Surendra S\u00e1\u00ed rebellion. Kurgal Singh, uncle of the present chief, remained in outlawry several years after the amnesty had been proclaimed. He was captured in 1865, and was hanged for murder. His father was also transported in 1864, and died while undergoing sentence.\nGHISRI\u2014A river in the B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t district. It rises in the hills to the north-east of the Dhansu\u00e1 pargana, and, flowing due south through the Hatt\u00e1 pargana, empties itself into the B\u00e1gh, within five miles of the junction of the latter with the Waingang\u00e1.\n\nGHOT\u2014A chiefship in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district\u2014(see \u201cAh\u00edr\u201d).\n\nGHOT\u2014The principal village of the Arpall\u00ed and Ghot pargana, in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, is a thriving place, with government schools for boys and girls.\n\nGHUGHRI\u2014A picturesque spot at the junction of the Burhner and the H\u00e1lon in the Mandla district. The village itself is but small, but there is an excellent encamping-ground on the banks of the river under a grove of mango trees. The estate, comprising ninety-eight villages, was given to Lachm\u00ed Parsh\u00e9\u00e9d, a Br\u00e1hman, who behaved very well in the disturbances of 1857-58. He was also presented with a sword of honour.\n\nGHUGUS\u2014A large village in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, thirteen miles west of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1, with abundant shade, and possessing remains which show it to have been formerly a place of importance. It has three temple-caves, and in their vicinity are some carved stones, apparently meant to represent animals, but so weather-worn that the intention of the sculptor can only be guessed at. Near the village, about the end of the seventeenth century, occurred a battle between the Gond king R\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h and the insurgent princes B\u00e1gb\u00e1, \u00c1\u2019gb\u00e1, and R\u00e1gba. \u00c1\u2019gb\u00e1 fell on the field, where his tomb is still to be seen; and in the neighbourhood is the \u201cGhor\u00e1 Gh\u00e1t,\u201d so called from B\u00e1gb\u00e1\u2019s fabled leap across the Wardh\u00e1. On the bank of this river, between Ghug\u00fas and Ch\u00e1nd\u00far, a seam of coal thirty-three feet thick crops out on the surface, and a shaft has been sunk, from which coal has been taken out for trial on the railway.\n\nGHUTKU\u2014A town ten miles north-west of Bil\u00e1sp\u00far in the Bil\u00e1sp\u00far district, containing a population of 2,000 souls, chiefly weavers. Cotton and silk cloths are manufactured here to a considerable extent, and the community is in a fairly flourishing condition. Although the town is said to have been established by the Gonds in the remote past, there are no indications of antiquity in the vicinity, nor objects of interest to attract the visitor.\n\nGILGAON\u2014A zam\u00edn\u2019d\u00e1ri or chiefship attached to the \u00c1\u2019mbg\u00e1on pargana of the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district. Its extreme dimensions are twenty-six miles by sixteen, but it only contains twelve villages, as most of the area is hill and forest. There is some good timber, mostly s\u00e1l and bijes\u00e1l. The tenure is said to be ancient.\n\nGIRAR\u2014A town in the Hingangh\u00e1t tahsil of the Wardh\u00e1 district, thirty-seven miles south-east of Wardh\u00e1. It gains much local importance from the shrine of the Musalm\u00e1n saint, Shekh Khw\u00e1ja Far\u00edd, on the top of the hill close by, which attracts a continual flow of devotees, Hind\u00fa as well as Musalm\u00e1n. The story goes that Khw\u00e1ja Far\u00edd was born in Hindust\u00e1n, and that after wandering about for some thirty years as a fak\u00edr he came and settled on the Girar hill about the year A.D. 1244. Several fantastic legends have grown up in celebration of the power which he gained by his devotions, but the only one worth mention is that by which the zeolitic concretions on the Girar hill are accounted for. These are said to be the petrified cocoanuts and other articles of merchandise belonging to two travelling traders who mocked the saint, on which he turned their whole stock-in-trade into stones as a punishment. They\nimplored his pardon, and he created a fresh stock for them from dry leaves, on which they were so struck by his power that they attached themselves permanently to his service; and two graves on the hill are said to be theirs. The hill bears the appearance of having once been fortified, and indeed a solitary hill of this description, rising like a truncated cone from the plain around, is well fitted for a stronghold. Local tradition says that the walls were built by a worshipper at the shrine, in fulfilment of a vow that he would do so if God granted him a son. But this is probably a mere fable to increase the honour of the saint, for the remains of the fortification seem older than the shrine. The shrine of Girar absorbs the revenues of five villages; in Marath\u00e1 times it also received considerable grants of money. Girar itself, however, is not among the number. It is a small municipality, with a population of 1,836 souls; and has a police outpost, a good village school, and a weekly market.\n\nGIROD\u2014A small and insignificant village in the Bil\u00e1sp\u00far district, containing some sixty huts, with a population of 200 or 300 souls. It is situated fifty miles south-east of Bil\u00e1sp\u00far, on the south bank of the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed and on the borders of the Son\u00e1kh\u00e1n estate. The spot itself has no peculiar attraction, but here originated the religious reformation of the Cham\u00e1rs of Chhatt\u00edsgarh\u2014(see \u201cChhatt\u00edsgarh\u201d and \u201cBil\u00e1sp\u00far\u201d).\n\nGODA\u2018VARI\u2019\u2014Of the whole course of this river, which is some 900 miles in length, about 150 miles border the Central Provinces to the south-west. Regarding the earlier part of the river\u2019s course it will be sufficient here to say that it rises near N\u00e1sik, on the eastern declivity of the western gh\u00e1ts, and flows south-east and east for some 650 miles through the Bombay presidency and the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s territories, until it is joined by the Pranh\u00edt\u00e1 at Sironch\u00e1, in the Upper God\u00e1vari district. The portion of it touching on these provinces has been thus described by Sir. R. Temple, whose account, it should be premised, commences from the highest point of the projected navigation system, viz. at the Falls of the river Wardh\u00e1:\n\n\u201cStarting then from the Falls of the Wardh\u00e1 near Hingangh\u00e1t the voyager would see on the right hand the wild hilly country of the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s dominions, and on the left, or British side, a broad level valley covered with cultivation. Further down the river, past the junction of the Pain-gang\u00e1, as the third or upper barrier is approached, the rich valley on the left becomes narrower and narrower, more and more trenched upon by hill and forest, till it is restricted to a fringe of cultivation along the river\u2019s bank; while on the right hand the country somewhat improves, and, though still hilly, is more open. The junction of the Waingang\u00e1 is hidden from view by the hills. The barrier itself lies closed in by rocky hills and dense forests, a narrow strip being left on the right bank, along which the tram-road or the canal is to pass. Below the barrier the river is called the Pranh\u00edt\u00e1. On the left, or British side, the hills at first arrange themselves in picturesque groups, one of which has been compared by some to the group of Seven Mountains (Sieben Gebirge) on the Rhine, and after that continue for many miles almost to overhang the river, sometimes displaying the fine foliage and blossoms of the teak tree down to the water\u2019s edge. On the opposite or Niz\u00e1m\u2019s bank the most noticeable feature is the mouth of the Bibri\u00e1 stream, justly noted for its beauty. Further down, on the British side, the only point of note is Sironch\u00e1, with its old fort overlooking the water; the country continuing to be hilly or jungly with patches of\ncultivation. But on the opposite or foreign side the junction of the God\u00e1var\u00ed Proper causes great tongues of land and broad basins to be formed, all which are partially cultivated, and are dotted over by such towns as Chin\u00far, Mant\u00e1n\u00ed, Mah\u00e1deop\u00far, and the sacred K\u00e1leswar. Then the hills, of some variety and beauty, cluster thick round the second or middle barrier. This junction of the Indr\u00e1vat\u00ed also is concealed from view by the hills. Below this, on the British side, long ranges of hills, rising one above the other, run almost parallel with the river, till the junction of the T\u00e9l is reached. On the opposite or Niz\u00e1m\u2019s side again the country is more cultivated and open, and marked by the towns of Nagaram and Mangampeth. Below the latter place again the sacred hill of Rutab Gutt\u00e1 rises into view, immediately opposite to Dumagudem, on the British bank, where the head-quarters of the navigation department are established. Proceeding downwards at the first or lower barrier, the country is comparatively level on both sides, and this barrier is far less formidable than the two preceding ones. Below the barrier, down to the junction of the Sabar\u00ed, the prominent object on the British side consists of the small hills of Bhadr\u00e1-challam, crowned with cupolas, cones, and spires of Hind\u00fa temples. On the opposite or Niz\u00e1m\u2019s side is that Tank region already mentioned, which extending inland some 250 miles to beyond Warangal, the capital of ancient Telengana, is marked by the remains of countless works of agricultural improvement, attesting a wisdom in the past not known to the Native dynasties of the present.\n\n\u201cNear the junction of the Sabar\u00ed the God\u00e1var\u00ed river scenery begins to assume an imposing appearance. Hitherto as it passed each barrier, and gained the successive steps in its course, the river has been increasing in width, generally being about a mile broad, and sometimes even 2\u00bd miles. Here also the whole range of the eastern gh\u00e1ts comes fully into view, some 2,500 feet high, bounding the whole horizon, and towering over all the lesser and detached hills that flank the river. Passing the Sabar\u00ed junction the God\u00e1var\u00ed becomes more and more contracted and pressed on either side by the spurs of the main range, till at length it forces a passage between them, penetrating, by an almost precipitous gorge, through the heart of the mountains that mark the frontier of the Central Provinces. It is at this gorge that the scenery of this river has been justly compared to that of the Rhine. Imprisoned for some twenty miles between the hills, the river flows in a narrow, but very deep channel, with a current that sometimes lashes itself into boiling whirlpools. Then escaping from its imprisonment, the mass of water spreads itself over a broad smooth surface, resembling a lake surrounded with hills and dotted with islands, some of which are surmounted with Hind\u00fa temples. Then finally emerging from the hills it forms itself into one mighty stream between flat cultivated banks, till passing by the Madras station of R\u00e1j\u00e1mandr\u00ed, and approaching the Great Dhawaleswaram Anicut, it breaks off into those numerous channels which permeate the Delta. At Dhawaleswaram there commences that network of canals which not only irrigate the lands, but also afford perfect navigation to the seaport of Cocanada.\u201d\n\nGOLLAGUDEM\u2014A small village on the bank of the God\u00e1var\u00ed in the Upper God\u00e1var\u00ed district, twenty miles below Dumagudem; only important as being the point at which the steamers and boats belonging to the Upper God\u00e1var\u00ed navigation works take in and deliver cargo. There is a small\ninspection bungalow here, belonging to the public works department, which travellers are allowed to occupy.\n\n**GOND-UMRI**\u2014An estate in the Bhand\u00e1ra district, consisting of ten villages, situated from five to ten miles north-east of S\u00e1ngarh\u00ed, and containing much jungle and waste land. The area is 17,715 acres, of which 2,862 only are cultivated. The population numbers 2,282 souls, chiefly Gonds and Dhers. The present chief is a Br\u00e1hman. Gond-Umri is the only large village, and possesses an indigenous school. Near the village of Kokna on this estate there is a bani\u00e1n tree in full vigour, and of remarkable size, being capable of sheltering at least one hundred and fifty men. The forests generally are of little value.\n\n**GOSALPU'R**\u2014An ancient and considerable village in the Jabalp\u00far district, on the road to Mirz\u00e1p\u00far, about 19 miles N.E. from Jabalp\u00far. There are a government school and police post here. On the high downs surrounding the village a house has been erected, which is much used by the European residents of Jabalp\u00far for change of air. Gosalp\u00far is mentioned in an old narrative of 1790 \"as a large and clean place,\" and it still maintains its reputation.\n\n**GUMGA'ON**\u2014A small town in the N\u00e1gp\u00far district, on the left bank of the Wan\u00e1 river, twelve miles south of N\u00e1gp\u00far. Its population amounts to 3,342 souls, and is mostly employed in agriculture, though a considerable quantity of cotton-cloth is manufactured by the Kosht\u00eds. The municipal funds have been spent by the town committee in making a street through the town, in building and supporting a school, and in improving the b\u00e1z\u00e1s. Near the police quarters, in a commanding position overhanging the river, are the remains of a very considerable Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 fort, and near this is a fine temple of Ganpat\u00ed, with strongly-built walls of basalt facing the river. Both fort and temple were erected by Chim\u00e1 B\u00e1\u00ed, wife of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Raghoj II., who may be said to have founded the town, and since whose time this estate has continued in the direct possession of the Bhonsl\u00e1 family.\n\n**GUNDARDEHI**\u2014A chiefship attached to the R\u00e9fp\u00far district, containing fifty-two villages, which cover an area of about eighty or ninety square miles. It lies in the northern portion of the B\u00e1lod pargana, and is surrounded on all sides by kh\u00e1lsa villages. It contains no jungle, and is generally well cultivated, the population and crops being similar to those in the cultivated portion of the district. The estate has been in the possession of the present chief's family for three hundred years. He is by caste a R\u00e1j-Kanwar.\n\n**GUNJEW\u00c1HI**\u2014A large village in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, twenty-six miles south of Brahmap\u00far, possessing a fine tank. The inhabitants are almost wholly Telingas. It has a police outpost, and government schools for boys and girls. About two miles from Gunjew\u00e1hi is the T\u00e1tol\u00ed hill\u2014a long low ridge from which iron-ore is quarried.\n\n**GUNJI**\u2014A hill near Sakt\u00ed, in the Bil\u00e1sp\u00far district, of local interest and sacredness.\n\n**GURAYYA**\u2014A river which forms part of the boundary between the Damoh and Jabalp\u00far districts. It rises at Katang\u00ed in the Jabalp\u00far district, and after a devious course of about thirty miles flows into the Bairm\u00e9.\n\n**GWA'RIGHAT**\u2014In the Jabalp\u00far district. Here the Narbad\u00e1 is crossed on the main road between Jabalp\u00far and N\u00e1gp\u00far about five miles from the former. The river is fordable during part of the cold weather, and all the hot season,\nbut in the rains it is a rapid torrent more than fifty feet in depth. Here there is a post for collecting duties on timber, which is floated down from the Mandla forests.\n\nH\n\nHA'LON\u2014A river which rises about eight or ten miles to the south of the Chilp\u00edgh\u00e1t in the Maikal range, and after a northerly course of some sixty miles through the B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t and Mandla districts flows into the Burhn\u00e9r. The average elevation of its valley is about 2,000 feet. It is not to be confounded with the comparatively unimportant stream of the Alon.\n\nHA'MP\u2014A stream in the Bil\u00e1sp\u00far district, having its rise in the Pandari\u00e1 hills. It flows south and east through the Pandari\u00e1 chiefship and the Mungeli pargana, and then forms for several miles the boundary line between R\u00e1jp\u00far and Bil\u00e1sp\u00far, finally falling into the Seon\u00e1th near N\u00e1ndgh\u00e1t.\n\nHANDIA'\u2014An old Mohammadan town in the Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d district, formerly the head-quarters of a sark\u00e1r or district under Akbar's rule. It had a handsome stone fort on the river, said to have been built by Hoshang Sh\u00e1h Ghor\u00ed of M\u00e1lw\u00e1, but now dismantled. Handi\u00e1 was on the old highroad from the Deccan to A'gra, and was once a large and flourishing place, of which the extent may still be traced by the ruins scattered for some distance along the bank of the Narb\u00e1d\u00e1. On the withdrawal of the Moghal officials, about a.d. 1700, and the construction of a straighter and better road across the Vindhya hills via Indore, it fell into ruin, and its present population is only 1,992 souls. There were here once a large number of Jul\u00e1h\u00e1s, or Mohammadan weavers, but they have all emigrated. The place was given up to the British by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s in 1817.\n\nHARAI'\u2014This is the most important of the hill chiefships or zam\u00edn-d\u00e1r\u00eds, in the north of the Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 district. It lies mainly in the mountainous tract to the north of Amarw\u00e1r\u00e1, but a portion lies below the gh\u00e1ts leading into the valley of the Narb\u00e1d\u00e1. The chief's residence is a moderate-sized masonry fort in the lowland tract. The estate comprises ninety-one villages, of which eighty-six are inhabited. The chief, who is a Gond, receives an allowance of Rs. 6,000 per annum from Government, in commutation of certain privileges formerly enjoyed by him.\n\nHA'RAT\u2014A village in the Damoh district. It was a place of some importance under the Bundel\u00e1s, but is now only noticeable for some Mohammadan tombs, and a waterfall of the Sun\u00e1r, on the left bank of which the village stands. It is three miles south-west of Hatt\u00e1, and about twenty miles north of Damoh.\n\nHARDA'\u2014The western revenue subdivision or tahs\u00edl in the Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d district, having an area of 2,001 square miles, with 409 villages, and a population of 120,546 souls according to the census of 1866. The land revenue for the year 1869-70 is Rs. 1,29,761-0-3.\n\nHARDA'\u2014The chief town in the subdivision of the same name in the Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d district. It is on the highroad to Bombay, and has risen on the ruins of Handi\u00e1, which is twelve miles off. Under the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 government Hard\u00e1 was the residence of an \u00e1nil or governor, and on the opening of the campaign in 1817 Sir John Malcolm established here the head-quarters of the\narmy under his command. Since the cession in 1844 a resident assistant commissioner has held special charge of the subdivision, aided by a tahsildar holding subordinate criminal, civil, and revenue jurisdiction. This was already a thriving place when the country was ceded, and since then a good deal has been done for its improvement. Its principal street is broad and well built, and a handsome market-place has been laid out, surrounded by substantial houses. In 1864 a dam was thrown across the river close by, which secured a good and convenient water-supply to the people. These and many other improvements were carried out by Mr. J. F. Beddy, who resided as assistant commissioner at Hard\u00e1 for several years, and to whose activity and practical resources the town owes very much of its prosperity. There is a railway station here. The principal trade is in the export of grain and oil-seeds. The population amounts to 7,499 souls.\n\nHASDU'\u2014A stream which, rising amid the hills of M\u00e1t\u00edn, flows nearly due south till it joins the Mah\u00e1n\u00e1di, eight miles east of Seor\u00edn\u00e1rain, in the Bil\u00e1spur district. Owing to many barriers in its course this river is very rarely navigable. In high floods boats of fair size can ascend from the Mah\u00e1n\u00e1di fifteen or twenty miles, but as the country in the vicinity of the river is wild and sparsely populated, boats laden with merchandise rarely ascend. In the hot and cold weather months Hasd\u00fa is a very insignificant stream.\n\nHA'THI'BA'RJ'\u2014A state forest of about fifteen square miles in extent, in the Bil\u00e1spur district, lying along the Jonk river, twenty miles from Seor\u00edn\u00e1rain. There is some fine teak still remaining here, and a plantation of teak lately formed gives very fair promise of success.\n\nHATT\u00c1'\u2014A chiefship in the B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t district, originally part of the K\u00e1mth\u00e1 chiefship, which was bestowed upon a Kunb\u00ed family about A.D. 1750, and on their rebellion in 1818 was granted to the Lodh\u00ed family in whose possession it now is. The prosperity of the Hatt\u00e1 chiefship is entirely due to the grantee, who is still alive, and though more than one hundred years old, retains his faculties to an extraordinary extent. The estate covers an area of 134 square miles, of which sixty-six are under cultivation; and contains seventy-five villages.\n\nHATT\u00c1'\u2014A town in the B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t district, well situated on a piece of high ground studded with mango-groves, about eighty miles to the north-east of Bhand\u00e1ra, and eight miles to the east of the Waingang\u00e1. The fort, which now encircles the residence of the zamind\u00e1r, is a relic of the Gond days, when the surrounding plains, now well cultivated, were covered with thick jungle. The present zamind\u00e1r, Ganpat R\u00e1o, who was created an honorary magistrate in 1865, has done much for the town. In the centre he has erected a good school-house, and contiguous to it a spacious dispensary; he has also improved the town roads, and keeps up a regular conservancy establishment. Close to the entrance of the fort is a remarkably fine baol\u00ed (a well with sloping descent to the water), which was constructed by the former Kunb\u00ed zamind\u00e1r, Chinn\u00e1 Patel. At the last census the inhabitants numbered 2,655 souls. There is no trade peculiar to Hatt\u00e1, the inhabitants being chiefly agriculturists of the Kunb\u00ed, Lodh\u00ed, Go\u00e1r\u00e1, and Rang\u00e1r\u00ed castes.\n\nHATT\u00c1'\u2014The northern revenue subdivision or tahsil in the Damoh district, having an area of 1,007 square miles, with 546 villages, and a population of 115,118 souls according to the census of 1866. The land revenue for the year 1869-70 is Rs. 1,20,107.\nHATTA'\u2014The head-quarters of the subdivision of the same name in the Damoh district. It has always been a place of some importance. The Gonds had a fort here, near the north gate, of which scarcely anything now remains. A second and larger fort was erected here in the seventeenth century by the Bundelks, who then ruled in this part of the country, and was afterwards enlarged by the Marathas. When the district was ceded to the British in 1818 the head-quarters were established here, and were not removed until 1835. The public buildings are a tahsil or sub-collector's office, a police station, a dispensary, a sarai, and a fine government school-house. There is a market twice a week, and a considerable trade in red cloth, which is manufactured for export to Bundelkhand and elsewhere. The population amounts to 7,100 souls. Hatta is situated on the right bank of the Sunar, twenty-four miles north of Damoh, one hundred and seventy miles south-west of Allahabad, and sixty-one north-east of Sagar. Latitude 24\u00b0 8' north, longitude 79\u00b0 40' east.\n\nHAWEI'\u2014Is the western pargana of the Mul tahsil, in the Chandia district, and is bounded on the north by the Bhanda and Garhbori parganas, on the east by the Rajgarh and Ghatkul parganas, on the south by the Wardha river, and on the west by the Wardha and the Bhanda parganas. Its area is about 448 square miles; and it contains 102 villages. On the north-east and east the country is hilly, and more than half of the pargana north and east is covered with dense jungle. The Viraj intersects it from north to south, and the Andhari flows in a south-easterly direction along its eastern boundary. The soil in the vicinity of the Wardha is black loam, and in other parts sandy and somewhat stony. The language spoken is chiefly Marathi. Dhanaji Kunbis form the largest agricultural class. Chandia is the only large town in the pargana.\n\nHINAUTA'\u2014A large market-village in the Damoh district, thirty miles north-east of Damoh and ten miles from Hatta, on the highroad to Nagod. It contains 389 houses, with a population of 1,154 souls, and has a considerable grain-trade with Bundelkhand. There are here a government school and an encamping-ground for troops.\n\nHINDORIA'\u2014The third town in importance in the Damoh district, situated nine miles north-east of Damoh. It is held in ubari (or quit-rent tenure) by Umrao Singh, a Bundela. During the mutiny of 1857 the inhabitants of this village rose in rebellion, and burnt all the records and public offices in Damoh. The place was reduced by a small body of troops from Sagar; and the fort, then in a good state of preservation, was demolished. The town contains 1,135 houses, and a population of 3,600 souls. The inhabitants, who are mainly Lodhis by caste, still maintain the bad reputation acquired by them in 1857. A very fine description of betel leaf, called \"desu bangla,\" is here cultivated by Mochis. A weekly market is held on Tuesdays. There are here a police station and a government school.\n\nHINGANGHAT\u2014The south-eastern revenue subdivision of the Wardha district, having an area of 722 square miles, with 415 villages, and a population of 93,680 according to the census of 1866. The land revenue of the tahsil for 1869-70 is Rs. 1,45,057.\n\nHINGANGHAT\u2014A large trading town in the Wardha district, situated twenty-one miles south-east of Wardha. The following table shows the Imports and Exports of the town for 1868-69:\u2014\n| Imports | Maunds... | 89,215 | 9,145 | 52,695 | 3,889 | 402 | 5,346 | 480 | 15,593 | 1,271 | 1,903 |\n|---------|----------|--------|-------|--------|------|-----|-------|-----|--------|------|-------|\n|         | Value, Rs.| 18,801,75 | 63,106 | 2,17,797 | 2,59,706 | 44,613 | 65,042 | 12,137 | 61,226 | 15,504 | 28,841 |\n\n| Exports | Maunds... | 65,393 | 2,752 | 7,102 | 2,503 | 62 | 1,805 | 64 | 1,253 | 555 | 97,602 |\n|---------|----------|--------|-------|--------|------|-----|-------|-----|-------|------|-------|\n|         | Value, Rs.| 11,48,940 | 22,755 | 22,633 | 1,77,114 | 3,217 | 26,161 | 1,782 | 4,924 | 9,432 | 14,619 |\n\nHingangh\u00e1t cotton has established for itself a name in the mercantile world, and is admittedly one of the best staples indigenous to India. It is properly speaking the produce of the rich Wardh\u00e1 valley, brought for sale to the Hingangh\u00e1t market; but a good deal of the cotton known in Bombay as Hingangh\u00e1t is not really produced in the neighbourhood of the town, but is grown elsewhere, and attracted to Hingangh\u00e1t by the ready market there found: thus some inferior stuff goes into the market as Hingangh\u00e1t. The best foreign cotton is that brought from Edal\u00e1b\u00e1d in the Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d territory, where the growth of the Paingang\u00e1 valley is collected. This cotton is reckoned quite as good as the Hingangh\u00e1t staple, and is eagerly sought after. Messrs. Warwick & Co. have established an agency here, with capacious iron-roofed warehouses, and a stock of full and half-presses; and they press for shipment direct to England. The principal native traders are M\u00e1rw\u00e1ris, many of whom have large transactions, and export to Bombay and elsewhere on their own account. But the greater number merely act as middlemen between the cultivators and the large merchants, buying up the cotton at the villages and smaller marts, and introducing it on speculation into the Hingangh\u00e1t market. The municipal committee have opened a large gravelled market-place and storage-yard for general use, with raised platforms, and scales for weighing the cotton. Round this yard are ranged the gunning-sheds and private cotton-enclosures of the native traders, but these at present are mere temporary structures of bamboo-work. The committee contemplate erecting permanent structures of safer materials, and letting them to the traders. Meanwhile the latter are obliged to provide small reservoirs for water in their enclosures, and these are kept full from funds provided by the cotton department. The municipal committee have further erected two half-presses in the cotton-yard; but the natives, rather than take the trouble of entertaining pressmen and finding their own ropes and gunnies, prefer to make over their cotton to Messrs. Warwick & Co. to be full or half-pressed for them, at so much a bale.\n\nThe chief native resident of Hingangh\u00e1t is the khil\u00e1tk\u00e1r, R\u00e1m R\u00e1o. He traces his origin to Puna, where, about ninety years ago, his ancestors were attached to the court of the Peshw\u00e1, their service being \"m\u00e1nkari,\" or personal attendance on the Peshw\u00e1. They were summoned thence by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Raghoji Bhonsl\u00e1 of N\u00e1gpur, and after holding various offices, obtained one-fourth of these town lands, which they had reclaimed from the jungle. Their descendants now hold several villages and a cash pension. The population of Hingangh\u00e1t amounts to 8,500 souls, chiefly traders of all kinds or their servants, weavers, and day-labourers. The octroi collections for the three years 1865-66, 1866-67,\nand 1867-68 let respectively for Rs. 61,600, Rs. 45,000, and Rs. 45,100. The last-mentioned farm was only for eleven months. The money has been expended principally in laying out streets, avenues, and shop-frontages for New Hingangh\u00e1t. Old Hingangh\u00e1t was a straggling, ill-arranged town, liable to be flooded by the river Wana during the monsoon. The new town has been laid out on the rising ground to the south of the old town in broad parallel streets, marking off rectangular blocks. Of the total population, about three-fifths, including all the principal traders and more respectable residents, live in the new city, while the remainder cling to the old town. One main reason of this is the difficulty of procuring water in New Hingangh\u00e1t. Springs have, however, recently been struck to the west of the new town, and there is now every prospect of a good water-supply throughout the year. The people in New Hingangh\u00e1t are fast becoming attached to the place, which, with its broad clean streets and rising avenues, begins to present quite an attractive appearance. The zil\u00e1 (or chief) school of the district is at Hingangh\u00e1t, and here both English and Vernacular are taught up to an advanced standard. A female school has also been opened here, but has not as yet met with much success. Hingangh\u00e1t contains a tahsil office, a furnished travellers' bungalow, a large sarai, with several good rooms in it reserved for Europeans, where travellers may halt three days free of charge, and a dispensary, with a range of hospital buildings after the standard plan.\n\nHINGNI\u2014A town in the Huz\u00far tahsil of the Wardh\u00e1 district, about sixteen miles to the north-east of Wardh\u00e1, founded about 150 years ago by Ragheun\u00e1th Pant S\u00fabdar, grandfather of the present m\u00e1lguz\u00e1r. A large masonry fort, two temples, two large houses, twenty-one wells, and three hundred fine mango and tamarind trees, remain to attest the energy of the founder. In the time of the Pindh\u00e1ri disturbances the then m\u00e1lguz\u00e1r held the fort with two hundred of his own followers. The population of Hingni is 3,061, of whom about a fourth are cultivators and another fourth weavers. An annual fair is held here on the second day of the Holf, and the weekly market on Fridays is well attended. A government village school has been established here.\n\nHIRAN\u2014A small but deep and rapid river, rising in latitude 23\u00b0 30' and longitude 80\u00b0 26'. After a course of more than one hundred miles it falls into the Narbad\u00e1 at S\u00e1nkal, in latitude 23\u00b0 4' and longitude 79\u00b0 26'. Its general course is south-west.\n\nHI'RA'PU'R\u2014A village in the extreme north-east of the S\u00e1g\u00e1r district, on the road from Sh\u00e1hgarh to Cawnpore. There are here an encamping-ground and a staging bungalow. Iron-ore is found in the neighbourhood; and the reserved government forest of Tigor\u00e1 lies to the north-east of the village.\n\nHIRDENAGAR\u2014A large and populous village in the Mandla district. It was founded by the R\u00e1j\u00e1 Hirde Shah about A.D. 1644. An annual fair is held here on the banks of the Banjar, at which there was an attendance in 1868 of 25,000 persons. The value of the merchandise exposed for sale was estimated at Rs. 1,14,250, and the value of that sold at Rs. 79,524.\nHOSHANGA'BAD\u2014\n\nCONTENTS.\n\n| Page | Page |\n|------|------|\n| General description | 20i |\n| Geology | ib |\n| Forests and rivers | 211 |\n| Communications | ib |\n| Climate and rainfall | 212 |\n| Agriculture | ib |\n| Minerals, forest products, and cattle | 213 |\n| Administration | ib |\n| Area and population | ib |\n| Tenures | 214 |\n| Manufactures and trade | 215 |\n| History | ib |\n\nA district forming a portion of the Narbad\u00e1 valley, lying entirely on the left bank of the river, and including some large tracts in the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1 hills. It is bounded on the north by the territories of Bhop\u00e1l, Sind\u00eda, and Holkar, from which it is separated by the Narbad\u00e1. On the east the Dudh\u00ed river divides it from the Narsinghp\u00far district. On the west it adjoins the Nim\u00e1r district, the boundary being the Chhot\u00e1 Taw\u00e1 river, which flows into the Narbad\u00e1\u2014a stream called the Gul\u00ed, which flows into the Tapt\u00ed,\u2014and an imaginary line across the hill joining the sources of those two streams. On the south lie the districts of Western Ber\u00e1r, Bet\u00fal, and Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1. The boundary line on this side is very uncertain and arbitrary. For many miles it lies along the foot of the hills, or includes only the outer spurs and low hills which fringe the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1 range. But in four places it makes a great sweep to the south, and brings in four large hill tracts known as the Mah\u00e1deo hills, and the talukas M\u00e1l\u00edn\u00ed, R\u00e1j\u00e1bor\u00e1ri, and K\u00e1lsbht respectively. The boundary line includes K\u00e1lsbht by following the river where it flows out of the R\u00e1j\u00e1bor\u00e1ri hills to the Tapt\u00ed; it marches with the Tapt\u00ed for sixteen miles until it meets the Nim\u00e1r frontier, and turns northward again along the little stream called the Gul\u00ed. The district may be generally described as a long valley of varying breadth, running for 150 miles between the Narbad\u00e1 and the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1 range. The soil consists in the main of the well-known black basaltic alluvium, often more than twenty feet deep; but there are submontane tracts of red soil and rock, with low hills of various formations. From Lokhartalai (near Seon) eastward to the extremity of the district these are almost invariably of the Mah\u00e1deo sandstone, its line \"faulted\" or broken here and there by the intrusion of other rocks, notably at Patrot\u00e1, where the road from Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d towards Bet\u00fal strikes the base of the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1s, and \"passes close under two high pointed hills, which are formed of nearly vertical beds of schistoze quartzite.\"* It is to the east of the glen of the Taw\u00e1 river that the district boundary takes its southern sweep, which brings in the M\u00e1l\u00edn\u00ed forests and the Mah\u00e1deo hills. Below the northern base of the Mah\u00e1deo hills lies an inner valley shut out from the main Narbad\u00e1 valley by an irregular chain of low hills, and drained by the Denw\u00e1 river. A little beyond Fatehp\u00far, which stands in the gorge through which the Denw\u00e1 valley is entered from the plains, the boundary line of the district turns north to the Narbad\u00e1. All down along the Narbad\u00e1, as far westward as Handi\u00e1, the champaign country is only broken by a few isolated rocks, but to the west of Handi\u00e1 the plain is crossed and cut up by low stony hills and broad-backed ridges. Here the Vindhyas throw out jutting spurs, which occupy a large area, and are known as the Bairf hills; and from the southwest the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1s push up similar branches, which almost touch the Vindhya outposts.\n\nThe following extracts from the Memoirs of the Geological Survey of India will give an idea of the geology of Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d.\n\nGeology.\n\nThe hills which bound it on the south belong\n\n* Memoirs of the Geological Survey of India, vol. ii. p. 231.\nmainly to the series classed as \"Mah\u00e1deva\" and \"Lower Dam\u00fad\u00e1,\" but in places basaltic, metamorphic, and crystalline rocks occur. The Mah\u00e1deva group is thus described by Mr. J. G. Medicott *:\n\n\"The range of hills which forms the south side of the Narbad\u00e1 valley is formed of these; and along much of that part of the valley which extends from Jabalp\u00far to Handi\u00e1 and Seoni they form a series of escarpments quite as remarkable, and more picturesque, since less regular, than do those of the Vindhyan range on the north. In the central portion of this range they attain their greatest development, and form the fine masses of the Pachmarhi or Mah\u00e1deva hills, from which their name has been taken. Here they present a thickness of at least 2,000 feet, and many miles away from this central culminating mass they still attain very considerable development.\n\n* * * * * * *\n\nLithologically considered, the Mah\u00e1deva group consists of sandstones and grits, with a few exceptions hereafter to be described. In their typical localities these grits (thick and thin bedded) make up the whole thickness of the formation as seen in the Mah\u00e1deva hills, and are characterised throughout, but more especially near the top, by hard earthy ferruginous partings. A very prominent characteristic of the Mah\u00e1deva area is the way in which these great sandstone masses are disposed: vertical escarpments, with clear rock faces many hundred feet high, are constantly met, and this remarkable feature is presented wherever these rocks are (in this district) found.\"\n\nThe lower Dam\u00fad\u00e1 (including the T\u00e1lch\u00edr groups) are described\u2020 as ascending from \"obscurely bedded or unbedded masses of green mud\" into shales, flags, and coarse sandstones. The occurrence of these rocks in the Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d district is thus\u2021 mentioned:\n\n\"The Moran river exposes some beds of the Lower Dam\u00fad\u00e1 series: Moran river beds. shales, flags and sandstones, and a bed of poor coal \u00a7 come to the surface. The beds have been considerably disturbed, and the massive thick sandstones of the Mah\u00e1deva group (see below) rest unconformably on them.\n\n\"The Dam\u00fad\u00e1 beds are found only at the bottom of the Moran glen, and only a very small patch of them can be seen. Both sides of the glen are formed of Mah\u00e1deva sandstone (as stated above), and on the west these are almost immediately covered up by trap.\n\n* Memoirs of the Geological Survey of India, vol. ii. part 2, pp. 183, 184.\n\u2020 Ditto ditto ditto p. 148.\n\u2021 Ditto ditto ditto pp. 149, 150, and 165\u2014167.\n\u00a7 \"With respect to the coal seam here we may remark that it is at its outcrop about three feet thick, but very much impregnated with pyrites. A strong efflorescence of sulphur and of alum covers its exposed surface, as well as that of some of the accompanying shales. Such impurities, if equally abundant throughout, would render the mineral commercially useless\u2014a circumstance the more to be regretted as no coal is known to exist to the west of this place, and the position of the outcrop gives it many advantages over Sonad\u00ed, which is, next to this, the most westerly coal of the district. From that place a quantity of coal was taken to Bombay some years since under the auspices of Sir R. Hamilton. Situated on the level of the Narbad\u00e1 valley, and many miles to the west of any other known outcrop, this locality will doubtless receive a trial whenever a demand for the mineral exists within a distance sufficiently short to admit of its being worked to a profit, after cost of transport has been paid.\"\n\"Proceeding hence towards the east the Dam\u00fad\u00e1 and T\u00e1lch\u00edr beds will be seen to occupy a large area in the valley of the Taw\u00e1. The Taw\u00e1 is a considerable stream confluent with the Narbad\u00e1, a little above Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d, and issues from the hills on the south side of the valley through a gorge, at the entrance of which the old fort of B\u00e1gr\u00e1 stands. It drains a very large area within the range to the south; its numerous tributaries reach many miles to the east and west among the hills, and itself flows across a wide plain surrounded almost on all sides by the high ground. All the low ground of this plain, and of many of the glens which open into it, is occupied by the rocks under consideration, and many fine sections of them are exposed.\n\n\"The green muds and boulder bed are occasionally met with in almost every part of this area, but they are far more largely developed towards the south of it, and it is there that they may be best studied.\n\n* * * * * * *\n\n\"Leaving the Taw\u00e1 valley and proceeding up the Narbad\u00e1 valley for about thirty-five miles (in a straight line) the hill district may be again entered through a gorge, at the mouth of which the fortified village of Fatehp\u00far stands. Within and south of the narrow glens which connect it with the Narbad\u00e1 valley lies a wide spread of flat country.\n\n\"The flat ground is occupied by the T\u00e1lch\u00edr and Lower Dam\u00fad\u00e1 beds; Denw\u00e1 Valley. it is drained by the Denw\u00e1 river, which, passing from here to the west among the hills, joins the Taw\u00e1 just above B\u00e1gr\u00e1. This may be called the Lower Denw\u00e1 valley, and if we follow that stream up its course, it will be found to wind through deep glens and between high vertical scarps as it works its way from south to north among the eastern and lower spurs of the Pachmar\u00ed hills; again to the south of these its valley becomes once more wide and flat. The stream itself, and its tributaries, draining the country under the southern face of the great Mah\u00e1deva sandstones of the Pachmar\u00ed, expose many fine sections of the rocks of the Lower Dam\u00fad\u00e1 series, similar to those seen in the Taw\u00e1 valley. Similar to these in texture and structure we have fossiliferous shales, flags, and seams of impure coal, and like them in habit we find an irregular and sometimes inverted dip, faults, and trap dykes.\n\n* * * * * * *\n\n\"As in the valley of the Taw\u00e1, we here find the rocks of the T\u00e1lch\u00edr and Lower Dam\u00fad\u00e1 groups presenting a flat or gently undulating surface, from which the massive vertical scarps of the Mah\u00e1deva sandstone rise.\"\n\nThe type of the granitic rocks, which occur in one or two places only in this part of the valley, is thus* described:\n\n\"Below Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d much granite is exposed in the banks of the Narbad\u00e1, and here also it is mostly either this syenitic porphyry with pink felspar, or a pink felspar granite; this latter is the rock seen at Handi\u00e1. A similar red felspar granite forms a range of hills in the southern portion of the country surveyed, and is also well seen in the Chit\u00e1 Rew\u00e1 section near Berkher\u00e1.\"\n\n* Memoirs of the Geological Survey of India, vol. ii. part 2, pp. 122, 123.\nWestward of Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d the following account is given* of the district by Mr. W. T. Blanford:\n\n\"This tract, from Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d to Hard\u00e1, consists of a gently undulating plain of cotton soil. No rocks appear in general even in the streams, although outcrops would probably be met with here and there, in the deeper ravines, if the place were thoroughly searched. About Hard\u00e1 rock begins to appear more generally in the streams, and occasionally at the surface of the ground, and farther west trap to the south, and metamorphic rocks to the north are largely exposed. This is especially the case in the neighbourhood of the Narb\u00e1da, which runs through a rocky bed between low hills of Bij\u00e1wars and gneiss. To the south is the western extension of the Pachmari and other hills, much diminished in height, and gradually sinking more and more towards the plain. It is chiefly composed of trap. Mr. Medlicott's map comprises the only portion of the range consisting of older rocks, with the exception of a small patch of Mah\u00e1deva beds in the Ganj\u00e1l river, the existence of which is proved by pebbles brought down by the stream, but which was not reached.\u2020 It is far within the hills, and is evidently of small extent. The section of Mah\u00e1deva rocks at the Moran river has already been referred to in the chapter devoted to those rocks in general. For about two miles south of Lokhartalai trap is seen in the river, then from beneath the trap coarse conglomerates crop out, dipping at about $10^\\circ$ to west, $20^\\circ$ north. These conglomerates contain pebbles of various kinds, some of metamorphic rocks, amongst which quartzite predominates, others of the peculiar purplish quartzite sandstone of the Vindhyans; a few are of red jasper, and mixed with the mass are blocks, frequently two or three feet across, of soft felspathic sandstone, evidently derived from the Dam\u00fad\u00e1s, which are in place close by. Below the coarse conglomerate is brown sandstone, slightly conglomeritic. This rests on felspathic sandstone, succeeded by flaggy beds and carbonaceous shale, the latter clearly belonging to the Dam\u00fad\u00e1s series. Despite the unconformity between the two series shown by the Dam\u00fad\u00e1s detritus contained in the Mah\u00e1deva conglomerate, it was impossible precisely to determine the line of separation. It is clear, however, that the Mah\u00e1devas do not, at this spot, exceed two hundred feet in thickness, and probably half that amount is nearer the truth. Up the Moran river the Dam\u00fad\u00e1s soon turn over to the south, and disappear again below the traps. The Mah\u00e1devas appear to be wanting. They are, however, much thicker in the hills east of the Moran than in the river. No good sections are seen. The hills further west, about Makr\u00e1i, are composed of bedded trap, either dipping at low angles to the south or horizontal. Some intertrappeans occur in the upper part of the Agn\u00ed stream, west-south-west of K\u00e1l\u00edbh\u00edt. South of Hard\u00e1, towards Ch\u00e1rw\u00e1, there is a great bay of the alluvium stretching further to the west than is the case near the river. This larger quantity of surface-deposit away from the river appears to indicate a former distribution of the rivers throughout this country different from that at present prevailing. It may have some connexion with the great break near A's\u00edrgarh, in the hills which separate the valleys of the Tapt\u00ed and Narbad\u00e1. The trap demands but little\n\n---\n\n* Memoirs of the Geological Survey of India, vol. vi. part 3, pp. 83\u201486.\n\n\u2020 \"Its existence was only discovered just before leaving the field. I had no map of the country, and could not spare the three or four days it might have required to hunt it out and survey it.\"\n\n27 CPG\nnotice, and the neighbourhood of the Narbad\u00e1 west of Hard\u00e1 received so very hurried an examination that but little of importance can be stated concerning it.* The rocks consist principally of metamorphics and Bij\u00e1wars, overlying trap occurring here and there. On the Narbad\u00e1 a range of hills formed of quartzite rises from the alluvial plain about two miles west of Handi\u00e1. This range stretches along the river for some distance to the westward. Similar quartzite occurs, as already mentioned, at Nim\u00e1war, north of the river, opposite Handi\u00e1.\u2020 About Hard\u00e1 syenitic and granitic rocks occur. Much alluvial cotton soil covers the surface, but it is often very thin. Thus in one place, a few miles west of the town, on the road to Khandw\u00e1, although no rock whatever was visible on the surface, blocks of granite for the railway works were being quarried from a depth of only six or eight feet. In the M\u00e1chak river trap is found about Danw\u00e1r\u00e1. In the upper part of this stream no rock is met with as a rule, although trap is exposed near Mohanpur and G\u00e1h\u00e9l. About half a mile below Danw\u00e1r\u00e1 coarsely crystallised pegmatite (or rather protogene), containing a chlorite-like mineral, is met with, and forms the bed of the stream for a considerable distance. At Dev\u00e1p\u00far there is metamorphic limestone. The rocks are extensively metamorphosed, and no foliation can be recognised. In the country between the M\u00e1chak and the Taw\u00e1 large outliers of traps overlie the metamorphic rocks. The same is the case north of the M\u00e1chak, but to a smaller extent. No attempt has been made to ascertain precisely the boundaries of these numerous little patches. The larger areas have been roughly surveyed so as to indicate the general mode of occurrence. Most of the patches are oval or oblong, their larger axis corresponding with the general strike of the metamorphic rocks, or about east 20\u00b0, 30\u00b0 north, and it is evident that they are due to the traps having overflowed the irregular surface of the underlying formations, in which, as at the present day, ridges of the harder beds, chiefly quartzite or compact granitoid gneiss, stood up above the general level of country. Where denudation has so far removed the traps that the old surface is once more visible, the hard ridges again protrude, while some trap yet remains in the hollows between them. Trap dykes occasionally occur in the metamorphics. They were especially observed in the jungles north-east of Pungh\u00e1t. They appeared at that place to have two principal directions, south-east and east-20\u00b0-north, the latter coinciding with the lamination of the metamorphics. A very interesting section occurs in the Taw\u00e1 river \u2021 near its junction with the Narbad\u00e1. At the mouth of the Taw\u00e1 the Bij\u00e1war limestone is seen presenting a peculiar concentric structure; the alternating bands of siliceous and calcareous minerals, instead of being plane, are concentric around nuclei of quartz. Many of these concentric masses are of great size. A little further south there is an immense mass of hard quartzose breccia similar to that seen north of the river north-west of Ch\u00e1ndgarh, composed of purplish jasper-like rock, with enclosed angular fragments of quartzite; upon this rest Vindhyan shales, sandy as usual, and passing upwards into the typical quartzite sandstone, which forms hills west of the stream. It is difficult to say what\n\n* \"It has since, like the neighbouring country north of the river, been examined by Mr. Mallet, who will probably describe it in greater detail.\"\n\u2020 \"This quartzite has been shown by Mr. Mallet to belong to the Bij\u00e1wars.\"\n\u2021 \"This is the smaller Taw\u00e1, called the Chhot\u00e1 Taw\u00e1 or Suktaw\u00e1 river.\"\nis the position of the breccia. It was at first supposed to be Bij\u00e1war, but the occurrence of similar breccia, apparently interstratified in the Vindhyans on the Narbad\u00e1 close by, renders it possible that it may belong to that series.* The shaley beds appear to be unconformable upon the breccia, and the breccia upon the Bij\u00e1war limestone, but neither unconformity is very clearly made out, and apparent unconformities of breccia or quartzite beds resting upon Bij\u00e1wars must be regarded with suspicion on account of the predominance of cleavage foliation in some of the beds of that series, and its absence in the hornstones and quartzites. Higher up in the Taw\u00e1 trap comes in, and further on still there is a patch of metamorphic rocks. It is of no great extent. The rock is granitoid.\"\n\nThe finest forests are the two reserved tracts which were made over to this district from Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 in 1865\u2014the Bor\u00ed and Denw\u00e1 reserves; but throughout the woodland country the teak is very common, and the saplings thrive well where they are protected. There are some such tracts on the Narbad\u00e1, and a good deal of forest lies west of Handi\u00e1. Of jungle, scrub, or brushwood, there is more or less throughout the valley, but least in the eastern and most in the western parganas. To the east of Seoni the jungle has been only allowed to remain in the poor sandy soil, which is not worth cultivation. Strips of wood run down along the sandy banks of the streams which cross the flat plain from the hills. But in Ch\u00e1rw\u00e1 there is an extensive tract of dense low forest.\n\nThe chief rivers are the Anjan, Taw\u00e1, H\u00e1thir, Denw\u00e1, Ganj\u00e1l, Moran, and Dudh\u00ed, besides the great boundary streams of the Narbad\u00e1 and Tapt\u00ed. The district is, however, throughout intersected by innumerable little streams, many of them perennial, which run down from the hills to the Narbad\u00e1.\n\nThe best road in the district is now the line from Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d by It\u00e1s\u00ed towards Bet\u00fal. It is already partly metalled, bridged, and embanked, and work on the remainder is in active progress. It passes the railroad at the It\u00e1s\u00ed station, eleven miles from Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d. The highroad to Bombay, which runs right through the district from east to west, is only aligned in parts, and nowhere well embanked or drained. Bridges have been built over a few of the streams, and causeways thrown across others. The road from Hard\u00e1 to Handi\u00e1\u2014the old highroad in the days of the Moghals from the Deccan to Agra\u2014is a wide track, well defined, but not metalled, and out of repair. All other roads in the district are merely fair-weather routes, which are being gradually demarcated and drained. The roads from Seoni and Hard\u00e1 towards Bet\u00fal are pretty good, except in the rainy months. The Great Indian Peninsula Railroad (expected to be completed to Jabalp\u00far in 1870) now intersects the whole district from west to east, with stations at B\u00e1gr\u00e1, Hard\u00e1, Seoni, It\u00e1s\u00ed, Soh\u00e1gp\u00far, and Bankher\u00e1. It crosses the Taw\u00e1 by a viaduct at the opening of the gorge through which the river issues from the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1s, and it is carried by a short tunnel under an interposing projection of the hill close by. A system of railway feeders has for some time been under the consideration of the local Government, and is gradually being carried out.\n\n* \"This was pointed out by Mr. Mallet.\"\nThe temperature is said to be higher than that of Narsinghpur or Jabalpur, but it is of a very medium character, free from excess of heat and cold. The direct rays of the sun are very powerful; but hot winds are the exception, and are seldom very violent, while the nights in the hot weather and rains are always cool. The thermometer seldom rises above 100\u00b0 in the shade; the average maximum of July, August, and September 1864 was 91\u00b0 in the shade, the average minimum was 73\u00b0. The cold weather is seldom bitter, and often hardly bracing, though frosts of one or two nights' duration are not uncommon. The rainfall is exceedingly variable, ranging between the limits of forty and sixty inches in the year. The winter rains are very regular, insomuch that it is a local proverb that there have been famines from too much rain, but never any from drought. From the position of the district, as a long valley or gorge between the two great ranges of the Sutpura and Vindhya hills, it is subject to violent atmospheric changes, and the harvest is seldom gathered without hailstorms and thunder-showers; dust-storms, however, are unknown. On the whole, considering that the district is within the tropics, and not raised above the ordinary level of Indian plains, it may be considered fortunate in having a climate which is decidedly better than might have been expected. Hoshangabad itself is about 1,000 feet above the sea; but as the fall of the valley is twenty feet in seven miles, the eastern end of the district is about four hundred feet higher than the western end. An east wind blows often in the cold weather, and is rather bitter and piercing.\n\nFrom the thinness of the population and the plentifulness of waste land all round, it naturally follows that the cultivation is Agriculture. not laborious, nor of a high order. Cereals are raised entirely without manure and irrigation, and the rich black soil of the valley is almost independent of any system of rotation, and produces fine crops of wheat without change or fallow for thirty or forty years. Only garden crops and sugarcane are manured and watered. The total cultivated area of the district in the year 1868 was 891,587 acres, and the principal crops grown are cotton, gram, wheat, jawari, and til; since 1864 a great quantity of the land formerly under gram, jawari, and til has been given up to cotton. But the great flatness of the land is against the cultivation of cotton, and is the chief cause why kharif (or rain) crops bear so small a proportion to rabi (or cold weather) crops. The black soil will only grow rain crops when it is thoroughly well drained, and in default of a good system of subsoil draining, this amounts to saying that rain-crops will only grow in ground which slopes considerably, and which is generally light and stony. The black soil, when supplied with unlimited moisture and heat, throws up a crop of weeds which choke whatever is sown, and which, from the deep muddy nature of the soil, cannot be hoed up till dry weather comes; consequently this soil, which is the prevailing one, will only grow rabi crops, and is devoted almost entirely to wheat. In 1860, before the American war, the cotton-growing area was calculated at 24,000 acres, producing 40 lbs. to the acre. In 1864 the extent of area had doubled; but the cotton is never, or very seldom, grown on what is called the \"black cotton soil\"; it is confined to the lighter or inferior soils. The Government waste lands are chiefly hilly tracts, only useful for pasturage, or fit for growing teak or other timber. But at the western extremity of the district, in the Charw\u00e1 pargana, there are some very fine waste lands, which would well repay the expense of cultivation. South of the highroad to Bombay there are about two hundred square\nmiles of such land, interspersed only with three or four villages. Low ranges of stony hills run through the tract, covered with low scrub. In the valleys between, which are often of considerable depth, the soil is of very fine quality.\n\nCoal is found in small quantities in the bed of almost every stream which cuts through the Mah\u00e1deo sandstone range, notably in the bed of the Taw\u00e1; but no coal mines of any value have yet been worked in this district. Ironstone occurs in several places, especially in the low hills near Hard\u00e1, and is roughly smelted by the hill tribes. Fruits, drugs, dyes, and tanning-barks are brought down from the hills, a little tasar silk is produced and some lac is collected, but not in any large quantities. There are a few good brood-mares in the district; most of them belong to substantial Gujar M\u00e1lguz\u00e1rs, who breed in a small way; and the better class of farmers from Hindust\u00e1n seem always to have kept horses for riding. But horses and ponies are by no means so common as in Upper India. Two fine stallions have been procured by the Government for improving the district stock. The cattle belong mostly to the M\u00e1lw\u00e1 and up-country breeds, the M\u00e1lw\u00e1 stock being in highest favour. The oxen are stout beasts, useful for heavy draught and for ploughing the deep black soil, but much inferior in pace and activity to the small Ber\u00e1r bullocks. Of late years there have been very large importations of high-priced cattle from the north, to meet the demand among the prosperous agriculturists of this valley. Sheep-breeding is not carried on to any large extent; the supply is from Bundelkhand.\n\nAt Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d are the courts, civil and criminal, of the Deputy Commissioner and of his assistants. Here also is the office of the collector of customs, and of a patrol. The district has four administrative subdivisions, under tahsild\u00e1rs, who have their head-quarters at Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d, Sob\u00e1gp\u00far, Seoni, and Hard\u00e1 respectively, and who exercise judicial and fiscal authority. There are police stations at all the four places above mentioned, also at Bankher\u00ed and Ch\u00e1rw\u00e1 near the eastern and western extremities of the district. Several outposts of police are stationed at various intermediate points. The police force is 429 strong, including all ranks.

Of this 2,300 square miles are contained in the fertile valley of the Narbad\u00e1, and the hill tracts are estimated to cover about 2,000 square miles. The population, according to the census of November 1866, amounts to 440,433 souls, giving an average of 102 to the square mile. Of this 47 per cent are returned as females. The agriculturists are to the mercantile and artisan population as 100 to 114. The non-agricultural portion of the people is very small as compared with the agriculturists. Almost all the principal\ntraders in the towns are M\u00e1rw\u00e1ris. There are also the usual classes of petty shopkeepers; and there are large colonies of weavers, Mah\u00e1rs, Kol\u00eds, Cham\u00e1rs, and Kosht\u00eds. The principal agricultural classes are, in the east, Kir\u00e1rs, Gujars, and Raghubans\u00eds, emigrants from Bundelkhand and from Oudh. Westward, Gujars, J\u00e1t\u00eds, R\u00e1jputs, and Bishno\u00eds from M\u00e1rw\u00e1r and M\u00e1lw\u00e1, Kurm\u00eds and Menos from Nim\u00e1r and Kh\u00e1ndesh. There are also a large number of Gonds and Kurk\u00fas\u2014aboriginal hill tribes\u2014with non-Aryan languages and non-Aryan habits of their own. In the valley they are considered too improvident to be good cultivators, but they are hardworking and trustworthy farm-servants. In the hill tracts they form the sole population, Gonds and Kurk\u00fas alone inhabiting the eastern tracts of Pachmar\u00ed and M\u00e1lin\u00ed; Kurk\u00fas, with an admixture of Gonds, occupying R\u00e1j\u00e1b\u00f3r\u00e1ri and K\u00e1l\u00edbh\u00edt. They are chiefly remarkable for their truthfulness, inoffensiveness, and shyness, and it is hard to believe that only fifty years ago they were the most reckless and daring of robbers, and that their depredations filled the whole valley with terror, and gave to M\u00e1lin\u00ed its title of Chorm\u00e1lin\u00ed, or \"Robber M\u00e1lin\u00ed.\" There has probably never been a stronger instance of the character of a whole race being completely changed in a generation by peaceful government. The subjoined figures, which are understood to be rather under the mark, show that the population is most numerous in the eastern parganas, and decreases rapidly from pargana to pargana going towards the west:\n\n| Persons |\n|---------|\n| R\u00e1jw\u00e1r\u00e1 | 166 |\n| Sch\u00e1gp\u00far | 165 |\n| Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d | 146 |\n| Seoni | 130 |\n| Hard\u00e1 | 123 |\n\nIn this district, as throughout the Narbad\u00e1 valley, there are some estates which have for generations belonged to petty chiefs or heads of families, who have been strong enough to keep their lands together, and to pay only tribute or feudal service to the ruling power. Such have been the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Fatehp\u00far and the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Sobh\u00e1p\u00far, who held their fiefs originally from the princes of Mandla, and who have contrived to retain the bulk of their ancestral estates through the changes of times and dynasties up to the present date. With these also may be classed, but at a long distance below them, the T\u00e1lukad\u00e1rs of B\u00e1bai, and one or two other small proprietors, who hold at a quit-rent some half-cultivated tracts of Hard\u00e1. These families were undoubtedly lords of their domains, and their proprietary right as t\u00e1lukad\u00e1rs or quit-rent holders has been recognised in the recent settlement of land revenue. In some cases, where long hereditary occupancy appeared to give some prescriptive title to the farmers of villages on these t\u00e1lukad\u00e1ri estates, or where the farmers have sunk capital in the land, a sub-settlement has been made recognising their possession of inferior proprietary rights, and protecting them from being ejected at the pleasure of their landlord. The status of the petty hill chiefs in the Mah\u00e1deo hills also deserves special mention. For many generations their ancestors held the difficult and unproductive country, on and around the Pachmarh\u00ed plateau, under a sort of feudal subjection to the rulers of Deogarh and N\u00e1gp\u00far, but were never entirely subdued until 1818. They sheltered and supported \u00c1p\u00e1 S\u00e1hib when he escaped into their fastnesses; they raised their clans in his favour; and were thoroughly put down by the British troops sent to expel him. But the British agents\nadopted the policy of maintaining these talukadars in their rights, continuing the same system of receiving nominal tribute from some, while others received stipends from the state. Upon the recommendation of Sir R. Temple, late chief commissioner, the Government formally confirmed in this position all of these jagirdars, except the Zamindar of Ralkheri, who rebelled in 1858, and whose lands were confiscated. Of these jagirdars or zamindars those of Almod, Pachmarhi, and Pagara are the most important.\n\nThere are no manufactures of any note, and few handicrafts, except the ordinary leather-curing, weaving, and the like. The workers in brass have a good name in the country round. The local weaving trade was flourishing until the enormous demand for cotton in 1863-64 raised the price of raw material beyond their means. Cotton was then exported, and English piece-goods were imported. These disadvantages, with the high price of day-labour, stopped a large number of looms; but the trade has by no means succumbed yet, and will probably continue for some time to supply the coarser and stouter fabrics in which the outdoor working-man clothes himself and family. The export trade is almost entirely composed of agricultural produce. It is a very large and increasing trade, affording employment to a great deal of capital and a large number of merchants, and pouring an immense quantity of silver into the district. It has received a great stimulus of late by the high prices which have prevailed in Malwa and Berar, in consequence of bad seasons, increased consumption, and other causes. The value of wheat exported has been roughly calculated at four lakhs of rupees (\u00a340,000) annually. Besides wheat, the export of gram, oil-seeds, and cotton is considerable. In return, English piece-goods, spices, and cocoanuts are the principal imports from the west, salt from Bhopal, sugar by way of Mirzapur from the east. But the gradual approach of the open railway from the west increases every year the tendency of the district trade in that direction. When the line is completed it is most probable that this part of the Narbad country will deal almost entirely with Bombay. It has been roughly reckoned that five lakhs of rupees (\u00a350,000) worth of English piece-goods are imported every year.\n\nLittle is known of the ancient history of the district before the Maratha invasion. The eastern portion, or the Rajawar pargana, is owned by four Gond Rajas,* who derive their title from the Rajas of Mandla. The centre of the district was subject to the Rajas of Deogarh either directly, as Sohagpur, or indirectly through his feudatories, the petty Rajas of Bagra and Sullugarh. In the extreme west the Gond Rajas of Makrai is said once to have had an extensive independent jurisdiction. But there are hardly any writings or traditions belonging to this period. In Akbar's time Handia was the head-quarters of a sarkar, and was occupied by a faujdar and diwan, and by Moghal troops; Seoni was attached to a province of Bhopal; and Hoshangabad is not mentioned at all. Several reasons concur to give probability to the idea that the eastern part of the district was never conquered by Delhi at all, but was thought too wild and valueless to wrest from the Gonds who occupied it. Dost Mohammad, the founder of the Bhopal family, took Hoshangabad itself, and annexed a considerable territory with it, from Seoni to the Tawa, or to Sohagpur, as some say. From the dates of sanads now existing he must have done this about the year A.D. 1720.\n\n*The Rajas of Sohagpur and the three Rajas of Fatehpur mentioned before.\nIn A.D. 1742 the Peshw\u00e1, B\u00e1l\u00e1j\u00ed B\u00e1j\u00ed R\u00e1o, passed up the valley on his way to attack Mandla; but he seems to have kept permanent possession of the Handi\u00e1 parganas only. In 1750-51 R\u00e1j\u00e1 Raghoj\u00ed Bhonsl\u00e9 of N\u00e1gp\u00far overran the whole range of hill from G\u00e1walgarh to Mah\u00e1deo, and reduced the country east of Handi\u00e1 and south of the Narbad\u00e1, except the portion held by Bhop\u00e1l. The R\u00e1jw\u00e1r\u00e1 Gond r\u00e1j\u00e1s seem to have retained their independence until A.D. 1775, and we hear of no hostilities between Bhop\u00e1l and N\u00e1gp\u00far about this time. But in A.D. 1795 an officer of Raghoj\u00ed's attacked and took Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d. In A.D. 1802 Waz\u00edr Mohammad, the ruler of Bhop\u00e1l, retook it; he also occupied Seoni, thirty miles to the west of Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d, and made an unsuccessful attack on Soh\u00e1gp\u00far. The Bhop\u00e1l chief held the country round Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d, until he was driven across the Narbad\u00e1 by the N\u00e1gp\u00far troops in 1807. During the war which followed between N\u00e1gp\u00far and Bhop\u00e1l, Waz\u00edr Mohammad called in the Pindh\u00e1r\u00eds to his help, and till they were finally extirpated in 1817 the whole of this fertile valley was a prey to their insatiable thirst for plunder and disregard of life. Large tracts of country were laid entirely waste, and the accumulated wealth of the district was effectively dispersed. In 1818 that part of the district which was owned by N\u00e1gp\u00far was ceded under the agreement of that year,* confirmed by the treaty of 1826.\u2020 In 1844 the district of Hard\u00e1 Handi\u00e1 was made over by Sindi\u00e1 at an estimated value of Rs. 1,40,000, in part payment of the Gwalior contingent, and by the treaty of 1860 it was permanently transferred, and became British territory. The mutiny of 1857 disturbed the district very little. There was some trouble with the police at Hard\u00e1: a petty chief rebelled in the Mah\u00e1deo hills, and T\u00e1t\u00ed\u00e1 Topi\u00e1 crossed the valley in 1858. But the authority of the British officers was at no time seriously shaken.\n\nHOSHANG\u00c1BA'D\u2014The north-eastern revenue subdivision or tahsil in the district of the same name, having an area of 987 square miles, with 392 villages, and a population of 136,178 souls according to the census of 1866. The land revenue for 1869-70 is Rs. 1,47,479-3-7.\n\nHOSHANG\u00c1BA'D\u2014The head-quarters of the district of the same name; is situated in latitude 20\u00b0 40' north, and longitude 77\u00b0 51' east, on the south side of the Narbad\u00e1, which is here 700 yards wide from bank to bank, though in the hot weather the stream is not more than 300 yards across, and is fordable both above and below the town. The road from Bhop\u00e1l to Betul and N\u00e1gp\u00far passes through it, as also the highroad to Bombay, although the greater part of the through traffic cuts off the angle made here, and passes about five miles to the south. The town is supposed to have been founded by Hoshang Sh\u00e1h, the second of the Ghor\u00ed kings of M\u00e1lw\u00e1, who reigned about A.D. 1403 (according to Prinsep's genealogical tables). It is said that he died and was buried here, but that his bones were removed to M\u00e1nd\u00fa and buried again there. The town, however, remained very small till the Bhop\u00e1l conquest, about A.D. 1720, when the fort was either built or enlarged, and a trading population began to collect round it. The fort was a very massive stone building of irregular shape, with its base on the river commanding the road to Bhop\u00e1l. It has now been mostly removed piecemeal. It was attacked in A.D. 1795 by Ben\u00ed Singh S\u00fabad\u00e1r, an officer of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of N\u00e1gp\u00far, and after a two months' siege was evacuated by the Bhop\u00e1l troops. In A.D. 1802 the kil\u00e1d\u00e1r or governor of the fort was a Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 Br\u00e1hman, a man of peace, and his fears were so\n\n* Aitken's \"Treaties,\" vol. iii. p. 109.\n\u2020 Do. do. do. p. 113.\nworked on by men under the Bhop\u00e1l influence, that he gave it up without a blow, and it was immediately reoccupied by Wazir Mohammad, then the virtual ruler of Bhop\u00e1l. This success added so much to his prestige and military strength that he overran all the Sohagpur pargana and besieged the fort of Sohagpur, but before he could take it the siege was raised by the arrival of a force from Seoni Chhapar, which defeated him with heavy loss. He was hotly pursued into Hoshangabad, and making a stand outside the town his horse was killed under him. A rude stone figure of a horse still marks the spot. He mounted his celebrated tail-less horse Pankhr\u00e1j (which gave him the title of Band\u00e1 Ghorek\u00e1 Saw\u00e1r), and escaped only by leaping him over the battlement of the fort. The Nagpur army besieged the fort for some time, and, being unable to take it, contented themselves with burning the town, and departed.\n\nIn 1809 Hoshangabad was again attacked by a Nagpur force, and after a siege of three months, when their communications with Bhop\u00e1l were cut off, and a battery had been erected on the north side of the river against them, the garrison surrendered. In 1817 General Adams occupied the town, and threw up some earthworks outside it, to protect it against an enemy coming from the south and east. From A.D. 1818 it has been the residence of the chief British official in charge of the district, and lately it has been made the head-quarters of the Narbada division. A church has just been built, and a central jail is under construction. There is a dispensary, and there are one or two well-filled school-houses. It is also occupied by the wing of a Native regiment. It is the head-quarters of the English piece-goods trade of the district, and a good deal is done in cotton, grain, and bills of exchange. The bazar is a good one, with some petty shops at which European articles are sold. The railway passes about eleven miles off. The nearest station is Itarsi on the Betul road. The population of the town is 8,032 souls.\n\nI\n\nINDRA'NA'\u2014A village in the Jabalpur district, picturesquely situated near the Hirant river; latitude 23\u00b0 24' 2\", longitude 79\u00b0 56' 22\". It is said to have been founded by Raj\u00fa Niz\u00e1m Shah of Mandla; and a garden laid out and a well dug by Pandit B\u00e1liji S\u00faba, under the S\u00e1g\u00e1r r\u00e1j\u00e1's administration, still exist. There is a mud fort here belonging to the petty chief who owns the surrounding estate. On the south of the town runs the Hirant, which is here two hundred feet broad. The place is noted for dyeing cloths. The country round abounds in game, and there is good fishing in the river.\n\nINDRA'VATI'\u2014A river which rises in the highlands of Thumul, in the eastern gh\u00e1ts, and after a course of about 250 miles becomes the boundary between a portion of the Upper Godavari district and the Bastar dependency for a distance of about twenty-five miles, and then falls into the Godavari, about thirty miles below its confluence with the Pranhita. Its bed is full of rocks, and is a succession of rapids.\n\nINDUPU'R\u2014The ancient name of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 in the pre-historic age.\n\nIT\u00c1'WA'\u2014An estate in the S\u00e1g\u00e1r district, about thirty-eight miles north-west of S\u00e1g\u00e1r. It contains forty-four villages, with a total area of seventy-seven square miles. At the cession of S\u00e1g\u00e1r to the British Government by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s in A.D. 1818, this tract, which then consisted of forty-six villages, yielding a yearly rental of Rs. 8,964, was assigned rent-free for life to a Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 pandit, by name R\u00e1m Bh\u00e1\u00fa, in lieu of Malh\u00e1rgarh and Kanji\u00e1, the former\nbeing an estate situated to the extreme north-west of the S\u00e1gar district on the other side of the river Betw\u00e1, which he held under the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s on the same tenure, and which was made over by the Government to Sind\u00ed\u00e1. At the late settlement sixteen villages were given to the t\u00e1lukd\u00e1r in proprietary right, and in twenty-eight the superior proprietary right only was given to him. The village itself is of tolerable size and importance. It contains 371 houses, with a population of 1,402. It is supposed to have been founded about 325 years ago by a Bundel\u00e1 officer of Akbar named Indrajit. From the Mohammdans the country appears to have passed into the hands of a race called Gaul\u00eds, who were succeeded about the beginning of the eighteenth century by D\u00edv\u00e1n Anup Singh, r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Pann\u00e1, then in possession of Khiml\u00e1s\u00e9 and the surrounding country. The small fort now standing was built by him about that time, and large improvements and additions were made to the town. In A.D. 1751 he made over the place to the Peshw\u00e1 in return for assistance sent him by the latter against the Bundel\u00e1s. The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s improved the fort and town, and enlarged the latter considerably. There are some fine buildings in and close to the town, the stone-work and carving in which are really remarkable, especially in an unfinished temple now under construction. A market is held here every Friday, the chief sales at which consist of corn and native cloths. There is no trade worth mentioning. A boys\u2019 school has been lately established here.\n\nJ\n\nJABALPU'R (JUBBULPORE)\u2014 CONTENTS.\n\n| Page | Page |\n|------|------|\n| General description | 218 |\n| Watersheds and rivers | ib. |\n| Geological formation and minerals | 219 |\n| Climate | 221 |\n| Forests | 223 |\n| Manufactures and trade | 223 |\n| Communications | ib. |\n| Administration | 224 |\n| Population and languages | ib. |\n| History | 225 |\n\nOne of the largest and most populous districts in the Central Provinces, bounded on the north by Pann\u00e1 and Maihr; on the east by Rew\u00e1; on the south by Mandla, Seoni, and Narsinghp\u00far; and on the west by Damoh. It lies between latitude 22\u00b0 40' and 24\u00b0 8' north, and between 81\u00b0 6' and 79\u00b0 35' east longitude; and contains an area of 4,261 square miles,\n\nThe main body of the district is a large plain of rich soil watered by the General description. Narbad\u00e1, the Paret, and the Hiran, extending from Sihor\u00e9 on the north to the Bher\u00e1 and Lamet\u00e1 gh\u00e1ts of the Narbad\u00e1 on the south, and from Kumbhl on the east to S\u00e1nkal, where the Hiran unites with the Narbad\u00e1, on the west. It is surrounded by spurs of the Gondw\u00e1n\u00e1 range on the south, by the Bh\u00e1nrer and Kaim\u00far hills on the north and west, and by the Bhitr\u00edgarh hills on the east. These hill-ranges break the monotony of the prospect in the plain, in every part of which the horizon is marked in more than one direction by high ground, and give a very diversified character to the scenery of the borders of the district, where hill and valley, forest and stream, succeed each other in rapid variety.\n\nThere are two principal watersheds in the district. The one is a curved Watersheds and rivers. irregular line, with a general north-easterly and south-westerly direction, and lies to the north of the Bh\u00e1nrer and Kaim\u00far ranges, by which it is formed. Rivers to the north of\nthis watershed are affluents of the Jamn\u00e1. The second commences in the Bhitr\u00edgarh range of hills, and crossing the Great Northern Road between Sleeman\u00e1b\u00e1d and Sihor\u00e1 passes to the north of the latter place. In this watershed the Katn\u00ed (sometimes called Katn\u00ed) river takes its rise, and after a circuitous course crosses the Great Northern Road near Murw\u00e1r\u00e1, and falls into the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed, an affluent of the Son, which debouches into the Ganges, and finally unites its waters with the Bay of Bengal. Thus travellers from Jabalp\u00far to Mirz\u00e1p\u00far pass over the great watershed between the Gulf of Cambay and the Bay of Bengal. Water falling to the north and east of them pours into affluents either of the Ganges or Jamn\u00e1, whilst that shed to the south or west unites with the rapid stream of the Narbad\u00e1. The principal rivers are the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed, which, rising in the Mandla district, pursues a generally northerly course, till in the Bijer\u00e1ghogarh subdivision it bends to the east and discharges itself into the Son; the Guray\u00e1, between Jabalp\u00far and Damoh; the Patn\u00e1, on the boundary of Pann\u00e1 and Jabalp\u00far; and the Hiran, which flows into the Narbad\u00e1 at S\u00e1nkal. The affluents of the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed are the S\u00e1k\u00e1n river, a very small portion of whose course lies in the Jabalp\u00far district, the Katn\u00ed, and other smaller streams. The principal affluents of the Hiran are the Ker, the Bil\u00f3r\u00e1, and the Lamber\u00e1, the whole of whose course is within the Jabalp\u00far district. The above join the Hiran on its right bank, whilst the Pare\u00ed is the principal affluent on the left bank. The Narbad\u00e1 also flows through the district for about seventy miles from east to west. On its right bank is the Gaur, and on the left bank the Timar.\n\nThe geological aspect of the Jabalp\u00far district proper may be thus generally described from the map attached to the Memoirs of the Geological Survey of India, Vol. II., Part 2. Its most valuable portion is a long, narrow plain running north-east and south-west, which may be regarded as an offshoot from the Narbad\u00e1 valley. To the north-west it is bounded by the Bh\u00e1nr hill, which belong to the Vindhyan sandstone series, though the Kalumbar hill to the north-west of Katang\u00ed is trappean. To the south-east the boundary line is a thin irregular strip, consisting chiefly of rocks of the Upper Dam\u00fad\u00e1 and Mah\u00e1deo series, interspersed in places with metamorphic and crystalline rocks. The plain itself is covered in its western and southern portions by a rich alluvial deposit of the black cotton soil class, while to the north-east it merges into an undulating tract of metamorphic and lateritic formation. The country from P\u00e1nag\u00e1r on the south to Gos\u00e1lp\u00e1r on the north, and Majhgaw\u00e1n on the west, is also metamorphic, thus breaking to some extent the continuity of the central plain. The southern and eastern portions of the district, lying parallel with the black soil plain, belong to the great trappean area of Central India and the Deccan. In the north-eastern part of the district, rocks of the Lower Dam\u00fad\u00e1 series occur, intermingled with kindred formations. The granitic rocks are thus mentioned* by Mr. J. G. Medlicott:\n\n\"Rocks of granitic type, although often seen at the surface, do not occupy large areas in this portion of Central India; the largest of these areas is found near Jabalp\u00far, where the granite forms a range of low hills running from Lamet\u00e1 Gh\u00e1t on the Narbad\u00e1 in a north-east direction.\"\n\n* Memoirs of the Geological Survey of India, vol. ii. part 2, pp. 120\u2014122.\n\"Near where the old town of Garh\u00e1 stands the hilly area of the granite is about two miles wide, and a building now in ruins, called the Madan Mahal, stands on the highest point of this part of the range. * * *\n\nFrom this place the granite may be followed for many miles to the north-east, forming a narrow irregular band among the metamorphic rocks; it is not even quite continuous, but sometimes thins out and disappears for a short space, coming to the surface again in the same general direction. This line of the granite is approximately parallel to the strike of the metamorphic rocks, though not absolutely so. Whenever we find the igneous rocks near to the altered bedded formations, their relations seem equivocal; a definite line can rarely be drawn between the two, and the transition from the one to the other is often imperceptibly graduated.\n\n\"Lithology of the Granitic Rocks.\u2014The mineral characters of rocks included under this head are in our area very various. That variety which is most widely spread, and occupies the greatest extent of surface, is a porphyritic syenite, whose matrix is a mixture of glassy quartz with pale pink or pale green felspar, along with a small proportion of hornblende, and which contains embedded crystals of dull lead grey felspar (adularia), about one-third of an inch long, and in great number, frequently forming a large proportion of the mass. A rock answering more or less closely to this description forms the Garh\u00e1 hills, much local variation in the composition of the mass obtains, and this sometimes to the extent of totally altering the general aspect of the rock. Thus the adularia crystals are sometimes altogether absent; elsewhere they become so numerous as to constitute of themselves two-thirds of the rock mass; again, minute crystals of black mica are found replacing the hornblende, and were in one case noticed along with it in a hand specimen; sometimes the rock becomes fine-grained syenite without any detached crystals, and with very little quartz. A good case of this occurs at the second bridge from Jabalp\u00far on the road thence to Soh\u00e1gp\u00far, where the hornblende is in unusually large proportion.\"\n\nThe most remarkable of the metamorphic rocks are thus described*:\n\n\"The saccharine limestone shows, save only in a few of its massive beds, a more or less distinctly observable laminated structure; the lines of lamination are sometimes marked by variations of colour and texture, evidently due to the presence of new ingredients, and the shading off above spoken of is effected by a gradual increase in the frequency of the recurrence of such indications, and by the intermixture of these argillaceous and arenaceous partings becoming a more and more prominent ingredient in the mass, until, from being impurities in a calcareous schist, they come to constitute the rock, an argillaceous, or siliceous schist, with layers, bands, and veins of carbonate of lime scattered through it.\n\n* * * * * * * * *\n\n\"About nine miles from Jabalp\u00far, on the south-west, a considerable extent of tolerably pure and beautifully saccharine white limestone is seen; the river cuts a deep channel through the mass of this rock, exposing sheer vertical surfaces of the white limestone, in places 120 feet high; it is scarcely possible to exaggerate the picturesque effect of the varied outline and colour of the whole. The locality is well known as the 'Marble Rocks.'\"\n\n* Memoirs of the Geological Survey of India, vol. ii. part 2, pp. 134\u2014136.\nCoal is found at R\u00e1mgh\u00e1t, Lamet\u00e1gh\u00e1t, Bher\u00e1gh\u00e1t, and near Sing\u00e9p\u00far on the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed. The latter seam is eighteen inches thick, and is said to be \"poor and unworkable.\" The Lamet\u00e1gh\u00e1t coal, for long thought useless, has again attracted attention, and now promises well. Iron is found in more than a hundred places, of which the principal are Simr\u00e1, Gogri, Boli\u00e1, Agari\u00e1, Dalror\u00e1, Jauti, P\u00e1n\u00e1g\u00e1r, and Lamet\u00e1. The iron is worked entirely by native processes. The ores of the Narbad\u00e1 valley have been classed as follows:\n\n1. The detrital ores.\n2. The iron clay sands of the Damud\u00e1 and Mah\u00e1deo sandstone, sometimes, though rarely, smelted.\n3. The ores extracted from the beds of the crystalline rocks, which are interstratified with the quartzite.\n4. The ores which are accumulated along fault lines.\n\nTo this last class the mines of Dabw\u00e1r\u00e1, Agari\u00e1, and Jauti belong. They are by far the most productive mines. \"The ore is chemically hydrous peroxide.\" No. 3 is that next in importance commercially, and includes Lamet\u00e1, P\u00e1n\u00e1g\u00e1r, and other mines. Near all of the above mines limestone is believed to be abundantly obtainable. But perhaps the most important iron mines in the Jabalp\u00far district are those of the Kumbh\u00ed pargana, about twenty or thirty miles to the north-east of Jabalp\u00far, which belong to the second class. The ore occurs in the form of a black iron sand, which is an article of extensive traffic. It is known by the name of \"Dh\u00e1o,\" and having been smelted, is made up into all kinds of utensils at P\u00e1n\u00e1g\u00e1r. The iron trade of the Jabalp\u00far district is considerable; but it would be fallacious to quote the returns here, unless iron imported for railway purposes could be separated from that produced from native ore. The limestone of the hills at Bher\u00e1gh\u00e1t is celebrated; and at Murw\u00e1r\u00e1 is said to exist a limestone suited for \"lithographic purposes.\" The limestone of the marble rocks is adolomite; and sandstone of every variety abounds. Clay suitable for bricks is found everywhere, and for pottery in some parts. Roofing-slate is found near Sihor\u00e1 at Ku\u00e1n, about thirty miles north of Jabalp\u00far. The collection of agates in the N\u00e1gp\u00far museum from this district is worthy of remark.\n\nAt Jabalp\u00far itself, where the cantonment is built, the soil is sandy, and water is found very near the surface. Thus the roads of this station are probably superior to those of any other in the Central Provinces. There is also a freshness and greenness even in the hot season which is not observable in stations situated on basaltic soil. To the north-east, north, and west opens out the plain of the Narbad\u00e1 and Hiran, which has been already described. It includes the parganas of Garh\u00e1, Sihor\u00e1, and some portion of Kumbh\u00ed. In some places the soil of this plain is \"black soil,\" whilst in others there is a thick deposit of pale, brownish-coloured alluvium; and again in other localities the \"regar\" has been entirely removed by causes now in action, and its place is occupied by deposits of silt brought down by the Narbad\u00e1. This silt is said to be highly productive. Beyond the limits of the parganas named above the soil is sandy, and all the small ranges of hills are of sandstone.\n\nThe climate is salubrious. The rainfall ordinarily exceeds forty inches. The temperature is extremely moderate.* In the cold weather the thermometer on the ground in the neighbourhood of Kundam has been recorded as low as 26\u00b0 Fahr. There\nare only two months of hot weather, and, except immediately before the rains, no great heat is experienced. The rains commence early in June and last until late in September. The prevailing winds are westerly. In the rains the wind varies a few points to the south, and in the hot weather as much to the north. The coldest wind is from the north and north-east; westerly winds in the cold weather usually bring clouds and increased temperature. A south-east wind is rather uncommon, north-westerly winds are rare. Hailstorms occur in February and March, and sometimes occasion great damage to the rabi crops. Annexed is a register of the thermometer kept for a single year by the late Dr. Spilsbury, from whose records the above account of the climate is taken. The average temperature has not varied much since 1840, when the register was kept:\n\n| Months | Coldest day | Hottest day | Medium | Remarks |\n|--------|-------------|-------------|--------|---------|\n| January | minimum 40 | maximum 67 | 50\u00bd | |\n| February | minimum 40 | maximum 68 | 75 | |\n| March | minimum 52 | maximum 72 | 62 | |\n| April | minimum 58 | maximum 91 | 82 | |\n| May | minimum 76 | maximum 99 | 88 | |\n| June | minimum 72 | maximum 74 | 90 | |\n| July | minimum 72 | maximum 77 | 76 | |\n| August | minimum 71 | maximum 79 | 77 | |\n| September | minimum 71 | maximum 82 | 92 | |\n| October | minimum 54 | maximum 78 | 76 | |\n| November | minimum 42 | maximum 77 | 93 | |\n| December | minimum 39 | maximum 68 | 84 | |\n\nAverage minimum... 67\u00bd Average maximum... 83\u00bd\n\nThe principal complaints are fevers and dysentery. The former prevail from the setting in of the rains to the end of November. The epidemics are cholera, influenza, and small-pox.\n\nThe plain country is well wooded, and the hills are covered with forests. Formerly these forests suffered great loss from the annual burnings by the hill tribes and others, or by accidental conflagration of the grass of the previous year's growth. In\nmany places a spectator might pitch his tent in an amphitheatre of hills, enjoy\nthe beautiful scenery by day, and, as night advanced, watch the hills glowing\nwith fire. The Forest department now use every effort to prevent these exten-\nsive fires, which do not usually kill outright, but scar the bark of the young\nteak tree. The most useful kinds of indigenous timber are the teak (tectona\ngrandis), s\u00e1j (pentaptera glabra), kaw\u00e1 (pentaptera arjuna), hard\u00fa (nauclea cor-\ndifoia), kem (nauclea parvifolia), tend\u00fa (dyospyrus melanoxylon), b\u00e1b\u00fal (acacia\narabica), and bamboo (bambusa). The mhowa (bassia latifolia), chironi\u00e1\n(buchanania latifolia), j\u00e1mun (syzygium jambolanum), guava, mango, ber (zizy-\nphus jujuba), mulberry, and tamarind trees abound. Amongst the orna-\nmental trees may be noticed the pipal (ficus religiosa), the banian (ficus \u00edndica),\nthe kachn\u00e1r (bauhinia variegata). Besides the ordinary Indian fruits, such as\nplantains and cape gooseberries, peaches, pineapples, and strawberries will\ngrow, as also very excellent potatoes and other garden produce. Tracts of\nforest land in the Sangr\u00e1hp\u00far valley, and on the west banks of the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed\nin Bijer\u00e1ghogarh, have been marked off as State reserves.\n\nThe forests produce lac and the tasar moth, from the cocoon of whose\nworm a valuable silk is manufactured. There are also gum-bearing trees;\ntheir gums are used in preparing sweetmeats, and some are said to possess\nmedicinal properties. Besides these fruits and products already enumerated\nmay be mentioned mainph\u00e1l (vanguieria spinosa), eaten as a vegetable when\ngreen, and when dry used as a medicine, and in some parts of India as a\nnarcotic; honey and wax; roots of various kinds, as kul\u00fa-kand, bich\u00e1nd\u00ed,\ndard\u00ed kand, and ghat\u00e1l\u00fa; tlkh\u00far, or the wild arrowroot; the kh\u00e1j\u00far, or date\npalm, used in making mats and brooms; the h\u00e1r\u00e1 dhaur\u00ed, and bah\u00e9r\u00e1 (belleric\nmyrobalan), used as dyes; and the barks of the r\u00ednj\u00e1, bab\u00fal, and s\u00e1j, used for\ntanning. Corn is grown from the \"bearded wheat\" known as d\u00e1\u00fad\u00ed; sugar,\np\u00e1n (betel), maize, tobacco, red pepper, linseed, sesamum, safflower, sarson\n(sinapis dichotoma), the castor-oil plant, b\u00e1jr\u00e1 (holcus spicatus), jaw\u00e1ri (sorghum\nvalgare), gram (cicer arietinum), peas, and various kinds of d\u00e1l and rice, are all\nproduced.\n\nThe chief manufactures are iron, cotton-cloth, and brass utensils of various\nkinds. The chief seat of the iron manufacture is\nManufactures and trade. P\u00e1n\u00e1g\u00e1r. At Katang\u00ed and Barel\u00e1 gun-barrels are\nmade. Tents and carpets are made at Jabalp\u00far, both in the School of Industry\nand by private persons. At Jaber\u00e1 knives are manufactured, and there are in\nthe district many excellent workers in leather.\n\nThe trade, as will have been seen from the list of productions, is of con-\nsiderable importance. In 1868-69 the imports through Mirz\u00e1pur and from\nCentral India amounted to 645,998 maunds, and were valued at Rs. 1,09,35,260,\nwhilst the exports to the above localities were 163,111 maunds, valued at\nRs. 26,97,793. The export of manufactured lac-dye from Jabalp\u00far during\n1868-69 amounted to 53,468 maunds, which may be valued at five l\u00f3khs of\nrupees.\n\nA railway connects Jabalp\u00far with Mirz\u00e1pur on the north, and another\nCommunications. will shortly be opened to Bombay, via Narsinghp\u00far\nand Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d, on the west. The line will\ncross the Narbad\u00e1 near Jh\u00e1ns\u00edgh\u00e1t by a viaduct 371 yards long, which is to\ncost nearly \u00a3120,000. The bed of the river is rock. There is an excellent\nroad to Mirz\u0101p\u016br, which is one long avenue of trees, and also to Seoni on the south. These two lines are bridged and metalled. There are fair-weather roads to S\u0101gar and to Narsinghp\u016br, a track to Mandla, and a partially made road to Sh\u0101hpur in the east, and to P\u0101tan in the west. These are all the roads of any importance.\n\nThe stages on the S\u0101gar road are\u2014\n\nBel Kh\u0101r\u016b, 10 miles,\nKatang\u012b, 11\u00bd \"\",\nSang\u0101mp\u016br, 8\u00bd \"\", Travellers' bungalow.\nJabers\u012b, 9 \"\"\n\nThe stages on the Narsinghp\u016br road are M\u012brganj, nine miles, and Sh\u0101hp\u016br, four miles; beyond is Jh\u0101ns\u012bgh\u0101t on the Narbad\u0101. The first halting-place on the Seoni road is at Nigr\u012b, which is about ten miles from Jabalp\u016br on the south side of the Narbad\u0101; the next is at Sukr\u012b, where supplies are procurable. This place is ten miles from Nigr\u012b. The road after leaving Sukr\u012b enters the Seoni district before the next encamping-ground is reached. On the Mandla road the first station is at Mohg\u0101on, eight miles from Jabalp\u016br. Here supplies are procurable. The second encamping-ground is at Danol\u012b, fourteen miles from the former station. At Na\u1e45ganj, nearly eleven miles from Danol\u012b, a travellers' bungalow is about to be built. As far as this place the road is good, but hilly and stony in places, and it passes through thick scrub jungle. The road all the way to Mandla is practicable for lightly laden small country carts.\n\nThe district is comprised within the commissionership or division of the same name. It is administered by a Deputy Commissioner, who is assisted by four or five Assistant and Extra-Assistant Commissioners. For revenue and police purposes Jabalp\u016br is divided into three tahs\u012bls\u2014Jabalp\u016br, Sihor\u0101, and Murw\u0101r\u0101. The area of the district is 4,261 square miles, of which 884,740 acres are under cultivation, and of this not a hundred and seventy-seventh part is irrigated. The barren waste amounts to 513,766 acres. The remainder of the land is either fallow or fit for cultivation. About one-fifth of the cultivated area is cultivated by proprietors, two-fifths by hereditary cultivators, and the remainder by tenants-at-will. The number of villages in these tahs\u012bls is 2,707, of houses 163,094, of wells in use 5,515, and of ploughs 61,803. The revenue amounts to Rs. 8,45,452, of which Rs. 7,93,886 are imperial, and Rs. 51,566 are local. The land revenue for 1868-69 was Rs. 5,70,434, which is a tax of ten annas per acre on the cultivated area. The other imperial revenues were as follows:\n\n| Assessed taxes | Rs. 41,599 |\n|----------------|------------|\n| Excise         | Rs. 49,423 |\n| Stamps         | Rs. 73,838 |\n| Forests        | Rs. 56,240 |\n| Miscellaneous  | Rs. 2,352  |\n\nThe population of the district amounts to 620,201 souls, or about 145 per square mile. The non-agriculturists exceed the agriculturists by about 85,000. The people are for the most part Gonds, Gond-R\u0101jputs, Lodhs, Ponw\u0101rs, Kurmis, Kah\u0101rs, Dh\u012bmars, Dhers, and Cham\u0101rs. There are also Br\u0101hmans, both from the Mah\u0101r\u0101shtra and from Mathur\u0101, K\u0101yaths from Farukh\u0101b\u0101d and elsewhere, and Musalm\u0101ns. There are now no Gond landholders of any importance, but there are some,\nLodh\u00ed chiefs who once possessed a local celebrity. Under the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 rule all Kah\u00e1rs and Cham\u00e1rs were required to pay a portion of their earnings to the state; and Kurm\u00eds and Lodhis were not allowed to marry a second time without paying a fine. The Gonds were probably the indigenous inhabitants of Jabalp\u00far. The Lodhis and K\u00e1yaths appear to have settled in Jabalp\u00far when Bakht Buland was r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Deogarh, that is in the time of Aurangzeb. Concerning this immigration Sir R. Jenkins remarks*:-\u201cHe employed indiscriminately Musalm\u00e1ns and Hind\u00fas of ability. Industrious settlers from all quarters were attracted to Gondw\u00e1na; many towns and villages were founded; and agriculture, manufactures, and even commerce, made considerable advances.\u201d He appears to have made considerable conquests from Mandla; and although Jabalp\u00far never formed part of his kingdom, yet we may conclude that the Lodhis first settled in the district about the time of his reign. The language spoken is a dialect of the Hind\u00ed. Urd\u00fa is commonly understood, and is the language of the courts. The Hind\u00ed dialect is commonly known as the Baghel\u00ed. Its peculiarities that particularly attract the attention of a stranger from Northern India are the elision of nearly all short vowels, and the substitution of \u0917 for \u0917 and \u0918 for \u0918.\n\nThe early history of Jabalp\u00far is obscure. It probably belonged to the Vallabh\u00ed, and perhaps subsequently to the Pram\u00e1ra kingdom of Central India, for the first centuries of our era, but in the 11th and 12th centuries we find in inscriptions evidence of a local line of princes of that Haihaya race, which has at different times been so largely connected with the history of Gondw\u00e1na. In the 16th century the Gond\u2020 r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Garh\u00e1 Mandla (Sangr\u00e1m S\u00e1) extended his power over fifty-two districts, including the present Jabalp\u00far. In the minority of his grandson, Prem N\u00e1rain, permission was obtained by \u00c1\u2019saf Kh\u00e1n, the viceroy of Kara M\u00e1nikp\u00far on the Ganges, to conquer the Garh\u00e1 principality, which he did after a battle fought under the castle of Singaurgarh, in which the Gond queen Durg\u00e1vati committed suicide to avoid the disgrace of defeat. Garh\u00e1 was held some time independently by \u00c1\u2019saf Kh\u00e1n, who, however, eventually submitted himself to the Emperor Akbar and resigned his pretensions to sovereignty. In the list of Akbar\u2019s dominions given in the \u00c1\u2019\u00edn-i-Akbar\u00ed, Garh\u00e1 is included as a division of the government of M\u00e1lw\u00e1, but the Mohammadan power seems to have been faintly felt there, at any rate after Akbar\u2019s death, for the princes of Garh\u00e1 Mandla carried on their affairs in almost entire independence until their subjugation by the governors of S\u00e9g\u00e1r in 1781. In 1798 the Bhonsl\u00e1 rulers of N\u00e1gp\u00far obtained a grant of Mandla and the Narbad\u00e1 valley from the Peshw\u00e1, and the Jabalp\u00far district remained under them until it was occupied by the British after an engagement on the 19th December 1817. Immediately after the occupation of Jabalp\u00far a provisional government was formed, the president of which was Major O\u2019Brien. Their proceedings throw a curious light upon the government which they succeeded. Immediately after their assumption of office they appointed Raghn\u00e1th Rao, r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Ingl\u00ed\u00e1, acting s\u00fabad\u00e1r. That officer presented a petition, asking whether certain rules and regulations enforced by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s should be continued. Among these rules were the following:\n\n1. All widows to be sold, and the purchase-money to be paid into the treasury.\n\n* Report on N\u00e1gp\u00far by Sir R. Jenkins, Edition N\u00e1gp\u00far Antiquarian Society, p. 97.\n\u2020 Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, vol. vi. pp. 644\u2014646.\n2. All persons receiving any sum through an order, or the interference or interposition, of any person in office or authority, to pay one-fourth of the sum recovered to the state.\n\n3. Any person selling his daughter, to pay one-fourth of the purchase-money to the state.\n\n4. One-fourth of the purchase-money of all houses to be paid into the treasury.\n\nThese rules at the time of the British assumption of authority were by no means obsolete. At a meeting of the same provisional government we find the government ordering the release of a woman, by name Pursi\u00e1, who had been sold by auction a few days before for seventeen rupees. Slavery undoubtedly existed in a certain modified form under the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, and it is reported commonly amongst the people of Jabalp\u00far that under the Gond rule human sacrifices were not unknown.\n\nWhen the provisional government was abolished, the S\u00e1g\u00e1r and Narbad\u00e1 territories were for a time governed by a Commissioner, who was subject to the Resident at N\u00e1gp\u00far. Subsequently these districts were separated from the N\u00e1gp\u00far agency, and in 1843 Lord Ellenborough recast the whole system of administration. The superintendence of the departments of civil and criminal judicature was separated from that of revenue and police, and the latter was entrusted to the Commissioner and his staff; while for the former a Civil and Sessions Judge was appointed, with two superior and sixteen inferior Native Judges. The system here sketched lasted until November 1861, when the S\u00e1g\u00e1r and Narbad\u00e1 territories became part of the Central Provinces, and were placed under the control of a Chief Commissioner, resident at N\u00e1gp\u00far.\n\nJABALPU'R\u2014The southern revenue subdivision or tahsil in the district of the same name, having an area of 1,540 square miles, with 1,186 villages, and a population of 276,229 according to the census of 1866. The land revenue for the year 1869-70 is Rs. 3,08,739.\n\nJABALPU'R\u2014The head-quarters of the district of the same name. It is situated in East longitude 79\u00b0 59' 43\", and in North latitude 23\u00b0 9' 31\". Its elevation above the sea has been variously computed, but is believed to be about 1,458 feet. It is 165 miles N.E. from N\u00e1gp\u00far, 108 miles S.E. from S\u00e1g\u00e1r, and 221 miles S.W. from Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d. The name has been derived from the Arabic word for peak (\u062c\u0628\u0644); but though this derivation derives a certain plausibility from the situation of the town in a rocky basin, it is incorrect, as in an old inscription, now in the N\u00e1gp\u00far museum, the original name of Jabalp\u00far is given as J\u00e1valt-pattana. The facilities for damming up water, afforded by the numerous gorges and declivities of the surrounding rocks, have been taken advantage of so as to surround the town with a series of lakes and reservoirs, which, shaded by the fine trees which are here so numerous, and bordered by fantastic rocks and massy boulders, give a very diversified character to the environs. The town itself is modern, and contains no monumental buildings, but it is well laid out, and bears every evidence of progress and prosperity. The principal streets are wide and regular, and contain numerous dwellings, suited to an affluent middle class. There are several fine places in which markets are held, and the public buildings, though not large or magnificent, are well situated, and generally constructed with some taste. At the entrance to the town is a prettily laid-out public garden, and near its centre is a fine tank, surrounded by groups of temples. Altogether Jabalp\u00far will well repay a visit, though it must be regarded for the present as in a state of transition. The\ncompletion of the two railway systems, connecting the Eastern and Western capitals of India via Jabalpur, can hardly fail to raise the commercial importance of the latter, already considerable. The population is almost entirely Hind\u00fa, not more than five per cent. being Mohammadans. All trades are followed, but the principal traffic is an exchange of grain and forest produce against piece-goods and salt. The manufactures are insignificant, and the community may be regarded as essentially a trading one. The town trade for 1868-69 is given below:\n\n| Name of Article                  | Imports |          | Exports |          |\n|----------------------------------|---------|----------|---------|----------|\n|                                  | Quantity| Value    | Quantity| Value    |\n| Cotton                           | 8,470   | 1,87,547 | 3,784   | 79,894   |\n| Sugar and gur                    | 69,021  | 5,67,124 | 11,965  | 1,01,814 |\n| Salt                             | 33,157  | 2,65,386 | 5,995   | 47,960   |\n| Wheat                            | 198,498 | 5,69,219 | 1,905   | 5,715    |\n| Rice                             | 72,796  | 3,80,167 | 3,649   | 15,842   |\n| Other edible grains              | 92,577  | 2,46,280 | 3,396   | 9,422    |\n| Oil-seeds of all descriptions    | 30,144  | 90,690   | 2,024   | 6,072    |\n| Metals and hardware              | 5,945   | 2,28,416 | 1,281   | 89,113   |\n| English piece-goods              | 4,864   | 4,86,800 | 1,249   | 1,24,900 |\n| Miscellaneous European goods      | 6,736   | 3,16,809 | 1,114   | 55,700   |\n| Country cloth                    | 2,680   | 1,60,800 | 585     | 35,100   |\n| Lac                              | 9,548   | 84,052   | 7,824   | 74,896   |\n| Tobacco                          | 10,437  | 94,758   | 2,937   | 26,924   |\n| Spices                           | 14,327  | 2,24,276 | 3,942   | 61,554   |\n| Country stationery               | 969     | 15,504   | 53      | 848      |\n| Silk and silk cocoons            | 7       | 11,200   | 2       | 3,200    |\n| Dyes                             | 1,448   | 45,450   | 255     | 7,690    |\n| Hides and horns                 | 1,020   | 16,320   | 575     | 9,200    |\n| Opium                            | 39      | 24,960   |        |         |\n| Wool                             | 327     | 6,540    | 1       | 20       |\n| Timber and wood                 | 56,574  | 28,287   | 100     | 50       |\n| Ghee and oil                     | 901     | 1,80,574 | 1,769   | 85,840   |\n| Cocoanuts                        | 2,849   | 56,646   | 1,128   | 21,656   |\n| Miscellaneous                     | 46,167  | 2,77,002 | 6,681   | 40,086   |\n\nTotal: 669,501 45,14,757 62,214 8,01,996\n\n| No.                              |         |          |\n|----------------------------------|---------|----------|\n| Sheep                            | 38,923  | 1,16,754 |\n| Horses                           | 1,120   | 10,458   |\n\nTotal: 40,043 1,27,212\n\nGrand Total: 46,41,969 8,01,996\nThe civil station and cantonment are divided from the city by a small stream called the Umft. Although the site is regarded as unhealthy for Europeans, owing to the existence of a swampy hollow below the high ground on which their houses are built, the mildness of the climate and the variety of the scenery render the station attractive, and, combined with its situation, have raised the question whether the Capital of India might not suitably be located here. It may be hoped that the measures now in progress for draining the swamp will effectually remove the unhealthiness which is now the only drawback to Jabalp\u00far. The regular civil community comprises a Divisional Commissioner and his office, the ordinary district staff, the supervisors of the Thug school of industry and of a central jail, a branch of the Church of England Mission, who have good schools here, some mercantile residents, and a large body of railway officials. The Bank of Bengal has a branch here. There is already a church, and a larger one is being built. The garrison consists of a battery of artillery, the head-quarters and six companies of a regiment of European infantry, a regiment of Native infantry, and a squadron of Native cavalry. The school of industry, where Thug and Dacoit approvers and their families are employed in one of the largest manufactories of tents and carpets in India, is worth visiting.\n\nJABERA'\u2014A village in the Jabalp\u00far district, on the road to S\u00e1gar, thirty-nine miles north-west of Jabalp\u00far. The population is chiefly agricultural, but knives are to some extent manufactured. The government school here is well attended.\n\nJAGDALPU'R\u2014The principal town of Bastar, and the residence of the raja and the chief people of the dependency. It is distant about one hundred and eighty miles east from Sironch\u00e1. The place is small for the capital of a state like Bastar, and is a mere collection of grass huts, surrounded by a mud wall and deep ditch, one face of which is on the Indr\u00e1vati river, here a small stream about one hundred yards wide. There are no temples or buildings of any size or pretensions. Outside the walls are the suburbs, where the Mohammadans chiefly reside. A large tank lies close to the town. The country is open, well cultivated, and dotted with villages and groves. Jagdalp\u00far is only forty miles from Jaip\u00far, the capital of the Jaipur state, where there is an assistant agent subordinate to Vizagapatam, a police officer, and a strong police force.\n\nJAGMANDAL\u2014A hilly forest tract in the Mandla district, having an area of about fifty-three square miles. Teak is found growing here along the range of hills separating the valleys of the Hilon and the Buhner from that of the Moti\u00e1ri, but the forest has been much exhausted, and will require long rest.\n\nJAISINGHNAGAR\u2014The principal place in a tract of the same name in the S\u00e1gar district, about twenty-one miles south-west of S\u00e1gar. It contains 606 houses and 2,555 inhabitants, and is said to have been founded by one R\u00e1ja Jai Singh, the ruler of Garh Pihr\u00e1 or Old S\u00e1gar, about 180 years ago. He built a fort, which may be seen still, for the protection of the surrounding country from the small predatory chiefs, who then existed in large numbers. At the cession of S\u00e1gar to the British in 1818 this tract formed part of the territory made over, and in 1826 was assigned as a residence for Rukm\u00e1 B\u00e1\u00ed, one of the widows of \u00c1'pa S\u00e1hib, the last Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 ruler of S\u00e1gar. The village is tolerably prosperous and flourishing, and though no trade of any importance is carried on in it, it has two weekly markets\u2014on Mondays and Fridays. The sales consist of grain, cloths, and provisions of various kinds. Two village schools have been established here\u2014one for boys, and the other for girls.\nJAL\u2014JA'M\n\nJALAL'KHERA'\u2014A town in the N\u00e1gp\u00far district, situated about fourteen miles west of K\u00e1tol, near where the J\u00e1m joins the Wardh\u00e1, here about one hundred yards wide. The population numbers 3,396 persons, mostly cultivators. Here are the remains of a large fort to which tradition assigns a Gaul\u00ed origin, and for nearly two square miles around the present village are to be found traces of the old town. It is said that at one time this place had 30,000 inhabitants, but that it was ruined by the ravages of a band of lawless Path\u00e1ns, who were but nominally subject to the Niz\u00e1m. It is probable that Jal\u00e1lkher\u00e1 with A'mner on the right or Ber\u00e1r bank of the river, once formed a single large city.\n\nJALGA'ON\u2014A fine agricultural village in the Wardh\u00e1 district, six miles north-west of A'rv\u00ed, and forty miles distant from Wardh\u00e1, containing 2,000 inhabitants, and paying a land revenue of Rs. 4,000. The inhabitants are chiefly cultivators, with a few weavers. The lands are well watered from over ninety wells, and the village contains p\u00e1n and other gardens. A market is held here twice a week\u2014on Tuesdays and Sundays, and there is a village school.\n\nJA'M\u2014A river in the Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 district. It rises amongst the hills which separate the Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 and Bet\u00fal districts, about four miles from Seg\u00e1on, and runs directly to the east, passing the town of P\u00e1ndhurn\u00e1; thence it winds itself among the hills between that and Mohg\u00e1on and falls into the Kanhn\u00e1n, of which it is one of the chief tributaries, near the town of Lodh\u00edkher\u00e1.\n\nJA'MBULGHATA'TA'\u2014A village in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, situated seven miles north-east of Chim\u00far. The largest market in the district is held here every Tuesday and Wednesday, and is numerously attended by traders from the surrounding districts. The chief Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 products sold are cotton-cloths and iron. About a mile from the village are extensive quarries of soapstone, which have been worked rather more than a hundred years. They are at present in the hands of three families of stone-cutters, who employ hired labour to aid in digging; and about fifty cart-loads of stone are annually quarried and fashioned into bowls and platters. Close to these quarries are others of a very fine black serpentine. They were worked for three years by Raghoj\u00ed III, who employed on them, for eight months out of twelve, on fixed wages, about 250 persons, the stone being principally used in the construction of a temple at N\u00e1gp\u00far. On Raghoj\u00ed's death the establishment was discharged; and the quarries have subsequently fallen in. The main excavation is an irregular oval of about thirty-eight feet by sixty feet; and the cost of clearing away the debris is roughly estimated at Rs. 5,000. The surrounding soil is red or sandy, with a considerable quantity of quartz cropping up, and some little laterite. Octroi is levied here, and with the funds thus raised a fine well, having an excellent spring, has been constructed; and a market-place will shortly be commenced. A police outpost is stationed at the village.\n\nJA'MNI'\u2014A village in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, situated thirty-two miles north of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1, under the eastern slopes of the Chim\u00far hills, and on the brink of a large artificial lake. Dense forest shuts in both lake and village, rendering the spot as picturesque as it is unhealthy for strangers. The Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 and Chim\u00far road passes by J\u00e1mn\u00ed, and a police outpost is located here for the protection of travellers.\n\nJA'MRI'\u2014A small zam\u00ednd\u00e1ri or chiefship in the Bhand\u00e1ra district, north of the Great Eastern Road, and close to S\u00e1k\u00f3lf. It consists of four villages, with an aggregate area of 9,811 acres, of which only 707 are cultivated. The chief is a Gond, and the inhabitants belong chiefly to that class. All the\nvillages are small, and the cultivation is very imperfect. There is some fine timber of the unreserved kind, from the sale of which the owner obtains a moderate income.\n\nJA'NA'LA'\u2014A village situated eight miles south-west of M\u00fal, in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, under a spur of the M\u00fal hills. It possesses a magnificent tank, the water of which, however, is deleterious to strangers.\n\nJA'NJGIR\u2014A small town in the Bil\u00e1sp\u00far district, thirty miles north-east of Bil\u00e1sp\u00far, and formerly a favourite resort of the Ratanp\u00far r\u0101j\u00e1s about five hundred years ago, still stands in a remarkably complete condition. It is perhaps the best specimen of ancient architecture in the district, and the minute and quaintly sculptured images which crowd its base possess considerable interest. In its vicinity is an immense tank.\n\nJHA'RA'PA'PRA'\u2014A chiefship in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, forty-four miles north-east of Wair\u00e1gahr. It contains thirty-three villages.\n\nJHARPAT\u2014A broad, shallow stream in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, which rises a few miles north-east of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1, and falls into the Vir\u00e1l opposite the Path\u00e1npur\u00e1 gate at Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1.\n\nJHILMILA'\u2014A village in the Jabalp\u00far district, about nine miles to the north of Kundam. In the neighbourhood are a number of iron furnaces, and the jungle has been entirely destroyed by the charcoal-burners. The country between Jhilmil\u00e1 and Kundam is wild and picturesque, but there is no valuable timber in it.\n\nJIGARGUNDA'\u2014The chief village of the Chintalm\u00e1r estate of Bastar. The zam\u00edn\u1e0d\u00e1r resides here. It is distant about sixty miles from Dumagudem, on the route from that place to Bastar. The population consists of Ko\u00eds and Telingas, and is estimated at about three hundred souls.\n\nJOGA' or JOGI'GARH\u2014Thirteen miles west of Handi\u00e1 in the Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d district. Here is a Path\u00e1n fort in perfect condition, very picturesquely situated upon an island in the stream of the Narbad\u00e1. It probably dates from the time of A'lamg\u00edr.\n\nJONK\u2014A stream which, taking its rise in Khari\u00e1r, flows northward through Bor\u00e1s\u00e1mbar and Phuljh\u00e1r, forms the boundary on the west between Phuljh\u00e1r and H\u00e1ip\u00far, and falls into the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed near Seor\u00ednar\u00e1\u00edn.\n\nJU'JHA'R\u2014An old village which formerly gave its name to a pargana in the Damoh district. It is prettily situated on the left bank of the Bairm\u00e9, about twelve miles east of Damoh. The country in the neighbourhood is undulating, and there is a small waterfall near the village.\n\nJUNONA'\u2014A village in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, situated seven miles east of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 and six miles north of Ball\u00e1lp\u00far, with which latter place it is supposed to have been connected during its occupation as the capital of the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 kingdom. It possesses a very fine tank, on the stone embankment of which stand the remains of an ancient palace, and in its rear are traces of a wall four miles in length. In communication with the tank is an elaborate system of under-channels, some of which have evidently been injured, as a large volume of water now escapes by them.\nKAIMUR\u2014A detached portion of the Vindhyan range, commencing near Katangi in the Jabalpur district, and running parallel with the Bh\u00e1nrer hills for a distance of more than a hundred miles. After forming the south-eastern boundary of the Maihir valley it takes a turn to the east, compelling the river Son to a similar course. In places this range almost disappears, being only marked by a low rocky chain, and it never rises in these provinces many hundred feet above the plain.\n\nKAIMURI\u2014A large village in the Jabalpur district. It is situated on the Hiran, five miles from Katangi, nine miles from P\u00e1tan, and nineteen miles to the north-west of Jabalpur. The village belongs to an Ahir chief, who owns a good deal of land hereabouts, and is tenth in descent from Ch\u00far\u00e1man, the founder of the family. The river is fordable here.\n\nKALIBHIT Taluks\u2014A hilly tract in the Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d district, about eighty miles in length by twenty in breadth. A portion of it has been reserved by the Forest department; but although the wood is plentiful, it is at present of small scantling.\n\nKALIBHIT\u2014A state forest of some thirty square miles in extent, about fifteen miles south of Hard\u00e1, and extending from the Ganj\u00e1l to the Gulf river in the Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d district.\n\nKALLER\u2014A village in the Upper God\u00e1v\u00e1ri district, situated on the left bank of the Sabari, twenty-four miles above its confluence with the God\u00e1v\u00e1ri. The population consists of Ko\u00eds and Telingas. The Sabari is navigable by boats from this point downwards, and there is some traffic in lac, honey, wax, galls, and timber by this route.\n\nKALMESWAR\u2014A flourishing town in the N\u00e1gpur district, fourteen miles west of N\u00e1gpur. It is built on a plain of black soil lying low, with a bad natural drainage. The country to the north and west is very fertile, but towards N\u00e1gpur it is sterile and stony. In the gardens west of the town opium, sugarcane, and tobacco are raised. There is a very considerable trade in grain, oil-seeds, and country cloth. The pressing of oil-seeds is also carried on to a great extent, as many as eighty mills being kept continually at work. Cloth is the staple manufacture; it is of medium quality, and is mostly sent to be sold at Kaundanp\u00far and other places in Ber\u00e1r. The imports of agricultural and manufactured products for the year 1868-69 amounted in value to Rs. 10,27,146, and the exports to Rs. 2,56,753. The proceeds of the octroi duties have been laid out to great advantage. The committee have made a handsome and commodious market-place, and from this have opened wide metalled roads towards N\u00e1gpur, K\u00e1tol, Dh\u00e1pew\u00e1r\u00e1, and Mohp\u00e1. Facing the market-place on one side are the police station and school-house, and a sar\u00ed is to be added. On the other side are excellent shops belonging to the wealthier traders.\n\nIn the centre of the town, on elevated ground, is the old fortress, now the residence of the village proprietor. It is said to have been built by a Hind\u00fa family from Delhi, which in the time of Bakht Buland, the Gond r\u00e9j\u00e1 of Deogarh, maintained, for the royal service, a force of four hundred infantry and one hundred cavalry. Family quarrels and Pindh\u00e1r\u00ed raids reduced them from the dignified position which they had continued to maintain, even after the accession of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, and the village has now passed into the hands of a Kunb\u00ed family.\nKALUMBE or KALU'MAR\u2014The highest peak in the Bh\u00e1nrer range of hills in the Jabalpur district. It is in the neighbourhood of Katangi. Altitude 2,544 feet; latitude 23\u00b0 27' 58\"; longitude 78\u00b0 46' 51\".\n\nKA'MEN\u2014A stream in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, which rises near the R\u00e1nj\u00ed hills, and after a generally westerly course of twenty-five miles falls into the Wain-gang\u00e1 a little above Garhchiroli.\n\nKAMTARA' NA'LA'\u2014A state forest of about twenty-five square miles in area, in the R\u00e1jp\u00far district, on the banks of an affluent of the Jonk river. It is heavily wooded with s\u00e1l. It is proposed to add to it by lease two adjoining tracts of similar character, which belong to the Deor\u00ed and Kauri chiefs.\n\nKA'MTHA'\u2014An estate in the Bhand\u00e1ra district, consisting of 207 villages, with an extent of about 503 square miles, two-fifths of which are under cultivation. It was originally conferred, more than a century ago, on a Kunb\u00ed family. They rebelled against the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of N\u00e1gp\u00far in 1818, on which their lands were confiscated, and granted to the ancestor of the present chief, a Lodh\u00ed, whose family, by payment of heavy fines, have since acquired the privilege of holding in zam\u00edn-d\u00e1r\u00ed tenure or chiefship. There is only one town on the estate, that of K\u00e1mth\u00e1, but there are several large and flourishing villages tenanted by cultivators, chiefly of the Lodh\u00ed and Ponw\u00e1r castes. The estate is a rich one, and the quit-rent payable to Government amounts to Rs. 46,799. The chief has considerable local influence.\n\nKA'MTHA'\u2014A town in the Bhand\u00e1ra district, about sixty miles to the north-east of Bhand\u00e1ra. The population amounts to 2,661 souls, mostly agriculturists, as there is little or no Trade. The zam\u00edn-d\u00e1r\u00ed or chief has a handsome residence here, surrounded by a wall and moat. The conservancy of the town is provided for by him, and a large dispensary has been built at his sole expense. The government buildings are a good school-house, a district post-office, and a police station-house.\n\nKA'MTHI' (KAMPTEE)\u2014A large town and cantonment in the N\u00e1gp\u00far district, nine miles north-east of N\u00e1gp\u00far, on the right bank of the river Kanh\u00e1o, immediately below the junction of that river with the Pench and the Kol\u00e1r. The cantonment proper, that is to say the military lines and b\u00e1zars, extends in one long narrow line along the river, and is laid out on the principle of a camp, except that the cavalry are on the extreme left instead of on the right. The town is a little distance south-east of the cantonment, and separated from it by an extensive parade-ground. The whole cantonment\u2014which, besides the military lines and the town, includes a considerable area of cultivated land\u2014is in the shape of a trapezium, having for its longest side the river bank. The total area is 4,598 acres, or about seven square miles. Both cantonment and town present a remarkably neat and tidy appearance. The roads are particularly well kept. The main thoroughfare through the cantonment is a handsome broad line of road, extending from the artillery lines on the extreme right up to the cavalry lines on the left, about four miles long. The appearance of the cantonment is rendered agreeable and cheerful by the avenues lining the roads, and by the neatly-kept gardens and compounds surrounding each bungalow. The bungalows themselves are generally thatched, and poor in appearance, though there are some good houses. During the monsoon fine views are to be obtained of the reaches up and down the river. The town is well laid out, and built in regular streets at right angles to each other. The streets are broader and better drained than is usual in this part of the country. The total number of houses is\n8,129, of which 1,960 are of stone or brick with flat masonry roofs, and 5,820 are of mud with tiled roofing. The walls of these last are coated with white or coloured plastering. The cantonment used to be considered unhealthy. This reputation, however, probably resulted from the mortality amongst the troops in by-gone times, before the late improvements in barrack accommodation and in sanitary arrangements had been attempted. Of late years the death-rate has very greatly decreased. The supply of water is chiefly from the Kanhan, but there are besides a large artificial tank and 360 wells.\n\nMunicipal affairs are managed by two separate committees, each of which has its separate functions. The committees consist of non-official Native, as well as of ex-officio English members. The president is the Brigadier-General commanding the force. Municipal improvement of all sorts has been continuously maintained for many years past. Great attention has always been paid to the roads. The most recent improvements are an excellent masonry tank, constructed partially at the expense of Banslal Abirchand Rai Bahadur, the most influential native resident of K\u00e1mthi; the Temple Gardens\u2014a place of public recreation, tastefully laid out; an excellent sarai for travellers, and a large central market-place. The town has its dispensary, its schools, and its dharmasalas for travellers. In the cantonment there is a large public building used for municipal meetings, station theatre, public receptions, &c. The Protestant church (built in 1833) is a commodious structure. There is a Roman Catholic establishment of the order of St. Francis de Sales, with its convent and large church. There are five Mohammadan mosques and seventy Hind\u00fa temples. The total population, inclusive of military, is as follows:\n\n| Adult males | 20,382 |\n| Do. females | 14,818 |\n| Male infants | 8,317 |\n| Female do. | 7,413 |\n| **Total** | **50,930** |\n\nOf these, 2,011 are Europeans or Eurasians.\n\nThe Brigadier-General commanding the force is the chief civil executive as well as military authority in the cantonment. The Cantonment Magistrate is the civil judge as well as magistrate.\n\nThe present military force, which is a first class brigade command belonging to the Madras establishment, consists of three batteries of artillery, a regiment of Madras cavalry, a regiment of European infantry, and a regiment and a half of Madras Native infantry.\n\nThe trade of the town is large and flourishing, though there are no manufactures save a little coarse cloth. The greatest amount of business done is in grain and oil-seeds of all sorts, country cloth, salt, European piece and miscellaneous goods. There are also a considerable trade in cattle, and a brisk traffic in wood, which is floated down the rivers Kanhan, Pench, and Kol\u00e1r, and sold here. The trade of the town has been registered for some years. In the year 1868-69 the declared value of the imports of K\u00e1mthi was Rs. 59,50,830; of its exports Rs. 18,76,069. It will be obvious that so large a trade as this does not depend on the supplies for troops alone. The fact is that during the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 rule traders flocked to K\u00e1mthi on account of the immunity which they\nenjoyed within the cantonment from the taxation to which they would have been subjected anywhere else in the N\u00e1gp\u00far province. The grain trade is almost entirely in the hands of the M\u00e1rw\u00e1ris.\n\nThe history of the place dates only from the establishment of the cantonment under Brigadier-General Adams in 1821. Previous to that year there were no habitations here, except one or two hamlets on the banks of the river. But on the other side of the river, where the village of old K\u00e1mth\u00ed now stands, there are some ruins indicating the former existence of a small town.\n\nKANDELI\u2019\u2014A town in the Narsinghp\u00far district, situated one mile from Narsinghp\u00far, on the east bank of the Singri n\u00e1l\u00e9, which divides the two towns. The government offices and houses of the European community are in Kandeli, but the head-quarters station is commonly known by the name of Narsinghp\u00far. Under the Gond rule Kandeli was a little village belonging to the Singhp\u00far subdivision, where the subordinate governing authority resided. Now, having become the head-quarters of the district, it is a rising town, with a population, apart from Narsinghp\u00far, of nearly 5,000 souls. The Railway will have a station here, which will add to its importance and commerce. The only manufacture is that of common native cloth.\n\nKANHA\u2019N\u2014A river rising in the S\u00e1tpur\u00e9 hills in the Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 district. Taking a south-easterly direction it winds through a series of small hills in the Ghargajgarh forests, and after passing close to the old Deogarh fort, now in ruins, it continues the same course until it reaches R\u00e1m\u00e1kon\u00e1 on the road to N\u00e1gp\u00far, where it takes a turn more directly south, until near Lodhikher\u00e1 it resumes its south-easterly course. Just below Lodhikher\u00e1 it is joined by the J\u00e1m\u2014a large stream emerging from the Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 district into the highly cultivated plain of N\u00e1gp\u00far, and joining the Pench a little above the military cantonment of K\u00e1mth\u00ed, the united streams flow on until they fall into the Waingang\u00e1 below Bhand\u00e1ra. A magnificent stone bridge is now being constructed over the Kanh\u00e1n at K\u00e1mth\u00ed, at a cost of about \u00a380,000. The length of the river from its source to the junction of the united streams with the Waingang\u00e1 may be about 140 miles.\n\nKANHARGA\u2019ON\u2014A small estate in the Bhand\u00e1ra district, which, though consisting of one village only, ranks as a chiefship. The area amounts to 1,404 acres, but very little is cultivated. Around the former village site are very fine trees\u2014mango, p\u00edpal, tamarind, and date palm\u2014including a magnificent banyan of great age, and covering a considerable surface. The chief is a R\u00e1jput.\n\nKANHERI\u2019\u2014A hill in the Bhand\u00e1ra district, about eighteen miles to the south-east of Bhand\u00e1ra. It is some three hundred feet above the level of the plain, and quite barren. It yields some good building stone, and in portions of it hone-stones and white soft stone for pottery are found.\n\nKA\u2019NHI\u2019WA\u2019RA\u2019\u2014A considerable village in the Seoni district, situated sixteen miles to the east of Seoni on the road to Mandla. A good deal of pottery is made here.\n\nKANJIA\u2019\u2014The principal place of a tract of the same name on the northern frontier of the S\u00e1g\u00e1r district, sixty-nine miles north-west of S\u00e1g\u00e1r. It is supposed to be very old, but the first of its rulers of which anything is now known was a Bundel\u00e1 chief named Deb\u00ed Singh. To his son Sh\u00e1hji is attributed the fort, which is still standing on an eminence to the south of the village.\nHis descendants remained undisturbed till A.D. 1726 when one, by name Vikram\u00e1jit, was attacked and defeated by Hasan-ulla Kh\u00e1n, naw\u00e1b of Kurw\u00e1\u00ed, a neighbouring state. Vikram\u00e1jit fled to Pipr\u00e1\u00ed, a small village situated on the extreme northern boundary of the tract under mention, where a descendant of his, by name Amrit Singh, is still living on a rent-free estate of five villages. In the year 1758 the Peshw\u00e1's army defeated the Naw\u00e1b of Kurw\u00e1\u00ed and drove him out of Kanji\u00e1. The Peshw\u00e1 then conferred the tract on one of his officers, by name Khand\u00e9r\u00e1o Trimbak. His successor, R\u00e1mchandra Ball\u00e1l (otherwise R\u00e1m Bh\u00e1\u00fa), in A.D. 1818, when S\u00e1g\u00e1r was ceded to Government by the Peshw\u00e1, at once gave up Kanji\u00e1 and Malh\u00e1rgarh, a neighbouring tract, and in return the tract of It\u00e1w\u00e1 was bestowed on him (see \"It\u00e1w\u00e1\"). In the same year Kanji\u00e1 was made over by Government to Sind\u00eda, under whom it remained till the year 1860, when an extensive exchange of territory was effected, and it was incorporated with the S\u00e1g\u00e1r district. In the beginning of the mutiny in 1857 a party of Bundel\u00e1s came down from the adjoining native states upon Kanji\u00e1, expelled Sind\u00eda's officer, and forcibly set up the abovementioned Amrit Singh as their ruler. He, however, only remained in that position a few days, and was glad to get away from his dangerous elevation. The Bundel\u00e1s plundered the town and laid waste the country, but after remaining about eight months, decamped on hearing of the advance of Sir Hugh Rose from R\u00e1hatgarh.\n\nAlthough this tract bears evidence of possessing great capabilities, yet its present condition is anything but satisfactory. The inhabitants were greatly over-taxed under Native rule, it being well known that in several instances officers considered deserving of reward were sent for a short term to Kanji\u00e1, with liberty to get whatever they could from the inhabitants, paying only the fixed revenue to the government. The greater part of the town is now in ruins, chiefly owing to the visit of the Bundel\u00e1s mentioned above. Its condition has, however, begun to improve since the new settlement of the land revenue, and much further development may be looked for. A weekly market is held on Tuesdays; to which nothing, however, but the necessaries of life are brought for sale. The fort stands on a considerable eminence to the south of the town. It is square, with a tower at each corner, and encloses a space of about two acres, covered for the most part with ruined buildings. A boys' school has been established here.\n\nKA'NKER\u2014A chiefship situated to the south of the R\u00e1\u00edp\u00far district, bounded on the north by the \"kh\u00e1lsa\" pargana of Dhamtari, on the east by that of Seh\u00e1w\u00e1, on the south by the feudatory state of Bastar, and on the west by the P\u00e1n\u00e1b\u00e1ras zamind\u00e1r\u00ed belonging to the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, by that of Lohar\u00e1 belonging to R\u00e1\u00edp\u00far, and by the kh\u00e1lsa pargana of B\u00e1lod. The whole of it is more or less hilly, and except in the eastern portion, along the valley of the Mah\u00e1n\u00e1d\u00ed, there are few fertile plains of any extent, and even in the latter valley a large portion of the soil is shallow, and a considerable area is occupied by outcropping masses of rock and scattered boulders. It is divided into eleven t\u00e1lukas, and contains 444 villages. Except in the K\u00e1nker t\u00e1luka, which comprises the whole of the Mah\u00e1n\u00e1d\u00ed valley, the prosperous villages are few and far between, and the habits of the population are shown by the state of the jungles, which are almost ruined by d\u00e1hya cultivation, large tracts of country being entirely denuded of all vegetation, except under-sized stunted trees, while the soil is for the most part so poor as to render continuous cultivation unprofitable, if not impossible. The total area of the estate is about\n1,000 square miles, perhaps rather more than less, of which about one-third is cultivated; and the total population amounts to 36,144 souls, at the rate of about thirty-six per square mile. Of these some 21,176 are Gonds.\n\nThe zamind\u00e1r belongs to a very old Rajput family, and according to tradition his ancestors were raised to the throne by a vote of the people. During the reign of the Haihai Bans\u00ed dynasty in Chhattisgarh the K\u00e1nker zamind\u00e1rs seem to have been both prosperous and powerful, as in the old Haihai Bans\u00ed records K\u00e1nker is reckoned among the feudatory dependencies, such as Bastar, Sambalp\u00far, &c., while at the same time the r\u00e1j\u00e1s held the large and fertile kh\u00e1lsa pargana of Dhamtar\u00edf.\n\nThe total revenue of the estate (1868) is as follows:\n\n| Revenue Type          | Amount |\n|-----------------------|--------|\n| Land revenue          | Rs. 6,213 |\n| Cesses and excise     | ,, 2,726 |\n| Forest revenue        | ,, 1,021 |\n| **Total**             | **Rs. 9,960** |\n\nKA'RANJA'\u2014A small octroi town in the A'rv\u00ed tahsil of the Wardh\u00e1 district, forty-one miles north-west of Wardh\u00e1. It was founded some 260 years ago by Naw\u00e1b Mohammad Kh\u00e1n Ni\u00e1zi of A'sht\u00ed. The site is on high land surrounded by hills, but in the valleys between are some fine gardens where opium and sugar are grown. A market-place in the centre of the town, a new school-house, and a good road connecting the town with the highroad from N\u00e1gp\u00far to Amr\u00e1oti, are the principal works carried out from the municipal funds. K\u00e1ranj\u00e1 contains about 3,000 inhabitants\u2014cultivators, traders, and weavers.\n\nKARARGA'ON\u2014A small estate in the extreme south of the Bhand\u00e1ra district, which, though ranking as a zamind\u00e1ri or chiefship, only consists of one village. The area is 1,208 acres, of which one-tenth only is under cultivation. The owners are a poor Mohammadan family.\n\nKA'ROND or KA'LA'HANDI'\u2014A feudatory chiefship attached to the Sambalp\u00far district, and lying between 19\u00b05' and 20\u00b030' of north latitude, and 82\u00b040' and 83\u00b050' of east longitude. It is bounded on the north by the P\u00e1t\u00e1na state, on the east by the Jaip\u00far state and the Vizagapatam district, on the south by Jaip\u00far, and on the west by Jaip\u00far, Bindr\u00e1 Naw\u00e1g\u00e1rh, and Khari\u00e1r. The country is thus described by Colonel (then Captain) Elliot in a report submitted in 1856, which will be found printed in No. XXX of the Selections from the Records of the Government of India in the Foreign Department:\n\n\"The general appearance of the K\u00e1rond country answers more nearly to the character given of it in Sir Richard Jenkins' report than what has there been said regarding Bastar, though there is a greater extent of plain than might be supposed on reading his remarks. The country is high, lying near the foot of the main line of the eastern gh\u00e1ts, and partaking of the watersheds both of the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed and Indr\u00e1vati, which last, with several tributaries and sub-tributaries of the first, rise within its limits; it is well supplied with water, and in some parts (as Thu\u00e1m\u00fal, &c.) the soil is enabled to yield two crops of rice within the year. The hills are chiefly plutonic, and independently...\"\nof two or three considerable ranges hereafter to be noticed, detached hills of greater or less size are interspersed throughout the dependency; the light alluvial soil washed from their slopes is rich, fertile, and easily worked, yielding heavy crops of almost every description. Further in the open country the soil approaches more to the character of black cotton soil, mixed with lime nodules, and occasionally alternating with red gravel, but all appears capable of cultivation, and likely to give good returns for labour well expended. The population is thinly distributed however, and the tracts of waste land are extensive, as are also those of land once cultivated but now abandoned. At the same time the villages are numerous and small, and the people appear to be well cared for, though, as in Bastar, and partly for the same reasons, there is no stimulus for them to exert themselves. Their case, however, is better than in Bastar: they are evidently more contented and numerous, and less apprehensive of intercourse. The drawbacks here appear to be, in addition to the universal fault of the cultivator being unable to reap the fruits of his labour, or rest his claims on any stated share of the common property, that, although there are several large villages and many small ones, their communication one with another is exceedingly limited and unfrequent; there are no periodical bazars, and the produce of one village finds its way with difficulty to the next. These causes are the source of stagnation, and much retard the development of the resources of this rich tract. The disposition of the people however, and the good intentions of the raja, give every hope that these hindrances will be gradually and effectually removed, and the country be made to assume that increased appearance of prosperity which it is naturally, from many advantages, so capable of maintaining. The hills are well wooded where the process, called d\u0101hya here, has not cleared the way for cultivation. In some parts, as Thum\u0101l, clearing has taken place to some considerable extent, principally by the hill Khonds, whose fields occupy the slopes and tops of the hills, but which latterly and gradually they appear to be leaving for the plains. This disposition will doubtless increase as they gain confidence in the dwellers in the low country, and be much fostered and encouraged by the establishment of bazars in the various large villages in their neighbourhood, which the raja has at my suggestion proposed to give immediate attention to. The trees most commonly met with in the dependency are in the southern parts; the sarai, so common in Bastar, yielding large quantities of a very useful dammer or resin, and the wood of which possesses the property of not rotting when immersed in water or inserted in the ground, the pillar commonly seen in the middle of tanks in this country being generally of sarai wood; and several kinds of hard woods useful for building purposes, but of no great size. The orange, though not indigenous, is here cultivated in considerable quantities, and produces very fine fruit. I cannot learn from whence it has been introduced; those whom I have asked say from Jaipur and Naurangpur, but I am not aware that the tree is originally a native of those parts, or that the vegetation there differs materially from that of this dependency.\n\n\"The principal range of hills in the K\u0101rond dependency, which is Hills. considerable, is contributed by the Eastern Gh\u0101ts, and, though in some places disconnect- ed, runs from north to south, and rather west through Madanp\u016br, K\u0101rond,\nand L\u00e1nj\u00edgarh, in the south of which last zam\u00ednd\u00e1ri the range divides, the main branch proceeding south through Jaip\u00far to Gunap\u00far; and the other, broad and mountainous, winds towards the west through Korl\u00e1p\u00e1t and Thu\u00e1m\u00fal; again dividing, one branch running west into Naw\u00e1garh Bhendr\u00ed, and the other south to join the original range. It receives names at different points from the villages near its base, the highest part being perhaps that called Nayangiri, near L\u00e1nj\u00edgarh. Small hills are also interspersed throughout the dependency.\n\n\"The rivers in this dependency are for the most part small, and all tributaries of larger rivers. Those most deserving of notice are the Indr\u00e1vat\u00ed, a tributary of the God\u00e1var\u00ed; the Tel, a tributary of the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed; and the Hatt\u00ed, which falls into the Tel.\"\n\n\"The villages of K\u00e1rond are more numerous, and very much exceed in size and condition those of Bastar. The principal town of the dependency, Jun\u00e1garh, is situated on the banks of the Hatt\u00ed river, distant from R\u00e1jp\u00far about 210 miles south-east. It contains nearly five hundred houses, principally of thatch and bamboos; the streets are irregular, each house being separate, with a small enclosure or piece of ground attached; the prevailing system of arrangement tending both to insecurity and the accumulation of dirt. The r\u00e1j\u00e1's house is built of brick and mortar, and in one part consists of two stories with a terraced roof. The town of Bhundesar, the temporary residence of the r\u00e1j\u00e1, in consequence of the cholera having carried off his younger brother about seven years since, is situated about twenty miles to the north-east of Jun\u00e1garh, and contains about two hundred houses. Next in size and importance to Jun\u00e1garh, however, is the town of D\u00e1dp\u00far, about thirty miles to the north-east of it. It contains upwards of four hundred houses of the same construction, the walls being formed of wattled bamboo, plastered on both sides with mud, and the roof thatched with grass. The houses are generally broad and of convenient size, and the material forms a comfortable and substantial habitation. Asurgarh, on a tributary of the Tel river, about fifty miles north-east of Jun\u00e1garh, contains about one hundred houses. L\u00e1nj\u00edgarh, about forty-two miles south-east of Jun\u00e1garh, at the foot of the Nayangiri hills, is the principal town of the zam\u00ednd\u00e1ri of that name, and contains about 150 houses. K\u00e1szp\u00far, one of the principal towns of the Thu\u00e1m\u00fal zam\u00ednd\u00e1ri, situated sixty miles to the south and rather east of Jun\u00e1garh, contains about one hundred houses. Besides these the towns named below are not unworthy of mention:\n\n| Town                  | No. of houses about |\n|-----------------------|---------------------|\n| Khair\u00edpodar           | 200                 |\n| Mah\u00e1lpatn\u00e1            | 100                 |\n| D\u00e1sp\u00far                | 100                 |\n| Chichy\u00e1               | 100                 |\n| Sosi\u00e1                 | 80                  |\n| Kanat                 | 80                  |\n| Kuksar\u00e1               | 60                  |\n| Medinp\u00far              | 60                  |\n| Chilchil\u00e1             | 60                  |\n| Dohg\u00e1on               | 50                  |\n\"The bulk of the population belongs to the hill tribe called Khonds, whose restless disposition seldom allows them to remain long in the same spot, and the greater part of whom pay nothing to Government, and have but little intercourse with its officers.\n\n\"The productions of the K\u00e1rond dependency, though various, are none of them of a very superior quality, or in such quantities as to admit of exportation, the greater part of them being consumed within the limits of the estate. They may be thus enumerated.\u2014Rice, kutk\u00ed, mandi\u00e1, kodo, gurj\u00ed, mung, urad, kandol, kulth\u00ed, sarson, til, erand\u00ed, sugarcane, cotton, and tobacco. Wheat and several kinds of pulse, common in other parts, are not cultivated here, though the soil is admirably adapted for them, and gram is produced to a very limited extent. There appears to be no obstacle to their introduction, further than that they do not form articles of consumption by the inhabitants. Turmeric, fennugreek (meth\u00ed), and most of the vegetables used by the natives are cultivated in abundance. The imports from the west consist of wheat, gram, &c.; from the east, tobacco, salt, cloths, and condiments, as pepper, ginger, assaf\u00f3ctida, &c. Trade is principally carried on by barter, the rupee being the only current coin.\n\n\"The climate of K\u00e1rond is in general good, and presents no peculiarities. Being near the gh\u00e1ts, the rains are regular and abundant, during which season fever prevails, particularly amongst new arrivals and those unaccustomed to the climate and food of the country. The water, however, is good, at least that of the rivers and wells, for a custom obtains here which pollutes the water of the tanks, and renders it unfit for drinking purposes. Universally throughout the dependency the people are in the habit of anointing their bodies with oil and turmeric as a prophylactic against cold and fever, and from washing in the tanks the water becomes so much defiled that persons making use of it for any length of time are very liable to fall sick, as was exemplified in the cases of some of my camp. Though cholera is not unknown, its visits are not frequent, nor its ravages great.\"\n\nBut few changes have taken place since this report was written in 1856. The chief, a R\u00e9jput, has a high character, and administers his state well and successfully.\n\nKARUN\u2014A river which rises in the territory of the chief of K\u00e1nker, and passing the town of R\u00e1ip\u00far joins the Seo not far from Simg\u00e1. It is navigable during the rains, and stores from Calcutta have been landed three miles west of R\u00e1ip\u00far by it. This, however, is practicable only in times of extraordinarily high floods, as the river, as a general rule, is shallow, with a rocky bottom.\n\nKATANGI\u2014The southern revenue subdivision or tahs\u00edl in the Seoni district, having an area of 899 square miles, with 332 villages, and a population of 134,511 according to the census of 1866. The land revenue for the year 1869-70 is Rs. 86,855. It is remarkable for its rice cultivation, and from its proximity to the large commercial centres of K\u00e1mth\u00ed and N\u00e1gp\u00far, finds a good market for its produce.\n\nKATANGI\u2014A small chiefship in the Bil\u00e1sp\u00far district, containing thirty-eight villages, and covering an area of fifty-seven square miles. It adjoins\nBil\u00e1igarh, and is wedged in on one side by the Mah\u00e1n\u00e1di, on the other by the Son\u00e1kh\u00e1n hills. The tract on the whole is fairly level and open, and contains average soil. The cultivated area amounts to 10,814 acres, and the culturable waste to about 15,000 acres. The population is 9,407, or at the rate of 165 per square mile. The chief is a Gond.\n\nKATANGI\u2014The head-quarters of a small chiefship of the same name in the Bil\u00e1sp\u00far district, is situated on the Jonk near its junction with the Mah\u00e1n\u00e1di. The town contains a small and flourishing community of traders and weavers, and a weekly market is held to which all the villagers in the vicinity resort.\n\nKATANGI\u2014A state forest of about 170 square miles extent in the Bet\u00fal district. Commencing from the village of Katang\u00e1 on the Tapt\u00ed it extends westwards to the river Ganj\u00e1l. The chief product is teak, which in many parts grows luxuriantly.\n\nKATANGI\u2014A large but decaying village in the Jabalp\u00far district, situated at the foot of the Bh\u00e1nrer hills, twenty-two miles to the north-west of Jabalp\u00far, on the north side of the Hiran, and on the road to S\u00e1g\u00e1r. Here are a large tank and the remains of some mosques. Many of the inhabitants are Mohammadans, and are said to be the descendants of the soldiers of Akbar and Aurangzeb, both of whom encamped near this place. Katang\u00ed used to be famous for the manufacture of gun-barrels, which were, Thornton says, \"largely exported.\" The place has now 348 houses, and an agricultural population numbering 2,947 souls. There is a government school here.\n\nKA'TOL\u2014The north-western revenue subdivision or tahsil in the N\u00e1gp\u00far district, covering an area of 803 square miles, with 498 villages, and a population of 133,798 according to the census of 1866. The land revenue of the tahsil for 1869-70 is Rs. 2,26,536.\n\nKA'TOL\u2014A town in the N\u00e1gp\u00far district, ten miles north-west of Kon-dh\u00e1l\u00ed and forty miles from N\u00e1gp\u00far, on the left bank of the J\u00e1m, a tributary of the Wardh\u00e1. The population amounts to 4,116 persons, most of whom are agriculturists. A new school building and a market-place have lately been constructed by the local committee. Some attempts too have been made to open out the town by new streets, but the site on which it is built is extremely uneven, and intersected by ravines. Almost all the houses are thatched, and the general aspect of the place is mean. The remains of an old fort are still to be seen overhanging the river banks. There is a curious temple here of very early date, built entirely of layers of sandstone, which must have been quarried many miles off. No mortar is used about it, and the stones have many grotesque carvings. It is called the house of \"Bhaw\u00e1n\u00ed,\" but is without any image, and without any legend, save that of an undefined miraculous origin. Here are the head-quarters of a tahsil subdivision.\n\nKA'TOL\u2014A village in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, situated fourteen miles east-south-east of Segi\u00f3n, and possessing a very fine irrigation-reservoir.\n\nKAURIA\u2014A chiefship attached to the R\u00e1jp\u00far district, consisting of 152 villages. A good deal of the land is poor and uncultivated, and the quit-rent is merely nominal. The zam\u00edn\u00e9d\u00e1r is a Gond by caste. Kauri\u00e1 lies about eighty miles to the east of R\u00e1jp\u00far on the Sambalp\u00far road.\n\nKAURIA\u2014A village five miles to the west of Sleeman\u00e1b\u00e1d, in the Jabalp\u00far district. It now contains 226 houses and 1,262 inhabitants. The tank to the north of the village is said to be very ancient.\nKAURIA'\u2014A large village in the Narsinghpur district, containing 651 houses, with a population of 3,158 souls. It is on the highroad between Jabalpur and Hoshangabad, about two miles from Gadarwara. Its chief importance is derived from the large cotton sales that are transacted in January and February. The resident population are chiefly agriculturists, but there are also some Marwaris and other merchants. The manufactures are insignificant. A good town school exists; and the municipal funds, though small, are sufficient to keep up a conservancy establishment and build drains in the main streets. It belongs to the Raj of Gangai.\n\nKAWARDA'\u2014The largest feudatoryship in the Bilaspur district. It contains an area of 912 square miles; the western half is a network of hills locally known as the Chilpi range, and at their base is situated the cultivated portion of the estate. There are altogether 321 villages, many of which are surrounded by unbroken sheets of cultivation, and contain comfortable and thriving communities. Much of the soil is of first class quality, and cotton is the chief product. The cultivated area is 112,785 acres, and the land fit for cultivation is estimated at 176,000 acres. The population is 69,077, or at the rate of 78 to the square mile. If the plain and hill portions be taken separately, the rate for the former rises to 227 persons per square mile, while the hilly area has only 10. Altogether the estate is in a flourishing condition, and possesses marked capabilities of future development. The chief is a Raj-Gond.\n\nKAWARDA'\u2014The head-quarters of the chiefship of the same name in the Bilaspur district, is situated at the foot of the Satekri range sixty miles west of Bilaspur, and has within the last few years risen into a town, with a population exceeding 5,000 souls, and including many traders and agents for the purchase of lac and cotton from Mirzapur and Jabalpur firms. The houses are generally tiled, an unusual feature in Chattisgarh, and here and there stand prominently forward some imposing structures of masonry. The most conspicuous of these is the residence of the chief, containing several double-storied blocks, from the terraced roof of which the town has a good appearance. The present high priest of the Kabir Panthi sect also lives here, and his presence attracts devotees from all parts of India.\n\nKELJHAR\u2014A town in the Huzur tahsil of the Wardha district, situated about sixteen miles to the N.E. of Wardha on the old Nagpur and Bombay highroad. It is said to occupy the site of an ancient city called Chakranagar, an account of which, and of the demon which preyed on it, is contained in the Hindu sacred book called Bharat. The place contains the remains of a well-built fort, in the gateway of which is a famous idol of Ganpati, in whose honour an annual fair is held on the fifth of Magha Suddha, the month which corresponds with the latter half of January and the first half of February.\n\nKELOD\u2014A town in the Nagpur district, about seven miles north of Saoner on the main road to Chhindwara. It is situated at the foot of the Satpur hills, and has a population numbering 4,303 persons. The municipal funds have been employed in the construction of roads, drains, school and police buildings, and a market square. There are several old-established firms of Marwari money-dealers here, but the business they carry on is mostly local. The chief branch of industry is the manufacture of brass and copper vessels of a good description, which are exported to places as distant as Amravati and Rajpuri. Besides this, the only manufacture is that of rough glass ornaments. Kelod is said to have been founded fourteen generations ago by\nthe ancestors of the present M\u00e1lguz\u00e1r and Desmukh, at the same time that a neighbouring Gaul\u00ed chief formed the extensive old tank at Jaighar near the town. The fort, now falling to decay, seems to have been built in the early Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 period.\n\nKENDA'\u2014A chiefship in the Bil\u00e1spur district, adjoining the L\u00e1ph\u00e1 estate. It covers an area of 298 square miles, of which only 13,655 acres are cultivated. The hilly portion contains some good s\u00e1l forest, and a good deal of lac is exported from here to Mirz\u00e1sipur. The population amounts to 5,162 souls, the average rate being only seventeen to the square mile. The chief belongs to the Kanwar caste.\n\nKENDA'\u2014The head-quarters of a small chiefship of the same name in the Bil\u00e1spur district, situated twenty miles north of Ratanp\u00far on the Bil\u00e1spur and Rew\u00e1 road at the foot of the Vindhyan range of hills.\n\nKEOLA'DA'DAR\u2014A small patch of forest land about ten square miles in extent, situated on the Narbad\u00e1, in the Jabalp\u00far district. It is proposed after survey and further examination to reserve it as a State forest.\n\nKERBANA'\u2014An important village in the Damoh district, on the left bank of the Bi\u00e1s, twenty-four miles north-west of Damoh. It has a population of 1,100 souls. The proprietor is considered to be one of the chief Lodh\u00eds in the Damoh district.\n\nKESLA'BORI'\u2014A village in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, situated under the western slopes of the Chim\u00far hills, ten miles north-north-east of Seg\u00e1o\u0144. It has a considerable area under rice, irrigated by a hill spring, the water of which is stated to be very deleterious to strangers. The village now consists of only a few huts, but the grassy reaches around show that it once was of large size. In the vicinity, at the foot of a precipice, is the R\u00e1md\u00edgh\u00ed pool, hollowed out of the rock, about forty feet in diameter, and of unknown depth; and into this basin falls, during the rains, a considerable stream from the precipice above. Tradition attributes the formation of the pool to R\u00e1ma; and on an eminence above is an ancient temple, in which are two good carvings of a warrior with shield and straight sword. The temple is fast crumbling to ruin; and even the additions to the original structure are said to be more than a century old.\n\nKHAIRA'GARH\u2014The most important of the Chhatt\u00edsgarh feudatory states. It consists of four parganas or subdivisions, with 585 villages, mostly lying in the richest part of the Chhatt\u00edsgarh plain. The original possessions of the family, which is of the R\u00e9j-Gond caste, and descended from the royal family of Garh\u00e1 Mandla, were confined to the small forest tract known as Kholw\u00e1, at the foot of the S\u00e1l\u00e9tekr\u00ed range. Subsequently they obtained extensive grants in 1818, both from the Mandla princes and from the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 rulers of N\u00e1gpur. Two of the principal passes through the S\u00e1l\u00e9tekr\u00ed range between Chhatt\u00edsgarh and N\u00e1gpur are in the Khair\u00e1garh country, but a different line has been adopted for the Great Eastern Road. The town of Khair\u00e1garh is at the junction of the A'm and the Pipari\u00e1, forty-five miles west by north from R\u00e9jpur. The tribute paid by the Chief to the British Government amounts to Rs. 47,000.\n\nKHAIRI'\u2014A small estate in the Bhand\u00e1ra district, consisting of four villages, with an area of 8,848 acres, of which 679 only are under cultivation. It is situated about eight miles north of S\u00e1kolf on the Great Eastern Road. The chief is a Kunb\u00ed by caste, and the residents are mostly Gonds. The forests on the estate yield a good deal of timber of the inferior kinds, but very little good wood.\nKHAJRI\u2014A small estate in the Bhand\u00e1ra district, which, though consisting of two villages only, ranks as a zam\u00ednd\u00e1r\u00ed or chiefship. The area is 4,359 acres, of which 1,600 are cultivated. The zam\u00ednd\u00e1r is a Halb\u00e1, and the cultivators are Halb\u00e1s and Gonds. Khajr\u00ed is situated about six miles north of Arjun\u00ed, on the Great Eastern Road.\n\nKHAL\u00c1RI\u2014A village situated in the centre of an estate of the same name, in the R\u00e1jpur district, about 13 miles from R\u00e1jpur. Here are four very ancient temples, which tradition attributes to giants of former ages; they are small, but of peculiar construction, and are probably of Jain origin. The stones with which they are built are un cemented, but their disposition is so accurate that the structures have withstood the wear of ages. Khal\u00e1ri has an annual religious fair at the Chaitra Punava, or about the end of March, at which some 3,000 persons attend for the worship of Khal\u00e1ri Devi, to whom is dedicated a small chab\u00fatr\u00e1 at the top of the adjacent hill. The hill is of considerable height, and the extreme summit is crowned by huge granite boulders, which render access to the very top a work of toil; but the trouble is repaid by the extensive view of the surrounding country. It is at the base of these boulders, or on the first plateau, that the fair is held. There is a deep hole in the rock resembling an artificial cistern, which is said to contain a spring, though the appearance of the water is much against this. Khal\u00e1ri was the seat of a kam\u00e1visd\u00e1r, or revenue manager, in the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 times.\n\nKHAMARIA\u2014An ancient village in the S\u00e1g\u00e1r district, only remarkable as having been the first settlement of the Baladeos\u2014a shepherd race who afterwards settled at Rehl\u00ed, one mile to the south. Very little is now known about them.\n\nKHAMARPA\u2019NI\u2014A village in the Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 district, thirty-six miles south-east of Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1. It has a police station-house. It is entirely shut in by thick forests, abounding in teakwood, and is said to be most unhealthy.\n\nKHANDWA\u2014The eastern revenue subdivision or tahsil in the Nim\u00e1r district, having an area of 1,425 square miles, with 377 villages, and a population of 102,568 souls according to the census of 1866. The land revenue for the year 1869-70 is Rs. 82,416.\n\nKHANDWA\u2014The head-quarters and civil station of the district of Nim\u00e1r. It contains 1,219 houses and 9,708 inhabitants. It has a station on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, and here the whole traffic of Central India towards Bombay meets the line. The town is rapidly increasing in importance. The city of Burh\u00e1npur, which used to be the centre of trade between M\u00e1lw\u00e1, the Narbad\u00e1 valley, and the Deccan, is now quite superseded in that position by Khandw\u00e1, and many of the merchants have already transferred their places of business to the latter. There are here a good travellers\u2019 bungalow, and a spacious new sar\u00e1\u00ed, close to the railway station. An extensive range of barracks has also been built as a rest-house for the numerous troops which pass through in the cold season.\n\nKhandw\u00e1 is a place of considerable antiquity. It is mentioned by the Arabian geographer Al Bir\u00fan\u00ed, who wrote early in the eleventh century. In the twelfth century (and probably earlier) it was a great seat of Jain worship, and the modern town is built on a mound which is full of remains of old Jain buildings. Most of the more modern stone-work about the place is built of the hewn blocks dug out of this mound. Many finely carved pillars, cornices, &c.\nmay still be seen lying about, or built into Br\u0101hmanical temples, the walls of the Mar\u0101th\u0101 fort, and other structures. There are four \"kunds\" or water reservoirs, one on each side of the town, surrounded by Sivite temples, all of which are composed of the old Jain stones and carvings. The date A.D. 1132 has been found on those of the Padma Kunda, west of the town. Khandw\u0101 is also mentioned by the historian Farishta as the seat of a local governor of the Ghor\u012b kingdom of M\u0101lw\u0101 in A.D. 1516. It was burnt by Yaswant R\u0101o Holkar in A.D. 1802, and again partially by Tati\u0101 Topi\u0101 in 1858.\n\nThe civil station, two miles east of the town, contains a fine court-house, circuit house, and church, and is the residence of a Deputy Commissioner and the usual civil staff. Travellers for M\u0101lw\u0101 and Central India leave the Great Indian Peninsula Railway here. The road to Indore is now in good repair. The means of transit are either the government mail cart, which runs daily, and carries one passenger and a little luggage, or if a special cart be engaged\u2014which is permitted at all times except when the overland mail is being conveyed\u2014two passengers and a good quantity of personal baggage can be taken. The latter plan has the advantage of allowing the traveller to halt where he likes on the road. The journey to Indore occupies about ten hours. Bullock carts may be hired from Kaly\u0101nj\u012b Seoj\u012b, with relays along the road, and baggage can be sent in the same way. There are no horsed conveyances on the road except the mail cart above mentioned.\n\nKHA'PA'\u2014A town in the N\u0101gp\u016br district, situated on the right bank of the Kanhan river, twenty miles north of N\u0101gp\u016br, with which it is connected by the Chhindw\u0101r\u0101 road as far as P\u0101tans\u0101ng\u012b (fourteen miles), and thence by a main district road (six miles). The total population is 7,876; and the number of houses is 2,471, of which 2,155 are tiled, and the rest thatched. This town, which is one of the most thriving and wealthy in the district, is built on a site high above the river and immediately overhanging it, while on the land side it is completely shut in by fine groves. The late municipal improvements have been extensive. Not to speak of small works, four good metalled roads, drained with masonry channels, converge in the \"Chauk,\" or central market-place, which is lined on all four sides by good substantial buildings, erected by the traders. The dispensary, the school, and police buildings, and a sar\u0101i are also among recent municipal erections. The town is well kept, and its general appearance is now suitable to its wealth and population. The school (where English forms one of the branches of study) has at present 122 pupils. The site is healthy, and well supplied with water, both from the river and from numerous wells. Melons are cultivated to a considerable extent on the sand-banks in the bed of the river. The great manufacture of Kh\u0101p\u0101 is its cotton cloth, which is of good quality and strength, though inferior in texture and dye to that of N\u0101gp\u016br and Ummer. The exports consist chiefly of country cloth; the imports are cotton, wool, and cotton yarn, grain, European goods and hardware, and silk thread. There are several firms here which have large transactions in bills with Puna and other distant cities. The town is said to be ancient, but there is no known event of interest connected with its history.\n\nKHARIA'R\u2014A chiefship attached to the R\u0101jp\u016br district. It is said to have been formed many generations ago out of the P\u0101tn\u0101 state, having been given as a dowry by the P\u0101tn\u0101 chief to his daughter. It is bounded on the north and south by Chhatt\u012bsgarh Proper, on the east by Bor\u0101s\u0101mbar and P\u0101tn\u0101, and on the west by Bindr\u0101 Naw\u0101garh. It is fifty-three miles from north to\nsouth, and thirty-two from east to west. Nearly half of the area is under cultivation. The chief is a Chauh\u00e1n by caste.\n\nKHAROD\u2014An important town in the Bil\u00e1sp\u00far district, about forty miles east of Bil\u00e1sp\u00far, containing a population of 3,000 inhabitants. There are residents here of all trades; and a weekly market is held, which is largely resorted to by the people of the neighbourhood. The origin of the town is unascertainable, but an inscription on an old tablet indicates its existence as long ago as Samvat 902 (A.D. 845). The remains of ancient earthworks, over portions of which the plough has long travelled, show that it was once strongly fortified.\n\nKHAROND\u2014A stream in the Bil\u00e1sp\u00far district, which rises in L\u00e1ph\u00e1, flows east of Ratanp\u00far, and after a short career of twenty miles through the Bil\u00e1sp\u00far pargana is absorbed in the Arp\u00e1. Except during sudden floods the Kharond is a very insignificant stream.\n\nKHARSAL\u2014A chiefship attached to the Sambalp\u00far district, the nucleus of which was first formed in the reign of Bali\u00e1r Singh, r\u00e9j\u00e1 of Sambalp\u00far, some three hundred years ago, by the grant of the village of Kharsal to one Ud\u00e1m Gond in reward for services rendered. What with subsequent accessions of territory by gift, and with clearing away forest, the chiefship now consists of eighteen villages great and small, with an area of about twelve square miles. It is situated about thirty miles west of the town of Sambalp\u00far. The population by the census of 1866 is computed at 4,298 souls, and is entirely agricultural, belonging chiefly to the Kolt\u00e1, Gond, Saur\u00e1, and Binj\u00e1l (Binjw\u00e1r) castes. Kharsal, the principal village, is very insignificant, the population being only 530. It has, however, a good school, at which some eighty pupils are receiving instruction. The present chief, Mah\u00e1 Singh Sard\u00e1r, is a mere youth. His father, Day\u00e1l Sard\u00e1r, was hanged in 1860 for having taken an active part in the Surendra S\u00e1\u00ed rebellion.\n\nKHATORA\u2014A village in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, situated twenty-six miles north of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1. It was formerly a large town, giving its name to the pargana, but is now a mere cluster of Gond huts in a wide forest. For a considerable distance round Khat\u00f3r\u00e1 are reaches of grass unbroken by trees, showing where cultivated ground existed at no remote period; and there are the remains of a considerable stone fort with a moat, and double lines of defences. Near one of the bastions is the tomb of Ch\u00e1nd Kh\u00e1n, who is much venerated by the Musalm\u00e1ns of the district. The water used here is that of a hill spring, and is most deleterious to strangers.\n\nKHERI\u2014An ancient village in the immediate neighbourhood of Mandla. It was here that the Gond r\u00e9j\u00e1s formerly stationed the small band of cavalry which they kept in their pay. There is a tank here which was constructed in A.D. 1690.\n\nKHIMLA\u00b4SA\u00b4\u2014A town in the S\u00e1g\u00e1r district, about forty-two miles north-west of S\u00e1g\u00e1r, fifty miles south-west of Tehr\u00ed, and one hundred and seventy north-east of Oojein. It is a large place, surrounded by a stone wall twenty feet or more in height, with a fort in the centre, but it is ill laid-out, with narrow streets, and the population is only 2,461. It originally belonged to a dependent of the Delhi emperor, but was taken by the R\u00e9j\u00e1 of Pann\u00e1 in A.D. 1696. On the death of his son without heirs in A.D. 1746 the fort and surrounding country were occupied by the representative of the Peshw\u00e1 at S\u00e1g\u00e1r, and were\nby him made over, with S\u00e1gar, to the British in 1818. In July 1857, when the Bh\u00e1mp\u00far raja occupied Khur\u00e1l, he also seized Khiml\u00e1s\u00e1. From the cession in 1818 to the date of the land-revenue settlement in 1834 this town was the head-quarters of a tahsil. In that year, however, the tahsil was moved to Khur\u00e1l by Mr. Fraser, the settlement officer, on account of the latter being in a more central situation, and on the direct route of the salt traffic from Sironj to S\u00e1gar.\n\nKhiml\u00e1s\u00e1 is still one of the principal places in the district, and most of the houses are better built than those of any other town, except S\u00e1gar. A great part of it is, however, now uninhabited, and has been so since the Mud\u00edny, when it was most effectually plundered and laid waste by the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Bh\u00e1mp\u00far and his army. Rows of lofty and well-built houses of two and even more stories in height may now be seen ownerless, and the whole town to a casual observer has a deserted appearance. The space within the walls is sixty-three acres, and that within the fort, which is situated on high ground in the centre and slightly to the west of the town, is five acres. The police station-house occupies some old buildings inside the fort, in which there are also two other remarkable edifices. One\u2014a Mohammadan building\u2014is apparently the burial-place of some saint. It was originally a square structure, surmounted by a lofty dome, each side being about thirty feet in length. The most remarkable portions of it are the side walls, from the ground to the spring of the dome. They consist of enormous slabs of stone about an inch and a half in thickness, placed sideways one over the other, and cut with the most beautiful fretwork designs right through the stone, so that the pattern is visible from both the exterior and interior of the building. These walls are the only part of the building now standing, as the dome has fallen. The other is a Hind\u00fa building, and was apparently a place of the kind known to natives as a \"Shfsh\u00e1 Mahal,\" or glass palace. It is two stories in height, and on the upper floor was an apartment fitted up with mirrors, many traces of which still remain, though the roof has been entirely destroyed. Two schools have been established here\u2014one for boys, and the other for girls. No trade worth mentioning is carried on. A market is held, however, every Sunday, the attendance at which averages four hundred people.\n\nKHOBRA'GARHI.\u2014A river in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district. It rises in the eastern chiefship of Wair\u00e1g\u00e1rh, and flowing westward is joined near the town of Wair\u00e1g\u00e1rh by the Tep\u00e1garhi', which flows from the extreme north. The united streams, sometimes known as the Khobr\u00e1garhi', sometimes as the Vaitochari', fall into the Waingang\u00e1 two miles south of Seoni, after a course of fifty miles.\n\nKHUJJJI.\u2014A small chiefship attached to the R\u00e1ip\u00far district and bordering on N\u00e1ndg\u00e1on. It consists of twenty-seven villages, in a fairly open country, and is situated seventy miles to the south-west of R\u00e1ip\u00far. The chief is a Moham-madan.\n\nKHUTGA'ON\u2014A chiefship in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, twenty miles south-east of Wair\u00e1g\u00e1rh, and containing about fifty villages. It is attached to the Wair\u00e1g\u00e1rh pargana.\n\nKINHI.\u2014A chiefship of recent origin in the B\u00e1l\u00e9gh\u00e1t district. The ancestors of the present zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs were the head herdsmen of the Gond and Bhonsl\u00e1 kings of N\u00e1gp\u00far, and tended the royal flocks in the upland pastures of L\u00e1nji'. The estate in its original form was of considerable value, but now that it is divided into no less than eight shares it is rapidly deteriorating. It contains\nsixty-four villages, and covers 159 square miles, partly above the hills and partly below. The head-quarters village, Kinh\u00ed, is twenty-five miles S.E. of B\u00farh\u00e1.\n\nKIO\u041b\u0410'RI'\u2014A large market village in the Seoni district, situated in an extensive plain not far from the right bank of the B\u00e1ngang\u00e1 (Waingang\u00e1) at the point where it receives the S\u00e1g\u00e1r. Both these rivers are subject to sudden floods, and the village is sometimes submerged. There are here a police station-house and a village school, and the highroad from Seoni to Mandla passes through the village. The population amounts to 1,018 souls.\n\nKIRNAPU'R\u2014An estate in the B\u00e1lg\u00e1h\u00e1t district, consisting of twenty-five villages, with an area of forty square miles. It was bestowed upon Chinn\u00e1 Patel, the once powerful possessor of the K\u00e1mth\u00e1 and surrounding talukas, in 1828, and now forms his sole possession. The population numbers 21,251 souls.\n\nKIRNAPU'R\u2014A town in the B\u00e1lg\u00e1h\u00e1t district, the residence of the zam\u00ednd\u00e1r of Kirn\u00e1p\u00far. It is situated on high ground, about sixteen miles to the south-east of B\u00farh\u00e1. The old temples which are to be found at various parts of the town denote that it is a place of some antiquity. There is a good government school and a police outpost here, and the district post to L\u00e1nj\u00ed passes daily.\n\nKISANGANJ\u2014A village in the Damoh district, about ten miles to the north-west of Damoh, containing 407 houses and a population of 1,100 souls. The holder, who pays no revenue to government, is bound to distribute the income of the village to Gos\u00e1ins and other religious mendicants. There is a government village school here.\n\nKODAMENDHI\u2014A town in the N\u00e1gp\u00far district, situated on the banks of the river Sur, thirty-two miles north-east of N\u00e1gp\u00far, with a population, mostly agricultural, of over 1,000 souls. It is built on a slope closely overhanging the river, and around it are fine groves of mango and tamarind trees, and good gardens. The houses are particularly neat and well-kept for so small a place. The more recent municipal erections are a good school-house, police outpost, sar\u00e1i, and market-place; and a broad street has also recently been made right through the centre of the town. Some coarse cloth is manufactured, which employs about forty looms. The \"gur\" made here is believed to be the best in the district. The town is said to have been founded by one Jam\u00e1l Kh\u00e1n, a Path\u00e1n, a retainer of the Gond prince Bakht Buland, about the year A.D. 1710. But no trace of Jam\u00e1l Kh\u00e1n's family is now to be found. The lands passed many years ago into the possession of near relatives of the late reigning family, and now belong to one of the lineal descendants of that house. A very large cattle and grain market is held here.\n\nKOLABIRA\u2014A chiefship now attached to the Sambalp\u00far district, and created in the reign of Jeth Singh, r\u00e9j\u00e1 of Sambalp\u00far, about A.D. 1760.

The principal villages are Kol\u00e1bir\u00e1 and Raghun\u00e1thpalli; the former has a population of 611 souls, and the latter of 1,080. There is a good school-house at\nKol\u00e1bir\u00e1, where some thirty pupils are receiving instruction. There are also several other schools distributed among the villages. The present chief, Ghanasy\u00e1m, is about thirty years of age; he is the fifth of his line. His grandfather was hanged during the rebellion, and his father died an outlaw. The chiefship was restored to the family after the amnesty.\n\nKONDHA'LI\u2019\u2014A little town in the N\u00e1gpur district, with a population of 3,128 persons.

It consists of eighteen petty villages, with an area of ten or twelve square miles, and a population, chiefly agricultural, of 2,336 souls according to the census of 1866. Rice is the staple produce, but the cultivation is poor and slovenly. About one-half of the area is still covered with jungle. Kor\u00e1b\u00e1g\u00e1 is the largest village, but its population is under three hundred souls. There is, however, a school there. The family was formerly very lawless, and took an active part in the rebellion under Surendra S\u00e9 in 1857 and the subsequent years.\n\nKORA\u2019CHA\u2019\u2014A zam\u00edn d\u00fcr\u00e1 or chiefship on the extreme east of the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, forty miles east of Wair\u00e1g\u00e1rh.

It is situated on a rising ground on the banks of the Hiran, and contains several temples. The place was once of importance, and a large fair was formerly held here. The surrounding country produces a good deal of iron-ore.\n\nKUMHARI'\u2014A village on the road between Damoh and Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, in the Damoh district, thirty miles from Damoh. The forest in the neighbourhood is very dense, and the road from here to J\u00fajh\u00e1r, distant twenty-four miles, is a mere jungle track. Here are an encamping-ground, a police-station, and a sar\u00e1i.\n\nKUNDALPUR'\u2014A village in the Damoh district, situated at the foot of the Bundelk hills, twenty-one miles from Damoh.

It is known for its annual fair in January, which is usually visited by some 20,000 persons, and at which a good deal of traffic is done in cloth, English and Native hardware, spices, and live stock. In the centre of the village is a chab\u00fatr\u00e1, or platform, under a tree, which is the monument to one Gh\u00e1s\u00ed D\u00e1s, a saint among the Kabir Panth\u00eds. An agent from Kaward\u00e1\u2014the head-quarter of the Kabir Panth\u00eds\u2014ordinarily lives here to take care of the monument, and to receive the offerings of sugar, cocoanuts, money, &c. which are made at it.\n\nKURAI'\u2014The north-western revenue subdivision or tahsil in the S\u00e1g\u00e1r district, having an area of 921 square miles, with 546 villages, and a population of 105,517 souls according to the census of 1866. The land revenue for the year 1869-70 is Rs. 1,00,243.\n\nKURAI'\u2014A town in the S\u00e1g\u00e1r district, about thirty-two miles to the north-west of S\u00e1g\u00e1r, in latitude 24\u00b0 1', and longitude 78\u00b0 22'. Here are the head-quarters of a tahsil or revenue subdivision. Kura\u00ed is supposed to have\nbeen occupied very early by the Gaul\u00eds, from whom it passed to the Moham-\nmadan rulers of Delhi. Aurangzeb united the pargana of Kur\u00e1i with that of\nGarol\u00e1, and gave them in jagir to a D\u00e1ng\u00ed chief, who built the fort.\n\nIn the year 1753 Govind Pandit, as the representative of the Peshw\u00e1, took\npossession of Kur\u00e1i also, and appointed a subordinate to its charge. He altered\nand enlarged the fort, and built a temple on the south-west side of it. This he\nisolated with water, supplied from a lake on the south side of the fort, which\nhe had previously excavated. The temple is still in good preservation. He also\nbuilt the present tahsil court-house, dug a large well for a garden inside the\nfort, and improved the town generally. In the year 1818 Kur\u00e1i formed part\nof the country ceded to the British by the Peshw\u00e1. In the beginning of the\nMutiny, viz. in July 1857, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Bh\u00e1npur invested Kur\u00e1i, on which the\nGovernment tahsild\u00e1r, Ahmad Bakhsh, gave up the town and fort, and joined\nthe rebels himself. They placed officers in charge on their own account, who\nremained till February 1858, when the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Bh\u00e1npur and his army were\nbeaten at Barodi\u00e1 Naunagar by Sir Hugh Rose, and fled, taking with them all\nthe officers they had posted at Kur\u00e1i, Kiml\u00e1\u0161\u00e1, &c.\n\nThe town of Kur\u00e1i is remarkably well built, with wide streets and sub-\nstantially-constructed houses. On the north side of the fort there are several\nhandsome and solid Hind\u00fa temples. The principal streets as they now stand\nwere built in the year 1852. The chief trade is in cattle of all sorts. These are\nbrought to the weekly markets, not so much from the adjoining country com-\nprised within the S\u00e1g\u00e1r district, as from the native states of Gwalior, Kurw\u00e1i,\n&c., and especially from the former. The whole of the meat supplied by the com-\nmissariat for the use of the European troops at S\u00e1g\u00e1r, Jabalp\u00far, and Naug\u00e1o\ncomes from here. The country around Kur\u00e1i was for some time much\ndepressed, partly from alleged inequalities in the land-tax, but mainly from the\nravages of the rebels in 1857. Since the new land-revenue settlement there\nhas been marked improvement, and further development may be looked for.\nThe bulk of the population consists of a class of agricultural R\u00e1jputs, called\nD\u00e1ng\u00eds. Next to them the lower castes, such as K\u00e1chh\u00eds and Cham\u00e1s, pre-\nponderate. Town duties have been collected in Kur\u00e1i since the year 1855,\nand from the funds thus raised the town police and conservancy establishment\nare supported. The tahsil is held in an old Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 building inside the fort,\nwhich is in tolerable repair, and of considerable strength. Like most native struc-\ntures of the kind, it consists of round towers connected with curtain walls. It\nencloses a space of eleven acres, and is situated on the north bank of a large\nlake. There are here also a police station-house, a post-office, and three schools,\none for boys and two for girls.\n\nKURAI.\u2014A small village in the Seoni district, on the road to N\u00e1gpur,\ntwenty miles south of Seoni. Here the Northern Road descends the gh\u00e1ts,\nwhich are about seven hundred feet above the plain below. The road falls\ntwo hundred feet at the L\u00e1gh\u00e1t, and 480 feet at the Kur\u00e1i gh\u00e1t. The village\nitself is below the gh\u00e1ts. There are here a travellers' bungalow, a road bungalow,\nan encamping-ground, and a police outpost. The place is said to be very\nunhealthy, and the water unwholesome.\n\nKURUTI.\u2014A river with several branches, rising in the hilly ranges of the\n\u00c1mbg\u00e1o chiefship in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district.

The fort is believed to be the work of the Gonds in the early part of the eighteenth century; it is surrounded by a moat, and was no doubt once a place of much strength, but is now out of repair. There are a good government school and a police station in the town, and the district post connects it with the imperial postal lines. The population at the last census was 2,116. The name of the town is said to be derived from L\u00e1njk\u00e1i (the goddess K\u00e1l\u00ed), in whose honour a temple has been built on the edge of the fort moat. In the bamboo jungles, a mile to the north-east of the town, is an old temple dedicated to Mah\u00e1deva, surrounded by what are said to be the remains of the original town.\n\nLA'PHA'\u2014A chiefship in the north of the Bil\u00e1sp\u00far district, consisting of fifty-five villages, with an area of 272 square miles, of which 11,886 acres are cultivated.

Much of the fort wall is standing, and in remarkable preservation. It is composed of large slabs of well-cut stone. The climate on the plateau is cool and pleasant.\n\nLAUN\u2014A tract of country attached to the Raipur district, lying to the east of Simg\u00e1, and containing about 423 villages, with an area of some 800 square miles. It is watered by the Seon\u00e1th and Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed, and possesses a most fertile soil; but by far the greater portion is covered by scrub jungle, containing but little valuable timber. West of the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed the country is generally well cultivated, particularly to the south of the pargana. The uncultivated portions bear rich crops of thatching-grass, whence the greater part of the cultivated villages of the district are supplied with that article. To the east of the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed, with the exception of a portion to the north-east along the river, almost the whole country consists of low hills, covered with bamboos and thatching-grass, while along the extreme eastern boundary there are fine sal forests. The principal crop is rice, which is produced in very large quantities.\n\nLAUN\u2014A large tract of forest land in the subdivision of that name in the Raipur district, which has been provisionally reserved from sale under the waste land rules\u2014not so much on account of the value of the timber now on the land, but in order that its general resources may be husbanded to meet the growing wants of Raipur and other towns in the neighbourhood.\n\nLINGAGIRI\u2014A small estate in the Bastar feudatoryship, containing ten villages, with an area of about fifty square miles.

There are here a charitable dispensary, a school, and a sar\u00e1i.\n\nLOHA RA\u2014A chiefship attached to Raipur, lying to the south-west of the district, between the B\u00e1lod and Sanj\u00e1rl parganas. It is generally hilly and covered with jungle, and to the south the hills reach a considerable height, diminishing in size as they approach the north, till they sink into the plain near the northern boundary. It contains 132 villages, with an area of 375 miles. There is but little cultivated land, and the population is chiefly composed of Gonds, Kal\u00e1l\u00eds, and Halb\u00e1s. The country is well watered, being bounded respectively on the east and west by the rivers Tendul\u00e1 and Kharkar\u00e1, while numerous n\u00e1ls descend from the hills and water the valleys. The principal hill is the Dall\u00ed Pah\u00e1r; it is from 1,800 to 2,000 feet high, and was formerly covered with teak, as was also a large part of the chiefship; but there are now few valuable trees left. The jungles still contain a good deal of kusam, mhowa, bijes\u00e1l, and other similar trees, and lac, wax, and honey are yearly produced in very large quantities. Hemp and cotton are also exported by Banj\u00e1r\u00e1s, who buy up the supply; and iron is smelted. The zam\u00edn-d\u00e1r is a Gond by caste; and the estate was originally granted, in A.D. 1538, in return for military service, by one of the Ratanpur rajas.\nLOHA'RA'\u2014A small village in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, twenty miles southwest of Brahmapur\u00ed, famous for a hill of iron-ore in its vicinity.

The population is computed at 935 souls\u2014nearly all Gonds and Khonds. The inhabitants of this chiefship, under the guidance of Surendra S\u00e1, gave the greatest trouble during the rebellion of 1857, and as the highroad from Cuttack runs through the estate, they were in a position to do a great deal of mischief. Mudd\u00fa, the brother of the present chief, was hanged for having taken part in the murder of a European officer\u2014a Dr. Moore\u2014who was proceeding to Sambalp\u00far via Cuttack.

It is filled by means of a long line of embankment, which turns a hill stream into it. At the end of the dam are the remains of a hill-fort. The village is now deserted, but the lands are cultivated by people of the neighbourhood.\n\nMADNI'\u2014One of the smaller towns of the Wardh\u00e1 district, situated on the right bank of the Dh\u00e1m, about ten miles to the east of Wardh\u00e1. The weekly market held here on Sundays is of considerable importance, and a good deal of cotton changes hands at it. The place contains 920 inhabitants, principally agriculturists. Oil and country-cloth are made here.\n\nMAGARDHA'\u2014An ancient village, about five miles to the north of Bal\u00edhr\u00ed in the Sleeman\u00e1b\u00e1d tahsil of the Jabalp\u00far district. Here is a Gond fort, or rather the remains of one.\n\nMAHA'DEO PAHA'R\u2014A group of hills in the Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d district. They are the finest in the whole S\u00e1tpur\u00e1 range, and at one point rise to a height of 4,500 feet above the sea. It is in this cluster that the very remarkable group of rocks known by geologists under the name of the Mah\u00e1deo sandstones attains its greatest development.* Here the sandstone mass presents a thickness of 2,000 feet, and the finest of all those striking vertical escarpments which characterise this formation is seen on the south face of the Mah\u00e1deo block, where it rises from the flat ground of the Denw\u00e1 valley. The summits of the Pachmarh\u00ed hills, as seen from the Narbad\u00e1 valley, present a huge grotesque outline, which bears marked contrast with the ordinary contour of the basaltic range. These hills are entirely isolated from the main S\u00e1tpur\u00e1 range by scarps and precipitous ravines, and are almost encircled by the Denw\u00e1 and Sonbhadra, which rise in the valley to the south of the range, and unite on its north side. The slope of the hills to the north is as gentle and easy as the cliff to the south is steep.\n\n* Memoirs of the Geological Survey of India, vol. ii. p. 183.\nand abrupt, and laden animals, or even wheeled carts, may soon be able to ascend by the road which is now under construction, and which runs direct to the plateau from the Bankheri railway station, some twenty-two miles distant from the foot of the mountain. The ascent up the hill may be twelve miles long. Nothing can be prettier than the plateau itself, varied like a park with glades and clumps of trees, watered by a stream that runs winding down nearly its whole length, and curiously sheltered from the winds and storms by a rim of low rocks that bound it wherever it borders upon the outer face of the hills.\n\nMAHA'GA'ON\u2014A small chiefship or zamindari on the southern boundary of the Bhandara district, consisting of fourteen villages, with an area of thirty-one square miles, of which little more than one-tenth is cultivated. The forests yield a good deal of valuable timber, chiefly teak and saj, and there is ample pasturage for cattle, which assemble here in the hot months in large numbers. The only large village is Mahagaoon itself, where the zamindar, who is a Rajput, resides. There is a government village school established here, and the remains of an ancient fort are still visible. The famous hill fortress of Pratapgarh overlooks the village of Mahagaoon, though beyond its limits.\n\nMAHA'NADI', or \"Great River,\" is one of the largest and most important rivers in the Central Provinces; it rises about twenty-five miles south of Rajpur, in a mountainous region which bounds the Chhattisgarh plateau on the south and divides it from the Bastar country. This region is probably the wildest of all the wild parts of the Central Provinces. Thence the river flows in a northerly direction past the towns of Dhamtari, Rajim, and Arang, and so arrives at a point named Seorfnarkin. Thus far it has been a comparatively insignificant stream, and it is rarely used for purposes of navigation. But near here it is joined by three affluents\u2014the Seonath or Seo river, the Jonk, and the Hasdu. From the town of Malhar the Mahanadi, considerably increased in volume, and quite navigable during the greater part of the year, takes an easterly course for above sixty miles, passing by Chandrapur to a point near Padmapur. During this space it is joined by two feeders\u2014the Manda and the Kelu\u2014running downwards to it from the north. Though these are small streams, yet they would, at certain seasons, carry country boats for at least a short distance above their junction with the Mahanadi. The former of these rivers is navigated for a short distance. Near Padmapur the Mahanadi changes its course to a southerly direction, and enters a series of rocks, which crop up all over its bed, and split it into streamlets for several miles, thereby rendering it, if not unnavigable, at least very difficult of navigation. Then it is joined by the Eb\u2014a stream of similar character, flowing from the north-east, and partially navigable. Then again, struggling through masses of rocks, the Mahanadi flows past Sambalpur. There its course is less obstructed, but it is occasionally interrupted by mighty rocks\u2014the terror of boatmen\u2014standing up in mid-stream, and realizing the exact notion of Scylla and Charybdis. Thence it passes by Binka and Sonpur, at which latter place it is joined by the Tel.\n\nBelow Sonpur the Mahanadi, taking an easterly course, pursues a tortuous way, cribbed, confined, and tossed about between ridges and ledges, and crags of rocks for many miles, yet still struggling and rushing onwards with some velocity, till passing Bod (the capital of a state of that name) it reaches a place called Dholpur. After this its troubles and vicissitudes among the rocks come to an end, and rolling its unrestrained waters along, it makes straight for the range of the eastern ghats mountains. There it pierces the mountains by a gorge, about forty miles in length, slightly inferior in grandeur, but equal in\nbeauty, to the gorge of the God\u00e1var\u00ed. There overlooked by hills, and shaded by forests on either side, it flows deep and quiet, navigable at all seasons. Emerging from the hills it expands its bed, and spreads itself over sands, till it reaches Cuttack, where the delta commences by which it emerges into the Bay of Bengal.\n\n**MAHA'NADI**\u2014A stream of comparatively small importance, which must not be confounded with the larger river of the same name, that rises in the southern hill-ranges of the R\u00e1ip\u00far district. The Lesser Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed rises in the Mandla district, and flows into the Son after a course of about one hundred miles, during a portion of which it forms the boundary between Rew\u00e1 and Jabalp\u00far. Coal is found on its banks near Deori, where there is also a warm spring. S\u00e1l (*shorea robusta*) grows freely on both sides of the river.\n\n**MAH\u00c1RAJPU'R**\u2014A large and populous village in the Mandla district, immediately opposite to Mandla, at the confluence of the Narbad\u00e1 and Banjar. Its ancient name is said to have been Brahmaputra, but in A.D. 1737 R\u00e1j\u00e9 Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j founded the present village, and its name was then altered to Mah\u00e1r\u00e1jp\u00far. There is a good school here. An annual fair is held opposite to Mah\u00e1r\u00e1jp\u00far, on the right bank of the Banjar, at its confluence with the Narbad\u00e1, at the village of Purw\u00e1.\n\n**MAIKAL**\u2014The name generally given to the range of hills running southwest from Amarkantak for a distance of some seventy miles, whence they are continued by a similar range, locally known as the S\u00e1l\u00e9tekri hills. The Maikal hills form the eastern scarp or outer range of the great hill system, which traverses India almost from east to west, south of the Narbad\u00e1. They do not ordinarily exceed 2,000 feet in height, but the L\u00e1ph\u00e1 hill, which is a detached peak belonging to this range, has an elevation of 3,500 feet. The range is best known by the magnificent forests of s\u00e1l (*shorea robusta*), which still clothe its heights in many places. Measures are now being taken to preserve them from further damage; but they have already suffered considerably through a long succession of years, perhaps centuries, from the wasteful mode of cultivation adopted by the aboriginal tribes, who, instead of ploughing, cut down and burn wood on the hill sides, and sow their hardy crops in the ashes.\n\n**MAIKAL**\u2014A s\u00e1l forest of some 2,000 square miles in extent, lying along a range of hills of the same name in the Mandla and B\u00e1lagh\u00e1t districts. It has not yet been surveyed or demarcated. The belts of large trees which compose it diverge to considerable distances from the main range, and include open plains and glades spreading over a very considerable extent of country. This is also known as the Topl\u00e1 forest.\n\n**MAJHGAWAN**\u2014A considerable village in the Jabalp\u00far district, situated thirty miles to the north-east of Jabalp\u00far. There is a large tank close by, covering 125 acres, and called Sr\u00e1van S\u00e1gar after its excavator. The village is surrounded by beautiful groves of trees, and the soil is fertile. The population amounts to 2,318 souls, and includes a good many iron-workers.\n\n**MAKRA'T**\u2014A small independent chiefship in the Har\u00e1 subdivision of the Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d district, containing ninety-two villages, with an area of 215 square miles, and a revenue of Rs. 22,000. The territory was formerly much larger, including K\u00e1l\u00edbh\u00edt and Ch\u00e1rv\u00e1, but most of it was annexed by the Peshw\u00e1 and Sind\u00eda. The r\u00e1j\u00e9, who is a Gond, in virtue of his position as a feudatory has civil, criminal, and executive jurisdiction in his estate, subject only to the\ngeneral control of the British Government. Makr\u00e1\u00ed itself is an insignificant village lying in and round a hill-fort which the r\u00e1j\u00e1 inhabits; but there are some rich villages in the valley portion of the estate.\n\nMALHA'R\u2014A village situated twenty miles south-east of Bilasp\u00far. It is said to be very ancient, and to have been once important. It is now a fair-sized village, with indications of its former extent in the remains of a long earthwork with a surrounding ditch, which probably enclosed the old city. There are the ruins too of some very old temples, which would no doubt be interesting to the archaeologist.\n\nMALTHON\u2014The principal town of a tract of the same name in the S\u00e1g\u00e1r district, situated about forty miles north of S\u00e1g\u00e1r, on the southern slope of the Narat Gh\u00e1t or pass. The ascent is gentle, and is commanded by the fort. About A.D. 1748 Prithv\u00ed Singh of Garh\u00e1kot\u00e1 took possession of the village in the name of the Peshw\u00e1, and altered its site to where it now stands. He also built the present fort. He died in 1773, and his descendant R\u00e1j\u00e1 Arjun Singh in A.D. 1811 made over M\u00e1lthon and Garh\u00e1kot\u00e1 to Sind\u00ed\u00e1, in return for assistance given to him by the latter in expelling the army of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of N\u00e1gp\u00far from Garh\u00e1kot\u00e1 (see \"Garh\u00e1kot\u00e1\"). In A.D. 1820, shortly after the cession of the S\u00e1g\u00e1r district by the Peshw\u00e1, M\u00e1lthon was made over by Sind\u00ed\u00e1 to the British in exchange for some other territory. In July 1857, when the Mutiny commenced, two companies of the 31st Native Infantry were sent from S\u00e1g\u00e1r to M\u00e1lthon, but on their arrival before the place, as the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Sh\u00e1hgarh and Bh\u00e1npur were close by with a large force, they went back to S\u00e1g\u00e1r, and the Sh\u00e1hgarh R\u00e1j\u00e1, a descendant of the abovementioned Prithv\u00ed Singh, took possession of the town and fort, and remained there till January 1858, when he decamped on hearing the news of the defeat of the Bh\u00e1npur R\u00e1j\u00e1 at Barodi\u00e1 Naunagar.\n\nA weekly market is held here; nothing, however, of much importance is brought for sale. The road from S\u00e1g\u00e1r to Lalatp\u00far and Jh\u00e1ns\u00ed runs through M\u00e1lthon, and there is a travellers' bungalow close to the fort. Two schools have been established here\u2014one for boys, and the other for girls,\u2014and a dispensary was set on foot in 1863, at which there is accommodation for in-patients.\n\nMANDGA'ON\u2014A small town in the Hingangh\u00e1t tahsil of the Wardh\u00e1 district, situated about nineteen miles S.W.W. of Wardh\u00e1, near the river Wan\u00e1, shortly below its junction with the combined streams of the Dh\u00e1m and Bor. It contains 3,195 inhabitants, chiefly cultivators, weavers, and oil-pressers. The opening out of a high street and erection of a town-schoolhouse have been the principal works carried out from municipal income. A conservancy establishment and a force of town police are also kept up by the municipality. The weekly market held on Tuesday is well attended, and a good number of cattle are brought to it for sale.\n\nMANDHAL\u2014A small town in the N\u00e1gp\u00far district, about fifty miles south-east of N\u00e1gp\u00far, with a population of 2,522 persons. It has a fairly good school, and a small manufacture of plain cotton-cloth.\n\nMANDHATA*\u2014An island in the Narbad\u00e1 belonging to the Nim\u00e1r district, remarkable as containing numerous temples, ancient and modern, including the great shrine of Omk\u00e1r, a form of Siva. The island covers an area of about five-sixths of a square mile. Towards the northern branch of the river the slope is not very abrupt in most places, but its southern and eastern faces terminate in bluff\n\n* This article is by Captain J. Forsyth, Deputy Commissioner of Nim\u00e1r.\nprecipices 400 or 500 feet in height. It is cleft in two by a deep ravine running nearly north and south, the eastern end containing about one-third of the whole area. The southern bank of the Narbad\u00e1 opposite M\u00e1ndh\u00e1t\u00e1 (called Godarpur\u00e1) is as precipitous as M\u00e1ndh\u00e1t\u00e1, and between them the river forms an exceedingly deep and silent pool, full of alligators and large fish, many of which are so tame as to take grain off the lower steps of the sacred gh\u00e1ts. The rocks on both sides of the river are of a greenish hue, very boldly stratified, and said to be hornstone slate. The island is said in the Narmad\u00e1 Khand (professing to be a portion of the Skanda Pur\u00e1na) to have been originally called Baid\u00farya Mani Parvat, which was changed to M\u00e1ndh\u00e1t\u00e1 as a boon granted by Omk\u00e1r to the R\u00e9ja M\u00e1ndh\u00e1t\u00ed, seventeenth of the solar race, who had here performed a great sacrifice to the god. Be this as it may, there is no doubt that the worship of Siva was established here at an early age. On M\u00e1ndh\u00e1t\u00e1 the shrine of Omk\u00e1r, and on the southern bank that of Amareswar (lord of the immortals), are two of the twelve great Lingas which existed in India when Mohammad of Ghazn\u00ed demolished the temple of Somn\u00e1th in A.D. 1024.* The name Omk\u00e1r is from the syllable Om, which, says Professor Wilson\u2020, is a combination of letters invested by Hind\u00fa mysticism with peculiar sanctity, employed in the beginning of all prayers. It comprehends all the gods, the Vedas, the three spheres of the world, &c. The Br\u00e1hmans who now officiate at the shrine wish to exclude Omk\u00e1r from the twelve Lingas usually called \u201cA\u2019di\u201d or first, as something above and before them all. The Narmad\u00e1 Khand supports them in this assertion, but as it contains a prophecy of the time when India shall be ruled by Mlechhas (non-Hind\u00fas) and other modern allusions, its antiquity is certainly a good deal open to doubt. The evidence of the K\u00e1s\u00ed Khand and other Sivite writings is against them; and the pilgrims, who have vowed to visit the B\u00e1r\u00e1 Jyot\u00ed Lingas, pay their adorations both to Omk\u00e1r and Amareswar. Regarding the latter they are, however, avowedly left by the Br\u00e1hmans under a pious mistake. Amareswar was altogether lost during the wars of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the south banks having been deserted and overgrown with jungle, and when, towards the close of the eighteenth century, the Peshw\u00e1 desired to rebuild the temple, neither the Linga nor its old temple could be found. The temple was, however, built, together with a group of smaller ones, from slabs brought chiefly from the ruined temples on the island, and some time afterwards in digging for bricks (many of which of an old shape are found all over the neighbourhood), the old Linga was found standing on four argh\u00e1s, one above the other, showing that it had existed through the four ages of the world. It was also pronounced to be the true one by the Benares pundits, in consequence of being situated in a line with Omk\u00e1r and the Kapila Sangam, where a small stream joins the Narbad\u00e1. R\u00e9ja Daulat Singh, the last r\u00e9ja of M\u00e1ndh\u00e1t\u00e1, built a temple over it; but its honours and name were gone, and it has now been dubbed Viswa N\u00e1th, to distinguish it from its fraudulent rival. Indeed it seems very doubtful whether the present Omk\u00e1r is the real old deity of that name. The temple is evidently of modern construction, and all the really old temples in the place are situated along the banks of the northern branch of the Narbad\u00e1, not the southern. Tradition also states that the chief places of worship used to be on that side of the island, and probably at one time it was also the main channel of the river, as indeed it still is during floods. It has now been dubbed the K\u00e1ver\u00ed; and the fiction is that a stream of that name which enters the\n\n* Professor H. H. Wilson\u2019s Essays on the Religion of the Hind\u00fas, vol. i. p. 223, Edn. 1862.\n\u2020 Hall\u2019s Edition of Wilson\u2019s Vishnu Pur\u00e1na, vol. i. part I, chap. I., p. 1, note 1.\nNarbad\u00e1 about a mile higher up from the south passes unmixed through its waters and again leaves it at M\u00e1ndh\u00e1t\u00e1, in order to confer additional sanctity on the place by making a double sangam or junction of two holy rivers. The R\u00e9j\u00e1 of M\u00e1ndh\u00e1t\u00e1, who is hereditary custodian of all the modern temples, is a Bhil\u00e1la, claiming descent from a Chauh\u00e1n R\u00e9jput named Bh\u00e1rat Singh, who is stated in the family genealogy to have taken M\u00e1ndh\u00e1t\u00e1 from a Bh\u00edl chief in the year A.D. 1165. The genealogy gives twenty-eight generations to the family since then, or twenty-five years to each generation. The Bhil\u00e1las of this part of India are all descended from alliances of R\u00e9jputs with Bh\u00edls, and take the name of the R\u00e9jput clan to which they trace back their origin. The same genealogy affirms that at that time a Gos\u00e1i\u00edn, named Dary\u00e1o N\u00e1th, was the only worshipper of Omk\u00e1r on the island, which could not be visited by pilgrims for fear of a terrible god, called K\u00e1l Bhairava, and his consort, K\u00e1l\u00ed Dev\u00ed, who regularly fed on human flesh. Dary\u00e1o N\u00e1th, however, by his austerities shut up the latter in a subterranean cave (the mouth of which may still be seen), appeasing her by erecting an image outside to receive worship, and arranged with K\u00e1l Bhairava that for the future he should receive human sacrifices at regular intervals; and accordingly thereafter devotees were induced to precipitate themselves over the B\u00edrkhal\u00e1 rocks, at the eastern end of the island, on to the rocks by the river brink, where the terrible deity resided\u2014a practice which continued till 1824, in which year the British officer in charge of Nim\u00e1r witnessed the last offering of the sort made to K\u00e1l Bhairava. The Chauh\u00e1n Bh\u00e1rat Singh is related to have been invited by Dary\u00e1o N\u00e1th to kill Nath\u00fa Bh\u00edl, which he did; but it is more likely that he only married his daughter, and thus founded the present family, as Nath\u00fa\u2019s descendants are still the hereditary custodians of all the temples on the top and north side of the hill, that is of all those that are really ancient. The disciples of Dary\u00e1o N\u00e1th still enjoy lands on account of the worship of Omk\u00e1r.\n\nIt is not difficult to trace in this fragmentary story the revival of the worship of Siva, which took place about the tenth or eleventh century, and its gradual propagation by adventurous missionaries, adopting as it went the K\u00e1l\u00eds and Bhairavas of the savage tribes, as mythological consorts and sons of Siva, just as its R\u00e9jput protectors allied themselves with the daughters of the wild hill chiefs who worshipped these blood-thirsty deities.\n\nThe old temples about M\u00e1ndh\u00e1t\u00e1 have all suffered greatly from the bigotry of the Mohammadans who ruled the country from about A.D. 1400. Every old dome is overthrown, and not a single figure of a god or animal is to be found un mutilated. The fanatic Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn passed through this country in A.D. 1295 on his return from his Deccan raid, and as he took A\u2019sirgarh, which is not far off, it is improbable that he would have passed over so tempting an idol preserve as M\u00e1ndh\u00e1t\u00e1. Doubtless the work commenced by him was continued by the Ghor\u00ed princes of M\u00e1lw\u00e1, and completed by that archiconoclast Aurangzeb. Yet much remains among the ruins which must be highly interesting to the archaeologist. Both the hills are covered with remnants of habitations built in stone without cement. The walls of the different forts, two of which enclose the two sections of the island itself, and two more the rocky eminences on the southern banks, display some excellent specimens of the old style of Hind\u00fa architecture. They are formed of very large blocks of stone without cement. The stone is partly the basalt of the hill itself, and partly a coarse yellow sandstone, which must have been brought from a considerable distance. The gateways are formed with horizontal arches, and ornamented with much fine carving, statues of gods, &c. The best are those\non the eastern end of the island, or Mandh\u00e1t\u00e1 Proper, which also appears to be the only part that has ever received any repairs. It is easy to distinguish these from the old works, some being even as recent as the Mohammadan period, as at the Bh\u00edma-rj\u00fani gate (opposite the Birkhal\u00e1 rocks), where there is a distinct pointed archway laid in mortar. The oldest Sivite temple in the place is probably that on the Birkhal\u00e1 rocks, at the extreme eastern point of the island. It consists of a sort of closed court-yard with a front verandah, through which apparently was a passage to the shrine, which has now completely disappeared. It is totally different in plan from any of the other temples, which consist of the ordinary shrine and porch. The stones are of great size, the verandah and colonnades of the court-yard being supported on massive pillars very plainly carved in rectilinear figures. On the M\u00e1ndh\u00e1t\u00e1 hill are the remains of what must have been, if it ever approached completion, a remarkably fine Sivite temple, now called Siddhaswar Mah\u00e1deva. The dome which covered the shrine is, however, completely gone, and has been recently replaced by a mean flat roof, not so high as the remaining pillars of the porches. In its fall it has also overthrown and covered many of the pillars of the porches, and much of the fine work of the plinth. It appears to have been a square shrine of about twenty-six feet outside measurement, with projections added at the four sides, each about five feet in depth. In each of these was a doorway, and in front of each doorway a porch (Sabh\u00e1 Mandap) resting on fourteen pillars. These pillars are fourteen feet high to the architrave, each porch being thus a perfect cube. They are elaborately carved in squares, polygons, and circles, and most of them have a curious frieze or fillet of Satyr-like figures about half way up. They are about three feet square at the foot, and do not taper very much. They are all crowned with bracket capitals, on which rest the architraves, each bracket being carved into a grotesque squat human figure. The roofs of these porches appear to have been of flat slabs.\n\nIt is impossible now to say what the adytum or shrine was like; but if it corresponded with the porches, it must have been a most imposing structure. The most remarkable feature of the building, however, is the plinth or platform on which it is built; this projects ten or twelve feet beyond the porches, in front of each of which it is broken into a flight of ten steps. It is raised about ten feet off the ground, and appears to have been faced all round with a frieze of elephants, carved in almost complete relief on stone slabs. The elephants are between four and five feet in height, and are executed with singular correctness and excellence of attitude. The material is yellow sandstone, and they are consequently now a good deal weather-worn. In some cases there are two on a single slab in an attitude of combat, but more generally a single one, resting one foot on a small prostrate human figure. This frieze does not appear to have been completed, as close by, within an enclosure of which two sides are still standing, are a number of detached slabs with elephants carved on them, exactly like those on the plinth. All these, and most in the temple also, have been sadly mutilated, the trunks, ears, and figure of the rider being generally broken off. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 of M\u00e1ndh\u00e1t\u00e1 has also removed a number to build into his new palace, after getting a mason to chisel them down to a manageable size. The only two left at all perfect have now been rescued, and will be properly cared for. There is no record of any extensive crescentades against idols between the time of Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn and Aurangzeb, nor is it very likely that so pretentious a work as this would have been undertaken so late as the time of Aurangzeb; besides which its style and excellence of architecture seem evidently to belong to an earlier age. It is not therefore unreasonable to conclude that it was just being finished in A.D. 1295\nwhen Sult\u00e1n Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn interrupted the works, demolishing even the elephants that were still standing in the workshop. Most of them had, however, been fixed in their places, and the superstructure was probably complete. If so, the temple must have been inferior, as a work of art, to no structural Hind\u00fa temple of that period, of which illustrations or descriptions have been given to the public; besides which it appears to have been on a plan unusual in any known school of Hind\u00fa architecture; at least Fergusson gives no notice of four open-pillared porches in a Hind\u00fa temple.\n\nThere is another old Sivite temple below the M\u00e1ndh\u00e1t\u00e1 hill, on the bank of the so-called K\u00e1ver\u00ed branch of the Narb\u00e1d\u00e1. The porch only of this too is all that remains of the old work, and though probably older, it is inferior in carving and general effect to the temple already described. In neither of these buildings is there a trace of lime in the old part of the work.\n\nOn the northern section of the island called Muchkund (after R\u00e9j\u00e1 M\u00e1ndh\u00e1tri\u2019s son) there are no temples now standing of any age. That of Gaur\u00ed Somn\u00e1th appears, however, to be an old shrine rebuilt with lime. Somn\u00e1th himself is a gigantic linga, now black, but once, as the story goes, white, in accordance with his name. The Mohammadan leader, who destroyed old M\u00e1ndh\u00e1t\u00e1, is related to have been told that this linga had the property of displaying to the curious a reflection of the subject into which their souls should pass at their next metempsychosis, and, on inquiring as to his own fate, the devout son of Isl\u00e1m was shown in the linga a pig, whereon he cast it into the fire, and since then it has assumed its jet black hue. An immense Nand\u00ed (Siva\u2019s bull), of a fine green stone, lies headless in front of the shrine, and about a hundred yards in front of the door is an overthrown pillar, which has been nineteen and a half feet high with its capital, and stood on a raised platform of basalt blocks. For the first six and a half feet it is two and a half feet square\u2014thence polygonal, with occasional round belts to the capital, which is square\u2014and furnished with five holes in the top, either to hold lamps or the fastenings of some figure.\n\nOn the north bank of the so-called K\u00e1ver\u00ed opposite M\u00e1ndh\u00e1t\u00e1 is a series of deserted temples, evidently of considerable antiquity. M\u00e1ndh\u00e1t\u00e1 itself seems to have been a perfect stronghold of Sivaism, no temple having ever been erected save to the destroyer or his associate deities. Here, however, besides one or two old structures that seem to have been also consecrated to Siva, we find several devoted to Vishnu, and a whole group of Jain temples, the existence of which has only recently been ascertained. Just where the Narb\u00e1d\u00e1 forks are the remains of a large Vishnuite erection, of which only some gateways, and a shapeless building formed of the old materials, exist. The former are in the same style of architecture, without cement, as the oldest on the M\u00e1ndh\u00e1t\u00e1 hill. In the latter are twenty-four figures of Vishnu and his various avat\u00e1rs, carved in good style in a close-grained green stone, including a large var\u00e1ha or Boar avat\u00e1r, covered with the same panoply of sitting figures as that at Khandw\u00e1. Jain-like sitting figures also appear in the other carvings of Vishnu, illustrating the intimate connection between the two religions. The date 1346 appears on an image of Siva in the same building, but there are no legible dates on the others. Further down the river bank are some very old remains, formed of huge blocks, and apparently from the carvings, Sivite. Of one, a portion of the dome is standing, formed in the same manner of blocks crossing each other at the angles. A little way on is a small ravine running down from the hills, called the R\u00e1wana n\u00e1l\u00e1, in which are some curious remains.\nFirst comes a prostrate figure carved in bold relief on four basalt slabs laid end to end. From head to foot it measures eighteen feet and a half in length. It is rather rudely executed; it is much weather-worn, and the legs are gone from the thighs to the ankles. It has ten arms, all apparently holding clubs and pendent skulls, but only one head. One foot rests on a smaller prostrate human figure, in which also are fastened the tiger-like claws of a small figure on the left. A scorpion is carved on the chest of the large figure, and a rat is sculptured on the slab near his right side. The people call it R\u00e1wan,* the demon who carried off S\u00edt\u00e1, the wife of R\u00e1ma, but it is questionable if statues are ever erected to him, nor have the scorpion and rat, it is believed, anything to do with the story of the R\u00e1m\u00e1yana. The figure was evidently intended to be erected in a mammoth temple, which never advanced far towards completion. The adjoining bed of the ravine is strewn with huge basalt blocks, rough-hewn, and slightly carved in some places. They are from ten to fifteen feet in length, and about two feet and a half square; a few intended for uprights are partially cut into polygons and circles. A number of blocks, shaped like crosses, are also to be seen. They are quite rough, five and six inches across each limb, the four projections being of equal size\u2014cubes of one foot nine inches. They were evidently intended to be cut into the bracket capitals of the temple. It cannot but occur to an observer how closely some of these resemble the so-called Christian cross recently discovered in the God\u00e1var\u00ed valley, and figured in the Proceedings of the Asiatic Society;\u2020 and had any of the huge blocks been erected in their places, how easy it would have been to make out of them the remains of a Druidical circle. Numbers of the stones from this n\u00e1la appear to have been removed to build the modern town of M\u00e1ndh\u00e1t\u00e1. The dry bed of the Narbad\u00e1, near the fork, is strewn with them, as if they had fallen out of boats in the attempt to transport them during floods. It may be conjectured that the figure is some form of Bhairava or some other of Siva's sanguinary developments. R\u00e1wana should have twenty arms and ten heads, and if, to save labour, they divided his arms by two, at least they should have done the same by his heads, and given him five instead of one.\n\nThe most curious of all the remains along this branch of the river is the group of Jain temples. They cover an elevation overlooking, but a little retired from, the river. The building nearest the figure just described appears rather to be a monastery than a temple. It may be described as a quadrangle, measuring outside 53 feet east and west, by 43\u00bd north and south. The western extremity is, however, rounded off at the corners, so as to make a sort of bow-face towards the river. In the centre is an open courtyard 23\u00bd feet by 14 feet. The whole of the rest, except in three places, has been roofed by flat stone slabs, resting on numerous carved pillars, with bracket capitals, which differ only in the style of ornamentation from those of the neighbouring old Hind\u00fa temples.\n\n* Regarding this figure Captain T. Forsyth, the writer of this article, has contributed the following additional information:\n\n\"On a second visit to Mandh\u00e1t\u00e1 and careful examination of this figure, I am satisfied that it represents the consort of Siva in her more terrible form of Mah\u00e1k\u00e1l\u00ed. It is certainly a female, has a girdle and necklace of snakes, and is either eight or ten-handed, it is not very clear which. The sword, bell, mace, skull, and head held by the hair in her hands, point, I think, clearly to the dread goddess K\u00e1l\u00ed.\"\u2014T. F.\n\n\u2020 Proceedings of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, No. v., May 1868.\nThere are four main rows of these pillars running round the building, and they stand about ten feet apart. They are also about ten feet high, and the building is therefore wholly wanting in external architectural effect. But the three spots now uncovered were evidently at one time covered by domes or spires. Two of these were of small diameter, on either side of the main entrance, at the eastern end of the building. Of one of these a portion is still standing, and it seems to have been of a ribbed pyramidal shape. The third must have been a large dome, over an octagonal opening in the centre of the western or rounded end of the building. It appears to have been built of large flat bricks, some of which are still in situ. The building appears to have been closed by walls on all sides except that towards the river. The eastern wall is still complete. The carving is mostly in the form of circles of foliage, quadrated lozenges, and variations on the square, polygonal, and circular sections of the pillars. It is all done in the same yellow sandstone as the Hind\u00fa temples, and is of greatly inferior execution to the Jain remains at Khandw\u00e1. The building seems to have been left almost entirely devoid of external ornament.\n\nTo the right of the eastern entrance have been two chambers projecting into the building, and immediately under the small spires already mentioned. That to the left is, with its spire, in ruins. In that to the right the writer found a greatly mutilated image of one of the T\u00edrthankars; but neither on it, nor any where in the building, was there any trace of an inscription. Immediately to the right and left of the doorway, on entering, are two figures carved on slabs about two feet in height. That to the left might be taken for Bhaw\u00e1n\u00ed, the consort of Siva, with her tiger and usual accompaniments, except that she has a sort of corona, or canopy of radiating foliage, and holds in one of her four hands a sort of triple-knotted rope, both of which emblems are often seen in Jain carvings. That to the right is palpably an adaptation of a T\u00edrthankar to Sivite ideas, and may be considered a most curious exemplification of the proneness of the later Jains to adopt the Hind\u00fa mythology of the sect that happened to be most in fashion in their neighbourhood. It is a pronouncedly naked (Dig\u00e1mbar) figure, with a single cord round the waist, and pendent ends, which alone would stamp it as Jain. It has also large circular ear-rings and plain round anklets. It is standing in an easy attitude, one leg encircled by a long loop, seemingly part of a snake, which also passes along the left side, through the left hand, and up behind the head, where it ends in three-hooded snake-heads, forming a canopy over the head. So far it might all be Jain (the serpent making it out as P\u00e1rsvan\u00e1th); but beyond this it has four hands, one occupied, as stated, by the snake, while two hold a sword and buckler, and the fourth Siva's drum or hour-glass (damaru). These and the T\u00edrthankar already mentioned seem to be the only images now left in the building, though the usual Jain figures are carved all over the ornamentation of this and the other two buildings now to be mentioned. It should be added that this building is erected on a platform of basalt blocks five or six feet high.\n\nA little to the north of the last building is the second, a great part of which is a ruin. This ruin seems to have been the temple proper, and to have been formed of a pyramidal shape with numerous smaller spires. The building still standing is its anterior porch, closely resembling that of A'mw\u00e1 near Ajant\u00e1, figured in Fergusson's Architecture, vol. II. p. 626, except that the plinth extends much further out all round, forming in fact a wide open terrace about sixty feet square in front of the porch, and cut down the centre into a long flight of steps. In form it is a square of fifteen feet and a half, worked\ninto an octagon by large slabs thrown across the corners, on which appears to have rested the dome, now quite gone. From each side of the square projects a recess or alcove about six feet square. At each angle is a carved pillar, the intervals being filled up with dressed sandstone blocks. The pillars are richer than those in the monastery, and the ceiling in particular appears to have been exceedingly richly carved in concentric circular patterns of foliage. The main entrance is to the east, opposite the steps. The northern alcove is closed by a wall; and in it the writer found a headless sitting image of a Tirthankar, carved in the same green stone as the images in the Vishnuit temple already mentioned. It bears a Sanskrit inscription on the pedestal, stating it to be Sambhunath. It has not yet been properly deciphered, but the date appears to be illegible. It is very correctly carved, but does not appear to be of any very great age. Probably all these green stone images were brought from a distance long after the erection of the temples in which they stand. The recess in the southern face may have been either a doorway or another image chamber, and is now quite ruined. The doorway from the porch into the ruined shrine is covered with ornamental carving, chiefly sitting female figures like that on the left of the entrance to the monastery, with friezes of elephants' heads, and figures of goats with human heads. No doubt the most interesting part of the building is the shrine, now buried beneath the ruins of its dome.\n\nThe third building is merely a small temple, nineteen feet square, built on the top of a pyramid of basalt blocks, about twenty-five feet high, and with very steep sides. The dome must have been a very high one, judging from the quantity of ruins, and it appears to have had no porch of any sort. It has an image recess in the southern face, which is now, however, empty. The sitting figures over its doorways and other carvings are precisely similar to those in the two larger buildings. It is probable that these buildings date from the same period as the other Jain remains of Nimar at Wun, Barwani, Hasud, and Khandwa, viz. A.D. 1166 to 1293; but excepting those at Wun, they are the only remains of the sort at all in decent preservation. The hills adjoining these temples are like Mandhata itself\u2014covered with remains of habitations and walls of stone, and nowhere is there any trace of the use of lime in the building. It seems therefore that the whole of the section of the Narbada valley, in which Mandhata stands, was at one time the seat of a populous community. It is now unoccupied except by the attendants of the temples and the Rajas people. The great fair of Omkari takes place on the fifteenth of Kartik (end of October and beginning of November), and 10,000 to 15,000 people usually attend, with numerous shops and traders from all parts of the country. The place is easily accessible from the Barwani travellers' bungalow, from which it is about seven miles distant by a good bridle-road. It is said to be increasing in importance. The southern bank, which was wholly waste at the close of last century, is now the site of numerous temples and several monasteries of Godar (whence its name of Godarpura), Niranjani, Dasmani, and other devotees, built and endowed by Ahilya Bai and other Maratha chiefs, and the Maharaja Holkar has recently intimated his intention of founding another. The Mandhata Brahmins fully rely on the accomplishment of a prophecy contained in the Bhavishya Purana (and copied of course into the local gospel), that after 5,000 years of the Kaliyuga the sanctity of the Ganga river will expire, and the Narbada will be left without a rival. There are now only thirty-one years left of this period, but it remains to be seen whether the\nGangetic Br\u00e1hmans will not discover some means of averting such a disastrous extinction of the profitable \"M\u00e1h\u00e1tmya\" of their river.\n\n**MANDHERI**\u2014A flourishing village in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, eleven miles west-north-west of Waror\u00e1, at which a large weekly market is held.

It is bounded on the east by the native state of Rew\u00e1 and a portion of the Bil\u00e1sp\u00far district; on the north by the Soh\u00e1gp\u00far and Chendy\u00e1 t\u00e1lukas of Rew\u00e1, and a small portion of the Sleeman\u00e1b\u00e1d tahsil of the Jabalp\u00far district; on the west by the districts of Jabalp\u00far and Seoni; and on the south by the districts of Seoni, B\u00e1lg\u00edch\u00e1t, R\u00e1\u00edp\u00far, and Bil\u00e1sp\u00far. The district presents such a variety of different features that to give a general description of it in a few words is not easy. It might almost be called a mountainous tract, comprising the valleys of numerous rivers; these valleys being broken into irregular sizes and shapes by the spurs of low hills running down from the main ranges towards the larger rivers. The singular feature of these ranges of hills is that many of them are quite flat at the top, and an abrupt steep ascent culminates in a fine plateau with a general slope downwards to the east. The traveller from west to eastward crosses over a series of steppes, varying in height and extent, until he reaches the main range of the Maikal gh\u00e1ts, which form the border of the district to the south-east, and from this range continual spurs run down\u2014some richly clothed with s\u00e1l forest\u2014dividing the country into valleys. The extreme length of the district from east to west is 156 miles. Its width varies very much. From the Chilp\u00ed Gh\u00e1t to Sh\u00e1hp\u00far cannot be less than 130 miles, while in the eastern t\u00e1lukas of R\u00e1mgarh it is not more than thirty miles. The total area may be set down as 8,000 square miles, much of which\n\n*This article consists almost entirely of extracts from the Land Revenue Settlement Report of the Mandla district by Captain H. C. E. Ward.*\n\n34 CPG\nis waste. For revenue purposes the district is divided into two portions, the old pargana boundaries having been retained, as they are so well known to the people; but as the two parganas of R\u00e1mgarh and Mandla differ much one from the other, and but little is known of the former, a short description of each may be of service.\n\nThe Mandla tahsil occupies the western and southern portion of the district, and is better populated and much richer than the other. It comprises portions of the valleys of the Narbad\u00e1, the Banjar, Burhner, H\u00e1lon, Phen, Th\u00e1nwar, and other smaller streams too numerous to mention. Most of these rivers run at a great depth below the surface of the country through which they pass, and consequently in but few places are they utilised for irrigation. They lie mostly to the east and south of Mandla itself, and in their valleys all the best cultivation of the tahsil is comprised. To the westward of Mandla the country is very hilly and difficult, opening into valleys here and there, where the rivers B\u00e1bai, Bal\u00e1i, and Hingna force their way through the hills towards the Narbad\u00e1, but altogether throwing many obstacles in the way of travellers and settlers, owing to its inaccessibility in the rains, for the streams, dry in the hot-weather months, come down with such violence, that a few hours' heavy rain is sufficient to cut off all communication. The country too is so inhospitable in appearance, and so wild in reality, that it is not after all very surprising that Mandla should have a bad name, for in the rainy season the black soil in the valleys becomes so deep as to render the journey from Jabalp\u00far one of no ordinary labour, and once in Mandla it used to be no uncommon thing to have all communication with the outer world cut off for three days together. Of the valleys to the westward, that of the Bal\u00e1i for the last six miles of its course, through the plain in which Nar\u00e1inganj\u00ed is situated, is one of the best cultivated, but there is still plenty of room for improvement. The soil is of the richest black cotton quality, and it is only lately that it has been brought into proper order. Some of the valleys of the Hingna and Gaur rivers nearer Jabalp\u00far are capable of anything almost in the way of cultivation, but are dreadfully neglected at present. The Haweli lands south of the Narbad\u00e1, near Mandla, are the richest and best cultivated in the whole district, and in them the best villages of the Mandla district are situated. They are formed by irregular spurs of low hills, running northwards from the Bhains\u00e1 Gh\u00e1t towards the Narbad\u00e1, and are watered by the rivers mentioned above, between two of which the Banjar, an affluent of the Narbad\u00e1, and the Th\u00e1nwar, an affluent of the Waingang\u00e1, a range of low hills runs, on the top of which is an extensive plateau, where some of the best Gond villages are situated, scattered about with no regularity, and divided by strips of jungle. As must be expected with such irregular features, the variety of soils is great. In the low lands there is abundance of rich black cotton soil, patches of which are found surrounded, as the lands rise towards the hills, with red gravelly soil, usually covered with masses of stones and flint, and fit for nothing but the commonest kinds of crops. In some valleys less favoured than others, instead of the rich black soil a light friable sandy soil takes its place, here called \"sehar.\" In fact it is difficult to find two of these valleys alike, and in some places the difference is very striking. The general elevation of the tahsil varies from 1,600 to 2,500 feet.\n\nThe R\u00e1mgarh tahsil is very poor, thinly populated, and but little known. Even the people of Mandla itself look upon it as the Ultima Thule of civilisation, and it is most\ndifficult to induce any official to remain there. That such should be the case is much to be regretted, for it has sufficient natural advantages to counterbalance even its inaccessibility, were it once known: and in reality it is not by any means inaccessible. Between Mandla and R\u00e1mgarh there are only two ranges of hills to cross, and over one of these a road passable for carts has been made, while over the other there is a very fair path which has been lately widened; but the fact is that the difficulties of the road between Jabalpur and Mandla are quite considerable enough to deter would-be travellers, for they not unnaturally expect to find the whole district the same, and to visitors from the north via Sh\u00e1hpur\u00e1 the aspect of the country is certainly not enticing. The different subdivisions of this tahsil comprise, if possible, more variety of feature than any part of the Mandla tahsil; but the description above of the different soils in the valleys will hold good for the greater part of R\u00e1mgarh also. The two t\u00e1lukas to the eastwards Prat\u00e1pgarh and Mukutp\u00far\u2014Prat\u00e1pgarh and Mukutp\u00far\u2014deserve special mention. The former of the two may be said to be a magnificent pasture, watered by several rivers running near the surface, offering every facility for irrigation, and covered all through the hot-weather months with abundance of short but thick green grass. To the south the Maikal gh\u00e1ts form the boundary, and in these the rivers Kermandali, T\u00e1r, Tur\u00e1r, Seoni, Sont\u00edth, and Chakr\u00e1 take their rise, flowing due north to the Narbad\u00e1, which here forms the northern boundary. The valleys of these rivers are separated by low spurs of hills, running down from the main range towards the Narbad\u00e1, and mostly covered with sal forests. The rivers do not ever, even in the hottest months, become quite dry, and throughout these parts water is at all times procurable near the surface with but little trouble; natural springs are indeed so numerous that there is not one single well in the whole place.\n\nThe formation of the hills all along the south is basalt, capped with laterite, so that iron is abundant. Mukutp\u00far is more hilly than the abovementioned, but has much the same characteristics, the valleys of its several rivers\u2014the Burhner, Kharmfar, Kachn\u00e1rt, Kemar, H\u00e1nt\u00ed, and Kukr\u00e1\u2014being rich in magnificent pastures, with a great extent of black soil, capable of producing any crop. Wheat and gram wherever sown grow luxuriantly. These, with the usual kodo and kutki, are the staple products of the country. These two t\u00e1lukas comprise an area of 1,066 square miles, with a population of about thirty-nine to the square mile, so that large tracts are completely waste. The climate is very variable, the elevation at Chaun\u00e1d\u00fadar, the highest plateau, being the same as at Amarkantak\u20143,400 feet; while K\u00e1rinj\u00ed\u00e1, in the plain below, is 2,696 feet above the sea, and R\u00e1mgarh, sixty miles to the westward, 2,000 feet above the sea. The action of the hot winds is comparatively little felt in these parts; the grass is never parched up even late in May; the nights are always cool, except just at the break of the monsoon in June; and when the hot wind does blow, it is hardly felt till noon, and disappears at sunset. The scenery is picturesque in the extreme near the heads of the valleys of these rivers, the hills being covered with sal forest or their remains. There is no jungle in the lowlands, but the valleys present the appearance of rolling prairies, broken here and there with belts of forest trees, or perhaps a patch of cultivation intersected by the river, with a fringe of green trees on its banks.\n\nLying between the t\u00e1lukas of Mukutp\u00far and the Narbad\u00e1 is the small, but comparatively rich t\u00e1luka of R\u00e1mip\u00far, comprising some of the best villages in the\ntahsil. Of essentially volcanic formation, the appearance of the country when the wheat crops have been cut, and the grass in the plains burnt, is bleak and dismal, for even the sal tree, which grows on the hills bordering the taluka, and on the spurs dividing the rivers Michr\u00e1r and Kutr\u00e1r, is of a dwarfed and stunted description. The rich lands in this taluka are strangely intersected and cut up by spurs of low hills, covered with a variety of siliceous fragments, and quite unfit for any cultivation other than that of kodo.\n\nThe three poorest talukas, with fewer natural resources than the rest, are those of Chauw\u00e1s\u00e1, Mehdw\u00e1n\u00ed, and K\u00e1tot\u00eda.\n\nChauw\u00e1s\u00e1, Mehdw\u00e1n\u00ed, and K\u00e1tot\u00eda.\n\nThey are hilly, cut up with deep ravines, and covered throughout with trap boulders and fragments of igneous rocks; their geological character is volcanic, with laterite resting upon trap in some of the valleys. The soil would be rich were it not for the enormous quantities of stones which crop up in every direction. They are so surrounded by hills and jungles that access to them is at all times difficult, and their population is perhaps even more scanty than that of other parts of the tahsil.\n\nNorth of the Narbad\u00e1 the taluka of Sh\u00e1hp\u00far and K\u00e1rhe Sond\u00e1, buried as it is in the heart of the wilds, is the most backward of all; it is rugged, cut up with deep ravines and rivers, and intersected with high ranges of hills, some very wild and inaccessible. People appear to have a superstitious dread of many parts of it, and caves are pointed out as the homes of evil spirits, into which no human being can venture in safety. There are many Gond villages in the heart of these jungles, which had never been visited by any travellers, and which were quite unknown, except to their own inhabitants, until they were inspected by Captain Ward in the course of the land revenue settlement just completed (1869).\n\nSh\u00e1hp\u00far and N\u00edw\u00e1ns are both much more advanced, with some extent of really good cultivation. Contact with the people of the Jabalp\u00far district has made the inhabitants more civilised, if such an expression can be used of a wild Gond, and better able to hold their own in transactions with traders than their brethren further east. One peculiarity of Sh\u00e1hp\u00far is that the river Silgh\u00ed, which runs through its south-eastern portion, has a fall to the eastward, being an affluent of the Narbad\u00e1, while in the north-west the Sonkal and Kup\u00e1b\u00e1 fall to the west, being affluents of the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed, a tributary of the Son, so that the high land dividing these streams becomes a watershed between Eastern and Western India.\n\nN\u00edw\u00e1ns is much in the same style; but even in its best lands the trap rock is very near the surface, and consequently its covering of black soil is not rich, and is incapable of bearing any crops for long continuously. The range of hills spoken of in the previous paragraph divides its lands, and causes its rivers to flow both to the east and west, the Silgh\u00ed and Gaur falling into the Narbad\u00e1, while the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed, which rises not many miles from the Gaur, but on the northern ridge of the same high land, flows to the north-east until it joins the Son.\n\nThe chief reason for the backward state of the district is the total absence of roads. On coming into the district from the westwards the wildness of the country and its\njungle aspect is striking: the hills are blue, wild, covered with dense scrub jungle, and apparently deserted; through these are nothing but narrow footpaths, touched on either side by jungle and long grass; and stories of deaths from starvation, tigers, or thirst are numerous. From hunger and thirst in the hot weather there is really some danger, but the accounts of tigers are absurdly exaggerated, for when the immense extent of the country is taken into consideration, the number of deaths from tigers is very small. Still there is sufficient truth in the stories to deter timid travellers from undertaking trips into the interior of Mandla. The local authorities have never had any money to spend in opening out communications. The road fund amounts to only about Rs. 1,000 per annum, and the bulk of that is usually expended in keeping open the communication with Jabalp\u00far. It is now under contemplation to make the section of the road between Jabalp\u00far and R\u00e1jp\u00far, and until this is done much cannot be expected from Mandla. Once this road is opened, and trade from the south begins to flow through the district, as it gives every promise of doing, the prosperity of the country must increase. Already even the opening of the Railway to Jabalp\u00far has given an impetus to Mandla trade, and been marked by a greater influx of carts and traders than has ever before been known.\n\nA description of the district would be incomplete without some account of the hills. Of these Chaur\u00e1dad\u00e1r in the Maikal range is the highest and most important. Its height is nearly that of Amarkantak, which is given by Major Wroughton as 3,328 feet at the temples, where the source of the Narbad\u00e1 is said to be, and the hill above these must be from 80 to 100 feet higher, so that the height of Chaur\u00e1dad\u00e1r may be computed to be between 3,200 and 3,400 feet above the level of the sea. The plateau comprises about six square miles, overlooking, to the south, the t\u00e1luka of Lamni, now a portion of the Bil\u00e1sipur district, and to the north the t\u00e1luka of Prat\u00e1epgarh. In the winter months the cold here at nights is intense, and in January and December the thermometer (Fahrenheit) not unfrequently registers six and seven degrees of frost. So late as April the heat is not oppressive even in the hottest hours of the day. Water is abundant near the surface, more than one stream taking its rise in the plateau, and were it not for its inaccessibility, it would be well suited for a sanitarium, for it is cleared of jungle, and consequently feels the effects of all the cool breezes from whatever quarter they may come. It is not nearly so pretty as the Amarkantak plateau, which is about twelve miles to the east of it, but the latter is in the Rew\u00e1 country, while Chaur\u00e1dad\u00e1r forms part of the Mandla district.\n\nIn Sh\u00e1hp\u00far, north of the Narbad\u00e1, and overlooking the Johil\u00e1 N\u00e1di\u2014an affluent of the Son\u2014there are some high and very wild hills, covered with s\u00e1l forests or their remains, and with precipitous descents into the valley of the Johil\u00e1, which here flows at an immense depth through rugged hills, occasionally opening out into small basins. This section of the Maikal gh\u00e1ts in Sh\u00e1hp\u00far is also a part of the watershed of Eastern and Western India, for the Johil\u00e1 flows east, and the water from the top of the hill overhanging it flows into the Narbad\u00e1, and is carried west to the Gulf of Cambay. The hills here are wild in the extreme, very rugged and inaccessible, with but a small Gond and Baig\u00e1 population. Out of the numerous small affluents of the Johil\u00e1, which flow down the northern sides of these hills, the Ganjar and Ganjar\u00ed are the only rivers worthy of mention, and they, not for their size, but for their peculiar falls from the highlands into the valley below, into which they descend by a succession of jumps, as it were, from one plateau on to another. The highest fall is about\nsixty feet, and behind this are some vast caves of unknown extent, which are carefully avoided by the people, as being the homes not only of wild beasts, but of evil spirits, who are said to have resided there ever since the time of the P\u00e1ndavas. All these hills are considered to be especially under the protection of Mah\u00e1deva.\n\nThe formation of almost all the hills in the Maikal range is laterite. Mineral products. Iron-ore is therefore abundant, and the mines near R\u00e1mgarh are said to produce the most valuable metal; but in Mowa\u00ed, also of the R\u00e1\u00fagarh Bichhi\u00e1 tract, there are many good mines, which supply most of the neighbourhood with axe-heads, ploughshares, &c. Coal has not been discovered in any part of the district, though Dr. Spilsberry* notes that it has been found in the Johil\u00e1 river near P\u00e1li of Soh\u00e1gpur. The course of that river, however, lies for but a short distance within the Mandla district. No other minerals have been discovered.\n\nThe geology of the Mandla district presents but little variety; excepting at its southern and eastern confines nearly the whole of its area is covered by overflowing trap. To the south, the formation of the tract of country, on either side of the Banjar, to within a short distance of its junction with the Narbad\u00e1, consists of crystalline rocks, but they are not superficial over any wide extent. Eastward of the Banjar valley, though granite, syenite, and limestone frequently appear on the banks of the streams and form the sides of hills, yet almost everywhere, even to the tops of the highest peaks, trap is the uppermost rock, and sometimes the trap is itself covered by laterite. A bed of this formation occupies a considerable area north of the Chilp\u00ed Gh\u00e1t and R\u00e1j\u00e1dh\u00e1r, interposed, as it were, between the crystalline and trappean rocks.\n\nMandla has few villages which are worthy of the name of town. Mandla, Bahman\u00ed, and Sh\u00e1hpur\u00e1, whose population is respectively 4,336, 2,179, and 1,497, may be said to be, the two first, the only towns in the Mandla tahsil, and the last, in the R\u00e1mgarh tahsil. In many villages b\u00e1z\u00e1sars are held, but none of these can be said to have any real trade, either export or import. There is a considerable traffic in grain throughout the district, but in R\u00e1mgarh it is almost entirely dependent on the foreign traders, who travel through the district with large herds of cattle, and as the people are, to a great extent, dependent on them for a market, they can as a rule pretty well command their own rates\u2014a state of things which would be quite impossible were the country more open and accessible. In Mandla itself there are a few indigenous grain-dealers, as also in the R\u00e1m\u00edpur taluka of R\u00e1mgarh, and in Sh\u00e1hpur\u00e1, on the borders of the Jabalpur district, where the people just come within the range of the high prices prevailing now throughout the surrounding country. In B\u00e1j\u00e1g, until lately, there used to be considerable traffic in country cloths brought for barter in exchange for forest products with the wild tribes who inhabit the Maikal gh\u00e1ts.\n\nThe climate is throughout the district very variable. There is none of the intense heat of Upper India, and the nights as a rule are cool. In Mandla itself it is perhaps hotter than in other parts of the district which are more open, for surrounded as it is by hills, the hot wind blows only in fitful gusts, which prevent the khaskhas tatt\u00eds working with any continued good effect. Away to the east of\n\n* Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, vol. ix. part 2, p. 901, July to December, 1840.\nR\u00e1mgarh the hot winds only last a few hours, beginning between eleven and twelve o'clock and ceasing at sunset, seldom blowing with any great force, and not overpoweringly hot. The hottest time in the year is at the break of the monsoon in June, just before the rains commence, and in September, when they cease. The cold weather commences in October or November and lasts till the end of February; but even in March the heat is nothing to speak of, the thermometer generally ranging between 60 and 85 degrees.\n\nDuring the monsoon the rainfall is heavy, the average measurements being from fifty-six to sixty inches during the season. Rain seldom falls for more than three days without a break, and while the rains last the climate is generally pleasant and variable. Pankh\u00e1s are not absolutely necessary at nights, as frequently the wind off the river Narbad\u00e1 comes up very cold; it is, however, considered dangerous to sleep exposed to its ill effects. Storms are frequent, even during the hot weather. Hail is much dreaded all over the district, as the stones are sometimes of such size, and the storm so violent, that whole fields are swept of their crops as clean as if they had been cut, carried, and carefully gleaned. The hailstones in the month of March are sometimes as large as pigeons' eggs; and heaps of these stones, when collected in a shady place, often remain unmelted the whole of the following day.\n\nMandla has, throughout its length and breadth, a very bad name for fever, and not without cause, as the local type is a virulent disease. It is very fatal in its effects if not properly treated, and does not succumb easily to quinine; strangers are peculiarly subject to it; and the people have a theory that, once cured of a really bad attack, you are free for seven years. Cholera visits the country occasionally, apparently about once in every four or five years. Small-pox is very virulent and fatal; the district can hardly ever be said to be thoroughly free from it, and vaccination having made but little progress, the people suffer greatly.\n\nNo census of the whole district appears to have been taken prior to that of November 1866, nor are there any old settlement records. No comparison therefore can be made in the Mandla tahsil between the present and former rate of the population. Throughout R\u00e1mgarh Captain Wroughton completed his revenue survey in 1842, and in his report the population statistics of each taluka are given. From these it appears that twenty-six years ago the whole population amounted to 41,766 souls. At the time of the last census in 1866 there were 71,621 inhabitants throughout the tahsil\u2014an increase of some seventy-five per cent.\n\nThe population for the whole district is given by the census of 1866 as amounting to 187,699 souls, and of these 127,958 are returned as agriculturists. The average per square mile is only seventy-six, and this alone would seem to be sufficient to account for the very backward state of the district. There is some hope that since this census was taken the population has increased somewhat by foreign immigration, especially during the current year 1869, for the harvests of the two past seasons have been above the average, and consequently, in spite of the high prices ruling for food-grains, the agricultural classes have been prosperous. This has proved a temptation to outsiders, and a considerable number of people both from Rew\u00e1, parts of Sihor\u00e1 of the Jabalp\u00far district, and even from the native states of Bundelkhand, have taken up land in Mandla lately. The following extract from the Census Return of 1866 classifies the population:\u2014\nNo. of houses......42,506\n\nMales. { Adults.............. 54,458 Females. { Adults.............. 55,703\n        Under 14 years... 41,203 Under 14 years... 36,335\n\nPrincipal Castes.\n\n| Brahmans | 6,242 |\n| Rajputs  | 882   |\n| Karmis   | 4,341 |\n| Kachhis  | 2,452 |\n| Mehras   | 6,456 |\n| Pankas   | 8,085 |\n| Baisors  | 2,470 |\n| Ahirs    | 7,829 |\n| Lohars   | 2,847 |\n| Banias, Kuyaths, &c. } | 1,452 |\n\n| Telis     | 5,524 |\n| Lodhis    | 3,546 |\n| Marars    | 2,525 |\n| Other castes | 23,121 |\n| Dhimsars  | 6,934 |\n| Mohammadans | 1,403 |\n| Gonds     | 87,652 |\n| Baigas    | 10,388 |\n| Kols      | 3,550 |\n\nTotal... 187,699\n\nThe original inhabitants of this district are undoubtedly the Gonds and Baigas, who at the present time form the larger share of the population. Next to these the oldest residents may be considered the Brahman families, some of whom affect to trace back their arrival in Mandla to the time of Jadhava Raya in Samvat 415 (A.D. 358), though it is much more probable that they settled here in the reigns of Hirde Sah and Narenda Sah, from Samvat 1663 to 1788 (A.D. 1606 to 1781). The former of these two kings introduced a number of foreigners into the country, especially a large colony of Lodhis, who settled in the valleys of the Banjar, Motiar, and Narbad, gave the name of Hirdenagar to the taluka thus brought into cultivation, and did much, by digging tanks and otherwise, to colonise the best parts of the district. With these exceptions, and that of the Mahto Tel immigration into Ramgarh at a much later period, there is no other trace of the population of the district having been recruited from foreign resources. These Mahtos are without exception the best cultivating class in the Ramgarh tahsil. They have almost taken possession of the rich taluka of Ramipur, and brought it into really fair order. They are a thriving, pushing race, a little inclined to be turbulent, but devoted to agriculture. The first pioneers of this class are said to have been brought into Ramgarh some eighty or ninety years ago, but these were only a stray family or two. The bulk of the Mahto emigrants who have settled in Ramipur must have come in since 1842, for Captain Wroughton then reports that the population there was comprised solely of Gonds and Baigas, and that the cultivation then amounted to 18,500 acres, most of it of the poorest kind, whereas now (1869) there are 28,785 acres cultivated.\n\nThese people are Hindus, originally of the Tel caste, and formerly resident at Maihir. Their tradition is that between two hundred and three hundred years ago a Rathor Tel of that place became disgusted with his hereditary avocation of oil-pressing, and determined to do what he could to raise himself and his people to a better position. As he was a wealthy and influential man, he succeeded in collecting around him a considerable number of followers, who accepted him as their leader, gave up oil-pressing as a profession, and took to cultivation. The other tribes disliked his proceedings. He was sufficiently powerful to hold his own against them, and eventually the then Rajah of Maihir\nwas persuaded to take the new sect under his protection, raise them above the rank of the common Telis, and allow them to take the name of a Sanskrit word signifying great, which has been corrupted by course of time into \"M\u00e1hto.\"\n\nThe R\u00e1jputs are but few; they are supposed to be descendants of the hangers-on of the old kings of Mandla, and appear to be mostly of impure blood. Among them are a number of R\u00e1j-Gonds, who ape the manners and customs of the Hind\u00fas, and are often more attentive to their religious observances than the Hind\u00fas. These always wear the Jane\u00fa or Br\u00e1hmanical thread, while the original R\u00e1jputs of purer descent are frequently seen without it. With the exception of the Gonds and Baig\u00e1s, none of the other tribes appear to call for separate mention.\n\nIn Mandla the Gond race is divided into two classes, which again are subdivided into forty-two different castes or gots.\n\nGonds. The two classes are the R\u00e1j-Gonds and the R\u00e1wan Bans\u00eds. The former is the highest of the two, and shows the advantage of even the spurious civilisation with which it has been brought in contact. They outdo the highest caste Hind\u00fas in the matter of purifying themselves, and ape them in all their religious ceremonies. They wear the Jane\u00fa or Br\u00e1hmanical thread, and consider themselves deeply insulted if compared in status with a Gond. Mr. Hislop * says that they carry their passion for purification so far that they have the faggots with which their food is cooked sprinkled with water before use. They may be said to have benefited by their connection with the Hind\u00fas so far that they have certainly given up many of the filthy habits of their own tribe, and if they are a little over-scrupulous in aping the Hind\u00fa religion, they are very much the cleaner for it. The R\u00e1wan Bans\u00ed tribe is split up into the following castes or gots:\n\n| Mar\u00f3b\u00ed. | Kumbar\u00e1. |\n|---------|----------|\n| Mark\u00e1m. | Danket\u00ed. |\n| Warkar\u00e1. | A\u0301rmon. |\n| Sr\u00ed A\u0301m. | Kor\u00e1p\u00e1. |\n| Tekam. | S\u00edm\u00e1. |\n| Dhord\u00e1. | A\u0301mdan. |\n| Karyain. | Temer\u00eda. |\n| Warwit\u00ed. | Darz\u00e1m. |\n| Part\u00edll. | Kind\u00e1m. |\n| Sarj\u00e1n. | Korch\u00fa. |\n| Chichain. | Kalk\u00fa. |\n| Markol\u00e1. | Temirach\u00ed. |\n| Sarot\u00e1. | A\u0301meg\u00e1. |\n| Paol\u00ed. | Mehr\u00e1m. |\n| Bhagdy\u00e1. | Kur\u00e1m. |\n| Wuik\u00e1. | Nakm\u00e1. |\n| Pand\u00fa. |\n\nTo these may be added the following:\n\n| Aghari\u00e1 or Muk\u00ed. | Barhay\u00e1. |\n|------------------|----------|\n| Pardh\u00e1n Path\u00e1ri | Bhen\u00e1. |\n| or Gugy\u00e1.       | Bhiman. |\n| Dh\u00e1l\u00fd\u00e1.         | Ghasi\u00e1. |\n\n* Papers relating to the Aboriginal Tribes of the Central Provinces, Edn. 1866, p. 5.\nThese last differ in some slight peculiarities from the Gonds, but undoubtedly belong to the same race. The Pardh\u00e1ns act as bards to the Gonds, and attend at births, deaths, and marriages. The Aghari\u00e1 is a worker in iron; he frequents the Baig\u00e1 villages, and acts as blacksmith to the whole community\u2014no light task where the iron-ore has to be dug from the hill, carried to the village forge, smelted, and then worked up to meet the wants of the people. These people may be set down as the laziest and most drunken of all the Gonds.\n\nMr. Hislop,* no mean authority, describes the Gond of the N\u00e1gpur country thus:\u2014\"A little below the average height of Europeans, and in complexion darker than the generality of Hind\u00fas; bodies well proportioned, but features rather ugly\u2014a roundish head, distended nostrils, wide mouth, thickish lips, straight black hair, and scanty beard and mustaches. Both hair and features are decidedly Mongolian.\" The description agrees very well with the Gonds above the gh\u00e1ts. Their women are as a rule better looking than the men. Gonds' wives are looked upon as so much property, for they are expected to do not only all the household work, but the bulk of the agricultural labour also. It is a common expression among them, when speaking of a well-to-do farmer, to say that he is a man of some substance, having four or five wives; occasionally they have seven, but this is exceptional, and the poor content themselves with one.\n\nIn dress the women are usually decent, though they wear only the dhoti and shoulder-cloth of coarse country-made stuffs, white, with a coloured thread border. For ornaments they wear strings of red and white beads, ear-rings of brass wire in coil, and polished zinc bosses; sometimes nose-rings of the same, and anklets and armlets of copper and zinc mixed, or of pewter and zinc. These, with the inevitable \"kar\u00e1s\" of lac, make up the sum total of their attempts at adornment. Wild as these people are, and scanty as is their dress, they are by no means above a certain amount of vanity, and show that the use of false hair is not confined to their civilised sisters of Europe. On festive occasions they wind long tresses of sheep or goat's wool in their own hair, which is generally worn long, and tied up in a bunch behind, somewhat in the style adopted by European ladies of the present day. They wear no other covering for their heads, but occasionally adorn their hair with small brass coins and glass beads. They are tattooed at an early age, some much more than others, and allow themselves to be put to a considerable amount of pain in the performance. The Pardh\u00e1ns and Dholy\u00e1ns are the people who practise the art of tattooing, and some have quite a local reputation for their skill in the art, and for the successful patterns with which they adorn the bodies of their victims. They usually work with needles, and rub in indigo and gunpowder or saltpetre.\n\nWild, uncivilised, and ignorant, the Gonds are among themselves honest, faithful, and trustworthy, courageous in some points, and truthful as regards faults they have committed (as a rule they plead guilty when brought before the courts). As a race they are now well behaved and very amenable to authority, however turbulent they may have been in former days. They occasionally exercise their talents in cattle-lifting, but when the innumerable opportunities which they have are taken into consideration, and the facilities with which crime of this sort might be committed, it seems wonderful that there is not very much\n\n* Papers relating to the Aboriginal Tribes of the Central Provinces, Edn. 1866, p. 1.\nmore. The Gond in service is exceptionally faithful and obedient to his employer, so much so that he would not hesitate to commit any crime at his orders, and sooner than turn informer would himself die. This description applies only to the really wild Gonds, who have not become contaminated by contact with spurious civilisation, for the domesticated Gond is mean, cringing, cowardly, and as great a liar as any other low class of Indian. Under favourable circumstances Gonds are strong and well proportioned, though slightly built, very expert with the axe, and, though lazy, do not make bad farm servants. They still like strong liquors; but Mr. Hislop's remark* that \"their acts of worship invariably end in intoxication\" is too sweeping at the present day. Spirits are a necessary part of their religious ceremonies; but drinking to excess appears to be becoming less common among them, and in some parts the Gonds have almost given up the use of spirits and taken to gur (unrefined sugar) as a stimulant in its place. This change has been in a manner almost compulsory, for the introduction of the central distillery system, and the enforcement of the prescribed penalties for illicit distillery, for a time rendered it difficult to procure spirits, and afterwards the natural apathy of the Gond and his dislike to over-exertion made him prefer doing without spirits, to travelling a number of miles to the nearest licensed vendor's shop.\n\nThe number of their deities seems everywhere to differ. Mr. Hislop says \u2020 that he never could get any one man to name more than seven. The best known are D\u00fal\u00e1deo, Nar\u00e1in Deo, Suraj Deo, M\u00e1t\u00e1 Dev\u00ed, Bar\u00e1 Deo, Khair M\u00e1t\u00e1, Th\u00e1kur Deo, and Ghansy\u00e1m Deo. Besides these the Gond peoples the forests, in which he lives, with spirits of all kinds, most of them vested with the power of inflicting evil, and quite inclined to use their power. To propitiate them he sets up \"p\u00e1ts\" in spots selected either by himself or by his ancestors, and there performs certain rites, generally consisting of small offerings on stated days. These p\u00e1ts are sometimes merely a bamboo with a piece of rag tied to the end, a heap of stones, or perhaps only a few pieces of rag tied to the branches of a tree. However, the spirit is supposed to have taken up his abode there, and in consequence, on the occasion of any event of importance happening in the Gond's family, the spirit has his share of the good things going, in the shape of a little spirit, and possibly a fowl sacrificed to him. In Mandla, Th\u00e1kur Deo is supposed to represent especially the household deity, and to preside over the well-being of the house and farm-yard; he has no special residence, but has the credit of being omnipresent, and is consequently not represented by any image. In R\u00e1mgarh too this deity is held in great reverence, but there he is supposed to occupy more than one shape. One village (J\u00e1t\u00e1) in the Sh\u00e1lip\u00far taluka is said to be very highly favoured as one of the residences of their deity. Captain Ward was shown there a few links of a roughly-forged chain which the superstition of the people had gifted with the power of voluntary motion; this chain looked very old, and no one could say how long it had been at J\u00e1t\u00e1; it was occasionally found hanging on a ber tree, sometimes on a stone under the tree, and at others in the bed of a neighbouring n\u00e1l\u00e1. At the time of Captain Ward's visit it was on the stone under the tree, from which it was said to have descended four days before. Each of these movements is made the occasion of some petty sacrifice, of which the attendant Baig\u00e1 priest reaps the benefit, so that\n\n* Papers relating to the Aboriginal Tribes of the Central Provinces, Edn. 1866, p. 1.\n\u2020 Ibid., p. 14.\nit is of course to his advantage to work on the credulity of the Gonds; he does not, however, appear to abuse his power, as these movements only occur about once in four months, so that the Gonds can hardly complain of being priest-ridden to any extent. None of the people will touch the chain in which they suppose the deity to be incorporated. In the taluka of Shahpur there are several places where Gond deities are said to reside, and the wild rugged nature of the country, with its hills rent into vast chasms by volcanic action in former periods, and full of vast caverns and passages, apparently running deep into the bowels of the earth, is quite sufficient to persuade a superstitious creature like the Gond that it must be the very home of deities and evil spirits. Throughout the greater part of Rangarh, and also in parts of Mandla, Ghansyam Deo is held in great reverence, and about one hundred yards from each village where he is in favour a small hut is built for him. It is generally of the rudest material, with little attempt at ornamentation. A bamboo, with a red or yellow rag tied to the end, is planted in one corner, an old withered garland or two is hung up, and a few blocks of rough stone, some smeared with vermilion, are strewn about the place, which is thus especially dedicated to Ghansyam Deo. He is considered the protector of the corps, and in the month of Kartik (November) the whole village assembles at his shrine to worship him; sacrifices of fowls and spirits, or a pig occasionally, according to the size of the village, are offered, and Ghansyam is said to descend upon the head of one of the worshippers, who is suddenly seized with a kind of fit, and after staggering about for a little, rushes off into the wildest jungles, where, the popular theory is, if not pursued and brought back, he would inevitably die of starvation, a raving lunatic; for, as it is, after being brought back by one or two men, who are sent after him, he does not recover his senses for one or two days. The idea is that one man is thus singled out as a scapegoat for the sins of the rest of the village.\n\nSmall-pox is worshipped under the name of \"Mata Devi,\" and cholera under that of \"Marf.\" They try to ward off the anger of these evil spirits, as they consider them, by sacrifices, and by thoroughly cleaning their villages, and transferring the sweepings across their own boundary into some road or travelled track. Their idea is that unless the disease is thus communicated to some passer-by, who will take it on to the next village, it will not leave them. For this reason they decline throwing the sweepings into a jungle, as no one passes that way, and consequently the benefit of the sweeping is lost. Bara Deo and Dul Deo are also favourites among the people, and have a considerable amount of attention paid them; while Sura Deo, Narain Deo, and the others are more or less neglected in Mandla, where religious ceremonies are never carried to any very high pitch. The priests of the tribe are the Baigas, and as these people seem to belong to a different stock from the Gonds, they will be described separately.\n\nSome of the Gond ceremonies are peculiar. Thus they have seven different kinds of marriages, some much more binding than others, but all supposed to contain a sufficient quantum of matrimonial sanctity about them. The first and the surest is the Byah Shadi. When a Gond wants to marry his daughter, he first looks for a husband among his sister's children, as it is considered the proper thing for first-cousins to marry whenever such an arrangement is possible; though, strange to say, the rule is only thought absolutely binding where the brother's child happens to be a girl, and the sister's a boy. Even in the opposite case,\nhowever, it is very generally done, as by so providing for a relation for life, the man is said to have performed a very right and proper act. Another reason is that less expense is entailed in marrying a relation than the daughter of a stranger, who is apt to be more exacting. Among the poorer classes who can offer no money as a dower, the bridegroom serves the bride's father for periods varying from seven or eight months to three years, or sometimes more, according to arrangements made by the parents. When the children are ten or twelve years old only, a committee of the village elders is generally held, and the term of the apprenticeship decided; the term of service being usually somewhat longer when the youth is serving his uncle for his cousin, as relations are supposed not to exact so much work from the \"Lamjina.\" The youth lives in one of the outhouses, and has to perform all the menial work of the household, both in the house and in the field. During his period of probation he is forbidden to hold any intercourse with the girl. This is called Lamjina Sh\u00e1d\u00ed. Another description of marriage is when the woman makes her own match, and declining the husband provided for her by her relatives, runs away with the man of her choice; this is called the marriage \"Ba ikhtiy\u00e1ri aurat,\" or of the woman's own will. A case of this sort seldom happens. It is, however, quite recognised among the Gonds that the women have the right to take their own way if they have the courage; and the elders of the village in which the man resides generally endeavour to arrange matters to the satisfaction of all parties. Connected with the above marriage is another called \"Sh\u00e1d\u00ed Bandhon\u00ed,\" or compulsory marriage. Even after the girl has run away from her father's house, and taken up her residence in the house of the man of her choice, it is quite allowable for the man she has deserted to assert his rights to her person by carrying her off by force; in fact not only is this right allowed to the deserted lover, but any one of the girl's first-cousins may forcibly abduct her and keep her himself, if he has the power. Once carried off, she is kept in the house of her captor, carefully watched, until she finds it is useless to attempt to resist, and gives in. Occasionally where the girl has made what is considered an objectionable match with a poor man, who has few friends, abductions of this sort are successfully carried out; but as a rule they are not attempted. The \"Sh\u00e1d\u00ed Baitho\" is for the very poorest people, or girls with no relations. In the latter case she selects some man of her acquaintance, and going to his house takes up her abode there. He signifies his acceptance by putting on her arms the bangles or \"ch\u00faris,\" and giving a small feast to the village elders. Sometimes he objects, if the woman is useless or of bad character; but he gets little redress from the elders; and unless he can induce some other man to take her off his hands, he is generally supposed to be bound to keep the woman. As, however, the women are usually good labourers, and well worthy of their hire, a man of property seldom raises any objection; the women too are usually quite sufficiently worldly-wise to choose for their keepers men fairly well-to-do.\n\nWidows are expected to remarry, and the Gond customs provide for their remarriage in two ways\u2014the \"Ch\u00fari\u00e1 Pahann\u00e1 Sh\u00e1d\u00ed,\" and the \"K\u00e1r\u00ed Sh\u00e1d\u00ed.\" The first consists simply in the woman proceeding to the house of the man she has agreed to live with after her husband's death. The other is where the younger brother marries his elder brother's widow, which he is expected to do by the custom of the tribe, unless the widow should insist upon making some other arrangement for herself. The ceremony in both of these cases consists simply of a presentation of bangles by the husband to the wife, and of a feast to the village elders. Elder\nbrothers are not allowed to marry the widows of their younger brothers. The only limit to the number of wives a Gond may have is his power of supporting them.\n\nCremation is considered the most honourable mode of disposing of the dead, but being expensive, is very seldom resorted to, except in the cases of the elders of the tribe. The rule is that, if possible, men over fifty should be burned; but as these wild tribes have no means of telling the ages of their friends, it results that all old men are burned. Women are always buried. Formerly the Gonds used to bury their dead in the houses in which they died, just deep enough to prevent their being dug up again by the dogs; now they have generally some place set apart as a burial-ground near the village. Their funeral ceremonies are very few; the grave is dug so that the head shall lie to the south and the feet to the north; the idea being that the deceased has gone to the home of the deities, which is supposed to be somewhere in the north; but the Gonds do not appear to have any real theory as regards an after-life, or the immortality of the soul. They seem to consider that man is born to live a certain number of years on the earth, and having fulfilled his time to disappear. When the father of a family dies his spirit is supposed to haunt the house in which he lived until it is laid. The ceremony for this purpose may be gone through apparently at any time after death from one month to a year and a half, or even to two years. During that period the spirit of the deceased is the only object of worship in the house. A share of the daily food is set aside for him, and he is supposed to remain in the house and watch over its inmates. After his funeral, when, if the relatives can afford it, they clothe the corpse in a new dress, a little turmeric and a piece is tied up in a cloth, and suspended by the Baig\u00e1 to one of the beams of the house; there it remains until the time comes to lay the spirit, which is done by the Baig\u00e1 removing the cloth, and offering it, with a portion of the flesh of a goat or a pig, to the god of the village; a feast is given to the relations and elders, and the ceremony is complete.\n\nThe Baig\u00e1s are the acknowledged superiors of the Gond races, being their priests and their authorities in all points of religious observance. The decision of the Baig\u00e1 in a boundary dispute is almost always accepted as final, and from this right as children of the soil, and arbitors of the land belonging to each village, they are said to have derived their title of Bh\u00fami\u00e1, the Sanscrit word \"Bh\u00fami\" meaning the earth. In the Mandla district the two words Bh\u00fami\u00e1 and Baig\u00e1 are certainly synonymous and interchangeable. In language the Baig\u00e1s differ entirely from the Gond, their vocabulary consisting almost altogether of Hindi words. They belong to three sects or castes\u2014the Binjw\u00e1r or Bichw\u00e1r, the Mund\u00edy\u00e1 and the Bhirontiy\u00e1\u2014each of which is subdivided into seven other classes as follows:\n\n1. Mar\u00e1b\u00ed.\n2. Mark\u00e1m.\n3. Umar\u00ed\u00e1.\n4. Subhary\u00e1.\n5. Chulpury\u00e1.\n6. Kusy\u00e1r.\n7. Barhary\u00e1.\n\nThe Binjw\u00e1rs are said to be the highest caste, and from these chiefly the priests of the tribe and of the Gonds are derived. They live quite distinct from any other race, and though nominally often in the same village as Gonds, the Baig\u00e1 settlement is usually at some little distance from the Gond quarter\u2014often on the very top of a high hill over the latter.\nIn physical appearance the Baig\u00e1s differ so much as almost to defy description. One sect\u2014the Mund\u00edy\u00e1\u2014is known by the head being shaven all but one lock. The Binjw\u00e1rs on the other hand wear their hair long, never cutting it, and tie it up in a knot behind; so do the Bhirontiy\u00e1s. In stature some are taller than Gonds, but as a rule they are all very much below the average height of Europeans. The Baig\u00e1s to the eastwards, on the Maikal range, are much finer specimens of humanity than those near Mandla. In habits too they are superior, being a fine manly race, and better looking than their brethren near Mandla. They have not the flat head and nose and receding forehead so common among the Gonds; the head is longer, the features more aquiline, and the hands are peculiarly small. Some among them have, however, all the types of low civilisation\u2014flat heads, thick lips, and distended nostrils; but on the whole the appearance of these Baig\u00e1s of the Eastern Gh\u00e1ts is striking, as compared with that of other wild tribes.\n\nIn character too they differ much from the more degenerate aboriginal races. Fearless, trustworthy, independent, ready enough to give their opinion, and very willing to assist, they manage their communities in a way deserving of high praise. Social crimes, such as abduction of women, are more or less prevalent among them, but these cases are always decided by the village elders, generally to the satisfaction of all parties. Thefts among each other seem unknown, except perhaps in years of scarcity, when it is not uncommon for a man to help himself to grain from his neighbour's field; but self-preservation is held to be the first law of nature, and the elders do not punish these offences very severely. Of slight wiry build, they are very hardy, extremely active, and first-rate sportsmen. Cunning in making traps and pitfalls, and capital shots with their small bows and arrows, they soon clear the whole country of game; persevering to a degree, they never leave the track of blood; and the poison on their arrows is so deadly to the animal struck, that sooner or later it is certain to die. Unarmed, save with the axe, they wander about the wildest jungles; and the speed with which they fly up a tree on any alarm of tigers is wonderful; yet the courageous way in which they stand by each other, on an emergency, shows that they are by no means wanting in boldness. Their skill in the use of the axe is extraordinary, and they often knock over small deer, hares, and peacocks with it. It is indeed by no means rare to see panthers brought in either speared, or knocked on the head with the axe. Their capabilities of standing fatigue and privation are remarkable. On their hunting expeditions, which sometimes last three or four days, they subsist almost entirely either on what they kill, or, if unsuccessful, on roots and fruits found in the forests. When they are preparing a hill side for their d\u00e1hya cultivation, from morning till night in the hottest weather the ring of their axes is incessant, and even this is followed by harder work still, when they set to work dragging the logs into proper position. Even when occupied with his fields, the love of field-sports seems inherent in the Baig\u00e1, and in the rains, when he has little else to do, he and his companions amuse themselves with running down s\u00e1mbar and spotted deer with their dogs, following them into the water, and killing them with their axes when brought to bay.\n\nTheir dress is as scanty as it well can be\u2014in the hot weather certainly not sufficient for decency, consisting of the very smallest rag round the loins in the shape of a\n\"langott.\" This is supplemented in the cold season with a cloth worn crosswise over the shoulders and chest. The women dress decently, and are like the Gonds in appearance, wearing much the same ornaments. Both sexes affect strings of red and white beads, but the males leave them off when they are married. A very favourite ornament among them is the rupee, and to the east the fortunate possessor of so large a coin generally wears it round his neck. The women are all tattooed, and, like the Gonds, they wear bunches of wool tied up in their own hair. They are no cleaner than their neighbours, neither sex affecting the use of cold water any more than can be helped.\n\nIn their religious ceremonies they much resemble the Gonds, reverencing the same gods, but adding to them as the chief object of worship the mother earth, \"Mai Dharitri.\"\n\nThakur Deo is supposed to have special charge of the village, and is honoured accordingly. But the Baigas have a great belief in the spirits which are supposed to haunt the forests; and in the localities which are more especially the homes of these spirits, \"pats\" are set up, each under the charge of an appointed Baiga. There appears to be no especial rule regarding the institution of a pat. Sometimes it is the place where a man has been killed by a tiger or a snake; sometimes no reason whatever is given for the selection. In connection with these pats they have a peculiar ceremony for laying the spirit of a man killed by a tiger. Until it is gone through neither Gond nor Baiga will go into the jungle if he can help it, as they say that not only does the spirit of the dead man walk, but the tiger is also possessed for the nonce with an additional spirit of evil, which increases his powers of intelligence and ferocity, rendering him more formidable than usual, and more eager to pursue his natural enemy\u2014man. Some of the Baigas are supposed to be gifted with great powers of witchcraft, and it is common for a Baiga medicine-man to be called in to bewitch the tigers, and so prevent their carrying off the village cattle. The Gonds thoroughly believe in the powers of these men. Their other religious ceremonies are mostly the same as those of the Gonds; and at marriages, deaths, and births, much the same rites are observed.\n\nThe Baigas take considerable care in selecting the sites for their villages, which are usually located on the southern side of a hill, and on rising ground, a little above where their supply of water is taken from. They are generally sufficiently elevated for the square, in which they are arranged, to be naturally well drained; and the women are expected to keep it clean. In the middle a heap of firewood is piled up, round which the village elders assemble if there is work to be done. Buried as they are in the heart of the jungles, these villages are very difficult to find, for one may be on the top of a high hill, and the next is low down in the valley. The manner in which their village communities are regulated is really remarkable; and it is impossible not to admire their wild and independent spirit. They do not hide themselves in the jungles from any fear of man, but simply because they prefer the wild life, free from restraint, to any more civilised state.\n\nAs the dahya cultivation covers a large area in this district, it must be prominently mentioned. With no other instrument of agriculture but their axe, and a small sickle (\"hansy\u00e1\"), it is astonishing to see the extent of clearing that one village of Baigas makes on the sides of the hills on which their village is located. Until lately it was their habit to select the spots for their dahyas with an utter\ndisregard for all the rules of forest conservancy. In the cold weather months they cut down sufficient wood to cover pretty closely the whole of the area they mean to bring under cultivation. In May and June, just before the setting in of the rains, this wood and the brushwood into which it has fallen, are set on fire, and almost before the fire is out the Baigas may be seen raking up the ashes, and spreading them over the whole surface of the field. This is done either with a bundle of thorns or with long bamboos, until there is a superstratum of about an inch of ashes spread over the ground; in these ashes they sow kodo (*paspalum frumentaceum*), kutki, and occasionally a poor specimen of rice called here \"baigana.\" Owing to their position on the side of a hill, the ashes are cut up into furrows by the action of the rains, and often much of the seed must be washed away altogether, but sufficient seems to remain for the Baigas' wants. When sown the field is fenced round very roughly and strongly, small trees being felled so as to fall one on to the other. The interstices are then filled in with bamboos, and the boughs are carefully interlaced, so that not even the smallest kind of deer can effect an entrance. In addition to this, where there is any danger of the crops being eaten up by buffaloes or bison, which push through any ordinary fence, the Baigas bury a line of broad-bladed spears, called \"damsa,\" in the ground, at about the spot where these beasts would land if they jumped the fence; they then watch their opportunity, and sneaking round to the opposite side give a series of yells, which send the cattle off terrified over or through the fence. Generally more than one is wounded, and often one killed on the spot; the rest, once started, make straight away, and never visit that field again. In the fences round these \"bemars,\" as these patches of cultivation are called, are usually two or three cunningly-contrived traps for small deer, and several nooses for peacocks, hares, &c.; these the Baiga carefully examines every morning, and great is his delight when occasionally he finds a panther crushed under one of the traps.\n\nOne of these \"bemars\" lasts the Baiga at the outside three years. He usually leaves sufficient wood on the ground the first season to last for a second season's burning. The third year, if by chance he should make up his mind to stick to one field for so long, his labour is much enhanced, as he has to cut and drag the requisite wood for some little distance, and lay it over his fields. In addition to this, the outturn of the crops falls off every year, so that altogether he has every inducement to change the *locale* of his cultivation, and, where no restriction has been put on his movements, as a rule he does so.\n\nIt takes six or seven years before one of these old \"bemars\" is sufficiently covered with wood again to make it worth the Baiga's while to cultivate it a second time. In three years it is probably covered with densely-covered brushwood; but this, if burnt, leaves so little ash that it has to be largely supplemented with timber, and as this has been previously cut all round the clearing, it becomes a work of supererogation to take up one of these old plots before the wood is well grown again, when other, and more suitable land is available.\n\nThe ordinary cultivation in Mandla does not differ from that prevailing in the Province generally, and therefore needs no special notice.\n\nIt was only three centuries ago that Mandla became known as the chief seat of the Gond kingdom. Prior to that it formed but an insignificant part of the country known as\nGondw\u00e1na. According to Sir W. Sleeman* the Garh\u00e1 Mandla dynasty first became powerful in the reign of Sangr\u00e1m S\u00e1, who before his death in A.D. 1530 had extended his dominion over fifty-two \"garhs\" or provinces, comprising the present districts of Mandla, Jabalp\u00far, Damoh, S\u00e1g\u00e1r, Narsinghp\u00far, Seoni, and part of Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d, and the principality of Bhop\u00e1l. Mandla itself seems, however, to have been added to the dominions of the Gondw\u00e1na princes by Gop\u00e1l S\u00e1 as early as A.D. 684, and then it was that the whole kingdom became first known as Garh\u00e1 Mandla. To give even a brief history of this dynasty would be impossible here. Their names and the dates of their probable accession to the throne, as given by Sir W. Sleeman, are shown in the following list:\n\n| Years | Name |\n|-------|------|\n| 1. Jadhava R\u00e9ya An: Sam 415, reigned | 5\u2020 |\n| 2. M\u00e1dhava Sinha, his son | 33 |\n| 3.

The whole of this historical sketch is abstracted from the above article, which is believed to be founded principally on the chronicles of the B\u00e1jp\u00e1i family, who were the hereditary prime ministers of the Gond princes.\n\n\u2020 Some of the periods given for reigns are probably open to modification, as is shown by Captain Ward in the Mandla Settlement Report, but it has been thought best to follow a single authority, as it would be difficult to clear up the discrepancies.\n\n\u2021 \"He built the town of Gorakhp\u00far near Jabalp\u00far, and another of the same name in Barg\u00ed.\"\nThe names, from that of J\u00e1dhava R\u00e1ya, the first, down to Prem S\u00e1, the fifty-third on the list, were found engraved in Sanskrit on a stone in the temple at R\u00e1mnagar, which was built, it is said, by the son of the latter prince. Though the history of Gondw\u00e1na prior to the accession of J\u00e1dhava R\u00e1ya is more or less shadowy and uncertain, it seems at least highly probable that he received the kingdom from his father-in-law, the Gond r\u00e1j\u00e1 N\u00e1gdeva, about Samvat 415, or A.D. 358, and that while with the latter passed away the old Gond dynasty, in the person of J\u00e1dhava R\u00e1ya, there commenced the long line of Gond-R\u00e1jput sovereigns, who ruled for a period of 1,400 years. The story regarding the end of the original Gond rulers, and the succession of the R\u00e1jput J\u00e1dhava R\u00e1ya, as told by Sir W. Sleeman, is as follows:\u2014J\u00e1dhava R\u00e1ya while in the service of one of the Haihai-S\u00e1ris rulers dreamed that he should one day receive sovereign power. A certain holy Br\u00e1hman interpreting his dream advised him to enter the service of the Gond r\u00e1j\u00e1 N\u00e1gdeva (also called Dh\u00e1ru S\u00e1), which he did, and eventually married the old r\u00e1j\u00e1's daughter and only child. N\u00e1gdeva finding himself sinking, and having no hope of an heir to his throne, determined to appeal to heaven to choose one for him, and on an occasion of great solemnity, J\u00e1dhava R\u00e1ya was unmistakeably pointed out by the gods as his successor. On ascending the throne, J\u00e1dhava R\u00e1ya made the Br\u00e1hman, Sarbh\u00ed P\u00e1thak, his prime minister, and while the descendants of the one reigned from A.D. 358 down to the time of the S\u00e1gar conquest in A.D. 1781, the descendants of the other discharged the duties of prime minister for the same long period. After Sangr\u00e1m S\u00e1, who has already been mentioned as the founder of the Gond power on a large scale, there is little worthy of record until we come, in the year 1560, to the regency of R\u00e1n\u00ed Durg\u00e1vati, widow of Dalpat S\u00e1. \"Of all the sovereigns of this dynasty,\" says Sir W. Sleeman, \"she lives most in the grateful recollection of the people; she carried out many highly useful works in different parts of her kingdom, and one of the large reservoirs near Jabalp\u00far is still called the 'R\u00e1n\u00ed T\u00e1l\u00e1o,' in memory of her. During the fifteen years of her regency she did much for the country, and won the hearts of the people, while her end was as noble and devoted as her life had been useful.\n\nIn 1564* A\u0301saf Kh\u00e1n, the imperial viceroy at Kara M\u00e1nikp\u00far on the Ganges, invaded the Gondw\u00e1na kingdom at the head of a considerable force. The queen regent met him near the fort of Singaurgarh (in the Jabalp\u00far district), whence, having been defeated, she retired upon Garh\u00e1, and again towards Mandka, where she took up a strong position in a narrow defile. A\u0301saf Kh\u00e1n, who could not bring up his artillery, was here repulsed with loss, but on the following day the battle was renewed, and by that time the guns had come up, and the queen was compelled to give way. Mounted on an elephant, she refused to retire, though she was severely wounded, until her troops had time to recover the shock of the first discharge of artillery, and notwithstanding that she had received an arrow-wound in her eye, bravely defended the pass in person. But by an extraordinary coincidence the river in the rear of her position, which had been nearly dry a few hours before the action commenced, began suddenly to rise, and soon became unfordable. Finding her plan of retreat thus frustrated, and seeing her troops give way, she snatched a dagger from her elephant-driver and plunged it into her bosom. A\u0301saf Kh\u00e1n acquired an immense booty, including, it is said, more than a thousand elephants. He was so elated with his success that he determined to become an independent prince, and actually maintained some show of independence for a few years, when he\n\n* Compare Briggs' Varishta, Edn. 1829, vol. ii. pp. 217, 218.\nwas pardoned,* and returned to his allegiance. On his departure the dominion reared up by Sangram S\u00e1 received its first serious shock in the loss of ten districts (afterwards formed into the state of Bhop\u00e1l), which were ceded to the Emperor Akbar, to obtain his recognition of the succession of Chandra S\u00e1, the brother of Dalpat S\u00e1. Thenceforward, until the Moghul empire lost its prestige, the princes of this line seem to have admitted their subjection to the imperial power, for we find the next two of them visiting Delhi to pay their respects to the Emperor. In the reign of Prem Narayan, the grandson of Chandra S\u00e1, occurred the Bundel\u00e1 invasion, conducted by J\u00fajh\u00e1r Singh, raja of Orchha, which is remarkable as the first of those encroachments by neighbouring princes which by degrees sapped away the strength of the Garh\u00e1 Mandla kingdom. Prem Narayan took refuge from the invading army in the castle of Chaunragarh, in the Narsinghpur district, but he was treacherously assassinated, and the fort fell. His successor Hirde S\u00e1 repulsed the Bundelas and re-established his power by the aid of the Mohammadan chief of Bhop\u00e1l, to obtain which, however, he had to cede territory containing 300 villages.\n\nAfter this Hirde S\u00e1 had a long and prosperous reign, during which he constructed, among other works of utility, the Gang\u00e1 Sagar\u2014a fine piece of water near Garh\u00e1. An inscription on a stone at R\u00e1nnagar, made in his reign, bears the date Samvat 1724, or A.D. 1667. Again, in the reign of his great grandson Narendra S\u00e1 the Garh\u00e1 Mandla territories suffered serious diminution. The young prince, opposed by his cousin Pah\u00e1r Singh, had to obtain the recognition of the Emperor by the cession of the four districts of Dh\u00e1mon\u00ed, Garh\u00e1 Kot\u00e1, and Sh\u00e1hgarh (in the modern S\u00e1gar), and Mari\u00e1 Doh (in the modern Damoh). Even after Pah\u00e1r Singh\u2019s death, his sons, obtaining for the first time in Mandla history Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 aid, kept up the family feuds, and though they were eventually defeated and killed, the struggle cost Narendra S\u00e1 great part of his dominions, which he was obliged to cede to neighbouring princes to buy their aid. He thus lost the country forming the modern district of Seoni to Bakht Buland, the celebrated ruler who had raised the Gond chieftainship of Deogarh to the rank of a powerful principality; while to Chhatra S\u00e1l, the equally well known Bundel\u00e1 raja, who made Pann\u00e1 a formidable power, he ceded the western and the southern portions of S\u00e1gar and the southern portion of Damoh, the northern parts of both districts having already passed out of his hands into those of the Emperor. He died in 1781, leaving to his son Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j S\u00e1 only twenty-nine of the fifty-two districts which had composed the Mandla dominions in the reign of Sangram S\u00e1. In 1742 the Peshw\u00e1 invaded the country, and after defeating and killing Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j S\u00e1, placed his son Seo Raj S\u00e1 on the throne, on condition that he should pay four l\u00f3khs of rupees a year as \u201cchauth\u201d or tribute of one-fourth. \u201cBy this dreadful invasion of the Peshw\u00e1,\u201d writes Sleeman, \u201cthe whole country east of Jabalpur was made waste and depopulate,\u2020 and has never since recovered.\u201d The day of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s had now come, and the Peshw\u00e1 was followed by the Bhonsl\u00e1 Raj\u00e1 of N\u00e1gpur, who annexed the districts which had anciently comprised the whole of the dominions of the the Haihai-Bansi sovereigns of L\u00e1nj\u00ed, and now form part of the modern districts of Mandla, B\u00e1li\u00e1gh\u00e1t, and Bhand\u00e1ra. The next loss of territory occurred on the accession of Niz\u00e1m S\u00e1, about A.D. 1749, when the succession being disputed, the three districts which were afterwards known as the \u201cPanj Mah\u00e1l\u201d of Deori, lying in the north of the Narsinghpur and the south of the\n\n* Briggs\u2019 Farishta, Edn. 1829, vol. ii. p. 225.\n\u2020 Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, vol. vi. p. 636.\nS\u00e1gar districts, were ceded to the Peshw\u00e1, who had now replaced the Emperor as paramount power, in return for his recognition. Thenceforward the Garh\u00e1 Mandla kingdom lay entirely at the mercy of the semi-independent rulers of S\u00e1gar, who represented the Peshw\u00e1 in this part of the country, until in 1781 the last of the Gond-R\u00e1jput line was deposed, and his territories were added to the S\u00e1gar principality. The country was ruled from S\u00e1gar for eighteen years. Only one of the S\u00e1gar chiefs, V\u00e1sudeva Pandit, has left any mark on the district, and of him it is said that, in a few months, he did more towards the ruin of Mandla than either internal dissensions or the raids of the Pindh\u00e1ris would have effected in as many years. In 1799 Mandla was annexed by the Bhonsl\u00e1 r\u00e1j\u00e1s of N\u00e1gpur, and during the period of eighteen years which followed, the town of Mandla was fortified against the Pindh\u00e1ris, who, though they freely pillaged the rest of the country, never succeeded in plundering the town itself. In A.D. 1818 Mandla was transferred to the British,* and the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 garrison in the fort making a difficulty about the surrender, a force under General Marshall marched against it, and on the 24th March 1818 it was taken by assault. The first year of British rule was marked by a severe famine, and the first outbreak of cholera ever known in the country, which commenced some days only after its occupation by our troops. At the commencement of the mutiny in 1857 the chiefs of R\u00e1mgarh, Sh\u00e1hp\u00far, and Soh\u00e1gp\u00far joined the mutineers, for which, when order was restored, Soh\u00e1gp\u00far was made over to Rew\u00e1, and the estates of R\u00e1mgarh and Sh\u00e1hp\u00far were confiscated. Early in 1858, after some further unsuccessful attempts at mutiny, British administration was firmly established at Mandla; and on further inquiry it turned out that the people themselves had been little disaffected,\u2014the Gonds, whose ideas of English rule were indistinct, having followed their respective chiefs with the unquestioning faithfulness which with them is a second nature.\n\nThe imperial revenues of the district as it now stands are as follows:\u2014\n\n| Description          | Amount |\n|----------------------|--------|\n| Land                 | Rs. 56,516 |\n| Excise               | Rs. 15,654 |\n| Assessed taxes       | Rs. 4,206 |\n| Forests              | Rs. 7,193 |\n| Stamps               | Rs. 5,073 |\n| Miscellaneous        | Rs. 502 |\n\nTotal Rs. 89,144\n\nThe administration is conducted by a Deputy Commissioner, a Civil Surgeon, and an Extra-Assistant Commissioner at headquarters, with Tahsild\u00e1rs or Sub-Collectors exercising judicial powers at R\u00e1mgarh and Mandla. The police force consists of 280 of all ranks, under a District Superintendent, aided by two Inspectors. They have station-houses at Mandla, Pindrai, Nar\u00e1inganj, R\u00e1mgarh, Sh\u00e1hp\u00far, and Selw\u00e1r\u00e1, besides ten outposts.\n\nWithout increased population the state of the country and people must remain very backward; but the increase can only be very gradual, as the surrounding countries are too thinly populated to spare people for an immigration on any large scale. Much of this backwardness may be safely attributed to the unpopularity of Mandla, and the ignorance entertained by the population of the vicinity of its advantages. On the principle of *omne ignotum pro terribili*, the Mandla district\n\n* Aitchison's Treaties, vol. iii. p. 109.\nis supposed to be a wild and dense jungle, surrounded by impenetrable hills, and guarded by numberless wild beasts, instead of being known as a series of magnificent valleys, watered by streams which, never dry, offer unusual opportunities of irrigation, and rich prairies of black soil, capable of producing anything. The present inhabitants may be said to be, if not well off, at least well satisfied with their condition. Having once faced the hills with which Mandla is surrounded, they have now no wish to leave the fertile spots where they are settled. There is yet but little accumulated capital in the country, and with the exception of the \"Haweli\" lands round Mandla, it is still in a state of transition; but as the new road opens it up, and the people acquire enlarged markets for their goods, their prosperity cannot but increase, and the time may come when Mandla under British rule will recover the position and wealth which it gained by centuries of fostering care from its native princes, and lost by a few decades of Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 oppression.\n\nMANDLA\u2014The south-western revenue subdivision or tahsil in the district of the same name, having an area of 2,215 square miles, with 920 villages, and a population of 130,929 souls according to the census of 1866. The land revenue for the year 1869-70 is Rs. 46,991.\n\nMANDLA\u2014The principal town of the district of the same name, situated in latitude 22\u00b0 43', and longitude 80\u00b0 35', at an elevation of 1,770 feet. It is 59 miles south-east from Jabalp\u00far, 635 north-east from Bombay, and 135 north-north-east from N\u00e1gpur. The town is naturally one of some strength, being surrounded on three sides by the Narbad\u00e1. It now contains a population of about 5,000, and the number of houses is estimated at 1,200. Of these some 50 only are built of stone or brick, about 150 are made of mud, and the remainder of \"wattle and daub.\" The town was made the seat of his government by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Narendra S\u00e1, the fifty-seventh r\u00e1j\u00e1 of the Garh\u00e1 Mandla line, in 1680. He erected a fort on a piece of ground having the river on three sides, and separated from the town by a deep ditch. Within the fort he built a large palace. He also constructed a temple, a gh\u00e1t, and several houses for his followers. About A.D. 1739 Mandla was taken by the Peshw\u00e1, B\u00e1l\u00edj\u00ed B\u00e1ij\u00ed R\u00e1o, who named the gate on the Jabalp\u00far road, where he entered the town, the \"Fateh Darw\u00e1za.\" The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s built a wall with bastions and gates on the side of the town not protected by the river, and otherwise strengthened the place. In 1818, when it was taken by General Marshall, the fort and palace were found in a very dilapidated state, and were partially destroyed. The streets of the town are narrow, but from a distance the temples and gh\u00e1ts give the place a picturesque appearance. Of the latter there are as many as thirty-seven on the banks of the Narbad\u00e1, the earliest built in 1680, and the latest in 1858. The trade of the town is inconsiderable. The only manufacture is one of so-called \"bell-metal\" vessels, made of an alloy of zinc and copper.\n\nMANDLADAI\u2014A hill in the Seon\u00ed district, about twenty miles to the north-east of Seon\u00ed. It has an elevation of 2,500 feet above the sea, but is difficult of access.\n\nMANDU MAHAL SIRGIRA\u2014A small chiefship attached to the Sambalp\u00far district, situated to the south-west of B\u00e1isi. It consists of four villages only, and the area is not more than six square miles. The population is computed at 1,005 souls, of the agricultural classes, viz. Gonds, Khonds, S\u00e1onr\u00e1s, and Binj\u00e1ls (Binjw\u00e1rs). Rice, as elsewhere in the Sambalp\u00far district, is the staple agricultural product. The principal village is Sirgir\u00e9, the population of which is 577 souls.\nMANIGRU'L\u2014A village in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, lying twenty miles south-west of Brahmapur\u00ed, on the eastern side of the Perz\u00e1g\u00e1rh range. It possesses a very fine irrigation-reservoir, and is picturesquely situated.\n\nMANI\u00c1RI\u2014A stream in the Bil\u00e1sp\u00far district, which has its rise in the Lorm\u00ed hills, and flowing south and west past the towns of Lorm\u00ed, Bij\u00e1p\u00far, and Takhtp\u00far, forms, for a greater portion of its course, the boundary line between the Mungell and Bil\u00e1sp\u00far parganas. After a circuitous course of some seventy miles it falls into the Seon\u00e1th river in the Tareng\u00e1 t\u00e1luka. It has a wide straggling bed, but, except at intervals in the rains, contains no volume of water. In the hot and cold weather months many parts of its channel are quite dry, while in other places there are reaches of water, which are utilised for purposes of irrigation.\n\nMARIA'DOH\u2014A village and fort, prettily situated on a pool of the Jog\u00edd\u00e1b\u00e1r n\u00e1la, about ten miles north of Hatt\u00e1, in the Damoh district. The fort was built by the Bundel\u00e1 r\u00e1j\u00e1s of Charkh\u00e1ri, to whom, until 1860, the place belonged. It was then made over to the British in exchange for some territory in the Hamirpur district. There is a building still standing in the fort called the \"B\u00e1r\u00e1dari,\" where the Charkh\u00e1ri r\u00e1j\u00e1s used to live when they visited Mari\u00e1doh, and not far from the village is their game-preserve or \"ramn\u00e1.\" A good deal of coarse cloth is manufactured in the village, which contains a police station-house, a district post-office, and a village school.\n\nMA'RKANDI\u2014A village in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, situated on the left bank of the Waingang\u00e1, three miles north-north-west of Ch\u00e1murs\u00ed. It contains twenty-five houses only, and derives its name from a beautiful group of temples which stand on a high bluff overlooking the river. Here the waters of the Waingang\u00e1 flowing south suddenly change their course, and roll backwards to the north, then sweeping round in a wide curve they resume their progress. The M\u00e1r\u00e1ndi group comprises a monastery, and is enclosed in a quadrangle, with entrances from the river front and the two sides, while along the rear side runs a row of cells facing the Waingang\u00e1. The buildings themselves are of great antiquity, but much of the rich carving which adorns the centre temple is of comparatively recent date. Its apex has fallen, and some of the stones on the top are twisted round, overlapping the base, so as to give the idea that at any moment they may come crashing down; but it is stated that they have hung thus for two generations. Formerly a broad flight of steps led from the front to the river's bed, but much now has been swept away. The monastery is constructed of a purple stone, obtained from rocky islets in the Waingang\u00e1. Among the ancient sculptures are several of warriors with sword or battle-axe, and bow and arrows. The best of these is about three feet high, and displays a soldier with a short, straight sword in his right hand, and in his left a long bow, while at his back he carries a quiver full of arrows. All the warriors have anklets. The more modern carving is of rare excellence, covering every inch of space on the centre temple, and consisting mainly of human figures about two feet high, which appear to represent scenes in a continuous tale. The village is said to have been founded as early as the fourteenth century (of the Christian era) by Vyankat R\u00e1o, a Gond chief of Arpal\u00ed. It is now subject to yearly inundation, and in consequence few will reside here. A fair is held annually near the monastery in February, but the attendance of late years has not been large. Good stone for mills is found in the islets of the Waingang\u00e1 close to M\u00e1r\u00e1ndi, and is worked up by the Ch\u00e1murs\u00ed masons.\nMA'RU'\u2014A small town in the Bil\u00e1sp\u00far district, situated twenty miles south-west of Bil\u00e1sp\u00far. It is said to have been founded about three hundred years ago by a brother of the then ruler of Ratanp\u00far. It was protected by a large earthwork and ditch, the former of which is nearly level with the ground, but the latter, forty feet wide, still remains. The present population amounts to about 1,500 souls. A well-attended weekly market is held here.\n\nMATI'N\u2014A chiefship to the north of the Bil\u00e1sp\u00far district, containing forty villages, with an area of 569 square miles. The population by the last census amounted to 2,760 souls only, giving the low average rate of four to the square mile. The estate lies entirely in the hill country, and is infested by wild elephants, which until lately almost entirely prevented cultivation. A \"kh\u00e9d\u00e1\" was established a few years ago, which has now been transferred to fresh ground, after having materially diminished the herds. The chief is of the Kanwar caste.\n\nMATI'N DEVA\u2014A sacred hill near Mati'n, in the Bil\u00e1sp\u00far district.\n\nM\u00c1U\u2014A tract of country in the B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t district. It appears to have been settled some thirty or forty years ago by Ponw\u00e1s from the Waingang\u00e1 valley, under the enterprising management of the grantee, Lachhman N\u00e1ik, and is now the most flourishing portion of the B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t highlands.\n\nM\u00c1U\u2014A village in the B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t district, well situated on high and well-drained ground, in the centre of the extensive estate of the same name. It is about thirty-six miles to the north of B\u00farh\u00e1, and five miles from the Waingang\u00e1. There is a police outpost here.\n\nMAUNDA' (MOHODA')\u2014A town in the N\u00e1gp\u00far district, situated on the eastern bank of the Kanh\u00e1n, half way between N\u00e1gp\u00far and Bhand\u00e1ra. The surrounding estate belongs to Yaswant R\u00e1o Gujar, who has a fort in the town, which also contains a large market-place and a good main street. There are here a government school-house and a police station. The population, great part of which is employed in the cotton-cloth manufacture, amounts to 3,148 souls.\n\nMHESA'\u2014A village in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, situated three miles west-south-west of Seg\u00e1on, and possessing a fine irrigation-reservoir.\n\nMIRKALLU'\u2014A block of forest forming part of that described under \"Ah\u00edrl\" in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district.\n\nMOHARI'\u2014A town in the Bhand\u00e1ra district, situated on an affluent of the Sur river, about ten miles due north of Bhand\u00e1ra. The population amounts to 7,622 souls, and there is a considerable trade in the cotton-cloth manufactures of the town, which are well known and esteemed in the country round. There is also some trade in grain. The watch and ward and conservancy are provided from the town duties; and the town is kept fairly clean. It is considered healthy, though the well-water is brackish, and the supply is scanty in the hot season. There are here a large and flourishing government school, a police station, and a district post-office.\n\nMOHARLI\u2014A village in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, situated twenty miles north of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1, in the midst of thick jungle. It possesses a very fine tank, and produces a good deal of rice and sugarcane. The Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 and Chim\u00e1r road passes here; and there are a police station-house and a district post-office in the village.\nMOHGA'ON\u2014A municipal town in the Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 district, situated on a tributary of the river J\u00e1m, about thirty-eight miles south of Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1. The population numbers 4,789 souls, chiefly cultivators; but there are also a good many traders; and this is said to be almost the only place in the Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 district where there is an appreciable proportion of beggars, chiefly Br\u00e1hmans, among the inhabitants. On either side of the river is a large Hind\u00fa temple, one of which, sacred to Mah\u00e1deva, is said to be three centuries old.\n\nMOHKHER\u2014A large village in the Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 district, situated fourteen miles south of Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1, formerly the capital of the pargana. It possesses a good school, a police station-house, and a tank. The population numbers 2,174 souls, a good many of whom are carriers by trade. Leathern vessels for ghee are largely manufactured here.\n\nMOHPA'\u2014A town in the N\u00e1gp\u00far district, between S\u00e1warg\u00e1oon and Kalmeswar, twenty miles from N\u00e1gp\u00far, on the left bank of the Chandrabh\u00e1g\u00e1. It has a population of 5,509 souls, mostly agricultural. The M\u00e1l\u00ed caste musters strong here, and in consequence most of the rich land close to the village is cultivated and irrigated like a garden. This is the chief place in a small but rich estate belonging to the Naw\u00e1b Hassan Al\u00ed Kh\u00e1n, the representative of an old and distinguished family. The Naw\u00e1b collects his own octroi, and arranges for conservancy and watch and ward. The new road through Kalmeswar to S\u00e1warg\u00e1oon will pass through this town. A good school-house has been recently built.\n\nMORAN\u2014A stream rising in the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1 hills in the Bet\u00fal district, and entering the Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d district near the town of Seoni. During the rains it is a mountain torrent, for the rest of the year a clear, shallow stream. It unites with the river Ganj\u00e1l before reaching the Narbad\u00e1. In its bed, before leaving the hills, a vein of indifferent coal has been found.\n\nMORTAKKA'\u2014The north-western revenue subdivision or tahsil in the Nim\u00e1r district, having an area of 690 square miles, with 138 villages, and a population of 19,079 souls according to the census of 1866. The land revenue for the year 1869-70 is Rs. 16,758.\n\nMOTU'R (MOHTOOR)\u2014A plateau in the Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 district, thirty-four miles to the north-west of the station of Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1. The following short description of this place is taken from Sir Richard Temple's Administration Report for 1861-62:\n\n\"The height above the sea is 3,500 feet. The neighbouring hills and valleys are clothed with low and thick wood. And this circumstance is calculated to injuriously affect the climate during the rainy months and the autumn. But during the winter, spring, and early summer, or more than half the year, the climate is delightful. The plateau of the hill itself is open, and generally free from jungle. The soil and water are everything that could be desired. On the northern aspect the scenery is fine. In the hot months the atmosphere is cool and invigorating, and the sun is not overpowering.\"\n\nThe place has been tried as a sanitarium for European troops from K\u00e1mfhi, but has been abandoned, partly owing to the difficulty of reaching it at an inclement time of year, and over a bad road, and partly owing to the distaste of the soldiers for so solitary a situation.\n\nMOW\u00c1R\u2014A town in the N\u00e1gp\u00far district, six miles north of Jal\u00e1lkher\u00e1, and about fifty-six from N\u00e1gp\u00far, on the left bank of the Wardh\u00e1. The country around is extremely fertile, and is covered with groves and garden cultivation, which completely surround the town on all sides but that of the river. Mow\u00e1r is flourishing, having 3,762 inhabitants, mostly engaged in cultivation\nor in the manufacture of ordinary cotton-cloth. The municipal funds have been laid out in the construction of a good bazar, new streets, and school and police buildings. Two large dams have also been made on the banks of the river, which used often at these points to overflow and flood the town during the monsoons. The town has the reputation of being somewhat unhealthy.\n\nThe trade of Mowar is considerable. The declared value of its exports for the year 1866-67 was Rs. 1,21,501, and of its imports Rs. 3,24,869.\n\nMUGDAI\u2014A spring and cavern in the Perzagarh hills, about a mile east of Dom\u00e1, in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district. On ascending this portion of the range a platform of rock is reached, and beyond it rises a smooth sheer precipice, a hundred feet in height, of sandstone rock, black from exposure, but naturally white. Over this in the rains plunges a broad cascade, and in the driest weather a slender stream trickles from the foot of the precipice, and falls into a cleft in the rocky platform, four feet long by one foot wide, where throughout the year is an unvarying depth of seven feet of water. A few yards from the crevice is a large shallow cavern, sacred to the M\u00e1n\u00e1 goddess Mugda\u00ed. During the ravages of the Pindh\u00e1r\u00eds the Mugda\u00ed platform was the refuge of the neighbouring villages; and a small fair is still held there.\n\nMUL\u2014A range of hills in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, situated three miles west of M\u00fal, and measuring eighteen miles from north to south, and thirteen from east to west. They are covered with forest, among which is a good deal of large bijes\u00e1l, and under the southern slopes near Pipalkot teak is springing up in great profusion. Numerous perennial streams abound along the foot of the range, dotting the forest with patches of sugarcane. The valleys of Dhoni and Jhir\u00ed on the south, and of Khols\u00e1 on the west, were once immense artificial lakes, with large villages on the slopes of the hills, at which extensive markets met. Now there are only a few clusters of Gond huts on the site of the lakes, and thick forest on the hill-sides. In the very driest weather the grass in these valleys is brilliantly green, and the streams running through them bright and limpid. The Dhoni valley especially is worthy of a visit during the summer months; but the visitor should be careful to boil the spring-water before using it. On the hills is found a species of snowdrop, the leaves of which are eaten by the Gonds as a vegetable; and under the southern slopes is a large excavation in which the elephants that once abounded in this part of the country were entrapped by the Gond hunters.\n\nMUL\u2014The southern revenue subdivision or tahsil in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, having an area of 1,952 square miles, with 430 villages, and a population of 163,519 souls according to the census of 1866. The land revenue of the tahsil for the year 1869-70 is Rs. 69,150.\n\nMUL\u2014A town in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, situated thirty miles north-east of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1, on the eastern side of the M\u00fal hills. It is the head-quarters of the M\u00fal tahsil, and contains 776 houses. Three-fourths of the population are Telings. Rice and sugarcane are grown in the neighbourhood; and the chief manufactures are coloured cotton-cloths and native shoes and sandals. There is little trade beyond what arises from the consumption of the inhabitants. A tahsild\u00e1r is stationed here; and there are a town school for boys, a girls' school, a police station-house, a post-office, and a nursery for young trees.\n\nMULTAI\u2014The southern revenue subdivision or tahsil in the Bet\u00e1l district, having an area of 958 square miles, with 365 villages, and a population of 78,754 souls according to the census of 1866. The land revenue for the year 1869-70 is Rs. 68,601. Opium is more largely cultivated in this tahsil than in any other part of the Central Provinces.\nMULTATI\u2014A town in the Bet\u00fal district, situated on the Tapt\u00ed, twenty-eight miles east of Badn\u00far. The population amounts to 3,320 souls, and there is some trade, especially in opium and unrefined sugar, which are produced in the country around. There is a large tank here, which is reverenced by Hind\u00fas as the source of the Tapt\u00ed, and is ornamented by several temples. The public buildings are a tahs\u00edl court-house, a police station-house, a government school, and a charitable dispensary. There is also an English burial-ground here, now disused.\n\nMUNGELEI\u2014The western revenue subdivision or tahs\u00edl in the Bil\u00e1sp\u00far district, having an area of 679 square miles, with 609 villages, and a population of 140,500 souls according to the census of 1866. The land revenue of the tahs\u00edl for the year 1869-70 is Rs. 1,32,556-6-0.\n\nMUNGELEI\u2014The head-quarters of a sub-collectorate in the Bil\u00e1sp\u00far district. It is situated on the river A'gar, thirty-six miles west of Bil\u00e1sp\u00far, on the direct road between that place and Jabalp\u00far. The river at this point is so tortuous in its course as to envelope the town on three sides. Mungeli is daily increasing in importance, being conveniently situated for traders. Two large markets are held here weekly, and there are a police station-house and a town school.\n\nMURAMGAON\u2014A small chiefship in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e9 district, situated thirty-five miles east-south-east of Wair\u00e1garh. It contains twenty-five villages.\n\nMURWARA\u2014The northern revenue subdivision or tahs\u00edl in the Jabalp\u00far district, having an area of 1,276 square miles, with 577 villages, and a population of 146,485 souls according to the census of 1866. The land revenue for the year 1869-70 is Rs. 91,975.\n\nMURWARA\u2014A small but rising town in the Jabalp\u00far district, on the road to Mirz\u00e1p\u00far. It is fifty-seven miles north-east of Jabalp\u00far, and has a population of 1,735 people, chiefly agriculturists. There is a government school here; and the Katn\u00e1 river is crossed by two fine bridges, the one on the northern road, and the other on the Railway.\n\nMUTANDA\u2014See \"Pav\u00ed Mut\u00e1nd\u00e1.\"\n\nN\n\nNA'CHANGAON\u2014A town in the Huz\u00far tahs\u00edl of the Wardh\u00e1 district, lying two miles to the south of the Pulg\u00e9on railway station, and about twenty-one miles from Wardh\u00e1. It is said to be very old, and parts of the wall which formerly surrounded it still exist. The sar\u00e1\u00ed is the most conspicuous building in the place. With its strong stone walls and gateway, it more resembles a fort than a sar\u00e1\u00ed, and it was successfully used by the inhabitants for purposes of self-defence against the Pindh\u00e1ris. The rooms for travellers, also of strong masonry, abut on the inside of the walls, leaving a clear space containing a well in the middle. A carved stone on the well purports to show that the building was constructed nearly four centuries ago by one B\u00e1dsh\u00e1h L\u00e1r. One of the principal works carried out by the municipality has been the clearing and levelling of a square or market-place in the centre of the town. A weekly market is held here every Thursday, but it has fallen off of late years. An annual religious fair is held in the temple of Pur\u00e1nik, on the fourth of A'swin Vadya, the month corresponding to the latter half of September and the first half of October. There is a good village school and a police outpost in the town. It contains 3,571 inhabitants, chiefly agriculturists.\nNA'G\u2014A small stream which, rising amongst the little hills north-west of Sit\u00e1bald\u00ed in the N\u00e1gpur district, flows through the city of N\u00e1gpur, and after receiving the Pil\u00ed and other smaller streams empties itself into the Kanh\u00e1n.\n\nNA'GAR\u2014A range of forest-covered hills lying between Jabalp\u00far and Mandla. They may be considered as forming a portion of the northern boundary of the Narbad\u00e1, whose course in the Barg\u00ed pargana of the Jabalp\u00far district is nearly due north and south.\n\nNA'GBHI'R\u2014A town in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, situated twelve miles west-south-west of Brahmapuri, and containing 900 houses. The population is chiefly Mar\u00e1th\u00e1. Fine cotton-cloths of peculiar excellence are manufactured here, and there is some little trade. Rice is the chief product of the surrounding country. The town possesses an old fort now in ruins, a boys\u2019 school, a girls\u2019 school, and a police outpost.\n\nNA'GPUR*\u2014\n\nCONTENTS.\n\n| SECTION I.\u2014GENERAL DESCRIPTION | Page |\n|---------------------------------|------|\n| Geographical description        | ib.  |\n| Hill tracts                     | 293  |\n| Plains                          | 295  |\n| Detached hills                  | 296  |\n| Rivers                          | ib.  |\n| Climate                         | 297  |\n| Geology                         | 299  |\n\n| SECTION II.\u2014HISTORY            | Page |\n|--------------------------------|------|\n| Ga\u00fal kings                     | 301  |\n| Gond dynasty                   | 302  |\n| The Bhonsl\u00e1 family             | 303  |\n| Raghoj\u00ed I.                     | ib.  |\n| J\u00e1nj\u00f3j\u00ed                        | 305  |\n| S\u00e1b\u00e1l\u00ed and Mudh\u00e9l\u00ed             | 306  |\n| Raghoj\u00ed II.                    | 307  |\n| A'p\u00e1 S\u00e1hib                     | 309  |\n| Raghoj\u00ed III.                   | 313  |\n| Bhonsl\u00e1 polity                 | ib.  |\n| Bhonsl\u00e1 administration         | 314  |\n| British administration         | ib.  |\n| Mutiny of 1857                 | 315  |\n\n| SECTION III.\u2014ADMINISTRATION    | Page |\n|--------------------------------|------|\n| District staff                 | ib.  |\n| Imperial revenue                | 318  |\n| Local revenue                  | 319  |\n\n| SECTION IV.\u2014POPULATION         | Page |\n|--------------------------------|------|\n| Classification                 | ib.  |\n| Date of settlement             | 322  |\n| Language and religion          | 323  |\n| Occupations and customs        | ib.  |\n\n| SECTION V.\u2014PRODUCTIONS         | Page |\n|--------------------------------|------|\n| Cultivation                    | ib.  |\n| Khar\u00edf crops                   | 327  |\n| Rabi crops                     | ib.  |\n| Garden crops                   | 328  |\n| Live stock                     | 329  |\n| Forest produce                 | ib.  |\n| Stone and minerals             | ib.  |\n| Manufactures                   | 330  |\n\n| SECTION VI.\u2014TRADE              | Page |\n|--------------------------------|------|\n| Under the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 rule         | ib.  |\n| Cotton traffic                 | ib.  |\n| Imports and exports            | 332  |\n| Country cloth                  | ib.  |\n| Entrepos                       | 333  |\n| Banking                        | ib.  |\n\n| SECTION VII.\u2014COMMUNICATIONS    | Page |\n|--------------------------------|------|\n| Roads                          | ib.  |\n| Old lines                      | 335  |\n| New lines                      | 336  |\n| Northern Road                  | ib.  |\n| Eastern Road                   | 337  |\n| Southern Road                  | ib.  |\n| North-Western Road             | ib.  |\n| Local lines                    | 338  |\n| Progress of the country        | ib.  |\n| River communication            | 339  |\n\n| SECTION VIII.\u2014EDUCATION        | Page |\n|--------------------------------|------|\n\nA district in the Central Provinces, bounded on the north-west by a short stretch of the river Wardh\u00e1, on the north by the districts of Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 and Seoni, and on the east by the district of Bhand\u00e1ra. A small portion of the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district adjoins its extreme southern frontier; and throughout its whole length, from north-west to south-east, it is bounded by the new district of Wardh\u00e1. Thus, with the exception of the short frontier on the river Wardh\u00e1, beyond which lies East Ber\u00e1r, it is entirely enclosed by other districts belonging to the Central Provinces, and is situated in the south-western portion of the extensive territory.\n\n* This article, with the exception of one or two slight interpolations, is by Mr. M. Low, late Deputy Commissioner of N\u00e1gpur, who acknowledges the assistance he has received from Messrs. Nicholls, Macdougall, and Munton, his subordinates.\nnow subject to that administration. It lies immediately below the great table-land of the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1s. It comprises the central portion of the Upper Do\u00e1b between the Wai\u1e45g\u00e1ng\u00e1 and the Wardh\u00e1, and is identical with the most important part of that tract of country which was known in by-gone days as \"Deogarh below the gh\u00e1ts.\" N\u00e1gpur, the chief town, and the present seat of the administration of the Central Provinces, is situated nearly in the centre of the district, in north latitude 21\u00b0 9', and east longitude 79\u00b0 11'. The outline of the district is uneven, but in general terms its shape may be called triangular. The apex of the triangle would be the short reach of the river Wardh\u00e1 in the north-west, and the base, the boundary line of Bhand\u00e1ra on the east; while the other two sides would be formed by the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1 hills on the north, and the Wardh\u00e1 district boundary on the south-west. The extreme length of the district from east to west is eighty miles, and its extreme breadth from north to south seventy-eight miles. Its total area is 2,356,809 acres, or 3,682 square miles, being just a little smaller than the East and West Ridings of Yorkshire.\n\nFor revenue and administrative purposes it is divided into four subdivisions or tahsils. These are N\u00e1gpur, K\u00e1tol, R\u00e1mtek, and Umrer. The N\u00e1gpur tahsil may be said to comprise the central and south-western parts of the district. The north-western portion belongs to K\u00e1tol, the north and north-eastern to R\u00e1mtek, the south and south-eastern to Umrer. The entire district, as thus comprised, possesses great varieties of surface and scenery. Before describing the hill tracts, the plains, and the rivers, each in their turn, it will be well to turn for a moment to the map, in order to see the local disposition according to which these features of the country are severally grouped. It will be found that the hill ranges form, so to speak, the skeleton. The plain country is as it were the body, the whole of which is knit together, and its different portions separated by this upland framework. Throughout each portion is distributed its own system of rivers and streams as arteries and veins. The northern frontier of the district is one continuous range of hills, consisting sometimes of spurs from the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1s, and sometimes of the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1s themselves. A second great division of hills encloses the district from north-west to south-east, except at a break where the river Wan\u00e1 passes through, and again lower down where the range is resumed in the same direction, but is shifted, so to speak, further north, leaving the N\u00e1nd valley between the southern side of the range and the Wardh\u00e1 district boundary. The whole of the plain country (excepting the N\u00e1nd valley) is thus enclosed between two great hill ranges and the boundary line of Bhand\u00e1ra. But these two mountain ranges are themselves connected together by a third hill range running across the plain thus enclosed; so that the whole country is divided into three great hill ranges, and three great plains, which the hill ranges either enclose or demarcate, while each one of these plains has its own system of streams or rivers peculiar to itself.\n\nThe hills and hill ranges are extensive in area, though they attain no great altitude. The chains exhibit great variation in height, breadth, contour, and outline. They are sometimes in a high degree picturesque. Sometimes they are covered only with loose stones and low brushwood. In some cases, again, they are quite bare and arid; in others their slopes and summits possess a good soil for trees, and carry, or could carry, valuable timber. Generally they run on in unbroken chains, save at certain intervals, where perhaps a stream with fertile tracts on either bank has to pass through; some again are absolutely detached. They must all, however, it seems be regarded as offshoots belonging to the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1 range on the north; and themselves generally rocky and comparatively\nsterile, they have this peculiarity in common, that the valleys and lowlands intersecting and adjoining them possess a soil not merely culturable, but even extremely fertile. In the midst of barren hills, covered with nothing but loose boulders and low scrub, the traveller unexpectedly finds himself looking down on valleys studded with fruit trees, and teeming with corn and garden cultivation. Strips of rich, highly cultivated soil, entering from the lowlands below stretch away through the hill gorges, creeping as it were up the sides until they abruptly terminate in rock and brushwood. It is in the abruptness and frequency of the contrasts thus offered between hill and dale, rock and black soil, scrub and corn-field, jungle and homestead, and in the ever-recurring juxtaposition of desert and garden, that the most striking feature of the hill scenery is to be found.\n\nThe first division to be noticed is the northern boundary range. This consists of the outlying hills below the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1s, on the west, and of the actual gh\u00e1ts themselves, and of spurs from the lower part of the gh\u00e1ts, on the east. Commencing with the extreme western point, and continuing on in a straight line eastwards to the river Kanh\u00e1n, this strip is exceedingly narrow; and the Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 district is reached at all points before the ascent of the gh\u00e1ts; but between the Kanh\u00e1n and the Pench it is widened by a deep indentation into the Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 district; and the entire ascent of the gh\u00e1ts is made opposite Kham\u00e1rp\u00e1n\u00ed in Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1, before the N\u00e1gp\u00far boundary is passed. The strip here, including the Tik\u00e1ri hill (1,668 feet above the sea level) and other offshoots, averages twelve miles broad. It has some excellent young timber, and the whole of it forms part of a great forest reserve. The scenery about Bheogarh and along the banks of the Pench is very picturesque. The views commanding the plain from the top of the gh\u00e1ts are striking and even grand. This tract contains the old Gond site of Bheogarh, with some interesting ruins. Beyond the Pench the district boundary, proceeding eastwards, again recedes, leaving only a comparatively narrow strip south of Gauligh\u00e1t. Further east it becomes narrower still at Jun\u00e1w\u00e1n\u00ed, but broadens again as the district boundary extends towards Seoni. For the last seven or eight miles, before the eastern boundary is reached, it again broadens to about ten or eleven miles; but here the hills are only offshoots from the gh\u00e1ts, not the gh\u00e1ts themselves. The breadth then of this division varies from two and three to ten, twelve, and even eighteen miles. Its entire length from west to east is about sixty-four miles. It is most of it capable of bearing excellent forest timber, and contains useful stone and minerals of various kinds.\n\nTo the south of this division, near its eastern extremity, and detached from it by a few miles of cultivation, stands the sacred hill of R\u00e1mteck, with its ancient temples and fortress. This hill attains the height of 1,400 feet above the sea. It is in the form of a horse-shoe, the heel of which stands to the south-east. At the outer extremity, towards the north, the cliff is scarped, rising sheer from the base about 500 feet. On the summit are the old fortress and the temples. Below in the hollow, formed by the inner sides of the hill, and embosomed in groves of mango and tamarind, nestles a lake, its margin adorned with temples, and enclosed by broad flights of steps of hewn stone, reaching down to the water. From above the prospect is highly picturesque. To the east and south the eye stretches across the Do\u00e1b of the Pench and Kanh\u00e1n, and again over the plain of N\u00e1gp\u00far as far as the S\u00edt\u00e1b\u00e1l\u00ed hill. On the north and north-east is seen, first, a narrow belt of cultivation, then a broad reach of low hills and forest bounded by the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1 gh\u00e1ts. On the east lies the valley of the river Sur, winding its way towards the Waingang\u00fa, its course marked by a silvery line\nfringed with the green of the sugarcane; then undulating forest land; while in the distance appears the blue outline of the hills at Amb\u00e1garh. To the south, far away beyond the lake and its encircling heights, lies extended for miles and miles a vast cultivated plain, dotted with trees and tanks, and terminated only by the low, jagged hills below Umrer. Again, a little to the right of Umrer may be faintly seen on the horizon the abrupt peak of Girar, where is a mosque dedicated to Pir Shekh Farid, a place of pilgrimage as celebrated with the Musalm\u00e1ns, as R\u00e1mtek itself is amongst the Hind\u00fas.\n\nThe second great hill tract is that adjoining, and in great part extending into, the Wardh\u00e1 district. This range is a branch of the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1s. It enters the two districts at nearly the same point of latitude. In this district, with the exception of a single break of seven or eight miles at the river Wan\u00e1, it may be said to extend from the north-west to the south-east, either along or close to the entire length of the frontier. Above the Wan\u00e1 valley its breadth is very variable, ranging from two or three miles at the extreme north, to not less than twenty-five miles at the south. Its length down to the Wan\u00e1 valley is about fifty miles. In this range is the hill of Khark\u00ed, south-west of K\u00e1tol, rising to almost 2,000 feet above the sea. This is the highest elevation in the district not actually belonging to the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1s. Below the Wan\u00e1 valley the chain is resumed, but diminished both in breadth and height, and though running in the same direction as before to the confines of the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, is yet, as it were, shifted a little northwards, so as to leave between its southern side and the district boundary the cultivated strip through which flows the N\u00e1nd. The length of this second portion is twenty-two miles; its average breadth may be about ten miles; but it is much broader in the middle, and tapers away to the south-east. The upper tract is full of culturable waste land, and abounds with young teak and other valuable saplings. It contains some cultivated land of great richness, and possesses some wild and beautiful scenery. For the most part the hills are clothed with trees or brushwood up to the very top. In the lower tract the hills are generally dwarfed and rugged, vegetation is scanty, and the country uninteresting.\n\nThe third hill range\u2014another spur from the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1s\u2014bisects the K\u00e1tol tahsil from north to south, forming a connecting link between the two hill divisions already described. Its length is from sixteen to eighteen miles. Its breadth varies considerably, being nowhere more than ten miles, and in some places not more than two. The hills are bare and sterile, both in aspect and in reality. Their internal scenery is relieved from insipidity by their rugged and grotesque outlines. They contain the hill named Pilk\u00e1par (height 1,899 feet), which is their culminating point.\n\nThe whole of the plain country is, as said before, either encompassed or demarcated by these ranges of hills. By far the greatest part of it is comprised in the two great tracts of level or undulating country on either side of the third mountain range, culminating in Pilk\u00e1par. The first of these tracts forms the western half of the K\u00e1tol tahsil, and contains the most highly cultivated land in the district. It is surrounded on three sides by mountain chains, and on the fourth side by the river Wardh\u00e1. It possesses a soil profusely fertile. It abounds in mango and other fruit trees, and teems with the richest garden cultivation. Its total area is probably about three hundred square miles. Its slope is towards the river Wardh\u00e1. The second great tract, in area at least six times larger, lies to the east of the Pilk\u00e1par range, extending between the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1s on the north, and the second great division of hills on the south, to the confines of Bhand\u00e1ra and Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1.\non the east and south-east. It consists of one vast cultivated plain. Its surface, however, is hardly ever level. It abounds in mango-groves and trees of all sorts; and in some portions, especially towards the east, it is studded with small tanks, which form quite a feature in the landscape. As was before shown, it pierces the second division of hills by the Wan\u00e1 valley, which thus connects it with the great cotton field of Wardh\u00e1. Except in this valley, the general slope of the country is towards the Waingang\u00e1. The third and last tract of plain country is the narrow belt of cultivated land lying between the southern side of the hills, described as the lower portion of the second division of hills, and the district boundary. This tract naturally belongs to the great Wardh\u00e1 cotton field, of which it forms the most eastern and elevated part. It possesses for the most part the black soil common to the rest of the Wardh\u00e1 cotton field, and is throughout well cultivated. Its slope, as indicated by the course of the N\u00e1nd river, is westwards to the Wan\u00e1 valley. Its breadth varies from four to ten miles, and its length, measured south-east to north-west, is almost twenty-four miles.\n\nBut in the largest of these three tracts of plain country there are some detached hills that merit a passing notice, such as the Haldol\u00ed hills (highest point, 1,300 feet) in the south-east; the hills at Ch\u00e1pgarh\u00ed and Bheokund; the hill of S\u00edt\u00e1peh\u00e1r (height 1,433 feet) in the south-east corner of the tahsil of R\u00e1mtek, and the hills at Ambh\u00f3r\u00e1 on the Waingang\u00e1. These last are in themselves insignificant both in height and extent, but they are interesting as having originally belonged to a range in the Bhand\u00e1ra district on the other side of the river, which must have forced its way through the chain at this spot. Lastly, towards the middle of this plain is the isolated little hill on which stands the S\u00edt\u00e1bald\u00ed fort\u2014insignificant as to its mere altitude, but interesting from its historical associations, and remarkable for the expanse of country which the view from it commands, and for the distance from which it can be seen from all surrounding directions. The mean elevation above the sea of the plain country is 1,000 feet in its central portion, lessening to below 900 feet towards the Waingang\u00e1 and Wardh\u00e1.\n\nThe district has been described as being bounded on the north-west by a short stretch of the river Wardh\u00e1; similarly the course of the Waingang\u00e1 adjoins it for a short distance on the east. As these two rivers in no way belong to the N\u00e1gpur district, any description of them would be out of place here. It should, however, be observed that it is into them that the drainage of the whole area under description finds its way. Of all the streams flowing through this district there is not one which does not eventually discharge its waters either into the Waingang\u00e1 in the east and south-east, or else into the Wardh\u00e1 on the west and south-west. It has been said that each of the three plain tracts described in the foregoing paragraphs has its own system of rivers. The waters due to the first and third of these plains flow westward to join the Wardh\u00e1. The rivers draining the second, and by far the largest plain, and that portion of the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1 range which immediately overhangs it, flow (with one exception only) eastwards to the Waingang\u00e1.\n\nThe rivers traversing the first tract are the J\u00e1m and the Mad\u00e1r. The single stream in the third tract is the N\u00e1nd.\n\nThe rivers of the second, or great plain, are numerous, and will be found described under their proper headings. The two largest are the Kanh\u00e1n and\nthe Pench. These and the Kol\u00e1r unite\u2014the two first at Bin\u00e1, the last at War\u00e9g\u00e1n\u2014a little above K\u00e1mth\u00ed, and thence flowing in a single stream (the Kanh\u00e1n) past the military cantonment, join the Wainganga at Tid\u00ed, a little above Ambhor\u00e1. In the next rank come the Sur, the Marb\u00fc, the A'imb, the N\u00e1g, the N\u00e1nd, the Bor, and the Wan\u00e1. The main characteristics common to all these streams are their high banks and confined channels, which, however, become less steep and more sloping where the tracts they traverse are open and undulating;\u2014the depth of their channels far below the surface of the adjacent country;\u2014their sandy beds interspersed at intervals with abrupt and jagged ledges of rock; and most of all, the astonishing suddenness with which their waters rise and subside, and the extraordinary impetuosity of their currents while a flood lasts. During the dry season the largest of them\u2014the Kanh\u00e1n, the Pench, the Kol\u00e1r, the Wan\u00e1, the Sur, the Bor, and the N\u00e1nd\u2014have indeed always water; but what there is may be said to be in the pools, some of which are very fine. Where the water flows, the volume delivered during this season is quite insignificant, in many instances but a mere rivulet; the rest, as streams, may be said to be completely dried up, having water only in pools here and there. On the other hand, during a flood in the monsoon the largest among them assume the dimensions of great rivers, while every paltry rivulet and dry n\u00e1l\u00e9 is, in an hour, swollen into a powerful stream, or changed into a channel or a torrent.\n\nThe mean temperature is higher than in many other parts of India of the same height above sea level. But the absence of the really bracing air in the cold season for Upper India is in some degree compensated for by fresh cool weather during the greater part of the monsoon, and by tolerably cool nights in the summer months.\n\nThe following table gives the temperature for twelve months:\n\n| Months       | Maximum | Minimum | Mean |\n|--------------|---------|---------|------|\n|              | Degrees | Degrees | Degrees |\n| 1866,*       |         |         |      |\n| June         | 112     | 73      | 81\u00b77 |\n| July         | 97      | 70      | 81\u00b77 |\n| August       | 90      | 73      | 80\u00b75 |\n| September    | 97      | 65      | 81\u00b7 |\n| October      | 97      | 59      | 78\u00b7 |\n| November     | 88      | 54      | 71\u00b7 |\n| December     | 85      | 48      | 66\u00b7 |\n\n1867.\n\n| January      | 92      | 52      | 71\u00b71 |\n| February     | 96      | 53      | 75\u00b7 |\n| March        | 106     | 63      | 84\u00b75 |\n| April        | 109     | 64      | 88\u00b76 |\n| May          | 113     | 70      | 98\u00b75 |\n\n* This is selected as an average year.\nAs in other parts of India, there are three seasons\u2014the hot, the cold, and the rainy. The positively hot weather ordinarily commences about the 1st of April, and lasts till the first week in June. The monsoon lasts throughout June, July, and August. At this season the climate, though full of moisture, is fresh and pleasant to the feelings. In September there are long breaks between each fall of rain, when the weather is often close and sultry, though never so much so as in the plains of the north of India at this time. October is generally sultry and unpleasant, but diversified occasionally by refreshing showers. The cold weather does not fairly set in till the middle of November. From the 15th of November to the end of February the air is generally cool and pleasant. Often, however, with the appearance of clouds the thermometer rises as much as seven or eight degrees, and the climate becomes disagreeable and close. From the 15th of February the weather gets warmer, and the hot winds blow from the beginning of April till the monsoon. Rain falls during every month in the year, usually during the hot and cold season only in showers, but sometimes accompanied with violent storms. Hail falls occasionally in January, February, and the early part of March, sometimes in very large stones, doing much damage to the spring crops.\n\nIt is considered that the average annual rainfall, taking a great number of years back, is about forty inches.\n\nThe following table gives the rainfall for three years:\n\n| Months       | 1864 | 1865 | 1866 |\n|--------------|------|------|------|\n| January      | 2\u00b704 | ..... | ..... |\n| February     | ..... | 1\u00b756 | ..... |\n| March        | ..... | 2\u00b759 | ..... |\n| April        | ..... | 1\u00b722 | ..... |\n| May          | 1\u00b795 | 1\u00b727 | ..... |\n| June         | 7\u00b734 | 10\u00b722| 6\u00b710 |\n| July         | 9\u00b770 | 10\u00b777| 10\u00b710|\n| August       | 10\u00b746| 8\u00b738 | 14\u00b742|\n| September    | 8\u00b745 | 8\u00b732 | 8\u00b789 |\n| October      | ..... | 1\u00b775 | 1\u00b740 |\n| November     | 0\u00b715 | 1\u00b714 | ..... |\n| December     | ..... | 4\u00b76  | 2\u00b720 |\n\nTotal....... | 35\u00b759| 41\u00b763| 41\u00b711|\n\nThese have been selected as average years; 1867, 1868, and 1869 were exceptional.\n\nThe climate during the rains is considered by the poorer inhabitants, who are exposed to it, as more trying than the cold of the real cold weather. In July and August it is not unusual to see people sitting round a fire in the very early morning before going out for their day's labour. The climate is certainly not unhealthy; but the late collection of vital statistics has not been extended generally enough to make possible any comparison of deaths with population for the entire district. Fever is the most frequent amongst the epidemic diseases. The most unhealthy season is from the second week in September till the second week in December. The jungle tracts are certainly not free from\nmalaria until the cold weather has well set in, and during the greater part of November it is decidedly feverish in camp. Epidemic cholera occurs occasionally. In 1865 there were a large number of deaths from this disease. Small-pox too occurs at intervals, but lately its ravages have been materially lessened by vaccination.\n\nThe juxtaposition of volcanic and plutonic rocks, enclosing between them, as they do in this district, the wreck of a vast sandstone formation, invests the geology* of N\u00e1gp\u00far with particular interest. In the middle of the district stands the S\u00edt\u00e1b\u00e1ld\u00ed hill\u2014the centre of interest, as well geologically as historically. Within the limits of the horizon, as seen from its summit, every formation belonging to the district is to be met. More than this, within the circuit of a few hundred yards we have an epitome of the geology of the Peninsula. Standing on the hill-top we see the surface strewn with nodular trap. A few feet below, in the scarped face of the hill, may be traced a shallow layer of freshwater formation; below this a soft bluish tufa, which passes into a porous amygdaloid, and deeper into an exceedingly fine augitic greenstone. At the base of the hill, beneath the basalt, we have sandstone, below which again is gneiss.\n\nGenerally the trappian portion of the district is clearly demarcated from the plains by a sudden rise in elevation, and this line of geological separation pretty nearly corresponds with the eastern limits of the third and second hill tracts already described. To the west and south of this line, with one unimportant exception, the groundwork of the country is trap. Again, that small tract of the N\u00e1gp\u00far district, lying above the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1 gh\u00e1t, is trappian. This tract is scarcely ten miles long, and seldom more than two miles broad. The trap lies about one hundred feet deep over schistose rocks.\n\nThus trap is the surface rock over about 1,900 square miles, or more than a half of the whole area of the district. From the S\u00edt\u00e1b\u00e1ld\u00ed hill looking to the northern and north-eastern points of the compass, we meet hills massive and round-topped. After a long sweep, where in the direction of Kod\u00e1mendh\u00ed the rich plain stretches beyond the horizon, we faintly see the serrated outline of the B\u00e1l\u00e1h\u00ed hills near Bhand\u00e1ra. These forms are characteristic of the crystalline formations\u2014which with a few interruptions extend from here down to Cuttack\u2014as the flattened summits are of the trap.\n\nAgain, turning to the north we have in the foreground the gently swelling undulations of sandstone and shales, running from Korh\u00e1d\u00ed up to P\u00e1rseoni. The area over which sandstone formations occur at the surface is comparatively small. The sandstone enters the S\u00edt\u00e1b\u00e1ld\u00ed hill on the eastern side beneath the trap. On the western side it emerges, and is seen for a short space; then gneiss takes its place down as far as the N\u00e1g river; sandstone then reappears, but is soon lost under the trap at Amb\u00e1jh\u00e1ri. A sheet of sandstone about fifteen square miles in extent reappears at a distance of seventeen miles, near Vy\u00e1h\u00e1r (Beh\u00e1r), on the upper part of the Wan\u00e1 valley. Northwards again from N\u00e1gp\u00far over the T\u00e1k\u00ed plain to Silew\u00e1r\u00e1, Korh\u00e1d\u00ed, and Sur\u00e1d\u00ed, up the basins of the K\u00f3l\u00e1r, the Kanh\u00e1n, and the Pench, sandstone formations predominate\u2014a tract perhaps on the average\n\n* This geological sketch is founded on the description of the Geology of N\u00e1gp\u00far by the Rev. Messrs. Hislop and Hunter, which first appeared in the Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society of London, vol. xi. part 3, p. 345\u2014August 1, 1855, and was reprinted in the \"Geological Papers on Western India,\" published by the Bombay Government in 1857 (p. 247).\nthirty miles long by nine broad. Detached from this continuous bed sandstone is again found at Ch\u00e1rkh\u00e1ri and Chilchol\u00ed, north of Pilk\u00e1p\u00e1r, near the sources of the Kol\u00e1r, surrounded by trap. These outliers point to a continuation of sandstone underlying trap as far as Chikald\u00e1 in Ber\u00e1r, and also following the direction of the Kanh\u00e1n to the Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 coal district, and the sandstone of Mot\u00e1r. Small patches of sandstone occur also among the Sindwihir\u00ed hills and in the neighbourhood of Umrer, showing the connections of the N\u00e1gpur beds with those of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 and Bhand\u00e1ra. In some few parts beds of laterite are found on the surface, as at P\u00e1ndarthal, south-west of Umrer, at Maund\u00e1 (Mohod\u00e1), and Karb\u00ed, and at Dharm\u00e1p\u00far, in the valley of the Surnad\u00e1. At Ker\u00e1nl\u00e1, east of Umrer, it rests on gneiss. Limestone is found in some quantity in the hills running east and west from the Pench river to the north of P\u00e1rseoni. Throughout the whole of the rest of the district granite and kindred rocks form the groundwork of the country.\n\nThe superficial deposits are the \"regar,\" or black cotton soil, and the red soil, the former occurring almost universally with trap, the latter with plutonic rocks, sandstone, or laterite. The regar seldom in this district exceeds twelve feet in depth. It seems to be destitute of organic remains of any antiquity. Its chemical composition is very nearly the same as that of the black soil of the southern Russian steppes. This does not show greater affinity to the trap than to the granite rocks, nor would its colour prove that the regar is produced from the disintegration of trap. Yet its position, constantly attendant on the trap, its composition including the same minerals, as agates, chalcedony, zeolite, and its fusing like basalt into obsidian, are strong arguments against the counter-theory of its being a lacustrine deposit. It is frequently permeated with kankor in seams, and often in the drying beds of small streams gives a considerable saline efflorescence. The red soil is much deeper than the regar, sometimes as much as fifty feet, but, like it, it generally rests on a retentive calcareous clay, with a layer of conglomerate at its bottom. It also abounds in nodular carbonate of lime. Both of these superficial deposits are mostly unfossiliferous; but judging from such remains of mollusca and mammalia as have been found, it would seem that they are post-pliocene. The brown clay, with its accompanying band of conglomerate, underlying these superficial deposits, averages a depth of twenty feet. It is not known to be fossiliferous. The beds of laterite which occur in this district are generally less than ten feet in depth, and seem to be without organic remains. No satisfactory theory has yet been advanced to account for the manner of their formation.\n\nIn the descending series we next meet the overlying trap. Between this and the underlying beds of basalt a layer of fresh-water formation intervenes. In the hill of Sit\u00e1baldi and the little flat-topped hills around, the general depth of the overlying layer is from fifteen to twenty feet.\n\nThe fresh-water deposit which succeeds this is extremely varied, sometimes one or two inches, sometimes six feet in depth; sometimes it is sandy or of clay, here altered by heat to a crystalline state, there reduced to a cinder,\u2014now rich in fossils, now destitute of them. But wherever both layers of trap are present, the fresh-water seam intervenes. The height of all the basalt hills depends entirely on the thickness of the lower bed, as it lies on the sedimentary rocks below.\n\nWe find that this fresh-water deposit was lacustrine, and, from the fossils examined, that it corresponds more nearly with the London clay than with any\nother formation; we must therefore class it as belonging to the Eocene series. Thus of these three the lower basalt is the most recent, and the fresh-water formation the oldest.\n\nThe minerals of the trap are jasper, obsidian, heliotrope, and mesotype. Next below the amygdaloid come the various beds of sandstone. The upper bed (which is best seen at Bokh\u00e1ri) has a thickness of twenty-five feet. It is coarse and gritty, but very hard. In this upper bed are often included fragments of a finer sandstone from below. Lying between this upper bed and the next in succession we find bands of ferruginous conglomerate. The layers underlying the iron bands are on the top especially soft and argillaceous, highly fossiliferous and fissile. After a depth of about fifteen feet the stone gradually becomes quite hard. It is clear from a comparison of fossil remains that this second bed corresponds with the carbonaceous and bituminous shales of Umreth and Barkoi, and of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1; and if coal does exist in this district, it is here that we shall probably find it. The depth of this second layer of sandstone is probably in this district under three hundred feet. In some parts of the district, for example between Korh\u00e1di and Bokh\u00e1ri, red shale beds and green argillaceous strata have been forced up to the surface by the action of granite dykes. These formations underlie the second sandstone bed. These shales are again found in Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1. The green shale has a depth of thirty feet, the red of fifty feet. The white marble (which appears on the surface at Korh\u00e1di) succeeds the green and red shales. Similar strata are found at Gok\u00e1l\u00e1, D\u00e9dh\u00e1g\u00e1n, and Amb\u00faj\u00e1ri, in the valley of the Pench. A range of small hills of this crystalline limestone extends from Naw\u00e9g\u00e1on, on the Pench, to Kum\u00e1ri', north of R\u00e1mtek. We cannot expect to find organic remains in this crystallised rock. This bed is probably not more than one hundred feet in depth. The first and second beds of sandstone are probably very nearly of one age. Their equivalent strata in the English system are in the lower Oolitic series. The green and red shales are not much older, and must be part of the same jurassic group. Metamorphic and plutonic rocks occur in such varied combinations that it is very difficult to give any general description of them. Near N\u00e1gpur gneiss is the most common form, passing into mica schist. Quartz dykes are common. Pegmatite is here more common than syenite or granite. The plutonic rocks are not of one age. Sometimes dykes of granite are seen traversing other masses of the same kind of rock, when between the two much difference of consistency and composition exist.\n\nThe remote history of the country is quite lost to us. The general term \"Gondw\u00e1na\" was known to the Hind\u00fas of the SECTION II.\u2014History. Gangetic valley, and was applied by them in the later Sanskrit literature to a region of large but undefined extent, lying towards the \"Dakshan Aranya,\" or southern forest land. In Gondw\u00e1na there were at various periods four Gond kingdoms\u2014Garh\u00e1 Mandla, Kherl\u00e1, Deogarh, and Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1. Of the area now comprising the N\u00e1gpur district so much is certain that it belonged to the third of these states, and that it was in the year A.D. 1700 subject to the Gond prince Bakht Buland. But among the people tradition, widespread though vague, is not wanting, pointing to a time far anterior to the Gonds, when throughout Deogarh Gauli chiefs held sway. The exploits and renown of these ancient chiefs are often referred to in the songs of the villagers. There are forts too, and tanks and temples, or remnants of such structures, evidently the handiwork of races preceding the Gonds. The villagers of to-day, though unable to apprehend from the ruins themselves the architectural characteristics\nof either race, are quite aware that much distinction is to be made between them. \"It was a Gaul not a Gond king, so our fathers have told us,\" this is the common answer to all questions respecting such relics.\n\nThe first Raj-Gond ruler who resided below the gh\u00e2ts was named J\u00e2t\u00e2.\n\nGond dynasty. He built a strong fortress on the Bheogarh hill, overlooking the river Pench and the chief passes from Chhindw\u00e2r\u00e2 to the plains of N\u00e2gp\u00fbr. Below the hill he erected a residence for himself, and founded a town. He is said to have been a younger brother of the then ruling chief of Deogarh. But it is probable that before his coming there were Gond chieftains holding under, and dependent on, the Deogarh r\u00e2j\u00e2s, since we find, at a time which local tradition would fix at about A.D. 1560, a r\u00e2j\u00e2 of Deogarh encouraging settlers to come from the richer district of Ch\u00e2nd\u00e2 and form a settlement at Bhiwap\u00fbr, then in the heart of a jungle; and that at this time a fort was raised here by one Bh\u00eem S\u00e2 or by his father Jantan S\u00e2, who appear to have been the first settlers of the place. It is to be remarked that the descendants of these men are still recognised as kinsmen by the descendants of J\u00e2t\u00e2, and that all the local accounts go to show that the numerous Gond forts, studded over the district, were raised to protect new batches of settlers, while the jungles around were being brought under the plough. These and similar traditions, especially prevalent in the south-eastern part of the district, as well as tanks and other evidences of a people of settlers and colonists, afford faint glimpses of their condition and progress. They seem to have been undergoing a struggle, not against men, but against the uncurbed forces of nature,\u2014against the dominion of the jungle. Their achievements remain in the vast areas redeemed from waste; but their names have faded away from memory. Even their forts, their works of irrigation, and other instruments of their success have crumbled into decay.\n\nAccording to the current traditions of the Gonds the original forts of P\u00e2tans\u00e2ongl and Nandardhan (Nagardhan) were built by J\u00e2t\u00e2.* He is called the father of K\u00fb\u00f1\u00e2 Ekdand\u00ee Mohpeswara, who, being dispossessed of his father's acquisitions below the gh\u00e2ts, went to Delhi and entered the service of the Emperor Aurangzeb. The story goes that he performed some signal service and gained favour, and that the Emperor induced him to abandon the rites of R\u00e2msen, and to adopt the Mohammadan faith, on which he was both reinstated in his father's possessions, and acknowledged as R\u00e2j\u00e2 of Deogarh under the name of Bakht Buland. Certain it is that Prince Bakht Buland returned from the court of Delhi, nominally a tributary chief of the Moghal empire, and ruled over all Deogarh.\u2020 He brought with him numbers of artificers and agriculturists, both Hind\u00fbs and Mohammadans, whose services must have been of great value in the backward state of the country. He added to his dominions from those of the R\u00e2j\u00e2s of Ch\u00e2nd\u00e2 and Mandla, acquiring from the latter, who then ruled from Chaun\u00e2garh, possession of Seoni, Katangi, Chhap\u00e2r\u00e2, and Dongart\u00e2l, which were held for him by a relative, R\u00e2j\u00e2 R\u00e1m Singh. He then turned his attention to settling his old possessions and his new conquests, and established many towns and villages by allowing the original settlers to hold their lands, at first rent-free, and afterwards on a very light assessment. Finally he founded the city of N\u00e2gp\u00fbr on the site of some hamlets, then known as R\u00e2jap\u00fbr B\u00e2rs\u00e2. - Ch\u00e2nd\n\n* J\u00e2t\u00e2's real place in history is in the reign of Akbar. Vide A'in-i-Akbari, Account of S\u00fbba Ber\u00e2r (under \"Kh\u00e2rl\u00e2.\") There must therefore have been three or four generations between him and Bakht Buland.\u2014[Ed.]\n\n\u2020 This sketch of the Gond dynasty rests mainly on Sir Richard Jenkins' \"Report on the Territories of the R\u00e2j\u00e2 of N\u00e2gp\u00fbr.\"\nSult\u00e1n succeeded Bakht Buland, and like him turned his attention to the improvement of his country, and especially to agriculture. He walled in the city of N\u00e1gp\u00far and made it his capital, and considerably extended his possessions to the east of the Waingang\u00e1. On his death, in A.D. 1739, W\u00e1l\u00ed Sh\u00e1h, an illegitimate son of Bakht Buland, seized on the vacant throne. But the widow of the deceased prince called in Raghoj\u00ed Bhonsl\u00e1 from Ber\u00e1r to support her two sons Burh\u00e1n Sh\u00e1h and Akbar Sh\u00e1h. The usurper was put to death, and the rightful heirs placed on the throne. Raghoj\u00ed then retired to his charge in Ber\u00e1r.\n\nThis was the first direct connection of the Bhonsl\u00e1 family with N\u00e1gp\u00far, although part of Gondw\u00e1na had been conquered by K\u00e1nhoj\u00ed Bhonsl\u00e1 as early as A.D. 1716.* But the country was not destined to remain long without Raghoj\u00ed's interference. Dissensions between the brothers ripened into civil wars. In the year A.D. 1742, on one occasion, 12,000 Gonds are said to have been massacred in the fort of P\u00e1tans\u00f3ng\u00ed. In the following year (1743) Raghoj\u00ed was called in to support the elder brother Burh\u00e1n Sh\u00e1h. Akbar Sh\u00e1h was driven into exile and finally poisoned at Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d. Raghoj\u00ed had not the heart to give back to the weaker Gond a second time the country he held in his grasp. He constituted himself Protector, took all real power into his own hands, and making N\u00e1gp\u00far his capital, quickly reduced all Deogarh to his own authority. But still he studiously preserved the show of Burh\u00e1n Sh\u00e1h's dignity; whilst in reality he reduced him to the condition of a state pensioner, having a fixed share of the revenue, and the empty title of r\u00e1j\u00e1. In this position Burh\u00e1n Sh\u00e1h and his descendants have continued to remain. The present representative of the deposed prince resides at N\u00e1gp\u00far as a state pensioner, with the title of r\u00e1j\u00e1. He, like his ancestors, is well known as a kind and intelligent landlord.\n\nAt the same time that the sovereignty passed away from the Gond family, the impress of the race on the country began to wane, until, at the present day, excepting in the r\u00e1j\u00e1's family alone, there is not to be found either in city or village any Gond holding a leading position. Their customs, language, and institutions ceased to prevail, save in their own families. Henceforward the country becomes essentially Mar\u00e1th\u00e1, and its interests follow the fortunes of the family of Raghoj\u00ed Bhonsl\u00e1. Of the origin and rise of this remarkable family Sir Richard Jenkins' Report contains the following account:\u2020\u2014\n\n\"The early history of the N\u00e1gp\u00far branch of the Bhonsl\u00e1 family or tribe is obscure. The present members of the family do not profess to trace their origin beyond Mudhoj\u00ed I., the great-grandfather of the founder of the N\u00e1gp\u00far state; and their pretensions to a defined relationship with the first sovereigns of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 empire have either fallen into oblivion or were never seriously believed.\n\n\"Mudhoj\u00ed's sons were B\u00e1p\u00faj\u00ed, Parsoj\u00ed, and S\u00e1b\u00e9j\u00ed, contemporaries of the great Siv\u00e1j\u00ed, and in his military service. Parsoj\u00ed only was distinguished; and under S\u00e1h\u00fa R\u00e1j\u00e1 he was entrusted with an extensive military command and the collection of \"chauth\" in Ber\u00e1r. He died about the year A.D. 1709, and was succeeded by his son K\u00e1nhoj\u00ed, who fixed his residence at Bh\u00e1m in\n\n* Grant Duff, Indian Reprint, 1863, vol. i. p. 320.\n\u2020 Report on N\u00e1gp\u00far by Sir Richard Jenkins, Edition N\u00e1gpur Antiquarian Society, pp. 71 ff.\nBer\u00e1r. Raghoj\u00ed Bhonsl\u00e1 was the son of Bimb\u00e1j\u00ed, the third son of B\u00e1p\u00faj\u00ed, the brother of Parsoj\u00ed. He was born about the year A.D. 1698 at his father's village of P\u00e1ndaw\u00e1ri, near Puna. He served for some years with his relation K\u00e1nhoj\u00ed, who, it is said, at one time proposed to adopt him as his heir, but on a son being born to him, Raghoj\u00ed quitted his service in disgust and remained for a short time with Ch\u00e1nd Sult\u00e1n at N\u00e1gpur. From thence he went to Sat\u00e1r\u00e1, and was pitched upon as a fit person to supplant K\u00e1nhoj\u00ed, who had rendered himself obnoxious at court. Raghoj\u00ed's appointment to Ber\u00e1r is generally referred to the year A.D. 1731, though the earliest orders in the records for the collection of the \"chauth\" of Ber\u00e1r and Gondw\u00e1na directed to Raghoj\u00ed are dated A.D. 1737, to which were added in the year following more extensive predatory commissions, including Bengal, Beh\u00e1r, Oudh, &c. It was in this year that Raghoj\u00ed came to N\u00e1gpur, and having put Wali Sh\u00e1h to death, and set up Burh\u00e1n Sh\u00e1h and Akbar Sh\u00e1h, the two legitimate sons of Ch\u00e1nd Sult\u00e1n, he concluded a treaty with them, by which he received eleven l\u00f3khs of rupees and several districts on the Waingang\u00e1 as the price of his assistance, and was appointed the organ of all communication between the Gonds and the Government of Sat\u00e1r\u00e1. Raghoj\u00ed returned for the present to Ber\u00e1r.*\n\nWhile the war was being carried on between the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 nation and the Portuguese, Raghoj\u00ed, holding himself aloof, seized the opportunity of extending his possessions to the eastward, and succeeded in plundering Cuttack. Again, in 1738, when the Peshw\u00e1 was fighting with the Niz\u00e1m and the Moghals in Bhop\u00e1l, Raghoj\u00ed, though urgently summoned by the Peshw\u00e1 to join him, took no notice of the summons, but made, on his own account, an incursion to the northward as far as Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, from which he returned loaded with booty. To enforce his submission and punish him for his disobedience, the Peshw\u00e1, after defeating the Moghals, sent one of his generals against Raghoj\u00ed, but the Peshw\u00e1's officer was unsuccessful, and the news of the invasion of India by N\u00e1dir Sh\u00e1h induced the Peshw\u00e1 to postpone any further attempt to reduce Raghoj\u00ed, with whom he ultimately became reconciled.*\n\nIn 1741-42 Bh\u00e1skar Pandit, one of Raghoj\u00ed's generals, made an expedition to Bengal. On this occasion the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 authority was partially established in Chhatt\u00edsgarh. Up to this time the M\u00e1r\u00e1th\u00e1s had never penetrated into Chhatt\u00edsgarh, which was governed by two r\u00e1j\u00e1s of the Haihai-Bans\u00ed family, and now tribute was only demanded. But in 1745 the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Ratanp\u00far was deposed, and ten years afterwards the whole of Chhatt\u00edsgarh and Sambalp\u00far was Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 territory.\n\nIn 1743 the kingdom of Deogarh had been finally overthrown, and in 1749 the Gond r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 was obliged to cede a portion of his territory. In 1751 the fort and town of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 fell into the hands of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, and the r\u00e1j\u00e1 became a prisoner.\u2020\n\nTaking advantage of the difficulties in which the Peshw\u00e1 found himself placed in 1744, Raghoj\u00ed obtained for himself a sanad conferring on him the right of collecting all revenue and contributions from Lucknow, Patn\u00e1, and Lower Bengal, including Beh\u00e1r, and vesting him with the sole authority to levy tribute from the whole territory from Ber\u00e1r to Cuttack.\u2021\n\n* Grant Duff, Indian Reprint, vol. i. pp. 386, 392, 399.\n\u2020 Sir Richard Jenkins' Report on N\u00e1gpur Territories, Edition N\u00e1gpur Antiquarian Society, p. 74. Grant Duff, vol. ii. p. 17 et seq.\n\u2021 Grant Duff, vol. ii. p. 13.\nIn 1750 he received new sanads for Ber\u00e1r, Gondw\u00e1na, and Bengal. In the same year he sent another army to Bengal, and in the next year the whole province of Cuttack as far north as B\u00e1ls\u00f3ar was ceded to him. He now turned his attention to the Deccan, where the Peshw\u00e1 was at war with Sul\u00e1b\u00e1t Jang, and taking several fortresses, laid waste the country, but on his return to N\u00e1gp\u00far died there in March 1755.*\n\nBold and decisive in action, he was the perfect type of a Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 leader. He saw in the troubles of other states only an opening for his own ambition; he did not wait even for a pretext for plunder and invasion. Though he was unscrupulous in his dealings with his neighbours, yet he was liked and admired by his countrymen, who even now look with pride to Raghoj\u00ed Bhonsl\u00e1, the first and greatest of the N\u00e1gp\u00far house. With him occurred the great influx of Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, which resulted in the spread of the Kunbis and cognate Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 tribes over the entire district. It is erroneous, however, to suppose that there were no Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s here before Raghoj\u00ed. On the contrary there are the strongest proofs of grants of land by Bakht Buland to certain Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s before Raghoj\u00ed\u2019s first visit. Although from the documents now extant it would seem that both the Mar\u00e1th\u00ed and Urd\u00fa languages were used at Bakht Buland\u2019s court, yet the vernacular was undoubtedly Gond\u00ed, and the bulk of the people Gonds. But from this time the vernacular in every village became Mar\u00e1th\u00ed. We know but little of the administration under the Gonds, but it is certain that much of the material prosperity under the first Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 princes was owing to the groundwork laid by Prince Bakht Buland.\n\nThe Bhonsl\u00e1 family having obtained Deogarh through \u201ctreaty\u201d with the original possessors, afterwards allowed the title of r\u00e1j\u00e1 to the dispossessed princes, and granted them a share of the N\u00e1gp\u00far revenue, as it stood when the treaty was made. The commutation was received by the Gond princes through their own officers. All state ceremonial was ostentatiously rendered to the deposed princes. They gave the \u201ct\u00edk\u00e1,\u201d or mark of investiture, to the Bhonsl\u00e1 on each subsequent accession to the throne, and they affixed their seal to certain revenue papers. And in this there was deep policy, as the Bhonsl\u00e1 would be seen holding the N\u00e1gp\u00far territory from the Gonds, and not subject to the paramount power at Puna, and thus deriving a position superior to that of other military chiefs of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 empire, who owed their elevation to the Peshw\u00e1, and held their fiefs by his favour. Raghoj\u00ed was succeeded in A.D. 1755 by his eldest son J\u00e1noj\u00ed, though not without opposition from another brother, Mudhoj\u00ed.\n\nThe matter was referred to Puna; the former was confirmed in the sovereignty of N\u00e1gp\u00far, with the title of Sen\u00e1 S\u00e1hib S\u00faba; while Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 and Chhattisgarh were given as an appanage to Mudhoj\u00ed. J\u00e1noj\u00ed turned all his attention to settling the territory left him by his father. He and his kingdom sustained no loss by the battle of P\u00e1nipat, but rather from the terrible losses of the other Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 princes he became relatively stronger. Soon after this the Niz\u00e1m, taking advantage of the minority of the Peshw\u00e1, M\u00e1dh\u00f3 R\u00e1o, took up arms. J\u00e1noj\u00ed was bought off from an alliance with him by the promise of the Sardesmukh\u00ed of Ber\u00e1r, and full liberty to plunder his brother at Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1; but though he abandoned the Moghals, he afforded no aid to the Peshw\u00e1.\n\n* Grant Duff, vol. ii. p. 53. There is a discrepancy here between authorities. Grant Duff says Raghoj\u00ed died in 1758, while Jenkins has it 1755.* The latter date has been adopted, as Jenkins is more likely to be correct on such a point.\nNiz\u00e1m in that year was successful, and dictated peace almost at the gates of Puna in 1762. Next year, however, he broke through his treaties and gained over J\u00e1noj\u00ed to join him. Together they sacked and burned Puna. This was not the last of J\u00e1noj\u00ed's treachery. By the promise of territory yielding thirty-two l\u00f3khs of annual revenue he was induced to betray the Niz\u00e1m, and attack his army in concert with the Peshw\u00e1's troops, in consequence of which the Moghals were entirely defeated. The price was paid to J\u00e1noj\u00ed, but the boy Peshw\u00e1 did not fail to reproach him with his treachery. He detested J\u00e1noj\u00ed already, and in 1765 united with the Niz\u00e1m to avenge the sack of Puna. The confederate armies advanced to N\u00e1gp\u00far and burned it, and forced the r\u00e1j\u00e1 to disgorge the greater part of the price of his former treachery. Two years later J\u00e1noj\u00ed was again in arms against the Peshw\u00e1, having joined in the rebellion of R\u00e1ghob\u00e1\u2014uncle of the Peshw\u00e1\u2014and the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r. On this occasion the Peshw\u00e1 advanced through Ber\u00e1r up to N\u00e1gp\u00far, while J\u00e1noj\u00ed, having given him the slip, was plundering around Puna. But he was ultimately obliged to sue for peace, which was concluded in April 1769. In the treaty concluded J\u00e1noj\u00ed's dependence on the Peshw\u00e1 was fully acknowledged. He bound himself to furnish a contingent of six thousand men, and to attend the Peshw\u00e1 in person whenever required; to pay an annual nazar of five l\u00f3khs of rupees; to enter into no general negotiation with foreign powers, and to make no war without the Peshw\u00e1's sanction. In the year 1771 J\u00e1noj\u00ed went to the court of Puna, and obtained sanction to adopt his nephew Raghoj\u00ed, the son of his brother Mudhoj\u00ed of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1. Doubtless his intention of doing this had preserved peace between the brothers all through the complications with the Niz\u00e1m and the Peshw\u00e1. On his return journey to N\u00e1gp\u00far in May 1772 he died at Tulj\u00e1pur on the God\u00e1var\u00ed.* During his reign the country of N\u00e1gp\u00far, except on two occasions, had perfect peace within its boundaries. J\u00e1noj\u00ed's name is remembered as the settler of what his father only conquered. In his private life he was easy of access, and most regular in the observance of all duties of state and of religion. On the whole, his treacherous disposition notwithstanding, he was far from a bad type of a Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 sovereign of the time. Justice was well administered, crimes were few, and capital punishment seldom inflicted in his reign. The revenue flourished, and the people were well off.\n\nAfter the death of J\u00e1noj\u00ed, before Mudhoj\u00ed with his youthful son Raghoj\u00ed, the late king's nephew and heir by adoption, S\u00e1b\u00e1j\u00ed and Mudhoj\u00ed, could reach N\u00e1gp\u00far, S\u00e1b\u00e1j\u00ed, another brother of J\u00e1noj\u00ed, had usurped the government. During the next two years and a half a civil war raged, diversified in A.D. 1773 by a short reconciliation and joint government, and characterised by repeated desertion of either party by Dary\u00e1 B\u00e1\u00ed, widow of the late R\u00e1j\u00e1 J\u00e1noj\u00ed, who now supported one claimant to the throne and now the other. The closing scene of this contest was on the battle-field of P\u00e1nchg\u00e1on, six miles south of N\u00e1gp\u00far. The fortune of the day had declared for S\u00e1b\u00e1j\u00ed, and Mudhoj\u00ed was being surrounded by his brother's troops. Flushed with the fight and with victory, S\u00e1b\u00e1j\u00ed drove his elephant against that on which his brother was seated, and called on him to surrender. A pistol-shot was the only reply. One brother had slain the other, and gained the undisputed regency in behalf of his son, and the title of Sen\u00e1 Dhurandhar.\u2020 Mudhoj\u00ed at once set about restoring order in the affairs of the state, governing wisely and moderately. In the year 1777 he entered with\n\n* Sir Richard Jenkins, p. 76; Grant Duff, vol. ii. pp. 54, 58, 85, 112, 121 et seq. 175.\n\u2020 Sir Richard Jenkins, p. 77; Grant Duff, vol. ii. p. 222.\ncaution into engagements with the English, who were then preparing to support the claims of R\u00e1ghob\u00e1 as Peshw\u00e1. He was obliged, however, in order to keep up appearances at Puna to send troops down to Cuttack. Their march was intentionally delayed. When they arrived they did not act against the British Government, who were all the time kept informed that this march on Cuttack was a mere pretence. The Regent even assisted the march of Colonel Pearse through his provinces, when a force was being sent from Bengal against Haidar \u00c1lf. This display of a conciliatory spirit towards the English happened too at a time when Bengal was denuded of troops. In 1785 Mandla and the Upper Narbad\u00e1 valley were nominally added to the N\u00e1gp\u00far dominions by a treaty in which Mudhoj\u00ed agreed to pay twenty-seven l\u00e1khs of rupees into the Puna treasury.\n\nThe Regent died in A.D. 1788, leaving all the N\u00e1gp\u00far state tranquil and prosperous\u2014conditions which had lasted within the present N\u00e1gp\u00far district ever since the battle of P\u00e1nchg\u00e1on. He left great treasure in cash and in jewels to his family. His son Raghoj\u00ed II., though of age and nominally r\u00e1j\u00e1, had remained, during the lifetime of his able father, in perfect submission and obedience. He now assumed control of the state. He went to Puna, where his titles and dignity were confirmed. He also obtained for his younger brother Vyank\u00e1j\u00ed the father's title of Sen\u00e1 Dhurandhar, with Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 and Chhatt\u00edsgarh as an appanage. Chimn\u00e1j\u00ed, the other brother, was to have had Mandla, but he died shortly after Raghoj\u00ed's return to N\u00e1gp\u00far very suddenly, and not without suspicion of foul play.* The R\u00e9j\u00e1 took up his residence at N\u00e1gp\u00far, while his troops were fighting in the Peshw\u00e1's armies against the Niz\u00e1m and Tip\u00fa of Mysore. He participated in all the advantages gained by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s in these wars, and commanded the right wing of the Peshw\u00e1's army at the victory of Khardl\u00e1. In the year 1796, when the political condition of Western India was much confused, he seized upon Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d and the Lower Narbad\u00e1 valley. In the two following years he had gained the forts of Chaur\u00e1garh, Tezgarh, and Mandla from the Chief of S\u00e1g\u00e1r, as also the fort of Dh\u00e1mon\u00ed from another Bundel\u00e1 chieftain. He then began to consolidate his power in these newly-acquired districts. In the year 1797 Yashwant R\u00e1o Holkar fled for shelter to N\u00e1gp\u00far, but found only a prison. During this time the connection of N\u00e1gp\u00far with the Bengal Government had been growing firmer, and in A.D. 1798 Mr. Colebrooke was appointed Resident to the court of Raghoj\u00ed, but he did not arrive at N\u00e1gp\u00far until March 1799. In May 1801 the British Resident, who had vainly endeavoured to enter into a defensive alliance against Sindi\u00e1, withdrew from N\u00e1gp\u00far, and Sindi\u00e1 and Raghoj\u00ed united together in the year 1803 to oppose the British Government, which had now replaced B\u00e1i R\u00e1o, the Peshw\u00e1, after the treaty of Bassein. This they did in accordance with the wishes and secret directions of B\u00e1i R\u00e1o himself. General Wellesley soon brought the confederates to battle at Assaye. Raghoj\u00ed left the field at the commencement of the battle; Sindi\u00e1's troops bore the brunt of the day and suffered very heavily; but at Argaon, a few weeks after, the N\u00e1gp\u00far army under Vyank\u00e1j\u00ed Bhonsl\u00e1 was completely worsted. The fort of G\u00e1walgarh soon after fell to the British. Meanwhile from the Bengal side Colonel Harcourt had won the whole of Raghoj\u00ed's province of Cuttack. The price of the peace which he now sued for was heavy: nearly one-third of his kingdom was shorn off, comprising East and West Ber\u00e1r up to B\u00e1las\u00f3r, Sambalp\u00far and its dependencies; lastly, the R\u00e9j\u00e1 was to receive permanently a Resident at his\n\n* Grant Duff calls this brother Khandol\u00ed, vol iii. p. 65.\ncourt at N\u00e1gp\u00far, and Mr. Mountstuart Elphinstone was appointed to the post. Thus, of all the territory won by the great Raghoj\u00ed and his two sons, there only remained, after the treaty of Deog\u00e1on,\u2014Deogarh, Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1, Chhattisgarh with its dependencies, and the districts on the Narbad\u00e1. Before this peace Raghoj\u00ed's annual revenue had been nearly one crore of rupees, but after the loss of Cuttack and Ber\u00e1r it fell to about sixty l\u00f3khas. Before the war he had 18,000 horse, mostly Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s of the Puna country, and 25,000 infantry, of which 11,000 were of regular battalions; besides these he entertained a body of 4,000 Arab mercenaries. His artillery counted ninety guns, but of these thirty-eight were lost at \u00c1rg\u00e1on. His cavalry also were much reduced after that battle, and after the ensuing peace the regular infantry were never replaced. Raghoj\u00ed now had the heavy task of putting the finances of his country in order, settling his new boundaries, and securing his subjects from the famine, which was then so severely felt in the Deccan. To retrieve his finances he exacted large sums from his ministers and bankers, and with regard to the payment of his troops practised the meanest frauds.\n\nDuring the campaign which Raghoj\u00ed had undertaken with Sindi\u00e1, the Naw\u00e1b of Bhop\u00e1l had seized on Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d. This the R\u00e9j\u00e1 recovered in 1807. Sambalp\u00far with its dependencies was restored to him by the English in A.D. 1806, but some of the zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs were opposed to the transfer, and their resistance was not overcome until 1808.\n\nThe N\u00e1gp\u00far portion of his dominions now became the scene of frequent contests with the Pindh\u00e1r\u00eds and the robber hordes of Am\u00edr Kh\u00e1n. For security against these marauders most of the village forts were built, the remains of which stud the whole of this district. Insignificant as they may appear to us now, many of them have been the scenes of struggles where the peasant fought for bare life, all he possessed outside the walls being already lost to him. There are some old men now alive who can tell us of the hard lot of those days, how they sowed in sorrow, with little hope of seeing the harvest, and how, whenever they did reap, they buried the corn at once in the ground. The Resident repeatedly suggested that the R\u00e9j\u00e1 should entertain a subsidiary force, but his pride would not permit him to consent. The boldness of these robber bands became so great that in November 1811 they advanced under Am\u00edr Kh\u00e1n's leadership up to N\u00e1gp\u00far, burned one of the suburbs, and only retired when they knew that two British columns were approaching from the Niz\u00e1m's dominions to drive them back. There is, however, great reason to believe that many of the bands of marauders who plundered the country did not belong to the Sindi\u00e1 Sh\u00e1h\u00ed or Holkar Sh\u00e1h\u00ed bands of Pindh\u00e1r\u00eds, but were portions of the N\u00e1gp\u00far army, which, when they could not be paid from the treasury, were allowed in this way to help themselves. The name of Dharm\u00e9j\u00ed Bhonsl\u00e1 is well remembered as a leader in these forays. In this same year Raghoj\u00ed had been trying to conquer Garh\u00e1kot\u00e1, the possession of a petty chief near S\u00e1g\u00e1r, but Baptiste, one of Sindi\u00e1's generals, advanced to its relief, and routed the N\u00e1gp\u00far troops. In the year A.D. 1813 the R\u00e9j\u00e1 of N\u00e1gp\u00far entered into a compact with Sindi\u00e1 for the conquest and partition of the territories of Bhop\u00e1l. After besieging the capital for nine months, the confederates had to retire in July 1814, baffled by the energy and heroism of Waz\u00edr Mohammad. Raghoj\u00ed would have renewed his attempt in the following year had not the Bengal Government declared that this could not be permitted.*\n\n* Sir Richard Jenkins, p. 88; Grant Duff, vol. iii. pp. 65, 79, 101, 161, et. seq. 221, 230, 231, 280.\nRaghoji died in March A.D. 1816. He was coarse and vulgar in person, jealous of every one, and so prying into the minute details of government that no one served him heartily. His rapacity has been seen, his avarice was proverbial. He owned whole rows of shops in the bazar. He first kept his troops out of their pay, then lent them money from his own banking establishment, and at last, when he did pay them their arrears, he would oblige them to take a portion of it in goods from his own stores. The same spirit pervaded his family and his court.\n\nHe was succeeded by his son Parsoji\u2014a man blind, lame, and paralysed. Very soon after his accession the new Raj\u00e1 became totally imbecile, and it was necessary to appoint a Regent. The B\u00e1k\u00e1 B\u00e1\u00ed, widow of the deceased Raj\u00e1, with his nephew Guj\u00e1b\u00e9 D\u00e1d\u00e1 Gujar, for some time kept possession of the Raj\u00e1\u2019s person and the regency, until, with the consent of the M\u00e1nkaris (Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 nobles) and the military leaders, Mudhoji Bhonsl\u00e1, the son of the late Raj\u00e1\u2019s younger brother Vyank\u00e1j\u00ed, and next of kin to Parsoji, succeeded in becoming Regent. While the issue was still uncertain, and after being installed as Regent, Mudhoji, or \u00c1p\u00e1 S\u00e1hib as he was generally called, courted the countenance of the new Resident, Mr. Jenkins, and was anxious to get a subsidiary force, for he knew that there was much debt to be cleared off, and that it would be necessary to reduce the strength of the army\u2014a measure sure to create much discontent. Accordingly on the 28th of May 1816 a treaty of defensive alliance was signed, by which the British were to maintain six battalions of infantry, with cavalry and artillery, while Parsoji was to pay seven and a half l\u00f3khs of rupees annually, and to maintain a contingent of 2,000 horse and 2,000 infantry for the purposes of the alliance. It was, however, found in the campaign against the Pindh\u00e1ris in the cold season of that year that the contingent thus furnished by the Raj\u00e1 was useless. In January A.D. 1817 \u00c1p\u00e1 S\u00e1hib went away from the capital under pretence of visiting Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 on urgent state affairs. A few days after his departure the Raj\u00e1 was found dead in his bed\u2014poisoned, as it subsequently proved, by his cousin \u00c1p\u00e1 S\u00e1hib.*\n\nParsoji had no son, begotten or adopted; consequently \u00c1p\u00e1 S\u00e1hib, being the nearest relative to the deceased in the male line, ascended the throne before any opposition could be made by B\u00e1k\u00e1 B\u00e1\u00ed and her party. From this time the bearing of \u00c1p\u00e1 S\u00e1hib, before so cordial to the British, underwent a speedy change. The emissaries of the Peshw\u00e1 won him over to join with their master in his plots and treachery. He also joined in the schemes of Sind\u00ed\u00e1, and afforded encouragement to the Pindh\u00e1ris, even proceeding so far as to receive into his presence the emissaries of the notorious Chit\u00fa, and to confer on them dresses of honour. All this time, however, he was full of protestations before the Resident of good faith and feeling to the English. During the early part of November the conduct of \u00c1p\u00e1 S\u00e1hib was very suspicious. The N\u00e1gpur troops, which should have been sent on to the Narbad\u00e1 to join in the Pindh\u00e1r\u00ed campaign, were kept back; there was a force already drawn around the capital of 8,000 horse and as many foot; lastly, an active levy of troops from as far even as M\u00e1lw\u00e1 was commenced. The Resident on his part called in the detachment of Colonel Scott from Nandardhan near R\u00e1mtek, and messengers were sent to Colonel\n\n* Grant Duff says he was strangled (vol. iii. p. 281).\nGahan to hurry back from the neighbourhood of Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d. The news from Puna, of the Peshw\u00e1 having now openly broken from his engagements with the British, reached N\u00e1gpur on the 14th November. On the night of the 24th the R\u00e1j\u00e1 informed Mr. Jenkins that the Peshw\u00e1 had sent him a khilat, with a golden standard, and the high title of Sen\u00e1pati. He intimated his intention of receiving investiture of title and honours in state on the following day, and invited the Resident to be present at the ceremony. Mr. Jenkins remonstrated, stating that as the Peshw\u00e1 was at that moment in arms against the English, the R\u00e1j\u00e1\u2019s public acceptance of these marks of distinction was inconsistent with the terms of his alliance with our Government. On the following day the R\u00e1j\u00e1 received the khilat in public darb\u00e1r, and afterwards proceeded to his chief camp, beyond T\u00e1kl\u00ed, where, in front of his troops, he assumed with every ceremony the dignity of general-in-chief of the armies of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 empire.\n\nThe next morning an extreme measure which had been delayed to the utmost was carried out: the brigade under Lieutenant-Colonel Hopeton Scott moved from its lines to the Residency, also occupying the double hill of S\u00edt\u00e1bald\u00ed. This movement was executed only just in time, for a body of Arabs, stationed in a village where now stands the railway station, were only awaiting the final order to secure this position for themselves. Expresses were also sent to call up General Doveton with the second division of the Deccan army from Ber\u00e1r. The troops with Lieutenant-Colonel Scott were a brigade of two battalions of Madras Native infantry, one battalion being of the 20th, the other of the 24th, both much weakened by sickness. There were also the Resident\u2019s escort, two companies of Native infantry, three troops of Bengal Native cavalry, and four six-pounders manned by Europeans of the Madras artillery.\n\nThe hill of S\u00edt\u00e1bald\u00ed, standing close over the Residency, consists of two eminences joined by a narrow neck of ground, about 300 yards in length, of considerably lesser elevation than either of the two hills. The whole surface is rock, so that it was impossible in a short time to throw up any intrenchment. Of the two eminences, that to the north is the lesser, but being within musket range of the principal summit, its possession was of vital importance, particularly as on that side the suburbs of the city came close up to its base, and gave cover to the enemy, who throughout the 26th were seen collecting. Three hundred men of the 24th Regiment, under Captain Saddler, were posted on the smaller hill with one gun. The cavalry occupied the enclosures about the Residency just below the lower hill on the west; the remainder of the force, scarcely 800 men, were posted on the larger hill. On the evening of the 26th the battle began by the Arabs, from the village already mentioned, opening fire on the pickets of the smaller hill. This was the signal for a general attack on the English position. The engagement lasted till about two o\u2019clock in the morning, when it slackened somewhat on the side of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. Several times during the night the Arabs had come on, sword in hand, and tried hard to carry the smaller hill, but were repulsed every time, though at the cost of many lives to the defenders. Time after time, as the ranks of the 24th Regiment were thinned, help was sent down from the 20th, which was posted on the larger hill. Dawn of the morning on the 27th November saw the English troops holding an isolated position. Eighteen thousand men, of whom nearly one-quarter were Arabs, were drawn up against them, with thirty-six guns, all brought into position during the past night. At five o\u2019clock in the morning the few remaining men of the 24th, being utterly exhausted, were withdrawn, their place being taken by the Resident\u2019s escort, with orders to confine their defence to the summit of the smaller hill, which had by this time been somewhat strengthened by a breastwork of bags of grain.\nThus they continued to fight till nine o'clock, when the Arabs again charged home. Just as they gained the crest, the accidental explosion of a tumbrel caused some confusion among the defenders. The sepoys were overpowered, the lesser hill lost, and the gun, which fell into the enemy's hands, was turned against the greater hill. The brigade had now lost much of their superiority in position; from the nearness of the enemy and the fire of the gun on the lost hill, officers and men began to drop fast. The enemy's cavalry and infantry began to close in from every side, and to prepare for a general assault. To add to the perplexity of the moment the Arabs broke into the huts of our troops, and the shrieks of their wives and children reached the ears of the sepoys. The three troops of Bengal cavalry, together with the Madras horsemen of the Resident's escort, had been kept all this while in the enclosures around the Residency. Their commander, Captain Fitzgerald, now formed his men outside the enclosures, and charged the principal body of the enemy's horse. The Marathas did not long resist the onset of this little band, but breaking in all directions, abandoned a small battery by which they had been supported. Captain Fitzgerald pursued them for some distance, then reforming, charged the battery, took some of the guns, and brought them into the Residency in triumph. This success had been witnessed by all the infantry on the hill; and the men, before drooping from the fatigue of fifteen hours' fighting, became once more animated. A combined attack of cavalry and infantry on the Arabs was being arranged when another tumbrel on the lesser hill blew up, causing great confusion amongst the enemy. The advantage was seized, and the little hill was in a few moments again in possession of our troops, who pursued the enemy through the Arab village, and spiked two guns beyond it before they returned to their posts. Again the Arabs were rallied, and fresh troops brought up. Just as they were ready to advance against the hill, a well-timed charge around the base of it, by a single troop of cavalry under Cornet Smith, took them in the flank, and finally scattered them. The troops from the hill now made a general advance, and cleared the ground all about. By noon the enemy's artillery was carried away, and the battle was over. The British lost 367 killed and wounded. Amongst the killed was Mr. Sotheby, of the Civil Service, who had been in attendance on the Resident throughout the engagement. After this humiliating defeat, the Raj\u00e1 hastened to disavow any connection with the attack, and to express his regret for what had occurred. His troops and guns were withdrawn from the Sitabald\u00ed side of the city. On the 29th Colonel Gahan's detachment came in, so that the Resident's position became much stronger. Major Pitman also arrived on the 5th December with a detachment of troops belonging to the Nizam; and on the 12th the light part of General Doveton's division, consisting of five battalions of Native infantry, the 6th Bengal Cavalry, a troop of horse artillery, and two companies of the 1st Royals. The Raj\u00e1 had already been informed that no communication would be held with him till his troops were disbanded.\n\nThe Resident on the 15th December demanded the unconditional surrender of the Raj\u00e1, and the disbandment of his troops. Till four o'clock on the following morning was given for consideration. On the same afternoon all the stores, baggage, and women were sent to the Sitabald\u00ed hill, under guard of the troops who had previously so gallantly defended that position. At dawn next morning the English troops took position, having their left on the N\u00e9g Nad\u00ed, with the cavalry on their right in the open ground towards Anjn\u00ed. At nine o'clock Ap\u00e9 S\u00e1hib surrendered, but his troops prepared for an obstinate resistance.\nThe ensuing battle was fought on the ground lying between the N\u00e1g N\u00e1d\u00ed, the Shakardar\u00e1 tank, and the present southern and old Son\u00e9g\u00e1on roads, quite close to N\u00e1gp\u00far. The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s were completely routed. They lost their whole camp, with forty elephants, forty-one guns in battery, and twenty-three in a neighbouring depot. The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 chiefs who had not surrendered, being deprived of A'p\u00e1 S\u00e1hib's authority, lost all control over the scattered forces, which now dispersed all over the country. But in the city a large body of Arabs and Hindust\u00e1n\u00eds held out for special terms beyond payment of all that was due to them, and would not listen to the orders of A'p\u00e1 S\u00e1hib to lay down their arms. They were promised their arrears, and every inducement for marching out of the country in all security was offered to them, but without effect. Occupying a number of separate houses, the only approach to which was by narrow lanes, they maintained for some days a stout resistance. They did not capitulate until the 29th or the 30th December 1817, when they departed with a safe-conduct to Ber\u00e1r.\n\nAfter the reduction of the city the Resident entered into a provisional engagement to retain A'p\u00e1 S\u00e1hib on the throne on the following conditions*\u2014\"That he should cede all his territories to the northward of the Narbad\u00e1, as well as certain possessions on the southern bank, and all his rights in Ber\u00e1r, G\u00e1walgarh, Sirg\u00faja, and Jashp\u00far, in lieu of the subsidy and contingent; that the civil and military affairs of his government should be settled and conducted by ministers in the confidence of the British Government, according to the advice of the Resident; that the R\u00e1j\u00e1 with his family should reside in the palace at N\u00e1gp\u00far, under the protection of the British troops; that the arrears of subsidy should be paid up until the final transfer of the above-mentioned territories had taken place; that any forts in the territory, which we might wish to occupy, should immediately be given up; that the person, whom he described as principally resisting his orders should if possible be seized and delivered up to the British Government; and that the two hills of Sit\u00e1bald\u00ed, with the b\u00e1z\u00e1rs and an adequate portion of land adjoining, should be ceded to the British Government, which should be at liberty to erect on them such military works as might be deemed necessary.\" On these conditions A'p\u00e1 S\u00e1hib was permitted to return to his palace on the 9th of January.\n\nThe division of General Doveton proceeded westward to help in taking the forts in the territory ceded by Holkar, and in the pursuit of the Peshw\u00e1. No sooner had General Doveton's troops left N\u00e1gp\u00far than A'p\u00e1 S\u00e1hib renewed his intrigues, raised the Gonds, and sent secret instructions to the Kil\u00e1d\u00e1rs not to surrender the forts, which they were holding, to the English; and finally he applied for assistance to B\u00e9j\u00ed R\u00e1o. Even within a day's march of the capital the wild Gonds were burning Magardhokr\u00e1, A'mbg\u00e1on, and other villages belonging to the B\u00e1k\u00e1 B\u00e1i, the R\u00e1j\u00e1's political opponent. He sent messages for help to the Peshw\u00e1, and arranged for his own escape to Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1. At this time also his participation in the murder of his cousin had become known. Sir R. Jenkins now arrested the R\u00e1j\u00e1, and it was determined that he should be confined for life in Hindust\u00e1n. He was sent under escort towards Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, but on the road he managed to corrupt his guard, and escaped in the dress of a sepoy. He fled to the Mah\u00e1deo hills, where he was joined by Chit\u00fa, the last of the Pindh\u00e1ri leaders. He ultimately escaped, first to A's\u00edrgarh and then to the Panj\u00e1b.\n\n* Aitchison's Treaties, vol. iii. pp. 109, 110.\nOn the final deposition of A'p\u00e1 S\u00e1hib a maternal grandchild of Raghoj\u00ed II. was adopted by the widows of his grandfather. He took the name of Bhonsl\u00e1, and was recognised as R\u00e1j\u00e1 Raghoj\u00ed III. on the same terms as were granted to A'p\u00e1 S\u00e1hib in 1816. A Regency was established, at the head of which was the B\u00e1k\u00e1 B\u00e1\u00ed, widow of the second Raghoj\u00ed. She had the care of the young R\u00e1j\u00e1's person, but the Resident superintended and administered every department of the state through officers appointed by himself. In the year 1830, during the Residentship of the Honourable R. Cavendish, and four years after the departure of Sir R. Jenkins from the scene of his labours, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 was permitted to assume the actual government. The time of the R\u00e1j\u00e1's minority, when the country was administered by British officers under the Resident, is still remembered with favour by the people. Nothing occurred to disturb the peace at large during the next seventeen years; the country was quiet and prosperous; and the security, afforded by a firm and just rule, was a great stimulus to banking and trade. In the year a.d. 1848 an impostor named R\u00e1ghobh\u00e1rt\u00ed Gos\u00e1in, pretending to be A'p\u00e1 S\u00e1hib, raised an insurrection in Ber\u00e1r, but the disturbance did not extend to N\u00e1gpur. Raghoj\u00ed III. died in December 1853 without a child, begotten or adopted. The Marquis of Dalhousie, then Governor-General, declared that the state of N\u00e1gpur had lapsed to the paramount power. This order was confirmed by the Court of Directors of the late East India Company and by the Crown, and N\u00e1gpur became a British province.\n\nIt may be well here to attempt a brief examination into the composition of Bhonsl\u00e1 polity. The Bhonsl\u00e1, at least the first four of them, were military chiefs, with the habits of rough soldiers, connected by blood and by constant familiar intercourse with all their principal officers. Descended from the class of cultivators, they ever favoured and fostered that order. They were rapacious indeed, yet seldom cruel to the lower classes. The prince regnant was far from absolute, as we have seen; the younger brothers held portions of the kingdom as appanages; they were bound to serve the R\u00e1j\u00e1 as their feudal chief, but held their own independent courts, and had entire management of their own territories. The near relations of the family had a voice in all matters of moment. When the great Raghoj\u00ed I. came into Ber\u00e1r, certain officers of state were sent with him, for whom he had to provide. These men, known as Darakd\u00e1rs and M\u00e1nkar\u00eds, often acted as spies on him, always looking to Puna as their home, and working in the interests of the Peshw\u00e1. Next in degree to the members of the reigning family and their immediate connections among the M\u00e1nkar\u00eds came the civil and military functionaries. Of these the Diw\u00e1n was at the head of all departments of the state, the Farn\u00e1vis was the accountant, the War\u00e1r P\u00e1ndy\u00e1 (originally an officer under the Gonds) was keeper of the \"L\u00e1gwan Records,\" which showed the actual state of cultivation, occupancy, and rents of land. This would be a very important office in a state where the land assessments were annual. The Chitnav\u00eds was the chief Secretary, and the Munshi was Secretary for Foreign affairs, while the Sikkans\u00e1vis was keeper of the great seal. These offices were considered hereditary; where the person inheriting office was unfit, the department was managed by deputy, but a portion of the emoluments went to the support of the hereditary office-bearer. The principal military officers were the S\u00e1rdafatar or Controller of army estates, the Mir Bakhshi or Paymaster General, the P\u00e1g\u00e1n\u00e1vis or Controller of the body guard, and a similar officer for the artillery. The S\u00fabad\u00e1rs of provinces held military and civil command.\nwithin their respective local jurisdictions. These officers were for the most part paid by j\u00e1girs, or by other grants of land on exceptionally favourable terms. There were no separate officers employed exclusively in the judicial or police departments. Important suits of a civil nature and heinous crimes were decided by the R\u00e1j\u00e1 himself, or sometimes by panch\u00e1yats in open darb\u00e1r. Petty affairs were settled by the revenue officers in the districts, and by specially-appointed courts in the city.\n\nOf the success of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 administration, we may say that from their Bhonsl\u00e1 administration first arrival up to A.D. 1792 the country was on the whole prosperous. At that time the revenue and the area of cultivation had reached their maximum, but thenceforward they commenced to deteriorate from misrule and oppressive assessment. When Ber\u00e1r and Cuttack were lost to Raghoj\u00ed II. he would not reduce his army and expenditure in proportion to his lessened revenue. In the districts near N\u00e1gp\u00far many petty and hitherto unheard-of taxes were imposed, and a system of taking \"nazars\" resorted to. In more remote districts large tracts were given in j\u00e1gir to military leaders for the support of their troops. Added to these causes for retrogression, the country was being overrun year after year by the Pindh\u00e1ris, and this retrogression, it may be remarked, occurred simultaneously with, and in spite of, a great immigration from East Ber\u00e1r. The short reign of A'p\u00e1 S\u00e1hib was marked by still greater exaction than had prevailed under Raghoj\u00ed II.; land fell out of cultivation, and patel or ryot alike was involved in debt, from which he was only able to extricate himself during the wise rule of Sir Richard Jenkins. It is remarkable that between A.D. 1820 and 1825 the total area of cultivation had increased twelve per cent. In their lives the people generally seem ever to have been quiet, abstemious, and temperate; and the women, even of the highest classes, enjoyed much more personal freedom than is common in most parts of India. Their habits were simple, their manners boorish. They were capital colonists and farmers. There seems never to have been any large permanent military population, looking to the sword as their inheritance. The cavalry was mostly raised in the Puna country. The Silahd\u00e1rs who took service here never regarded N\u00e1gp\u00far as their home. The \"clouds of Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 horsemen,\" of whom we often read, never could have applied to the N\u00e1gp\u00far indigenous armies. On the whole it seems certain that the earlier Bhonsl\u00e1, rapacious as they were as regards the territory of their neighbours, were not addicted to oppression at home. On the other hand, from the second Raghoj\u00ed's time the Pindh\u00e1ri incursions and oppressive taxation caused much suffering amongst the peaceful inhabitants. Among all the native rulers and chiefs of whom mention has been made in these pages, there are four names still cherished in the district for having made the welfare of the people the chief aim of their lives\u2014first the Gond, Bakht Buland; then the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1, R\u00e1j\u00e1 J\u00e1noj\u00ed, \"the settler of what his father only conquered,\" with his soldierly general and able civil officer, Raghoj\u00ed Kar\u00e1ndy\u00e1, who was \"like a father to the people committed to his charge;\" lastly, the good widow of Raghoj\u00ed II., the B\u00e1k\u00e1 B\u00e1\u00ed, who throughout her long and useful life was as much distinguished as the protectress of her own people, as by her steady support of the English, and of the cause of order and good government.\n\nFrom 1853 till 1861 the dominions of the late R\u00e1j\u00e1 were administered by British administration. a commission of officers, at whose head was the Commissioner of the \"N\u00e1gp\u00far province.\" The even course of affairs in that period was broken only by the local events\nconnected with the great Mutiny and disturbances of 1857-58. It has never been discovered that any special communications from other quarters had been received, previous to the outbreak of the Bengal army, by those parties in N\u00e1gp\u00far, which about the very beginning of the Mutiny became more or less disturbed. The \"chapatis\" had indeed been circulated, but here, as in other parts of India, their import was certainly not understood by the bulk of the people, amongst whom they failed to attract any particular attention. There was noticed, however, about the end of April, on the part of some of the leading Mohammadans of the city, an unwonted opposition to the orders of Government on the subject of extra-mural sepulture. This opposition was met by decisive action; intra-mural sepulture was prohibited, and the order was obeyed, but not without covert hints that the time for issue of orders by any British Government was not far from its close. The behaviour of the Musalm\u00e1ns was from this time carefully watched. At the beginning of May 1857 Mr. Plowden was commissioner of the N\u00e1gp\u00far province; the officer in charge of the district was Mr. Ellis,* of the Madras Civil Service; his Assistant Commissioner was Mr. Ross. The troops stationed at N\u00e1gp\u00far belonged to the N\u00e1gp\u00far irregular force, and they consisted of a regiment of irregular cavalry, mostly composed of Mohammadans, and many of them connected by relationship with the Mohammadans of N\u00e1gp\u00far, a battery of light field artillery, and the 1st Regiment of Irregular Infantry, who were mostly Hindust\u00e1n\u00eds. The cantonment of K\u00e1mth\u00ed was garrisoned by Madras troops, consisting of two European batteries of artillery, one regiment of Native cavalry, and two regiments of Native infantry.\n\nIntelligence of the calamities at Meerut and Delhi arrived at N\u00e1gp\u00far before the end of May; and it seems that immediately after this a scheme for rising was concocted in the lines of the irregular cavalry, in conjunction with the Musalm\u00e1ns of the city. Secret nightly meetings in the city had been discovered by Mr. Ellis; and the Scotch Church Missionaries, who had schools and some influence in the city, had given warning that the public mind was much disturbed. The rising was fixed for the night of the 13th of June, when the ascent of a fire-balloon from the city was to have given the signal to the cavalry. But just before, probably to allay suspicion, the cavalry had formally volunteered for service, and had asked to be led against the mutineers in Upper India. On the 13th one squadron of the regiment received orders to march towards Seoni as part of a force moving to the north from K\u00e1mth\u00ed. This was just a few hours before the time fixed, and it took them by surprise. A d\u00e1s\u00e1d\u00e1r by name D\u00e1\u00fad Kh\u00e1n was deputed to the infantry lines to rouse the regiment to action. D\u00e1\u00fad Kh\u00e1n was at once seized and confined by the first man whom he addressed. Mr. Ellis and Mr. Ross, as soon as they had been made aware, through information communicated by one P\u00faran Singh, the jail d\u00e1r\u00f3gha, of certain suspicious movements in the cavalry lines, at once communicated personally with Captain Wood, second in command of the cavalry. At Captain Wood's house it was discovered that the regiment were saddling their horses. It was now past ten o'clock at night, and by this time the alarm was general. Mr. Ellis sent the ladies of the station for safety to K\u00e1mth\u00ed; and troops were summoned from that place. Meantime the arsenal had been cared for by Major Bell, commissary of ordnance. Loaded cannon were brought up to command the entrance and approaches, while a small detachment of Madras sepoys proceeded to the\n\n* Mr. R. S. Ellis, C.B., the present Chief Secretary to the Government of Madras.\nSit\u00e1bald\u00ed hill, and got all the guns in position. The behaviour of these last was such as to remove any anxiety as to the Madras troops having been tampered with. But at this juncture, until the arrival of troops from K\u00e1mth\u00ed, everything depended on the temper of the irregular infantry and artillery. The officer commanding the infantry was prostrate from wounds received from a tiger; the only other officer of the regiment was away from the station. Accordingly Lieutenant Cumberlege, the Commissioner's personal assistant, who had previously been with this regiment, proceeded to their lines, and took temporary command. He found that the regiment had fallen in of their own accord on their parade-ground, most ready and willing to execute any orders. The battery of artillery, commanded by Captain Playfair, evinced a spirit equally good. Having made sure of these portions of the troops, Mr. Ellis now went down to the city. Everything was found perfectly tranquil. The conspirators must have become aware that the authorities were on the alert, that their co-operators in the cavalry had failed to get the infantry to join, and were now hesitating. The fire-balloon was never sent up.\n\nThe cavalry, when they heard of the fate of their emissary, seem to have lost all heart. They unsaddled their horses and remained quiet. Subsequently they were turned out on foot without their arms, the infantry and the artillery being drawn up in position fronting and flanking them. It was in vain that efforts were made to induce them to name the ring-leaders, or those who had been saddling their horses. The daf\u00e1d\u00e1r who had been seized in the infantry lines was tried by court-martial on the next day, and condemned to death. The behaviour of the native officers of the cavalry had been closely watched by Mr. Ellis. The senior ris\u00e1ld\u00e1r, the \"wurdee major,\" and a \"kot daf\u00e1d\u00e1r\" were arrested. Within a few days, chiefly through the instrumentality of a native gentleman, Tafazul Husen Kh\u00e1n, whose loyalty had been throughout conspicuous, complete evidence was brought forward, by means of which these three, together with another ris\u00e1ld\u00e1r and a jam\u00e1d\u00e1r, were convicted. They were hanged from the ramparts of the fort overlooking the city. Also from among the Musalm\u00e1ns of the city two persons were executed, viz. the Naw\u00e1b K\u00e1d\u00e1r Ali Kh\u00e1n and Vil\u00e1yat Mi\u00e1n, both men of high family and position. The bulk of the treasure was now removed for security to the fort on the Upper Sit\u00e1bald\u00ed hill, into which, and the arsenal situated at its foot, a supply of provisions for three months was speedily thrown. On the 24th June the cavalry were disarmed. Their arms and accoutrements were removed to the arsenal. The men were kept till November under surveillance in their own lines. In November they were again armed, and employed towards Sambalp\u00far, where they performed their duties well. Besides this there was no actual disturbance within the district of N\u00e1gp\u00far. In the cavalry there had been one squadron composed almost entirely of Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, and these seem to have been implicated just as much as the Musalm\u00e1ns, for amongst a number of officers and men expelled from the regiment were one Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 ris\u00e1ld\u00e1r, one n\u00e1ib ris\u00e1ld\u00e1r, and two troopers. The vast majority of the population having hitherto remained quiescent, and the fidelity of the Madras force at K\u00e1mth\u00ed being now placed beyond question, the local crisis was passed. For the skill, the forethought, the judgment, and the resolution with which affairs were managed in the city up to the time of the crisis, for the discovery of the meetings, for the subsequent watch put on the conspirators, and for the promptitude with which punishment fell on the chief offenders, no small meed of praise is due to Mr. Ellis and to his coadjutor Mr. Ross. And it ought not to be forgotten that here again the aged princess B\u00fak\u00e1 B\u00e1\u00ed brought all her influence to bear on the side of the authorities in\ndealing with the doubtfully-inclined Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s connected with the late reigning family, when the Southern Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 Country was much disturbed, and was looking to N\u00e1gp\u00far as to a beacon,\u2014when, too, the turbulent subjects in the north of the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s territory would hardly have remained quiet had there been any serious difficulty at N\u00e1gp\u00far.\n\nThe course of events after the year 1857 does not find its place here, except to mention that the necessity for guarding against any irruption into the N\u00e1gp\u00far province by the ubiquitous T\u00e1t\u00ed\u00e1 Topi\u00e1, who had at the close of the year 1858 crossed the Narb\u00e1d\u00e1, east of Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d, was met by sending out to the banks of the Wardh\u00e1 river from K\u00e1mth\u00ed a column consisting of one troop of European horse artillery, the 7th Madras Cavalry, and the 26th Madras Native Infantry, under Colonel Osborne, with Mr. Ross as civil officer; while Major Henry Shakespear, with a body of irregular cavalry, accompanied by Lieutenant Cumberlege in a civil capacity, proceeded to the Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 district. The effect of these dispositions was that T\u00e1t\u00ed\u00e1 Topi\u00e1, who had penetrated as far as and burnt Mult\u00e1l, in the Bet\u00e1l district, was turned off in an easterly direction, when he was met by a column from Amr\u00e1oti under Brigadier Hill, defeated, and again driven northwards. It remains only to add that in the year 1861 the \u201cN\u00e1gp\u00far Province\u201d was amalgamated with the provinces known as the \u201cS\u00e1g\u00e1r and Narb\u00e1d\u00e1 Territories,\u201d the whole forming the present \u201cCentral Provinces,\u201d with the head-quarters of the administration at N\u00e1gp\u00far.\n\nThe method of revenue, general, and judicial administration will be noticed very briefly, as it is precisely the same as in other districts belonging to these and to other provinces in India, governed under what is termed the non-regulation system. The Deputy Commissioner, or head executive and administrative officer in the district, is collector of the general revenue in all its branches, the head civil judge, and the chief magistrate. He is charged also with general control over the police, with the superintendence of public instruction, with the collection and expenditure of local funds, with the construction of local public works, and with other general and miscellaneous duties which it is needless here to mention. To assist him in his revenue, judicial, and miscellaneous duties, the Deputy Commissioner of N\u00e1gp\u00far has generally four Assistant, or Extra-Assistant Commissioners, who are assistant or deputy collectors, assistant magistrates, and assistant civil judges. At the head-quarters of each of the four subdivisions or tahsils * is a Tahsild\u00e1r, who is in his turn sub-collector, and subordinate magistrate, and civil judge. Sometimes the naib-tahsild\u00e1r, or deputy sub-collector, has jurisdiction in petty civil suits. At K\u00e1mth\u00ed is a Cantonment Magistrate, who is subordinate to the Deputy Commissioner in judicial matters. There are thus nine stipendiary magistrates\u2019 courts subordinate to the Deputy Commissioner, besides fifteen non-stipendiary courts presided over by honorary magistrates. These native gentlemen answer in some respects to justices of the peace in England. They decide a considerable number of cases. The Deputy Commissioner, the Cantonment Magistrate of K\u00e1mth\u00ed, and generally two of the Assistant Commissioners, are also justices of the peace, with jurisdiction to try and punish European offenders in petty cases, and to commit for felonies to the High Court at Bombay. The civil judicial courts are at present ten in number, and are presided over by eight of the above-named officers in their capacity as civil judges, by a Small Cause Court Judge, and by a Sub-Collector.\n\n* The four subdivisions are N\u00e1gp\u00far, Ummer, R\u00e1mtek, and K\u00e1tel.\nThe civil and criminal courts of the Deputy Commissioner and the Assistant Commissioners ordinarily sit at the head-quarters of the district\u2014Sitabald\u00ed, a suburb of N\u00e1gp\u00far. The N\u00e1gp\u00far court of small causes, and civil and criminal courts of the Tahsild\u00e1r of N\u00e1gp\u00far, sit in the city of N\u00e1gp\u00far. The Cantonment Magistrate of K\u00e1mth\u00ed holds his civil and criminal courts in the Cantonment. Of the honorary magistrates, thirteen hold their courts at N\u00e1gp\u00far, one at K\u00e1mth\u00ed, and one in Mohp\u00e1. The Divisional Commissioner's court is held at T\u00e1k\u00edl, another suburb of N\u00e1gp\u00far. On the civil side it is an appellate court only. On the criminal side it is a sessions court, with powers up to fourteen years' imprisonment and transportation for life, and is competent also to pass sentence of death, subject to confirmation by the court of the Judicial Commissioner of the provinces. The whole of the district administration, whether in the revenue, judicial, or miscellaneous departments, is subject to the general supervision and control of the Divisional Commissioner, who superintends, besides this district, the four neighbouring districts of Bhand\u00e1ra, Wardh\u00e1, Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1, and B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t.\n\nThe constabulary force consists of two distinct bodies\u2014the district police, and the town police. The former are paid from the general revenues, and are available for service throughout the Central Provinces; the latter are paid from the municipal funds of the towns in which they are stationed, and theoretically their duties are confined to that town alone. The district superintendent of police (always an English officer, who ordinarily has under him a European assistant) is at the head of the whole force.\n\nThe Government revenues are derived from the land tax; the income tax; Imperial revenue. the excise on spirits, opium, and drugs; stamps; forests; salt, \"p\u00e1ndhri;\" and a few miscellaneous petty taxes. The land revenue demand for the year 1868-69 was Rs. 7,98,476. This branch of revenue will remain fixed at the same, or almost at the same, annual amount until the close of the present settlement. The excise revenue in the year 1868-69 amounted to Rs. 1,91,848. It is levied according to the central distillery system, which consists in the prescription of certain places in which alone spirits may be manufactured, and the payment of a fixed duty on their removal by licensed vendors; and the tendency is to diminish consumption, but to prevent any large fiscal loss, by the higher duty levied on the diminished amount manufactured. The revenue realised on opium and drugs is obtained chiefly by leasing out monopolies of right to sell by retail, and in some small part by fees levied on the cultivation of the poppy. The total revenue from this source for 1868-69 was Rs. 40,945. From the stamp revenue of 1868-69, realised under the rules of the Stamp Act (Act X. of 1862), was obtained the sum of Rs. 1,66,644. The increase in this branch depends on the increase in commercial transactions and litigation, and on the efficiency of the arrangements for the detection and punishment of offences against the stamp laws.\n\nThe unreserved forests and waste lands of the district are for the most part let out on usufruct leases, and thus afford a considerable amount of revenue. The system has been introduced of leasing out the right to collect or levy dues on minor forest produce only, viz. grass, mhowa and forest fruits, gums, firewood, and the like, the district authorities reserving the right to duty on all timber excepting firewood. The area from which this revenue is produced will annually diminish as the plots are disposed of under existing waste land sale and clearance lease rules. These rules permit the sale in freehold of all waste lands.\nat a minimum price of Rs. 2-8-0 per acre, and provide for their disposal on long leases, conditional on final clearance and reclamation. But it is hardly necessary to say that any loss thus effected in annual revenue will be more than counter-balanced by the proceeds of sale in the one case, and by the additional area ultimately brought under assessment in the other. The forest revenues of 1868-69 amounted to Rs. 19,274.\n\nThe p\u00e1ndhr\u00ed is a tax peculiar to this part of the country, and has the sanction of long usage. It was levied under the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s nominally on all non-agriculturists, and was calculated on the ostensible means of each rate-payer. It has generally been considered to partake of the nature of a house tax; but without doubt there used to be many non-agricultural householders specially and somewhat arbitrarily exempted; nor was much care taken to equalise its incidence so as to distribute it equitably over the rate-paying population. The tax, however, is one to which the people are accustomed, and not indisposed. It provides, moreover, a legitimate means of making the non-agricultural classes pay their fair share towards the expenses of the state. The assessment lists have recently been revised; an improvement has been made by exempting many of the poorer classes; while the result on the whole has been a large increase in revenue. Act XIV. of 1867 has now placed this tax on a firm basis. This impost yielded Rs. 53,305 in 1868-69.\n\nThe income tax reimposed in the current year 1869-70, on incomes exceeding Rs. 500 per annum, will yield about Rs. 73,360.\n\nThe revenue under the heading miscellaneous is unimportant. It consists of royalties on certain quarries, oil-mills, fisheries, and the like. There remains under general revenues only salt tax. This is levied not under district arrangements, but by a special department (the customs). The duty is three rupees per maund of 82 lbs.\n\nThe local revenues, or the funds spent in the district, arise from the road, school, and post cesses; from the naz\u00fal and ferry funds; and from octroi. The road and school cesses are paid by the landholders, and are calculated at the rate of two per cent respectively on the full assessment rate (k\u00e1m\u00edl j\u00e1m\u00e1) of each estate. The revenue in 1868-69 under these two heads was Rs. 31,940, or for each Rs. 15,970. The proceeds are applied to the purposes which their denominations import\u2014the first to the repair and construction of local roads, the latter to the maintenance of rural schools. The former, since the year 1866-67, has been augmented by large grants from the municipal funds of the towns most benefited by the construction of local lines and railway feeders; the latter forms only a part of the educational funds,\u2014the remainder accruing partly from other local sources, such as grants from municipal funds and voluntary contributions, and partly from state grants-in-aid. Similarly the d\u00e1k or postal cess, imposed for local postal service, is a tax on the proprietors of land. The rate is one-half per cent on the full assessment of each estate. The funds realised under this head are not spent exclusively in the district. The realisations from every district in the province are lumped together, and an allotment up to the amount of its own actual requirements is then made to each district. The amount raised under this head during the year 1868-69 was Rs. 3,992.\n\nThe naz\u00fal consists of the annual proceeds of rent, farm usufruct profits, or sale of buildings, lands, orchards, gardens, and other real property belonging to Government, and not subjected to assessment of land revenue. This is a\nvery important heading of local revenue. The proceeds are spent in keeping the different Government buildings and gardens in good order and repair, in defrayment of charges for model farms, purchase of improved agricultural implements, breeding live-stock, in horticulture, arboriculture, experiments with foreign cotton and cereals, and in other matters intended to promote the good of the people, and the general advancement of the district in agricultural and commercial prosperity. Rs. 7,050 were realised from this source in the year 1868-69.\n\nThe ferry fund, as its name imports, consists of the proceeds of fees levied at ferries, or from the annual sale of ferry contracts. It is supplemented by the profits of pounds and other minor headings, and is expended in purchase and repair of boats, improvement of ghats or approaches to rivers, and such like matters. The proceeds in 1868-69 amounted to Rs. 12,650. The most important of the local revenues is the octroi. This tax is now levied in twenty-six towns. The administration of these funds (after the deduction of cost of town police) is entrusted to the different municipal committees. The right to collect octroi is let out in annual contracts, separately for each town. The tax is one to which the people have long been accustomed during the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 government under the name of \"s\u00e1fr.\" Generally it is paid with the utmost contentment, and is certainly the form of local tax most suitable to the inhabitants of this part of India. The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 \"s\u00e1fr\" was in reality more a transit than an octroi duty. But pains have been taken to re-constitute it on a proper basis, and now no imports but those intended for actual local sale or consumption are subjected to duty. This branch of local revenue is the main source from which funds have been derived to carry out the extensive municipal improvements, which have been going forward for the last few years. The impost is regulated so as to fall lightly, except on certain articles, and the schedules have lately been revised so as to make the burden lighter than ever. The octroi funds of the municipal towns in 1866-67 reached the large sum of Rs. 3,07,050, of which Rs. 52,489 were set apart for watch and ward, Rs. 33,349 for grants-in-aid to district road fund, and the remainder spent in municipal improvements. This income has, however, been much diminished by the recent reduction of rates, and will fall still lower after the present year (1869-70) when, under the orders of the Government of India, octroi will cease on all but a few selected articles.\n\nThe following table will show the receipts of revenue under the different heads, imperial and local, for four years:\n\n| Description of Revenue | Proceeds in Rupees |\n|------------------------|-------------------|\n|                        | 1865-66 | 1866-67 | 1867-68 | 1868-69 |\n| Imperial                |         |         |         |         |\n| Land revenue           | 8,01,247 | 7,96,941 | *4,34,820 | 7,98,476 |\n| Excise                 | 2,00,797 | 2,29,888 | 2,15,068 | 1,91,848 |\n| Opium and other drugs  | 23,828   | 25,016   | 43,309   | 40,945   |\n| Stamps                 | 1,13,228 | 1,23,966 | 1,50,909 | 1,66,644 |\n| Forests                | 16,417   | 14,000   | 20,906   | 19,274   |\n| P\u00e1ndhri                | 70,883   | 83,307   | 89,352   | 58,805   |\n| Miscellaneous petty taxes | 5,979   | 2,985    | 3,171    | 2,720    |\n| Total Imperial         | 12,32,329 | 12,75,458 | 9,57,530 | 12,73,212 |\n\n* The apparent diminution of receipts under this head arises from an alteration of the year of account.\n### Description of Revenue\n\n| Proceeds in Rupees | 1865-66 | 1866-67 | 1867-68 | 1868-69 |\n|-------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| **Local**         |         |         |         |         |\n| Road cess         | 17,714  | 17,535  | 8,696   | 15,970  |\n| Ferry fund        | 5,152   | 8,126   | 13,000  | 12,650  |\n| Nazul             | 5,857   | 8,869   | 13,000  | 7,050   |\n| School cess       | 17,714  | 17,535  | 8,696   | 15,970  |\n| Postal cess       | 3,726   | 4,436   | 2,174   | 3,992   |\n| Octroi            | 2,993,75| 8,07,050| 2,98,323| 3,02,760|\n| **Total Local**   | 8,49,538| 8,63,551| 8,38,889| 8,58,392|\n| **Grand Total**   | 15,81,867| 16,39,004| 12,96,419| 16,31,604|\n\n### SECTION IV.\u2014Population.\n\nThe total population as ascertained by the census taken in November 1866 may be classed thus\u2014\n\n1.

The Musalm\u00e1ns are thus to the Hind\u00fas and Gonds as one to twenty-one.\n\nA very brief account of the order of time in which the different castes settled in the district may not be out of place. In Bakht Buland's time (A.D. 1700) the bulk of the population was undoubtedly Gond; but during his reign, and possibly to a slight extent before it, there had set in an immigration of Br\u00e1hmans and Kunb\u00eds from Ber\u00e1r and the West, and of Musalm\u00e1ns and Hind\u00fas of all castes from Hindust\u00e1n. Bakht Buland's visits to Delhi had shown him the superiority of foreigners over his subjects in all branches of industry. He encouraged foreigners to settle by granting them unredeemed, or partially redeemed, tracts on very favourable terms, and furthermore attracted them to his own military and administrative services by large grants. These persons again induced numbers of their fellow-countrymen to settle as cultivators; and so, long before the arrival of the first Raghoj\u00ed, the wild original tribes (never probably more than sparsely distributed over the face of the country) had begun to recede before the more skilful and superior settlers. Yet the great influx of the Br\u00e1hmans, Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, Kunbis, Kosht\u00eds, and Dhers doubtless did not commence until the usurpation of the Gond sovereignty by Raghoj\u00ed in A.D. 1743, when Burh\u00e1n Sh\u00e1h, Bakht Buland's descendant, was deposed. Before these tribes the Gonds gradually receded into the mountain tracts, leaving most of the cultivated and culturable tracts in the\nhands of the new comers. The Gonds are now as one to eighteen of the strictly Hind\u00fa population. The Musalm\u00e1ns have come from all directions\u2014some from the Delhi country, some from Ber\u00e1r and the West, but probably the greatest number from the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s dominions in the south. Only a very few trace their ancestry in these parts as far back as the time of Bakht Buland. By far the greater portion came with, and after, the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s.\n\nThe language of the bulk of the population is Mar\u00e1th\u00ed; but Urd\u00fa (excepting amongst the women) is generally understood. The language of the country-people is not pure Mar\u00e1th\u00ed, but a patois consisting of an ungrammatical mixture of the two languages. There is nothing in the religion or in the customs of either Hind\u00fas or Musalm\u00e1ns especially peculiar to this part of the country. The Br\u00e1hmans profess to worship Brahm\u00e1, Vishnu, and Siva equally. It is probable, however, that Siva is most worshipped. The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, Kunb\u00eds, Kosht\u00eds, and even the outcaste Dhers (the classes forming the great bulk of the population), almost exclusively worship Siva, under the appellation of Mah\u00e1deva. The M\u00e1rv\u00e1r\u00eds are many of them Jains, worshippers of P\u00e1rsvan\u00e1th.\n\nThe agricultural classes are chiefly Kunb\u00eds, Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, Pard\u00e9s\u00eds, Tel\u00eds, Lodh\u00eds, M\u00e1l\u00eds, Bar\u00e1\u00eds, and Pardh\u00e1ns. The best, as well as most numerous, are without doubt the Kunb\u00eds. They are simple, frugal, and generally honest in their dealings with each other. In general industry, in capability for sustained labour, and in agricultural skill, they will bear no comparison with the J\u00e1ts and other good cultivators of Upper India; but still they may be regarded as the backbone of the country. The Br\u00e1hmans follow many different professions. They are priests, shopkeepers, grain-sellers, bankers, servants, writers, and a few of them soldiers. Their manners are more rude and homely than those of their kindred in Hindust\u00e1n. They are often fair scholars and efficient public servants. The most important of the industrial, but non-agricultural, classes are the Kosht\u00eds and Dhers. These are the weavers and spinners of the country, the manufacturers of the different fabrics of cloth which the district has for many years past so largely produced. The Gonds now form a very unimportant section of the people, and any detailed examination into their religion and habits would be out of place here. They still preserve in some degree the rude forms of their old religion, the chief object of their worship being Bh\u00edmsen, who is represented by a piece of iron fixed in a stone or in a tree. But many of them have betaken themselves to the worship of Mah\u00e1deva, and most of them have adopted more or less of the Hind\u00fa religious observances. Among the Mohammadans there is nothing specially peculiar to this part of the country. They engage in every sort of occupation\u2014farming, trading, service, and the like. Most of the Br\u00e1hmans and the trading and the artisan classes take two meals a day\u2014one in the morning, and the other in the evening. Field labourers take three\u2014one in the early morning, one at midday, and the third after sunset. All classes, except Br\u00e1hmans, M\u00e1rv\u00e1r\u00eds, and a few others, eat animal food when they can afford it. All the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 tribes eat fowls and eggs\u2014the food held in so much abhorrence by all the higher castes in Hindust\u00e1n. With the same exceptions, viz. the Br\u00e1hmans, M\u00e1rv\u00e1r\u00eds, and a few others, all the people use spirituous liquor distilled from the fruit of the mhowa tree. The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s and Kunb\u00eds indeed profess not to drink, but in private almost all do consume spirits. Generally, however, the people drink in moderation, and the use of spirits appears to have no bad effect on them. But two castes\u2014the Dhers and the Gonds\u2014\nare notable exceptions to this rule of moderation. Many of these are habitual drunkards. The mass of the people are orderly and well-disposed. They are quiet, peaceable, and without much physical courage; they are rather simple than crafty; their manners, if we except the Br\u0101hmans, are rude and unpolished. They are neither treacherous, vindictive, nor cruel. They are kind to their relations and to their women, who are allowed a large amount of liberty. Jealousy is rare, not perhaps because of any great amount of chastity amongst their women, but more because the general standard of conjugal fidelity is low. They have little of that cringing servility to superiors seen in many parts of India. Amongst each other they are usually truthful and straightforward, but when they disagree and have to bring forward their disputes in the courts, they are often regardless of truth. The Br\u0101hmans, M\u00e1rw\u0101ris, Bani\u00e1s, and other classes, who are either wholly or partly traders or bankers, are intelligent and generally trustworthy. They are quick to enter into undertakings of enterprise, and to adopt any modern improvement likely in the end to be serviceable to themselves. The agricultural classes are for the most part honest, stolid, apathetic, and naturally averse to innovation of any kind. Heinous crimes are rare, as will be seen from the following table for three years:\n\n| Crimes                  | Number of Crimes perpetrated during Population | Number of Cases of Crime to each 100,000 souls in 1868 |\n|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n|                         | 1866.  | 1867. | 1868. | Population |                                           |\n| Murders                 | 4      | 5     | 6     |             | .9                                                |\n| Cases of culpable homicide | 7      | 1     | 0     |             | .0                                                |\n| Dacoity                 | 2      | 4     | 3     |             | .5                                                |\n| Robbery                 | 6      | 4     | 3     |             | .5                                                |\n| Thefts                  | 1,009  | 743   | 661   | 639,841     | 103\u00b72                                            |\n\nOf late the condition of the agricultural classes has been steadily improving.\n\nSocial condition. Apart from the various benefits resulting from the thirty years' settlement, the last few years have brought with them the greatly enhanced demand for cotton for the English market, and the flow of a steady exportation of grain and cereals to Ber\u00e1ir and the West; and these conditions have been accompanied by increased means of transit and exportation by road and rail. Large tracts of country hitherto growing edible grain have been brought under cotton cultivation; and of the grain grown, the ryot or farmer, after laying by sufficient for his own or for local supply, proceeds to sell the remainder for exportation towards the West. The country, thus drained of its edible grain, has had in a large measure to look for its supplies to districts on the East and North, from which a steady tide of importation has set in. The result has been that though the price of food and the general expenses of living have nearly trebled, the agriculturists, having found markets so profitable for the disposal of their produce, are now in a condition of hitherto unexampled prosperity. They have for the most part been able to dispense with the money-lenders altogether, and have indeed, many of them, saved a considerable amount in cash, which, it is to be feared, they still prefer to hoard, instead of expending it\non improved stock or instruments of tillage, or in the gratification of secondary wants. Improved farming stock, and indulgence in the gratification of hitherto unknown luxuries, will no doubt follow; it is after all only a question of time. But at present the possession of a surplus of cash suggests to the ryot but little beyond the treasuring of rupees, or the purchase of ornaments for his wife and family. As regards the non-agricultural portion of the people, they too are on the whole better off than they used to be, though their share in the increased prosperity is but small when compared to that of the agriculturists. The increase in the wages of labour, if it has not overstepped, has at least kept pace with the rise in the prices of food; and the demand for labour, especially for the lower classes of skilled labour, has largely increased. Most of the artisans and labourers are well fed, well lodged, and sufficiently clad. Of real indigence there is little or none.\n\nThe total number of towns and kasbas containing above 2,000 inhabitants is thirty-five, and the aggregate number of their inhabitants is 315,851. The total number of villages and hamlets containing a population below 2,000 is 2,193.\n\nThe size, population, and importance of the large towns, when compared to the total district population and area, are rather remarkable. The circumstance is perhaps, in some measure, to be accounted for by the system of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 government, which made the kam\u00e1visd\u00e1r, or head administrative official of each pargana, reside at the head-quarters of the pargana. The parganas were small and many. The kam\u00e1visd\u00e1r brought in his train a numerous retinue, for whose food, lodging, and clothing arrangements had to be made on the spot, and thus the nucleus of something like a town was commenced at once by the drawing together of a body of artisans, grain-sellers, and others, who were required to provide for the wants of the officials and their followers. The cloth trade again, which is so largely followed and so widely dispersed over the district, must have done much to increase the towns. There may be other special causes on which it would here be out of place to speculate. At all events, to whatever cause ascribable, the preponderance in number of the rural over the urban population is here much smaller than in most other districts in India.\n\nThe principal towns are the following:\n\n**N\u00e1gp\u00far Tahsil.**\n\n1. N\u00e1gp\u00far.\n2. K\u00e1mth\u00ed.\n3. Gumg\u00e1on.\n4. B\u00e1z\u00e1rg\u00e1on.\n5. Kalmeswar.\n6. Dh\u00e1p\u00e9w\u00e1r\u00e1.\n7. T\u00e1kalgh\u00e1t.\n8.

W\u00e1kori.\nBut none of them, excepting N\u00e1gp\u00far and K\u00e1mth\u00ed, were, until very lately, anything more than an agglomeration of houses, built for the most part of mud walls; sometimes, it is true, tiled, but oftener thatched. They had no regularly-defined streets, and no drained roads; the houses were ugly, and built not in rows, but anyhow, the corners and fronts pointing in any direction, according to the fancy of the builder; the roads (such as they were) were narrow lanes\u2014in the dry season passages, and in the rains water-channels. There was no attempt at conservancy; and the habits of the people being in some respects the reverse of cleanly, the state of the interior of the larger towns was excessively filthy. Heaps of cattle-refuse, manure, and rubbish lay piled about and exposed in the most public places, while great chasms, from which the mud had been originally excavated to form the walls of the houses, diffused pestilential malaria from the drainage and filth collected in them. Even now, after the expenditure of no small amount of pains on the part of the government officials, the smaller towns and villages are much behind those of many other parts of India. Still a beginning has been made towards persuading the people of the advantages of the more obvious sanitary precautions. Many of the landholders have adopted a regular system of whitewashing all the houses in the villages, and of insisting on proper conservancy. But as regards the larger towns the advance made within the last few years has been really great. Municipalities acting under the district officials have been appointed, and systems of conservancy have been matured and carried out. Funds have been raised, and municipal works have been pushed forward with a rapidity and effect sufficient in some cases to transform the appearance of the places; wide thoroughfares, metalled and drained, have been driven through the more populous quarters, commodious school buildings, dispensaries, police stations, and sar\u00e1\u00eds have been erected, central market-places have been formed, and the people have been induced to build their dwelling-places in a style suitable to the new streets.\n\nThe agricultural produce may be divided into three classes\u2014the khar\u00edf or rain crops; the rab\u00ed or spring crops; and the B\u00e1g h\u00e1\u00edt or garden crops. For B\u00e1g h\u00e1\u00edt the best black soil is almost invariably selected. The khar\u00edf and rab\u00ed crops usually grown on the different soils are as follows:\n\n| Soils          | Crops                                      |\n|----------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| K\u00e1l\u00ed (black soil). | Cotton, jaw\u00e1rfi (holcus sorghum), t\u00fbr (cajanas indicus), rice. |\n| Murand (brown clay with Jaw\u00e1rfi, mung (phaseolus mungo), limestone nodules). | Gram, mas\u00farfi (ervum lens) wheat, peas. |\n| Khard\u00ed (white clay with Jaw\u00e1rfi, t\u00fbr, vetches, limestone nodules). | Wheat, castor, gram, peas. |\n| Bard\u00ed (stony). | Cotton, jaw\u00e1rfi, t\u00fbr. |\n| Ret\u00e1d\u00ed (sandy). | Castor. |\n\nCrops.\n\nKhar\u00edf. Rab\u00ed.\n\nWheat, linseed, safflower, peas.\n\nCastor.\nThe ploughing for the kharif (autumn) harvest commences in April. The paring-plough (bakhar) is first used to level any irregularities of the surface; the ground is then ploughed three or four times or even more. The seed is not sown till after the first fall of rain, which ordinarily takes place early in June. The tifan or treble drill-rake is the instrument ordinarily used for sowing. Three furrows are thus sown at once. Shortly after the crop appears above the surface, the davan or hoe-plough is passed between the furrows to destroy the grass and, if necessary, to thin the crop, while the earth is turned over so as to cover the roots. After the lapse of a few weeks the hoe-plough is once more used, and sometimes even a third time.\n\nCotton has now become the most important, and generally the most remunerative, of all the crops. During the last four years its cultivation has been so stimulated by the demand in the English market, that it is now raised throughout large tracts of country formerly devoted to the cultivation of edible grain. The most valuable crops are grown in the north-west corner of the K\u00e1tol tahsil; but the whole of the K\u00e1tol and N\u00e1gp\u00far tahsils may now be said to be cotton-growing country. The total out-turn of this crop in the year 1868-69 was calculated at 86,081 mds. or 6,886,480 lbs. The indigenous staple is in itself of a fair quality; but much improvement is to be looked for by introduction of foreign seed, and from the sowing in one part of the country of seed selected from another part. Some extensive experiments in this interchange of indigenous seed are now being tried; and seed-gardens designed to afford picked seed for distribution have been established. Improvements in the method of cultivation have followed the increased demand for the staple, and there seems little reason to doubt that the cotton of this district may in a short time equal any producible in the country. The weeding and picking are better and more carefully done than they used to be; and many cultivators have already begun to adopt that plan of light but careful manuring which seems in this soil to produce the heaviest crops. Rice is not extensively cultivated, but wherever irrigation is available from artificial tanks a few rice-fields rarely fail to be seen. Jaw\u00e1ri is grown in great abundance, chiefly in the N\u00e1gp\u00far and K\u00e1tol tahsils. The crops are very fine. A good deal of t\u00fbr is grown; it is often raised in the same field as cotton, generally five ridges of cotton to one of t\u00fbr.\n\nFor the rab\u00ed (spring) harvest the fields are first worked with the paring-plough in June and July. They are then ploughed throughout the rains (the oftener the better) according to the means and leisure of the husbandmen. The sowing takes place in October and November, and the crop is ready for harvest at the end of February or beginning of March. Wheat is the grand rab\u00ed crop. The great wheat-field is in the Umrer and R\u00e1mtek tahsils, in a tract lying to the south of R\u00e1mtek, and enclosed on the east by the Bhand\u00e1ra boundary, on the south by the hills below Umrer, and on the west by a line drawn north and south through Nandardhan, Harbo\u00ee, Magardhokr\u00e1, and Sirsi. Here this cultivation is uninterrupted over many miles of country. In February the whole country appears covered with one vast expanse of yellow corn. The crop is usually cut at the end of February. The corn is trodden out by bullocks, and winnowed in the wind. The other rab\u00ed crops do not need any particular mention. Chan\u00e1 (gram) is grown chiefly in the Umrer and R\u00e1mtek tahsils; the remaining crops, perhaps, most in the tahsils of N\u00e1gp\u00far and K\u00e1tol. The alsi (linseed) of the district is said to be very good. The erand\u00ed (castor plant) of the K\u00e1tol tahsil is particularly fine.\nThe garden cultivation is devoted to sugarcane, plantain, tobacco, poppy, betel-leaf, yams, ginger, turmeric, garlic, onions, carrots, turnips, and other vegetables. Sugarcane is cultivated, but not nearly so much as it might be. It is chiefly raised in the valley of the Sur in the R\u00e1mtek tahsil, and in the rich garden villages of K\u00e1tol. The crops raised are fair, but the gur (molasses) manufactured from the cane is said to be poor. One reason for the comparative neglect of sugarcane cultivation may be this, that here the mhowa flower is used instead of gur for the distillation of spirituous liquor; another reason is, that the people have not yet learnt the art of manufacturing sugar from gur. The ground for sugarcane cultivation is first prepared by the bakhar, and then by the plough. It is next covered with a thick layer of manure, channels and cross-channels for irrigation are then made, and the whole field is well-watered. The plants are raised from cuttings from the old canes. They throw out their sprouts (one from each knot of the cutting) commonly in the course of thirty-five or forty days. The young sprouts are at first carefully supported with earth, which is not removed until they are grown to some height above the ground. As the plant grows up, the branches are tied up. From ten and a half to eleven and a half months elapse from the planting of the cuttings to the complete ripening of the canes. Continued irrigation is required until the monsoon sets in; and as this crop is considered the highest branch of garden cultivation, so its successful management demands skill, patience, and capital all combined.\n\nThe plantain is largely cultivated in all the garden villages; it has a triennial duration, and is generated from sprouts of the old plants. The betel-leaf cultivation is carried on with much success in a few gardens. Those at R\u00e1mtek are celebrated throughout this part of India for the excellence of their produce. A large portion indeed of the crops is now sent by rail to Bombay. The plant requires a particular kind of soil, and has to be partly sheltered from the outer air. This is effected by enclosing the plantation round the sides, and by roofing it over at the top with a framework made of grass and bamboos. Much manure is employed. Ghee, or clarified butter, is used largely for this purpose. The plant has a triennial duration, and requires ground that has lain fallow for some time. It is propagated from cuttings, and is planted in July. The leaves are not fit for use until twelve months after the shoots are put in, and thereafter they are picked every fortnight. The poppy is cultivated in a few places for opium. The cultivation might easily be increased. The juice is extracted by scoring the poppy heads from top to bottom with a sharp knife. The juice thus expressed is subjected to the usual processes; but there are no skilful manipulators in this part of the country, and the opium is not considered very good. None of the other garden-crops need special description. The fruit-trees cultivated in gardens and orchards may be briefly noticed. The oranges, lemons, sweet limes, mangoes, and guavas are plentiful, and remarkably fine. The N\u00e1gp\u00far oranges in particular are justly celebrated for their size and flavour. Their cultivation is increasing, and they are exported in large quantities to Bombay. Manure is applied to all kinds of garden cultivation. It is usually produced from the cultivator's own stock. Sometimes flocks of sheep and goats are turned out into the fields. The people quite appreciate the use of manure for all crops. The supply, however, is very limited, as large quantities of cow-dung are used in fires for cooking. Vegetable manuring is not much practised, but stubble after being burnt is often used as manure. Irrigation is almost entirely confined to garden cultivation and rice. Wells are ordinarily the means used in the case of the former, and artificial tanks for the latter. Enclosures are only used for garden\ncultivation and for fields adjoining jungles, where they are required to protect the crops from wild animals. The rest of the cultivation is all open, a narrow strip of unploughed land serving to demarcate field from field. The village boundaries are marked by stone pillars.\n\nHorse-breeding has hitherto been quite neglected. Indeed, excepting at N\u00e1gp\u00far and K\u00e1nth\u00ed, there are no horses. Ponies of an inferior breed are to be met with, but not very many even of these. Recently an attempt has been made (on a very small scale) to improve the breed of these ponies by crossing them with Arab blood. Horned cattle are bred in large numbers. The breed is smaller than that of Upper India, and very inferior in size and appearance to the Mysore and Nellore stock. On the other hand they are compact and wiry, and possess great bottom, endurance, and speed. The trotting bullocks used with the light travelling cart, or rengi, are well known, and one or two pairs of these little animals are possessed by every well-to-do m\u00e1lguz\u00e1\u0301r. They will frequently travel long distances of thirty miles or more, at the rate of six miles an hour. The district, however, does not appear to breed cattle in sufficient numbers for its own consumption. Numbers are imported every year from R\u00e1\u0301p\u00far, and also from Upper India, especially from Cawnpore. The price of a good pair of plough bullocks ranges from 70 to 150 rupees. For a pair of fast-trotting bullocks from 200 to 250 rupees is frequently given. For field operations it seems certain that it would be an improvement to have animals of more power than those of the indigenous breed. The district authorities have lately imported some very fine bulls of the Nellore breed to cross with the indigenous cows, but sufficient time has not yet elapsed to judge of the results. There are plenty of buffaloes, but the breed is not more than ordinarily good. Sheep and goats are to be met with in abundance all over the district. The best flocks of sheep are reared in the K\u00e1tol and N\u00e1gp\u00far tahs\u00edls; but the wool is coarse and inferior, and the mutton coarse, though sweet. Some Patna and other foreign rams have recently been imported, and have been very successfully crossed with indigenous ewes. Domestic fowls of every sort and description are reared in great numbers. The Mar\u00e1\u0301th\u00e1 game-fowls are remarkably fine.\n\nThe total area of forest lands may be computed at about 320,000 acres.\n\nForest produce. Until lately there was no system of conservation, and the result has been that most large-sized timber of the valuable sorts, such as teak (*teckona grandis*), s\u00e1l (*shorea robusta*), and shsham (*dalbergia latifolia*), has been felled. To prevent the total destruction of the best timber, it was found necessary altogether to prohibit for the time the cutting of these valuable trees, and to adopt a system of regular conservation, which has been in force since 1862. The saplings are now making progress, but it will not be for some years to come that any large timber will be fit to cut. Of forest fruit-trees the most important is the mhowa, from the flowers of which is distilled *d\u00e1r\u00fa*\u2014the spirituous liquor most used in this part of the country. A little honey and bees-wax are annually gathered from the wild honeycombs, which the insect generally constructs on the loftiest forest trees. Excellent grass grows in most of the forests. This grass is cut and stored as fodder for cattle, and is also used for thatching houses.\n\nThe district is rich in the different sorts of building stone. In speaking of Stone and minerals. geology, the trap, sandstone, laterite, and granitic formations have all been described. The basalt is not always found, near the surface, of a sufficiently large grain for building purposes. Wherever it is so found, it forms an excellent building material.\nThe Railway Company have used it largely in their bridges, and lately it has come into use for building in the town and station of N\u00e1gp\u00far. Broken up into small fragments, it forms the very best metalling procurable for roads. A very fine sandstone found near K\u00e1mth\u00ed is much used for building. The sandstone at Silew\u00e1r\u00e1 is much prized for ornamental carving, being fine-grained, soft, of good colour, and free from impurities. Granite rock is plentiful, but is not much used for building; it is of short grain and of variable composition. Laterite is used, and might be more utilised than it is. When dug from the quarry this composition is quite soft, but when exposed to the air it rapidly hardens and forms a durable building material. The limestones are also used for building. The lime used for making mortar is procured from the quarries of kankar, which are to be found almost everywhere in the alluvial and regar soils. Coal has not yet been found, but probably it does exist more or less in the sandstone formations, which lie between the coal-producing sandstone tracts of Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 and Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1. Associated with the trap-rocks, or enclosed in them, are occasionally found chalcedony, flint, heliotrope, and jasper. Some clays well adapted for pottery are to be met with here and there, especially in the T\u00e1kl\u00ed beds near N\u00e1gp\u00far, and at Chicholf north of Pilk\u00e1pur. Of metals there is a scarcity. Gold is said to have been noticed in a quartz matrix near Nandardhan, but this seems doubtful. Indubitably it exists in very small particles in the sand of some of the rivers, notably in that of the Sur. The particles are, however, so minute, and the labour of washing the sand so great, that very few persons follow the occupation of gold-washers. Sulphuret of lead (galena) has been noticed in one or two places. Iron-ore of good quality is found near Mansar, and must exist in many other places. It is too hard to be worked by natives, who prefer extracting the metal from the softer oxides contained in laterite rock. Manganese exists with the iron, especially connected with the laterite beds in the valley of the Sur river, and at Maund\u00e1 (Mohod\u00e1) on the Kanh\u00e1n.\n\nThe great article of manufacture is cloth. Cotton and silk fabrics of all sorts and descriptions are produced in abundance, from dhot\u00eds (cloths worn round the loins), valued at 500 rupees a pair, to the common cloths, costing a rupee and a half, worn by common coolies. Pagris (turbans), s\u00e1ris (garment pieces worn by women), and dhot\u00eds and dopatt\u00e1s (cloths worn by men), are the articles most manufactured. The most noticeable of all are the N\u00e1gp\u00far and Umrer dhot\u00eds. These are made of the very finest cotton-cloth (undyed), fringed with a border of silk. The pattern and colour of the silk border is according to the taste of the wearer. Some of the designs are very tasteful; they are formed by interweaving silk of different colours with gold thread, the groundwork of the whole being generally of a brilliant crimson. The pagris are generally made of finely-woven cotton-cloth either coloured or undyed, with a broad fringe of gold. S\u00e1ris and dopatt\u00e1s are sometimes made of plain white cotton-cloth, with handsome silk borders, sometimes entirely of silk, sometimes of dyed cotton-cloth with silk border. The very best of these finer cloths are made in N\u00e1gp\u00far and Umrer; but Kh\u00e1p\u00e1, Maund\u00e1, Bhiw\u00e1p\u00far, and many other towns also manufacture superior fabrics. The manufacture is in the hands of the Kosht\u00eds\u2014an industrious and skilful class of workmen. The looms are somewhat elaborate in their gear, and difficult to work. The weaver has to serve a long apprenticeship before he becomes a skilled workman. High commendation and several prizes were awarded to specimens of these fabrics at the recent Exhibitions at \u00c1gra, Lucknow, N\u00e1gp\u00far, Jabalp\u00far, and \u00c1kol\u00e1. The coarser fabrics consist of stout cotton-cloth, either white or dyed in various colours. The manufacture is carried on all over\nthe district. Indeed there is hardly a considerable village that has not a number of persons engaged in this manufacture. The workmen are chiefly Dhers. The rest of the manufactures are unimportant, and may be dismissed in a few words. They consist of blankets, white and black, made from indigenous wool, t\u00e1tpt\u00e1ti or sacking, coarse basket-work, common pottery, and some creditable brass work consisting of lot\u00e1s, kator\u00e1s, and cooking utensils. These last, however, are made only in a very few towns. There are a few workers in steel. One house is noted for the manufacture of steel weapons, such as daggers and hunting spears. Stone and wood carving had in former days reached a very creditable stage of progress, as old carvings abundantly testify. The art has to a certain extent fallen into disuse. There are still however, especially at N\u00e1gpur itself, many excellent workmen; and some efforts have lately been made to revive the art. The workmen are found quite capable of executing European designs, and some of the indigenous patterns show excellent taste and workmanship.\n\nThe trade of the district was always considerable. In the time of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, grain, oil-seeds, and country cloth formed the chief articles of export. Under the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 rule, the commodities the district received European piece and miscellaneous goods; salt from Bombay and Ber\u00e1r; silks, sugar, and spices from Bundelkhand, Mirz\u00e1p\u00far, and the North; and rice from R\u00e1ip\u00far, Bhand\u00e1ra, and the East. Except in times of depression, produced by the foreign struggles or internal commotions of the State, the general tendency of trade under the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s was to increase; but there were three prominent causes at work to prevent the rapid development of commerce. The first was the difficult nature of the country, and the wretched means of communication, impeding equally import and export. The second was the feeling of insecurity from the greed of the rulers of the State or their agents. Forced loans were frequently taken from wealthy merchants and bankers, without any pretext whatever, except that the State wanted money, with the full understanding on both sides that the amount was to be wholly or partially left unpaid. It would seem indeed that the later N\u00e1gpur rulers indulged in this species of plunder to a greater degree than almost any other native government. The result of this system was to make the merchant hoard his surplus wealth, and secrete it in the form of bullion and jewels, instead of embarking it in profitable, but visible, mercantile investments. The third cause is to be found in the existence of certain regulations trammelling the free export of grain, and in the establishment of vicious systems of private monopolies and transit duties. The two last causes have been removed for many years; indeed nothing of them but a few of the transit duties remained after the deposition of A'p\u00e1 S\u00e1h\u00edb in 1818. The last of these duties were not removed until after the annexation of the N\u00e1gpur kingdom in 1853.\n\nThe last six years have been marked by a sudden, and hitherto unprecedented, commercial activity, and accumulation of wealth. Cotton traffic. Many causes, diversified in their character, but similar to those operating in other parts of India, have contributed to produce this effect. But two of them stand prominently forward. The first is to be found in the increased demand for cotton for the English market; the second in the very recent development of communications by road and railway. The latter subject will be treated of separately. The effect produced on the district by the increased demand for cotton requires some brief mention. The increased demand for the English market first affected the cotton sowings in the agricultural year 1862-63. In that year the price of cotton at Bombay more\nthan doubled. In the district of Wardh\u00e1 and in the Ber\u00e1ra\u2014always cotton-growing tracts\u2014the cultivation was at once enormously extended, taking up large tracts of country hitherto devoted to the cultivation of edible grains. A similar, though less extended, movement took place in this district, where the cultivation probably doubled. In 1863-64 the prices at Bombay rose still higher, and the cultivation and export of the staple continued to extend. This district, always in the habit of drawing considerable quantities of grain from Chhatt\u00edsgarh and Bhand\u00e1ra, and also of exporting grain towards Wardh\u00e1 and the Ber\u00e1ras, now required more from the former country, and could afford less for the latter. The Chhatt\u00edsgarh and Bhand\u00e1ra country was able to meet the demand, and exported in enormous quantities to N\u00e1gpur, Wardh\u00e1, and the Ber\u00e1ras. The local prices of food rose, but on the other hand so great was the profit from the cotton exported to Bombay, that the aggregate result was a large augmentation of agricultural wealth. In 1864-65 the prices of cotton fell. In 1865-66 they again slightly rose. The increased cultivation and export of the staple had, however, been too firmly established to yield much to these fluctuations. On the other hand, partial failure of the grain crops in Chhatt\u00edsgarh during these two years lessened the import of cereal produce from that country, and this district, obliged to look elsewhere for its supplies, began to draw from an entirely new source, viz. Jabalp\u00far and the North. At the same time the extended cotton cultivation in the N\u00e1gpur and K\u00e1tol tahsils had now withdrawn so much land from cultivation of jaw\u00e1rf, that for the first time there was an ebb in the usual tide of traffic from East to West, and there sprang up an import of this grain from Ber\u00e1ra.\n\nAt the present time the agricultural produce exported consists of cotton, oil-seeds, and some edible grain; while the imports are rice, wheat, and other edible grain, partly from Chhatt\u00edsgarh, and partly from Jabalp\u00far and the North, and some jaw\u00e1rf from the Ber\u00e1ras. In articles not being agricultural produce, the chief imports are European piece and miscellaneous goods from Bombay, salt from the Concan, sugar and spices from Mirz\u00e1p\u00far and the North, and hardware from Bhand\u00e1ra and from the Narbad\u00e1 districts. The only export of consequence is the country cloth.\n\nThe trade in salt and in European miscellaneous goods appears to be greatly on the increase. The annual import of sugar, spices, and hardware is probably stationary, or nearly so.\n\nIt seems probable that the manufacture of the commoner sorts of country cloth is on the decline. The increased local prices of raw cotton arising from the late exports, and the sharp competition of machine-made stuffs from England, have combined to depress the local manufacture. Last year indeed the exports were apparently in excess of those of the year preceding, the fall in the prices of cotton having again tended to stimulate local manufacture, while at the same time there was a diminution in the import of European piece-goods. There appears, however, to be little doubt that this was a mere fluctuation, arising chiefly from the depressed condition of the Bombay market. Some of the ordinary sorts of cloth peculiar to N\u00e1gpur and Umre have now been imitated in England, and are actually sold here at much lower prices than their local prototypes. There seems, too, to be a growing preference for the English goods, and already many of the weavers, weary of competing any longer, have betaken themselves to more profitable employment. On the whole then, although the manufacture and export of home-made cloth is still briskly maintained, it seems probable that in the natural course of things the trade must decline, and perhaps eventually disappear before machine-made stuffs.\nBy far the largest entrep\u00f4t for wheat, rice, and other edible grain is K\u00e1mth\u00ed, where there are many wholesale dealers; other considerable entrep\u00f4ts are N\u00e1gp\u00far, Umre, S\u00e1oner, Kh\u00e1p\u00e1, and K\u00e1tol. With one or two important exceptions the trade is in the hands of the M\u00e1rw\u00e1ris, who have their agents for the purposes of purchase and import stationed in Bhand\u00e1ra and Chhattisgarh, and latterly at Jabalp\u00far. They also buy in the open market from the G\u00e1onthi\u00e1s (village headmen), who bring in the corn at their own venture from the countries where it is grown. They export again, either by consignment to their own agents stationed in Wardh\u00e1 and in the Ber\u00e1rs, or else sell at the entrep\u00f4ts to agents sent by the wholesale dealers in those districts. The district has no entrep\u00f4ts for cotton, if we except K\u00e1mth\u00ed, which does a small trade in this staple. The cotton of the N\u00e1gp\u00far tahs\u00edl mostly finds its way to the great entrep\u00f4t of Hingangh\u00e1t in the Wardh\u00e1 district; that of the K\u00e1tol tahs\u00edl to Amr\u00e1oti in Ber\u00e1r; and from these places it is sent to the different stations on the railway for transport to Bombay. The trade in European cloth and mixed goods is chiefly in the hands of the Bohr\u00e1\u00eds, who have large shops at N\u00e1gp\u00far. The retail dealers buy from these Bohr\u00e1\u00eds, and disperse the stuffs throughout the town and country b\u00e1z\u00e1rs. Br\u00e1hmans and M\u00e1rw\u00e1ris are also engaged in this trade, as also in the export trade of country cloth. The entire interchange of commodities may be thus summarised. The district exports raw cotton, grains, and other agricultural produce and cloth, and receives in return salt, sugar, English piece and miscellaneous goods, cattle, hardware, and cutlery. The balance of trade is without doubt greatly in favour of the district, and is adjusted by imports of bullion, which it is to be feared is still extensively (though less so now than formerly) hoarded in cash or ornaments, or in other unproductive representations of wealth.\n\nAlmost all the \"s\u00e1huk\u00e1ri\" or banking transactions are carried on by the M\u00e1rw\u00e1ris. There are, however, a few banking houses conducted by Br\u00e1hmans. The rate of interest is certainly less than it used to be. This is the natural result of the increased plentifulness of money. It is impossible to give any average rate of interest, as this varies with so many variable conditions, such as the amount to be borrowed, the nature of security, and the tightness of the money-market, but it may be said that money can always be obtained, on good security, for twelve per cent per annum, and often for considerably less. The security demanded is usually the pledge or pawn of valuable jewels and the like, mortgages on real property, or personal security of men of known substance. Ordinarily the better class of bankers will not lend very small sums. But some few of the very wealthiest of them combine the largest with the smallest sorts of transactions. Besides their large establishments at N\u00e1gp\u00far, these men have their agents established at every petty town in the district, and lend out the very smallest sums to poor people at high interest. Gold and silver bullion used to be imported both from Calcutta and Bombay, but now it comes almost entirely from Bombay. The gold importation has probably quadrupled during the last few years. The value of this import, it is believed, reached in the year 1866-67 the enormous sum of forty l\u00e1khs of rupees in N\u00e1gp\u00far alone, while the silver bullion was valued at ten l\u00e1khs. The increased demand for the precious metals is directly traceable to the flourishing state of the export trade in cotton and grain. The successful agriculturist has as yet little idea of investing his savings in anything but ornaments, and the bankers have regulated their importations accordingly. The profit derived by the bankers in this branch of their business is not so large as might be expected,\nbeing probably not more than from four to six annas on every hundred rupees' worth of bullion. The most extensive transactions in bills of exchange are with Calcutta, and after Calcutta with the following towns according to the order in which they are placed:\u2014Bombay, Mirzapur, Benares, Indore, Amr\u0101oti, Jaipur, and Haidar\u0101b\u0101d. All the principal bankers have agents and correspondents at these places. It would be impossible to state the annual amount of transactions, but it may be confidently affirmed that their increase of late years has been enormous.\n\nThe rate of exchange varies with the variable conditions governing the state of the money-market, both at home and at the place on which a bill is to be drawn, but bankers generally manage to make a fair profit at all times, and under all conditions of the money-market. There are regular quotations of exchange well known and kept to by the S\u0101huk\u0101r brotherhood in their dealings with one another, but they are not the least ashamed to make as much as they possibly can out of chance customers. In granting bills they will charge such people far beyond the current rates of exchange, and think it quite in the legitimate line of business. In N\u0101gp\u016br the money-market is generally tight from October to March, when money is out in the purchase of cotton and grains, and easy for the remainder of the year. It is not usual to grant bills payable at sight, though these can always be procured at a high rate of exchange. In the ordinary course of business bills are drawn thus:\n\n**Bills drawn on\u2014**\n\n| Town          | Days after sight |\n|---------------|------------------|\n| Calcutta      | 61               |\n| Bombay        | 13               |\n| Mirzapur      | 51               |\n| Benares       | 51               |\n| Indore        | 21               |\n| Amr\u0101oti       | 13               |\n| Jaipur        | 45               |\n| Haidar\u0101b\u0101d    | 21               |\n\nThe construction of roads, whether main or branch lines, is of very recent date. Under the Mar\u0101th\u0101s the only made road was the line towards Sambalp\u016br\u2014a fairly serviceable road made under English superintendence for postal service between Calcutta and Bombay.\n\nSECTION VII.\u2014COMMUNICATIONS.\n\nRoads.\n\nThis postal route was long ago discontinued, and the road fell into disuse. Excepting this, the only road, until very lately, was the short line (nine miles) from N\u0101gp\u016br to K\u0101nth\u012b, which was metalled and bridged some years ago. The history of road-making, in short, is comprised entirely in the period succeeding the year 1861, when the Central Provinces administration was formed. During the past eight years strenuous exertions have been made to open out both main and branch lines. A liberal expenditure of money and labour, and a large amount of professional skill, have been brought to bear on their construction, and the operations have been continuously maintained. In this respect N\u0101gp\u016br has been obviously at a great advantage as compared with any other district in the Central Provinces; for as most of the new imperial lines of communication leading to distant places have all been planned so as to radiate from N\u0101gp\u016br, the capital of the Central Provinces, so it has happened that the N\u0101gp\u016br district has reaped both in the first instance, and in the most plentiful degree, the advantages which these great works have conferred on the country at large. The recent prolongation of the railway to N\u0101gp\u016br has linked the district with Bombay. Four great imperial roads, starting from the city of\nN\u00e1gp\u00far, traverse the district to the north, to the south, to the east, and to the north-west, while district cross-roads and feeders (purely local works) are being pushed forward from town to town, and from tract to tract, with due regard to the trading and agricultural interests, which the railway and the great imperial roads seem most likely to subserve. The result of these operations has been to work a complete metamorphosis in the circumstances and conditions on which traffic and transport depend. And since the change is remarkable, not merely from its magnitude, but still more so from the rapidity with which it has been brought about, it may be worth while to describe the old, before enumerating the new routes of communication, so as to portray the full contrast between the present and the scarcely past. The following descriptions will be easily understood by a reference to the revenue survey map.\n\nBefore 1862 the main line of communication from the north, via Seoni from Mirzapur and Jabalpur, descended the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1 gh\u00e1ts at Kur\u00e1\u00ed in the Seoni district, and passing through Deolap\u00e1r entered this district a little above Chorb\u00e1oli, twenty-eight miles from N\u00e1gp\u00far. Here the line doubled, one branch going via R\u00e1mtek, the other by the village of Songh\u00e1t, and both again converging at a village called Kherd\u00ed, proceeded thence in a single line via S\u00e1tak to K\u00e1mth\u00ed, crossing the Kanh\u00e1n at the Yerkher\u00e1 Gh\u00e1t, in the centre of the military cantonment. Again, between K\u00e1mth\u00ed and N\u00e1gp\u00far there were two routes\u2014the one by the present metalled road (Great Northern) to Sit\u00e1bald\u00ed, the other from the place where the K\u00e1mth\u00ed sar\u00e1i now stands to the heart of the N\u00e1gp\u00far City. This line was in full use for seven months of the year, but traffic was all but impossible during the rains and October. The whole line lay through a dense jungle from Chorb\u00e1oli to the top of the gh\u00e1ts; and this region was unhealthy from malaria for at least four months of the year. Nobody ever travelled at night on account of wild beasts. People obliged to travel in the rains preferred to go from Seoni to Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1, and so to N\u00e1gp\u00far by the old Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 line. The principal routes from Bombay and Ber\u00e1r entered the old N\u00e1gp\u00far province at three separate points on the Wardh\u00e1 river. These points are (1) Jal\u00e1lkher\u00e1, in the north-west corner of the K\u00e1tol tahsil; (2) Bism\u00far; and (3) N\u00e1chang\u00e1on, both in the present district of Wardh\u00e1. The first of these places was in distance from N\u00e1gp\u00far fifty-six miles, the second sixty-seven miles, the third fifty-eight miles. The most important of the three routes was that crossing at N\u00e1chang\u00e1on. Traversing the present district of Wardh\u00e1 from west to east, it entered the N\u00e1gp\u00far district near Asol\u00e1, twenty-six miles from N\u00e1gp\u00far, which it reached by way of the villages of T\u00e1kalgh\u00e1t and Gung\u00e1on. It was by this route that the bulk of the export trade of cloth and silk fabrics was conveyed to J\u00e9ln\u00e1, Aurang\u00e1b\u00e1d, Sat\u00e1r\u00e1, Puna, and other distant cities in the Deccan. The line by Bism\u00far was used in a degree hardly less. It proceeded by K\u00e1ranj\u00e1 (Wardh\u00e1 district), Kondh\u00e1lt, and B\u00e1z\u00e1rg\u00e1on. The Jal\u00e1lkher\u00e1 route went by the town of K\u00e1tol, and traversing the K\u00e1tol tahsil from north-west to south-east, and then passing through Kalmeswar, entered N\u00e1gp\u00far at T\u00e1kl\u00ed. All of these lines were practicable only during the dry months, and then only for the light country carts used here. During the rains they were only passable for pack-bullocks. Such traffic as was obliged to be taken in the rains would generally choose the Bism\u00far line, which is the stoniest of the three, but which traverses less morass and black soil than either of the others. The traffic both ways in the dry months along the Bism\u00far and N\u00e1chang\u00e1on lines was enormous. Security at night was afforded by well-known Par\u00e1os, which were supplied with ordinary provisions for travellers. The traffic from the Bhand\u00e1ra, R\u00e1sp\u00far, and Chhattisgarh country entered the\ndistrict by two main lines\u2014the first leading direct from the town of Bhand\u00e1ra to Maund\u00e1 (Mohod\u00e1)\u2014twenty miles from N\u00e1gp\u00far\u2014on the Kanh\u00e1n, and so through the P\u00e1ld\u00ed suburb into N\u00e1gp\u00far; the second connecting with N\u00e1gp\u00far the towns of Moh\u00e1ri and Tumsar, in the Bhand\u00e1ra district, and the northern portion of the R\u00e1ip\u00far country, entered the district east of V\u00edrs\u00ed, and passing through T\u00e1rs\u00e1 went westwards to K\u00e1mth\u00ed. So far as can be ascertained these lines were occasionally used by strong convoys of Banj\u00e1r\u00e1s with pack-bullocks even during the rains, but like all the rest they were at that season utterly impracticable for wheeled traffic. By these lines were delivered the imports of wheat, rice, and other grain from Chhattisgarh. There were two routes from Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 and the south\u2014one entering the district below Umner, which it reached via Chim\u00far (in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district), and thence led to N\u00e1gp\u00far in a straight line north-west; the other entering just above J\u00e1m (in the Wardh\u00e1 district) passed through T\u00e1kalgh\u00e1t, and entered N\u00e1gp\u00far by the suburb of Son\u00e9g\u00e1o. Lastly there were the routes to Bet\u00fal and Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1, and from these places to Mhow, Ajm\u00edr, and R\u00e9jput\u00e1n\u00e1. These routes, after descending the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1s by the Tal\u00f3 and Moh\u00ed gh\u00e1ts, joined at S\u00e1oner (twenty-one miles north of N\u00e1gp\u00far), reaching N\u00e1gp\u00far by the villages of Adh\u00e1s\u00e1 and Brahmapur\u00ed. The traffic on these was inconsiderable. Like the others they were nearly impassable during the rains. As for the purely local lines, they did not exist at all as defined tracks. Excepting through mountain-passes, their courses were not even demarcated. People made their way from town to village, and from village to market-place, as best they might; the tracks being shifted from watercourse to upland, and from field to field, according to the seasons and alternations of the crops.\n\nSuch were the great arterial lines of communication along which, with no constructed roads, and in despite of every obstacle interposed by nature, a vast traffic to and from this country contrived, during eight months of the year, to force its way to Jabalp\u00far and the North, to Ber\u00e1r, the Deccan, and Bombay; to Bhand\u00e1ra, Chhattisgarh, and the East; to Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d and the South; to R\u00e9jput\u00e1n\u00e1 and the North-West. The little Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 carts, convoys of bullocks and buffaloes, and to some slight extent camels, formed the only means of transport; and with these means the entire imports and exports of the country had to be dragged through tracts of pestilential jungle, through quagmire and morass, down the precipitous banks and across the stony beds of rivers, and over narrow and dangerous hill-passes. The time occupied in transit was of course enormous. The marvel is how so great a traffic could have been conducted at all. What has been done during the last few years to facilitate communication will now be shown.\n\nThat portion of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway known as the N\u00e1gp\u00far branch, leaving the main line from Bombay to Jabalp\u00far, at Bhos\u00e1wal, in the Bombay district of Kh\u00e1ndesh, traverses the Ber\u00e1r country from west to east, and crossing the Wardh\u00e1, near the station of Pulg\u00e9\u00f3n, enters the Central Provinces. From Pulg\u00e9\u00f3n its course is still east. It has stations at Wardh\u00e1 and Sind\u00ed, in the Wardh\u00e1 district, and another at Bor\u00ed, in this district. At Bor\u00ed (nineteen miles from N\u00e1gp\u00far) the line curves sharply to the north and continues in that direction to its terminus at S\u00edt\u00e1bald\u00ed, the western suburb of N\u00e1gp\u00far. The Railway was opened to the terminus on the 20th of February 1867.\n\nNorthern Road. The new Northern Road is now complete the whole way to Jabalp\u00far. The only rivers still unbridged are the Kanh\u00e1n at K\u00e1mth\u00ed, and the Narbad\u00e1 at Jabalp\u00far. The Kanh\u00e1n bridge is now under con-\nstruction. Meantime a temporary pile-bridge is annually erected immediately after the rains, and is in use for eight months of the year. The road leaves N\u00e1gp\u00far close to the railway terminus, and goes to K\u00e1mth\u00ed. Thence, after crossing the Kanh\u00e1n, it proceeds northwards by Mansar and Chorb\u00e1ol\u00ed (twenty-one and twenty-seven miles respectively from N\u00e1gp\u00far), and passing through Deolap\u00e1r enters the Seon\u00ed district, ascends the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1 gh\u00e1ts at Kural\u00ed, and so on through Seon\u00ed over the tableland of the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1s, whence it descends again at a point distant about thirty miles from Jabalp\u00far. In the N\u00e1gp\u00far district its entire course is about thirty-three miles. In this length it has three sar\u00e1\u00eds, exclusive of those in N\u00e1gp\u00far itself, two excellent new ones at K\u00e1mth\u00ed and Mansar, and an old one at Chorb\u00e1ol\u00ed; two travellers' bungalows at K\u00e1mth\u00ed and at Mansar; four police posts at Indor\u00e1, K\u00e1mth\u00ed, Mansar, and Chorb\u00e1ol\u00ed. An avenue of trees has been planted along almost the whole length, and there are numerous wells and grain-dealers' shops at convenient places throughout.\n\nThe Eastern Road leaves N\u00e1gp\u00far by two branches, starting from the north and from the south of the city. Thence it proceeds still eastward to Bhand\u00e1ra (forty miles from N\u00e1gp\u00far), crossing the Kanh\u00e1n at Maund\u00e9 half way. The line is completed as far as Bhand\u00e1ra, the only stream unbridged being the Kanh\u00e1n. Beyond Bhand\u00e1ra a large portion of this road has been completed towards R\u00e1jp\u00far, but as a metalled road it can at present only be said to be open for through traffic between N\u00e1gp\u00far and Bhand\u00e1ra. Its course in this district is about twenty-nine miles, in which distance it has three police posts, viz. P\u00e1ld\u00ed, Maund\u00e9, and Kharb\u00ed, the last twenty-seven and half miles from N\u00e1gp\u00far. There is a travellers' bungalow at Maund\u00e9, where there is also a sar\u00e1i. An avenue of trees lately planted lines it almost throughout its course to Bhand\u00e1ra.\n\nThe Southern Road, like the last, starts from N\u00e1gp\u00far by two distinct branches\u2014the first from Sit\u00e1baldi, the second from the south-west of the city. These converge at a point two miles out of the city and station. Then in a single line the road goes southwards to Bor\u00ed (nineteen miles from N\u00e1gp\u00far), generally parallel to the railway, which, however, it thrice crosses before it leaves the district. From Bor\u00ed there is a separate branch of seven miles to As\u00f3l\u00e1\u2014a village on one of the old routes to Bombay. Crossing the Wan\u00e1 at Bor\u00ed, the main line goes on in a southerly direction, leaving the district a little below a small village called Son\u00e9g\u00e1o, twenty-eight miles from N\u00e1gp\u00far. Thence it continues by J\u00e1m (Wardh\u00e1 district), from which place there is a branch to Hingangh\u00e1t, to War\u00f3r\u00e1 (Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district), and so on to Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1. It has now been completed as regards metalling, but the Wan\u00e1 and other streams have not yet been bridged. This road too is planted with young trees throughout its course in this district. It has a travellers' bungalow and a sar\u00e1i at Bor\u00ed, and there are police posts at Bor\u00ed and Son\u00e9g\u00e1o.\n\nThe North-Western Road leaves N\u00e1gp\u00far at the northern suburb of T\u00e1kl\u00ed, and crossing the P\u00edl\u00ed n\u00e1d\u00ed and the Kol\u00e1r by masonry causeways, touches the village of D\u00e1h\u00edg\u00e1o (ten miles from N\u00e1gp\u00far). At this place it is met by a similar metalled road coming from K\u00e1mth\u00ed. Thence proceeding in a single line the road passes P\u00e1tans\u00e1ong\u00ed a little to the right, and so leads on to S\u00e1oner. From this point it is still incomplete, but it is to be continued over the gh\u00e1ts to Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1. It is partly planted with trees. The chief streams are not yet bridged. There is an excellent sar\u00e1i at S\u00e1oner, and a smaller one at P\u00e1tans\u00e1ong\u00ed (fourteen miles from\nThere are wells at short intervals. There are police posts at T\u00e1kl\u00ed, P\u00e1tans\u00e1ong\u00ed, S\u00e1oner, and Kelod.\n\nLocal lines now under survey and construction, or completed, are\u2014\n\n(1) Road from N\u00e1gp\u00far via Kalmeswar, Mohp\u00e1, S\u00e1warg\u00f3n, and Narkher to Mow\u00e1r, on the extreme north-west frontier, on the river Wardh\u00e1, to open out the K\u00e1tol subdivision of the district, and connect it with the railway. Of this road twelve miles have been completely bridged, fourteen miles have been partially bridged, and in the remaining twenty-three miles bridging is going on. An avenue of trees has been planted along eleven miles. At Kalmeswar there is a sar\u00e1i.\n\n(2) Road from Umrer to Bor\u00ed (railway feeder)\u2014total distance twenty miles. This is to connect Paun\u00ed (in the Bhand\u00e1ra district) and Umrer with the nearest point on the railway. This road has been completed for the first eight miles from Bor\u00ed. Bor\u00ed has a good sar\u00e1i and a police outpost.\n\n(3) Road from Kh\u00e1p\u00e1 to join the imperial road to Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 at P\u00e1tans\u00e1ong\u00ed, so as to connect Kh\u00e1p\u00e1 directly with N\u00e1gp\u00far\u2014total distance seven miles. This line is completed, and has avenues of trees all the way. There are sar\u00e1\u00eds and police stations both at Kh\u00e1p\u00e1 and at P\u00e1tans\u00e1ong\u00ed.\n\n(4) Road from Bor\u00ed railway station, to join the southern road\u2014one mile and a half.

None of the above roads are to be metalled for the present.\n\n(6) Road from Mansar through R\u00e1mtek to the Amb\u00e1l\u00e1 tank\u2014distance seven miles. This is metalled throughout, and an avenue of trees has been planted. This road connects the town of R\u00e1mtek with the imperial Northern Road.\n\n(7) Road from N\u00e1gp\u00far to K\u00e1mth\u00ed from the heart of the city to the new K\u00e1mth\u00ed sar\u00e1i\u2014eight miles. Five miles have been completed with bridging and metalling.\n\nThe effect of all of these recent works on the trade and general progress of the country is already very manifest. The goods' sheds and platform at the railway terminus are crowded with merchandise and wares of all sorts from Bombay and the West, and with cloth, cotton, and agricultural produce from the surrounding country for export. The old routes to Bombay must be, and indeed already are, given up altogether for any other use than mere local traffic. The caravans of oxen bringing salt and jaw\u00e1r\u00ed, the long string of carts taking hence cotton, cloth, wheat, rice, and other articles to the West, must soon disappear altogether. Merchandise, instead of taking two months in transit between N\u00e1gp\u00far and Bombay, is now conveyed in three to four days.\n\nAgain, the traffic with Mirz\u00e1p\u00far and the East Indian Railway, Jabalp\u00far, and the North, heretofore spread over several local lines, is now compressed into one channel along the new Great Northern Road. The large roomy waggons used on the good roads in Upper India are rapidly supplanting the miserable Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 carts, giving the trader the power of transporting four times the amount of bulk with the same amount of draught, while transit takes up half the time that it did with the old lines, and is carried on continuously throughout the year. Nor are these improvements, whether as regards the ease, the speed, or the continuity of the means of transport, less apparent in the case of the three other great imperial\nlines, though, from the larger rivers being still unbridged, the effects are not yet so complete. Even the local lines, unfinished as they are, have already done something to facilitate internal trade in the district, and to perform their work as feeders to the railway and the great lines.\n\nThe conditions of the rivers in the district are such that navigation, even in River communication. the largest of them (including the Waingang\u00e1 itself), can only be carried on during and shortly after the rains. Even during the rains the difficulties in the way of navigation are great. They arise, first, from the velocity and strength of the currents, rendering an upward voyage, even of empty boats, an affair of great toil and duration; secondly, from the suddenness of the rise and fall of the waters, and the consequent continual variations in the depth of the different channels; thirdly, from the ledges of rock which sometimes form barriers right across the beds. This last difficulty may be found to be partially capable of remedy. For example, the bed of the river Kanh\u00e1n, between the town of Kh\u00e9p\u00e1 and the Waingang\u00e1 (sixty-three miles), has only four points where the rocks dangerously threaten navigation in the rains. A scheme has been discussed for blasting the rocks at those points so as to afford a clear passage. Again, as regards the river Waingang\u00e1, supposing an artificial channel could be made, so as to avoid a heavy barrier of rocks at Tidi, above Ambhor\u00e1, there would be nothing whatever to impede navigation by light boats, in the monsoon, from the junction with the Kanh\u00e1n down to Paunt, one of the largest towns in the neighbouring district of Bhand\u00e1ra. Notwithstanding all these drawbacks the rivers Kanh\u00e1n, Pench, and Kol\u00e1r, and of course the Waingang\u00e1, during and after the monsoon may be, and are navigated by loaded boats and rafts. They are not even as much used as they might be; yet timber from the jungles below the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1s, and forest produce, are brought down in considerable quantities to K\u00e1math\u00ed, and some consignments of grain from the north of the Bhand\u00e1ra district find their way down Paunt and below. None of the other rivers are either navigated or navigable.\n\nEducation, still comparatively backward, is now undoubtedly making rapid advances. Formerly the only educated classes were the Br\u00e1hmans and a few of the Musalm\u00e1ns. The agriculturists generally were devoid of any education whatever; the traders and shopkeepers knew just enough to be able to keep their accounts. There were some indigenous schools, but the standard of learning to be acquired in them was extremely low. The present system of public instruction was inaugurated in the year 1862. The total number of boys' schools in the district is now 122, or 1 to every 934 of the non-adult male population. The different institutions may be thus classified:\n\n| Class of School          | Number of Institutions |\n|--------------------------|------------------------|\n| Normal school            | 1                      |\n| Zil\u00e1 do.                 | 1                      |\n| Grant-in-aid schools     | 7                      |\n| Anglo-veracular town schools | 8                  |\n| Vernacular schools       | 8                      |\n| Village do.              | 55                     |\n| Indigenous do.           | 42                     |\n\nThe Normal school\u2014the local institution for teaching and training masters\u2014is at N\u00e1gpur. This establishment has not been able completely to meet the local demand for masters, many of whom have had to be brought from\nthe Bombay presidency, but so far as it has gone it has done well. Each pupil receives from four to ten rupees monthly for his support. At the Zil\u00e1 school, the Normal school, and three of the Grant-in-aid schools a superior education is given both in English and Vernacular. The zil\u00e1 school is at K\u00e1mth\u00ed, and the grant-in-aid schools are at N\u00e1gp\u00far and K\u00e1mth\u00ed. Of the latter, four have been established by the Free Church of Scotland Mission. They are called \"grant-in-aid\" from the fact of their receiving regular pecuniary assistance from Government. In the Anglo-Vernacular town schools is given a thorough instruction in the vernacular (Mar\u00e1thi), a fairly good course of Geography, Mathematics, and Grammar, and the groundwork of the study of English. The other town schools give the same course, with the exception of English. These town schools are established only in the larger and more populous towns. They are supported partly by grants from general revenues, partly by municipal funds, and partly by voluntary subscriptions. The cost of village schools is defrayed entirely from the educational cess, which is a tax of two per cent. on the land revenue of the district, and is paid by the landowners. In these schools the standard is lower than in the town schools. The indigenous schools are supported by fees from pupils. They are established by the people themselves, and have no connection with Government, except that they are inspected by the educational authorities. These schools receive grants-in-aid according to the payment-by-results system. The course of study is rather lower than that of the village schools. The total number of boys now studying in these schools is 6,763. The total number of non-adult males in the district is 113,996. So that about one boy in seventeen is receiving education. And if due allowance be made for boys too young or too old to go to school, then the proportion would be about one to twelve. In the matter of female education only a commencement has been made. There is a Normal school at N\u00e1gp\u00far for the purpose of training schoolmistresses; and there are now seven ordinary schools\u2014two at N\u00e1gp\u00far itself, and five at towns in the interior of the district. The statement below shows the progress of education in each of the different classes of schools from the commencement of the system up to the present time:\n\n**Statement showing the state of Schools in the N\u00e1gp\u00far district during the last 7 years.**\n\n| Description of Schools | 1862-63 | 1863-64 | 1864-65 | 1865-66 | 1866-67 | 1867-68 | 1868-69 |\n|------------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Male Normal schools    | 1       | 70      | 1       | 54      | 1       | 39      | 1       | 45      | 1       | 59      | 1       | 65      | 1       | 78      |\n| Zil\u00e1 schools           | 1       | 100     | 1       | 112     | 1       | 102     | 1       | 174     | 1       | 130     | 1       | 130     | 1       | 132     |\n| Grant-in-aid schools   | 3       | 531     | 4       | 640     | 6       | 670     | 7       | 735     | 7       | 704     | 6       | 719     | 7       | 847     |\n| Anglo-Vernacular town schools | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | 8,1003 | 8 | 815 | 8 | 746 |\n| Vernacular town schools | ... | 19 | 1,281 | 17 | 1,263 | 9 | 664 | 9 | 719 | 8 | 670 |\n| Village schools        | 19      | 707     | 38      | 838     | 41      | 901     | 41      | 1,276   | 45      | 1,753   | 48      | 2,377   | 55      | 2,701   |\n| Indigenous schools     | 58      | 1,244   | 39      | 1,082   | 40      | 1,069   | 41      | 1,070   | 32      | 1,341   | 44      | 1,465   | 42      | 1,529   |\n| Total Boys' schools    | 82      | 2,712   | 102     | 4,007   | 106     | 4,020   | 108     | 4,563   | 103     | 5,054   | 117     | 6,290   | 122     | 6,763   |\n| Female Normal schools  | ...     | ...     | ...     | ...     | ...     | 1       | 22      | 1       | 19      | 1       | 14      | 1       | 23      |\n| Girls' schools         | 2       | 43      | 2       | 39      | 3       | 53      | 9       | 190     | 10      | 259     | 7       | 233     |\n| Total Female schools   | ...     | 2       | 43      | 2       | 39      | 4       | 75      | 10      | 209     | 11      | 273     | 8       | 255     |\nNA'GPU'R\u2014The central revenue subdivision or tahsil in the N\u00e1gp\u00far district, covering an area of 835 square miles, with 555 villages, and a population of 246,376 according to the last census in 1866. The land revenue of the tahsil for 1869-70 is Rs. 2,20,466.\n\nNA'GPU'R\u2014The principal town in the district of that name, and the seat of the administration of the Central Provinces. It is situated in the centre of the district, on the left bank of a small stream called the N\u00e1g. The municipal limits include, besides the city, the suburb of S\u00edt\u00e1bald\u00ed, the European station of S\u00edt\u00e1bald\u00ed with T\u00e1kl\u00ed, and a considerable area of land under cultivation. The soil is for the most part \"regar\" or black soil. The drainage of T\u00e1kl\u00ed and S\u00edt\u00e1bald\u00ed is good; the site of the city is low, and the drainage is ill-defined, but the general slope is to the south-east. The S\u00edt\u00e1bald\u00ed hill, on which stands the fort, may be regarded as the centre of the municipal limits, and from its summit is to be seen the best view of the station and surrounding country. Below, on the north and west, lies the prettily-wooded station of S\u00edt\u00e1bald\u00ed; beyond this, on the north, are the military lines and bazaars; and again beyond these, partially hidden by low basaltic hills, is the T\u00e1kl\u00ed suburb\u2014once the head-quarters of the N\u00e1gp\u00far irregular force, but now occupied only by a few bungalows. Close under the southern side of the hill is the native suburb of S\u00edt\u00e1bald\u00ed. Below the eastern glacis is the railway terminus. Beyond this lies the broad sheet of water known as the Jum\u00e1 Tal\u00e1o, which separates the city from the station and suburbs. The view is bounded on this direction by the buildings on the extreme east of the tank. The city itself, though immediately east of the tank, is completely hidden from the sight by a mass of foliage. The site of the European station is pretty and undulating. It is in general well wooded, though some parts, especially towards the extreme west, are somewhat bare. The roads are lined with ornamental trees. The bungalows of the European residents are generally thatched, and plain in appearance; but most of the enclosures have gardens immediately surrounding the house, and contain good trees planted here and there, so that the general aspect of the place is cheerful and pleasant. During the hot weather the ground looks parched, but in the rains and cold season the verdure is bright and pleasing. Outside the city there are handsome tanks and gardens, constructed by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 sovereigns. The three finest tanks are the Jum\u00e1 Tal\u00e1o, between the city and station, and the two artificial lakes of Amb\u00e1jhari and Telingkheri. Of these the largest is the Amb\u00e1jhari, and the smallest Jum\u00e1 Tal\u00e1o. The storage of water in these artificial reservoirs is very great. The retaining-walls are built of massive basalt masonry, and are admirably constructed. The Jum\u00e1 Tal\u00e1o supplies a considerable portion of the city with water. The other two lakes are at some distance from the city. They afford a partial supply of water to certain portions of the city and station by means of pipes. These great artificial tanks are real ornaments to the place, and form a lasting monument of the best times of the Bhonsl\u00e1 rule. The principal public gardens are the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j B\u00e1gh, in the station of S\u00edt\u00e1bald\u00ed, now managed by the N\u00e1gp\u00far Agri-Horticultural Society; the Tuls\u00ed B\u00e1gh, inside the city; and the four suburban gardens of P\u00e1ld\u00ed, Shakardara, Son\u00e9g\u00e1on, and Telingkheri. These four are maintained in good order by local funds, and form agreeable places for public resort and recreation. There are no Mohammadan mosques of any note. Hind\u00fa temples are numerous. Some of these are in the best style of Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 architecture, with elaborate carvings.\n\nThe Bhonsl\u00e1 palace, which was burnt to the ground in 1864, was the only dwelling-house of any structural magnificence. It was built of black basalt, profusely ornamented with wood-carving. The courts in its interior possessed\nsmall gardens and fountains. The great \"Nak\u00e1rkh\u00e1na\" gate, which is now the only remnant of the palace, is an imposing structure. The tombs of the Bhonsl\u00e1 kings are in the Sukraw\u00e1ri quarter, to the south of the city. These are in no way magnificent, though their construction is curious. The best is that erected over the ashes of the great Raghoj\u00ed. It is in the form of a cross, the arms projecting some ten feet from the body of the tomb. It has some narrow pillars or minarets, said to be in memory of the R\u00e1n\u00eds who immolated themselves on his funeral pyre. The tombs of the Gond R\u00e1j\u00e1s are ordinary plain Musalm\u00e1n monuments, without any architectural merit.\n\nIn spite of the extensive municipal improvements of the last five years, the general aspect of the city is even now poor and insignificant when compared to the wealth and number of the inhabitants. The new great thoroughfares are indeed excellent roads, well metalled, and well drained; and there is a considerable number of handsome edifices belonging to the richer inhabitants; but the great majority of houses are of mud walls with tiled roofs. The walls are often made to look well by a coating of white or straw-coloured plaster; but the houses are older than the roads, and were built originally without any regard to frontage, so that it was impossible to secure a good frontage when the new roads came to be made through the most populous quarters. Thus many of the houses in the new streets appear irregularly built, and of a style not suitable to the excellence of the roads. Still perceptible improvement is being made: the old houses are gradually disappearing in several of the principal thoroughfares, and new buildings of a superior description, and built in regular line, are taking their places. The total number of houses is 32,450, of which 1,580 are built of stone or brick with flat masonry roofs, 23,553 are tiled, and the remainder, 7,317, thatched; some of the better classes of houses are ornamented with well-executed wood-carving. The principal thoroughfares in S\u00edt\u00e1b\u00e1ld\u00ed are B\u00fat\u00ed street, and the S\u00edt\u00e1b\u00e1ld\u00ed b\u00e1z\u00e1r road, with the Temple b\u00e1z\u00e1r square between them. As has been stated before, the fort lies between the European station and the city. Immediately east of the fort is the railway terminus, and the railway line running north and south. East again of the railway line is the Jum\u00e1 lake, immediately beyond which is the \"Jum\u00e1 darw\u00e1za\" entrance to the city. The city is connected with the European station by three great lines, of which two are respectively on the north and south banks of the lake, while the third, the most northern, crosses the railway by an over-bridge north of the terminus. The last after crossing the railway becomes the Gurganj road, and traverses the north part of the city from west to east. The two first are connected together by a road on the eastern embankment of the lake. In the centre of this road is the entrance to the Jum\u00e1 darw\u00e1za street. This is the main street of the city. A double-storied line of shops extends for about a third of a mile up to the site of the old Bhonsl\u00e1 palace, through a square called the Gach\u00ed P\u00e1g\u00e1, and so on eastwards through the town. The Jum\u00e1 darw\u00e1za and the Gurganj roads are the main lines of traffic running east and west through the northern and southern portions of the city. They converge in the suburb of P\u00e1l\u00edd\u00ed, some little distance out of N\u00e1gp\u00far. They are connected by various lines running north and south, the principal of which are the P\u00e1nch P\u00e1ul\u00ed road and the Itw\u00e1ri. The other principal streets are the roads leading from the Nak\u00e1rkh\u00e1na gate of the old palace, and from the Gach\u00ed P\u00e1g\u00e1 to the Tuls\u00ed B\u00e1gh; the Sukraw\u00e1ri and the Shakardar\u00ed roads leading from the Jum\u00e1 darw\u00e1za road to suburbs on the south side of the N\u00e1g; and the new K\u00e1mth\u00ed and Indor\u00e1 roads leading through the northern outskirts of the city towards K\u00e1mth\u00ed. The best streets are the Jum\u00e1 darw\u00e1za, the Gurganj, and the Itw\u00e1ri. The houses belonging to the M\u00e1rw\u00e1r\u00eds at the northern end of the\nItw\u00e1rf are curious old buildings, of three and even four stories high, and profusely ornamented with woodwork. The street here is very narrow, and is the only really oriental-looking part of the town. The principal grain markets are those at Bagarganj at the eastern end of the Jum\u00e1 darw\u00e1za road, and the Sukraw\u00e1ri and the Shakardar\u00e1, to the south of the Jum\u00e1 darw\u00e1za. The bulk of the cloth trade is done in the Gurganj road and its immediate neighbourhood. The jewellers and bankers reside mostly in the northern end of the Itw\u00e1rf. Large weekly b\u00e1z\u00e1rs are held in the Gurganj square and in the Gachi P\u00e1g\u00e1.\n\nMunicipal concerns are managed by a committee, of which the Divisional Commissioner is the president, and the Deputy Commissioner of N\u00e1gp\u00far the vice-president. The committee consists altogether of twenty-seven members, of whom ten are official, and seventeen elected annually. Of the last, two are English, and the rest Native gentlemen of position and influence. The municipal revenue is spent mainly in watch and ward, in conservancy, and in material improvements. The improvements of the last five years have consisted chiefly in opening out and improving the main lines of communication. These works have been carried on with a rapidity and comprehensiveness which have sufficed to alter the entire appearance of the place. Before 1862 the only well-constructed road within the city was the Jum\u00e1 darw\u00e1za, and that only as far as the site of the old palace. The station roads too have of late been greatly extended and improved. The conservancy arrangements are good. The public latrines are on the dry-earth system; the private latrines are periodically inspected. The supply of water is plentiful, but many of the wells in the city do not contain good water. Pipes from the Amb\u00e1jhar\u00ed and Telingkher\u00ed lakes supply only a few of the houses in the station and city. A scheme of water-supply for the whole city and station has lately been proposed by the committee, and is now under consideration. Both town and station are considered healthy. Liver-complaint is the most frequent illness amongst the Europeans, and fever amongst the Natives. Visitations of cholera occur at intervals. Small-pox is common, but is gradually yielding to vaccination.\n\nThe entire population of the city and suburbs of N\u00e1gp\u00far, inclusive of military, is as follows:\n\n| Population          |       |\n|---------------------|-------|\n| Adult males         | 29,532|\n| Do. females         | 33,035|\n| Male infants        | 11,621|\n| Female do.          | 11,473|\n| **Total**           | **85,661**|\n\nOf these, 456 are Europeans and Eurasians, and 10 are Parsees. Among the Native Hind\u00fa population the most numerous class are the Br\u00e1hmans, who number 17,413 souls. Then come Kosht\u00eds (weavers) 8,642, Kumb\u00eds 7,271, and Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s 6,453. The Musalm\u00e1ns are under 10,000 in number. The occupations, under which are classed the largest proportions of the population, are those of farm-servants and day-labourers, which number 18,397 and 17,395 respectively. Of the banking class there are 6,367 persons. Among artisans\u2014weavers, carpenters, and masons are most largely represented.\n\nThe trade of the town is large and increasing. The chief articles of import are wheat and other grain, salt, country cloth, European piece and miscellaneous goods, silk and spices. The grand article of manufacture and export is country cloth. The finer\nfabrics of N\u00e1gp\u00far have long been celebrated for their richness and good quality, and are still, in spite of the competition of English stuffs, in great request, not only here, but in distant parts of the country.\n\nThe following table shows the entire trade for the years 1867-68 and 1868-69:\n\n| Imports | Exports |\n|---------|---------|\n|         | Weight in Maunds | Value in Rupees | Weight in Maunds | Value in Rupees | Weight in Maunds | Value in Rupees |\n| Cotton  | 3,513 | 38,968 | 2,293 | 49,928 | 19 | 320 | 282 | 5,491 |\n| Sugar and gur | 25,906 | 2,54,123 | 28,930 | 2,59,514 | 2,380 | 33,693 | 4,633 | 60,377 |\n| Salt    | 68,742 | 2,98,088 | 83,892 | 3,01,475 | 10,161 | 48,649 | 10,397 | 51,014 |\n| Wheat   | 224,786 | 4,86,007 | 210,727 | 6,86,378 | 2,996 | 6,811 | 1,024 | 2,439 |\n| Rice    | 202,439 | 3,75,458 | 104,090 | 3,94,187 | 12,809 | 30,010 | 4,831 | 13,407 |\n| Other edible grains | 103,452 | 2,23,609 | 157,116 | 4,38,067 | 3,888 | 10,306 | 3,553 | 10,596 |\n| Oil-seeds of all descriptions | 55,743 | 2,14,367 | 65,698 | 2,51,785 | 232 | 964 | 187 | 706 |\n| Metals and hardware | 3,908 | 92,504 | 4,049 | 1,02,908 | 363 | 16,899 | 568 | 21,511 |\n| English piece-goods | 4,844 | 2,54,457 | 2,573 | 2,54,053 | 206 | 24,002 | 66 | 7,170 |\n| Miscellaneous European goods | 399 | 84,405 | 649 | 62,899 | 25 | 2,416 | 2 | 180 |\n| Country cloth | 8,870 | 55,052 | 2,758 | 4,76,778 | 3,754 | 5,99,501 | 3,835 | 6,92,012 |\n| Lac     | 243 | 3,572 | 178 | 2,070 | 145 | 1,503 | 297 | 4,224 |\n| Tobacco | 4,904 | 49,433 | 3,269 | 40,131 | 139 | 1,810 | 68 | 897 |\n| Spices  | 30,259 | 2,40,069 | 30,210 | 2,99,397 | 5,198 | 48,991 | 9,275 | 90,907 |\n| Country stationery | 86 | 2,039 | 2 | 100 | 29 | 992 | 2 | 100 |\n| Silk and silk cocoons | 872 | 5,00,958 | 574 | 3,40,600 | 132 | 77,642 | 132 | 75,040 |\n| Dyes    | 695 | 59,709 | 701 | 89,215 | 174 | 18,534 | 185 | 14,820 |\n| Hides and horns | 467 | 9,355 | 433 | 9,497 | 214 | 4,064 | 157 | 3,711 |\n| Opium   | 108 | 72,971 | 214 | 1,14,838 | 7 | 4,200 | 9 | 5,948 |\n| Wool    | 119 | 2,524 | 262 | 5,071 | 4 | 82 | 20 | 327 |\n| Timber and wood | 50,283 | 53,857 | 62,621 | 77,022 | 1,320 | 1,617 | 2,762 | 3,473 |\n| Ghee and oil | 6,677 | 1,71,297 | 7,914 | 2,09,838 | 2,445 | 46,223 | 2,192 | 43,833 |\n| Cocoanuts | 3,296 | 82,964 | 2,884 | 17,947 | 459 | 5,140 | 241 | 2,696 |\n| Miscellaneous | 51,511 | 55,807 | 33,503 | 6,39,735 | 1,896 | 90,147 | 4,505 | 86,303 |\n\nTotal | 846,684 | 40,85,180 | 812,160 | 51,89,454 | 52,556 | 10,74,356 | 49,208 | 11,96,713\n\nAt the head-quarters of the administration the public offices are of course numerous. They are most of them in the civil station of S\u00edt\u00e1bald\u00ed. The old N\u00e1gp\u00far Residency, now the official residence of the Chief Commissioner, is situated in extensive and well-wooded grounds. The building itself is commodious, but of a very plain and unpretending exterior. The Secretariat is a large and substantial pile of buildings. The other public offices in the station are held in\nordinary-looking houses and bungalows, in no way differing in external appearance from private dwelling-places. The most notable public offices in the city are, the Small Cause Court, lately built on the eastern bank of the Jum\u00e1 Tal\u00e1o; the Tahs\u00edl, an old Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 building in a good style of architecture; the Honorary Magistrates\u2019 Court; and the Police Station-houses. The useful and charitable institutions are the following:\u2014the N\u00e1gp\u00far Central Jail, an excellent building, consisting of two large octagons, built to contain 1,060 prisoners; the City Hospital, with three branch dispensaries in different quarters of the town; the Lunatic Asylum; the Leper Asylum; the S\u00edt\u00e1bald\u00ed Poor-house; the Free Church Mission Native School; and the Bishop\u2019s School, for the education of European and Eurasian boys. There are three public sar\u00e1\u00eds or travellers\u2019 rest-houses, besides several private dharm\u00e1s\u00e1l\u00e1s for similar purposes. The Native schools are shown below:\n\n| Description of School                  | Number of Schools | Number of Pupils |\n|----------------------------------------|-------------------|------------------|\n| Mission school, N\u00e1gp\u00far..................| 1                 | 286              |\n| Do. do.

The former garrison the fort. The military works of the fort (built in 1819) are about to be remodelled and strengthened. The arsenal, which is just below the fort, contains considerable stores and munitions of war.\n\nNo part of the town is more than 160 years old. In Bakht Buland\u2019s time (A.D. 1700) the site of the city was a low swamp, on which were twelve small hamlets, known collectively as \u201cR\u00e1j\u00e1p\u00far Bh\u00e1rs\u00e1.\u201d Ch\u00e1nd Sult\u00e1n, Bakht Buland\u2019s successor, was the first sovereign who made N\u00e1gp\u00far his capital. Traces of a circumvallation made by him still exist. The town was probably most populous just at the close of the reign of the second Raghoj\u00ed. In Sir Richard Jenkins\u2019 report of 1826 the inhabitants are shown to have numbered over 111,000; since then the total population has much declined. There has, however, been no decrease in the mercantile and industrial classes. The artisans are much more numerous now than in the days of Sir Richard Jenkins. The diminution has occurred in the non-industrial classes, in the numerous semi-military retinues of the chiefs, and the servants and hangers-on attached to that retinue. The bulk of these people have now disappeared, having taken to agricultural or other employments elsewhere. Their exodus was a necessity of later times and circumstances, and is certainly not a subject for regret.\n\nNA\u2019HARMA\u00dc\u2014A village in the S\u00e1g\u00e1r district, situated about eight miles due west of Gaurjh\u00e1m\u00e1r. It is the highest point in S\u00e1g\u00e1r, being 2,324 feet above the sea. It gives its name to the surrounding country.\nNAHRA'\u2014A narrow rocky stream in the B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t district, which in its course receives the waters of the Usk\u00e1l, and eventually flows into the Waingang\u00e1. It was formerly the boundary line between the N\u00e1gp\u00far and the Mandla territories.\n\nNA'ND\u2014A river which enters the N\u00e1gp\u00far district at its south-eastern extremity, and proceeding westwards falls into the Wan\u00e1 in the Wardh\u00e1 district.\n\nNA'NDGA'ON\u2014A feudatory chiefship attached to the R\u00e1jp\u00far district. It contains 560 villages, in a fertile tract of country, a large portion of which is under cultivation, and is divided into four parganas, viz. N\u00e1ndga\u00f3n and Dongargarh to the south; P\u00e1nd\u00e1d\u00e1, about twenty miles to the north, at the foot of the S\u00e1l\u00e9t\u00e9r\u00ed hills, and separated from N\u00e1ndga\u00f3n by the Khair\u00e1g\u00e1rh pargana and that portion of Dongargarh belonging to the Khair\u00e1g\u00e1rh chief; and Mohg\u00e1on, about fifty miles to the north\u2014a very fertile pargana, lying between the Dhamd\u00e1 and Deorbij\u00e1 kh\u00e1lisa parganas, to the south and east, and Khamari\u00e1, belonging to Khair\u00e1g\u00e1rh, to the north. The chief is by caste a Bair\u00e1g\u00ed, or religious devotee, and celibacy being one of the observances of the sect, the succession has been maintained by adoption. The grantee was the family priest of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of N\u00e1gp\u00far, and the date of the original grant is A.D. 1723. Additions were made to it in A.D. 1765, and again in A.D. 1818. The tribute paid annually to Government amounts to nearly Rs. 46,000.\n\nThe chief village, which is situated forty-two miles west of R\u00e1jp\u00far on the Great Eastern Road, has a population of from 1,000 to 1,200 souls.\n\nNANDARDHAN (NAGARDHAN)\u2014A decayed town in the N\u00e1gp\u00far district, situated about four and a half miles from R\u00e1mtek, just off the old K\u00e1mth\u00ed road. It was formerly a cavalry station of the N\u00e1gp\u00far r\u00e1j\u00e1s. An old castle is still remaining, outside which an action was fought when the English were besieging N\u00e1gp\u00far in December 1817. The population amounts to 2,893 souls. A schoolhouse has been built here, and is well attended.\n\nNANSARI'\u2014A small zam\u00ednd\u00e1ri or chiefship, situated about nine miles south-east of K\u00e1mth\u00e1, in the Bhand\u00e1ra district; it consists of eight villages, with an area of 8,350 acres, more than 5,000 of which are cultivated. The holder is a Br\u00e1hman descendant of one of the official families attached to the late N\u00e1gp\u00far government. A large weekly market for cattle is held at Kath\u00edp\u00e1r on this estate.\n\nNARBADA' (NERBUDDA)\u2014A river which is regarded as the boundary between Hindust\u00e1n and the Deccan. It rises in the dominions of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Rew\u00e1 and flows into the sea below the town of Bharoch (Broach) in the Bombay district of the same name. But as the greater part of its course is in the Central Provinces, it finds a legitimate place in this compilation. Its ancient name as found in the Pur\u00e1\u1e47as is Rew\u00e1; and it bears a high reputation for sanctity. Local devotees sometimes place it above the Ganges; and there is a saying that, whereas it is necessary to bathe in the Ganges to obtain forgiveness of sins, the same object is attained by mere contemplation of the Narbad\u00e1.\n\nThe following description of the river is extracted from an article on the scenery of the Narbad\u00e1 by Sir R. Temple, published in \"Once in a Way,\" a Miscellany got up for the Jabalp\u00far Exhibition of 1866:\n\n\"The source is at Amarkantak, a massive flat-topped hill, forming the eastern terminus of that long mountain range which runs right across the middle of India from west to east. If the peninsula may be imagined...\"\nas a shield, and if any spot be the boss of such a shield, then Amarkantak is that spot. South of the Himalayas there is no place of equal celebrity so isolated on every side from habitation and civilisation. To the east and to the north hundreds of miles of sparsely populated hills and forests intervene between it and the Gangetic countries. On the west there extend hilly roadless uplands of what are now called the S\u0101tpur\u0101 regions. To the south indeed there is the partly-cultivated plateau of Chhattisgarh, but that after all is only an oasis in the midst of the great wilderness. It is amongst these mighty solitudes that the Narbad\u00e1 first sees the light.\n\n\"The river * * * * * bubbles up gently in a very small tank in one of the undulating glades on the summit of the mountain. Thence it flows through a little channel, and winds along the perennially green meadows. But soon the waters are reinforced by the countless springs which abound in those trap-rock formations, and * * * * * after a course of some three miles from the source, the abrupt edge of the Amarkantak plateau is reached.\n\n\"There it tumbles over the ledge of a black basaltic cliff with a sheer descent of seventy feet, a glistening sheet of water against the intensely dark rock. After its fall it is for a brief space hidden amongst the crevices of the stones, but soon struggles upward, and dashes along through a glen with lofty precipitous sides, a splendid confusion of rock and foliage, and of wild beauty not easily surpassed. These, the first, and perhaps the loveliest, of all the many falls of the Narbad\u00e1 are called Kapila-Dh\u00e1r\u00e1. * * * * * * * * * * A short distance from the stream is another fall of lesser height called D\u00fadh\u00e1r\u00e1, or the 'Stream of Milk,' the myth being that once the river here ran with that liquid.\n\n* * * * * * * * * *\n\n\"After descending some hundreds of feet by falls and rapids from the heights of Amarkantak the Narbad\u00e1 skirts the upland valley just mentioned, and winds about the hills of the Mandla district, pursuing a westerly course till it flows under the walls of the ruined palace of R\u00e1mnagar a few miles from the town of Mandla itself.\n\n\"Since quitting Amarkantak the Narbad\u00e1 has run a course of near a hundred miles, and receiving the drainage of a long hill district, has become a fine river. At this point its reach forms almost a semicircle, so that the spectator can see several miles both up-stream and down-stream. The river does not flow here in an unbroken expanse, but is divided into several channels, between which there rise wooded islets; in midstream too there protrude peaks and ledges of black trap-rock in all directions. The banks are clothed with thick foliage to the water's edge, and the horizon is bounded all round with hills, some near, some distant.\n\n* * * * * * * * * *\n\n\"Thus far the river's course, constantly interrupted by rocks and islands, has been frequently tortuous. But below R\u00e1mnagar for several miles down to Mandla it flows in a comparatively straight line, with an unbroken expanse of blue waters, between banks adorned with lofty trees * * *. These pools or reaches (called \"dohe\" by the natives) in many of the rivers of\nthe Central Provinces are reckoned as gems in the landscape. This doh or pool of the Narbad\u00e1, between R\u00e1mnagar and Mandla, is quite the finest of them all.\n\n\"Below Mandla, at the point Gw\u00e1righ\u00e1t, where the Trunk Road crosses from Jabalp\u00far to N\u00e1gpur, the river for a moment wears the look of trade and industry; for here are collected many hundreds of logs of timber cut in the forests, and thence thrown into the stream to be floated down by the current, like rafts, to the marts of Jabalp\u00far, shortly afterwards.\n\n\"Then the Narbad\u00e1, becoming pent up among magnesian limestone rocks, flings itself tumultuously over a ledge with a fall of some thirty feet, called Dhu\u00e1n-dh\u00e1r (the 'Misty Shoot'), and then enters on a deeply-cut channel, literally carved through a mass of marble and basalt for nearly two miles. The river, which above this point had a breadth of a hundred yards, is here compressed into some twenty yards. At the channel below the surface of the surrounding country the river passes through a double row of marble bluffs, or even between a wall of marble on either side. These glittering white steeps are from fifty to eighty feet high. This is the place known as the 'Marble Rocks.'\n\n* * * * *\n\n\"Up to this time the Narbad\u00e1 has not been troubled much by the works of man, having only passed through wild hilly tracts inhabited by half-civilised races, doubtless of a temperament congenial to the localities. But now it has to enter upon a valley, broad and rich, highly cultivated, thickly populated, for some two hundred miles. It is near here crossed by a great railway viaduct with massive piers. Thereafter it flows in a generally straight westerly course between the two parallel mountain ranges of different geological structure * * * * *. But inasmuch as many miles of fertile plain intervene on either side, the mountains are seen only in grey distance in a sort of vanishing perspective. The channel of the river from about here down to Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d\u2014a distance of near two hundred miles\u2014is not obstructed nor blockaded by any marked bars or barriers, but the constant occurrence of rapids and rocky interruptions renders it quite unnavigable for three-quarters of the year. During one\u2014the rainy quarter\u2014in the full flush of the floods boats can pass down with the current, which is somewhat violent however, and in this way there is some brief and precarious traffic.\n\n\"The soil of this broad valley consists of alluvial deposits of a recent geological epoch. By some it is supposed that at a prehistoric period there were vast inland lakes in this region. Fossil bones of extinct animals have been discovered of great value to the geologist. On some of the hillsides bordering the valley there have been discovered some of those strange flint implements which in other parts of the world have so roused the curiosity of antiquarians. Their discovery by the late Lieutenant Downing Swiney has added one more to the many associations connected with the Narbad\u00e1.\n\n\"In this valley the river, quitting the district of Jabalp\u00far and entering that of Narsinghp\u00far, reaches the spot known as Birm\u00e1n Gh\u00e1t. Here one of the largest annual fairs in the Central Provinces is held in the month of November. The high banks are crowned with structures, and flights of\nsteps lead down to the water's edge. The bed of the river is broad here; and the waters, receding and subsiding after the rainy season is over, leave a broad space of sand and shingle.\n\n* * * * *\n\n\"The next section of the river's course, though not remarkable in its external aspect, is noted for agricultural industry; the country being a great cotton-field, and also a great granary, producing wheat of such quality and in such abundance as often to have afforded succour to famine-stricken districts in other parts of India. It is equally noticeable for its mineral wealth, rich seams of coal having been found near the left bank, and iron-ores being worked near the right bank. These combined coal and iron operations may ultimately render the name of the Narbad\u00e1 a household word among the mercantile community.\n\n\"Thus the river traverses long-stretching plains clothed with waving harvests twice a year, past Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d, past Handi\u00e1 and Nem\u00e1war\u2014towns now decayed, but once famous in Mohammadan story\u2014past Jog\u00edgarh, where it rushes with clear swift rapids right beneath the battlemented walls and bastions, till it once more enters the jungles.\n\n\"These jungles, in the Nim\u00e1r district, are the wilds which at the beginning of this century furnished a home and refuge to the Pindh\u00e1rf hordes, where these predatory bands were at last brought to bay by the pursuing vengeance of British power, where their leaders were hunted down, and where the fugitive Chit\u00fa died a robber's death in the grip of a tiger.\n\n* * * * *\n\n\"Emerging from these horrid wilds the Narbad\u00e1 again becomes beautiful, crashing in grand turmoil over dark trap-rocks, then flowing quietly down in the shadow of wall-like ridges, and then surrounding the sacred island of Omk\u00e1r M\u00e1ndh\u00e1t\u00e1, the heights of which are covered with temples and priestly buildings. Here again the river forms itself into deep pools of still water, in which are imaged all the forms of the rocks and the structures. Here also at stated times are held religious gatherings, which greatly add to the beauty of the place. In former days devotees used to precipitate themselves from the rocky peaks, to earn immortality by perishing in the Narbad\u00e1.\n\n\"A few miles further on below Barw\u00e1f (where the road from Bombay to Indore crosses the river) there is one of the deep-water reaches, extending from Mandleswar to Maheswar. At Maheswar there are stately religious edifices with broad flights of steps leading down to the river, erected by the famous Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 princess Ahily\u00e1 B\u00e1i.\n\n\"At some distance from the right bank the headland and promontories of the Vindhyas have a well-defined outline. On one of these there stands all that remains of Mand\u00fa, the once splendid and royal city of the Mohammadan kings of M\u00e1lw\u00e1 and Nim\u00e1r.\n\n* * * * *\n\n\"Thereafter the river runs for some way through an open country till it approaches that point where the parallel ranges of the Vindhya and S\u00e1tpur\u00e1s (which have heretofore been separated by the broad valley above-mentioned) gradually trend nearer and nearer towards each other till they almost converge, before they both become finally lessened, and drop down-\nward towards the western coast territory of Gujar\u00e1t. At the nearest point of this convergence they are separated from each other only by the Narbad\u00e1 itself; and about here the scenery is of a mountainous character. The river courses along the bold masses (sometimes with rocks jutting out diagonally into midstream) with falls and rapids, some of which are said to extend for miles past the hill of Turan Mal, which has a fine lake on its broad summit, and has been thought of as a sanitarium, through the gorge of the Haran P\u00e1l, said to be so called from being a 'deer's leap.'\n\n\"From Haran P\u00e1l to the temple of S\u00falp\u00e1ni Mah\u00e1deva\u2014a distance of some seventy miles\u2014there occurs the main barrier of the Narbad\u00e1. Hitherto we have dwelt chiefly on the beauties of the river, but here the Narbad\u00e1 displays all her terrors. Twice has the passage been essayed in the flood season by spirited British officers\u2014Captain Evans and Captain Fenwick.\n\n\"Thrilling are the accounts given of the perils of the whole way, and of the hopelessness of any craft living in some of the worst parts of the streams.\n\n\"It is said that sometimes the water lashes itself into waves, curling, crisping, crested. Sometimes it swells, curves over rocks, and thence rushes headlong into deep troughs. Again it tosses foam and spray about in its fury, or it whirls in countless eddies, and sweeps round in swift-moving circles\u2014sometimes in little ma\u00eblstroms bubbling up from the bottom with roaring surge. At length its force culminates at the great whirlpool near Makr\u00e1\u00ed, described as actually terrific, and embracing the whole bed of the stream, some four hundred yards, from bank to bank.\n\n\"Thereafter the Narbad\u00e1 enters on the rich plains of Broach which border on the sea. In this particular section it is securely navigable, and is actually navigated by country craft. It is here compared in appearance by Captain Fenwick to the Hoogly.\n\n\"It has now run a course of near eight hundred miles, and has attained opposite the city of Broach a width of about two miles. It is here spanned by a viaduct of imposing length and dimensions belonging to the Railway between Bombay and Barod\u00e1. The lofty piers are formed by iron screw-piles driven down into the sandy ground to a depth of many feet. The immense structure has the appearance of wonderful lightness for its strength and size, and the trains passing over it seem as if suspended by a slender framework in mid-air. This work has been severely tried by the floods of the river, which\u2014swollen with the fast-accumulating drainage of the hills that are in such close proximity\u2014descend with mighty volume and velocity, carrying with them the drift trunks of forest trees and other masses of debris\u2014sometimes even the bodies of wild animals, in token of the devastating character of the inundation,\u2014and causing a tremendous collision with the opposing piers of the viaduct. The importance of this bridge, the obstacles successfully encountered in its erection, the scientific questions involved in the method of its construction, and the force of the flood which it has to withstand, keep alive to the last the interest which has pertained to the Narbad\u00e1.\n\n\"The city of Broach, though doubtless growing in wealth and with a great future before it, is not remarkable for external appearance. Up to Broach seagoing ships of considerable burden and draft can penetrate. The\nriver in fact is here an estuary, and the associations are almost those of a seaport.\n\n\"From this point the Narbad\u00e1 has but some thirty miles to proceed before it pours itself in the Gulf of Cambay.\"\n\nThe physical character of the river is thus described by Dr. Impey*:\n\n\"The Narbad\u00e1, then, rising in the highest land of Central India, 5,000 feet \u2020 about the sea, and pursuing a serpentine westerly course for 750 miles through a hilly tract, which runs parallel to, and borders closely both its banks, may be said to flow through a longitudinal cleft rather than a distinct valley, and to present the general characters of a mountain stream more than anything else. No great depth of water can ever be expected in it, from the nature of its tributaries, except in the monsoon; neither, were they to promise better, could it be retained, owing to the great declivity of the bed of the river, which from Jh\u00e1ns\u00ed Gh\u00e1t, near Jabalpur, to the sea falls 1,200 feet in 500 miles.\n\n* * * * * * * * *\n\n\"The bed of the river in its whole length is one sheet of basalt, seldom exceeding 150 yards in absolute width, which has been upheaved in ridges, which cross it diagonally in N.E. and S.W. directions. These elevations occur every few miles, and cause a kind of natural 'bandh' (dam), above which the water is invariably formed into a pond more or less deep.\n\n\"It is this peculiarity of geological and physical formation, creative of so many natural barriers, which gives rise to the numerous fords which, in all the open and cultivated parts of the Narbad\u00e1 valley, are found occurring every few miles, with a town on each bank; and their very existence indicates the absence of any extent of navigation, which can only be absolutely free between limited intervals.\n\n\"In such a condition of the bed the only change produced by time is due to the erosion of the water, whose course being straight, and the force of its accessory feeders so strong, is much obstructed by the deposit of sand and detritus, which the transporting power of the monsoon brings down and carries to spots where some natural impediment arrests them, or where the rapidity diminishes.\n\n\"Thus, where the Narbad\u00e1 is closed by hills, its breadth less, and the vehemence of the entering streams intense, the rush of water furnishes and lodges the large erratic blocks of debris, which the different natural rocky barriers stop, and which contribute to the formation of rapids, and to the decrease of water over them in those places.\n\n\"But in the larger basins, where the banks are high, and of alluvial and vegetable character, the hills further distant, and the impetuosity of the flood is lost, the larger debris are left behind; and the detritus, consisting of light gravel and sand, subsides, and accumulates more opposite or just below the entrance of the large tributaries. The character, then, of the bed of the Narbad\u00e1 in fair weather\u2014dependent of the large falls\u2014may be summed up as consisting of a narrow rocky channel, obstructed by numerous rapids, occurring in the openings of the bare rocky ledges\n\n* Selections from the Records of the Bombay Government, No. xiv. New Series, 1865, p. 5 et seq.\n\u2020 The height of Amarkantak is really not above 3,400 feet.\nwhich cross it diagonally. These rapids are tortuous, often at right angles with the general course of the river, and from fifty yards to five miles in length, very shallow, and rendered still more so by the accumulation of sand, rock, and gravel, deposited at the mouths of the numerous feeders, which cause a broken eddying current, with from six inches to a foot and a half of water over them, and are not safe, in consequence of projecting cliffs, with a rise of twenty feet of water, at which time formidable whirlpools, and a strong unmanageable current, subject to freshes of thirty feet in a few hours, take place.\n\n* * * * * * * * *\n\n\"The basins of the Narbad\u00e1 are those portions of the valley which are so fertile and productive. The upper one, 1,000 feet above the sea, extends from the marble banks of Bher\u00e1 Gh\u00e1t, opposite Jabalp\u00far, to a little below Handi\u00e1, nearly two hundred miles in length, but of little width northerly and southerly, the hills being nowhere above twenty miles distant.\n\n\"The other great basin, 500 to 750 feet high, stretches from the quartz hills above Barw\u00e1\u00ed to Chikald\u00e1, upwards of one hundred miles; it is more open, with the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1 range, in some places forty miles distant, to the south; while to the north the Vindhyas approach to between fourteen and sixteen miles.\n\n\"The banks of both basins are forty feet high, the soil alluvial, composed of marl and clay below, the superior stratum being the black vegetable mould. The upper basin is so level that from Jabalp\u00far to Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d, upwards of 120 miles, the fall is little more than fifty feet.* In the lower, the fall averages about two hundred feet. The centre of the latter is nevertheless nearly 400 feet below that of the upper, Mandleswar being 700, and Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d 1,070 feet above the sea, and Talakw\u00e1r\u00e1, in the inferior or third basin, 100 miles lower down, is 450 feet lower than Mandleswar.\"\n\nThe Narbad\u00e1 is fed principally from the south side, as the watershed of the Vindhyan tableland, which bounds the valley on the north, is almost entirely northward. The principal affluents are, on the left bank\u2014the Makr\u00e1r, Chak-r\u00e1r, Kharmer, Burhner, and Banjar, which with others rise in the wilds of R\u00e1mgarh and R\u00e1jgarh. The Banjar empties itself into the Narbad\u00e1 just opposite to Mandla. From this point, owing to the propinquity of the cliffs, of which the tablelands slope to the south, we have no more tributary streams until we meet the T\u00edmar\u2014a considerable affluent falling into the Narbad\u00e1 in the Barg\u00ed pargana, above the Gaur. Then we have the Son\u00e9r between Jabalp\u00far and Narsinghp\u00far, the Sher and Shakar in the latter district, the D\u00fadh\u00ed, Kor\u00e1mi, Machn\u00e1, Taw\u00e1, Ganjal, and Ajn\u00e1l, in Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d, the Dib, thirty miles west of Mandleswar, and the Goh\u00ed, thirty-nine miles further west.\n\n\"These streams \u2020 after escaping from the gorges of the Gondw\u00e1na hills have hollowed out channels for themselves across the flat ground of the valley beyond, exposing throughout most of their course many rocks distinct from each other in age, and differing among themselves in lithological character. And whether among the hills or on the plain beyond, the various texture\n\n* The height of Jabalp\u00far is given by the Trigonometrical Survey at 1,458 feet, and that of Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d by the G.

The real fall is therefore 338 feet.\n\u2020 Memoirs of the Geological Survey of India, vol. ii. part 2, p. 119.\nand structure of these rocks, as well as their diverse modes of occurrence and of disintegration, have impressed on the landscape that endless variety of outline from which its principal charm is derived.\"\n\nOn the right or north bank the principal affluents are the Bal\u00e1i, passing under Shankar Ganj, the Hingn\u00e1, the Gaur\u2014a beautiful stream a little east from Jabalp\u00far,\u2014the Hiran in the same district, the J\u00e1mner in Bhop\u00e1l, the K\u00e1ran in Holkar's dominions, crossed by the Bombay and Indore road, the Hatn\u00ed in Alfr\u00e1jp\u00far\u2014a small district in M\u00e1lw\u00e1 under the political superintendence of the Governor-General's Agent at Indore,\u2014the Aurin in Rew\u00e1 K\u00e1nt\u00e1, and some others of less note.\n\nThese northern feeders, being comparatively smaller than the southern, are also fewer and shorter. \"The proximity * of the hills increases their number, \"adds immensely to their volume and velocity, and accounts equally for the sudden \"flushing of the river in the rains to seventy and ninety feet, often in a few hours, \"and also for its shallowness in the fair season. The tributaries, being literally the \"drainage of the mountain ranges, rapidly empty themselves, owing to their short \"course and rapid fall; their rugged and precipitous nature, in fact, makes them \"torrents rather than streams. Of their size some idea may be gathered from one \"the Taw\u00e1), whose flood area is stated by Mr. Berkley to be 1,276 yards from \"bank to bank in the rains, while it is all but dry in the fair weather. The K\u00e1ran \"also, near Gujrf on the north bank, is nearly as wide, requiring a bridge of five \"large elliptical arches to span it.\"\n\nThe falls are those of Kapiladh\u00e1r\u00e1 and D\u00e9dh-dh\u00e1r\u00e1 near its source\u2014the former of 78 feet. The next is at Umar\u00ed\u00e1 in the Narsinghp\u00far district, of about ten feet. At Mandh\u00e1r, ninety miles below Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d, and about twenty-five below Handi\u00e1, there is a fall of forty feet; at D\u00e1dr\u00ed, near Pun\u00e1s\u00e1, twenty-five miles below Mandh\u00e1r, there is another fall of forty feet. Near Mandh\u00e1r the river presents an unbroken sheet of water one hundred feet from bank to bank. The navigation is there quite impracticable. In the dry season there are four or five channels. At Saheswar Dh\u00e1r\u00e1, below Mandleswar, there is a fall of ten feet. Then the fall and rapids of Haran P\u00e1l beyond Chikald\u00e1 occur. At H\u00e1mp, in the Rew\u00e1 K\u00e1nt\u00e1 division of Gujar\u00e1t, there is the Bal\u00e1gori rapid; at Makr\u00e1\u00ed there is another fall; and a little lower down a dangerous whirlpool, which is said to embrace the whole bed of the Narbad\u00e1. The Makr\u00e1\u00ed barrier is one of the worst in the Narbad\u00e1. It is about sixty miles below the Haran P\u00e1l. Below this barrier and whirlpool the bed of the river is comparatively open.\n\nNARKHER\u2014A town in the N\u00e1gp\u00far district, four miles from Belon\u00e1 and fifty-two from N\u00e1gp\u00far on the Betul road. Its population amounts to 7,319 souls, mostly belonging to the agricultural classes. A good market-place, retaining-walls of masonry facing the river, school and police buildings, and streets, have recently been made, the cost being defrayed partly from town duties and partly by private subscriptions.

The southern boundary is an irregular east and west line, including a strip of the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1 tableland, generally narrow, but of varying width. The Trans-Narbad\u00e1 portions are two isolated tracts, annexed to the district after its original formation. The easternmost is a mere insignificant patch of hill and ravine. The westernmost is a small but fertile valley, enclosed by the Narbad\u00e1 in a crescent-shaped bend of the Vindhyan range. The whole area of the district is 1,916 square miles, of which about half is cultivated. The extreme length from east to west is about seventy-five miles, and the extreme breadth about forty miles. The number of villages is 1,108, giving an average area to each village of nearly a square mile and three quarters.\n\n* An incarnation of Vishnu.\n\u2020 This article consists almost entirely of extracts from the Report on the Land Revenue Settlement of Narsinghpur by Mr. C. Grant.\nThe district may be described with approximate accuracy as forming the upper half of the Narbad\u00e1 valley proper. The first of those wide alluvial basins which, alternating with rocky gorges, give so varied a character to the river's course, opens out just beyond the famous marble rocks at Bher\u00e1gh\u00e1t, about eight miles west of Jabalp\u00far, and fifteen miles east of the Narsinghp\u00far district boundary. It is stated to extend as far as Handi\u00e1 in the Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d district\u2014a distance of about 225 miles. The general elevation exceeds 1,000 feet above the sea, and the fall is very gradual.* In the opinion of geologists the basins, of which this is one, were originally lakes,\u2020 which were \"more or less intimately connected with each other, and were fed by a slowly flowing river down which clayey sediment was carried, and distributed in a gradual and uniform manner over a considerable extent of country.\"\u2021 On the conglomerate and clay thus deposited lie twenty feet of the rich alluvium, so well known as the \"regar\" or black cotton soil of India.\n\nThe face of the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1 range overlooking the valley is generally regular, and probably nowhere rises more than 500 feet above the low land. It runs in a line almost parallel to the course of the river, at an average distance from it of fifteen or twenty miles. The intervening space, as has been stated above, forms the bulk of the Narsinghp\u00far district. The Vindhyan tableland, though also sandstone, is an entirely distinct formation from the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1 range. Its southern scarp, though generally abrupt, is irregular in its alignment, twice abutting on the river bed, and twice opening out into the bay-like curves which have been already mentioned as the detached Trans-Narbad\u00e1 portions of the district. Still the effect of the hill lines, viewed from a little distance, is sufficiently regular not to interfere with the otherwise compact configuration of the district.\n\nThe following description of the two opposite ranges and the valley which lies between them is extracted from the Memoirs of the Geological Survey of India, Vol. II. Part 2, pp. 117\u2014120, 122:\n\n\"This (the Vindhyan) range of flat-topped cliffs is marked by great uniformity of outline, averaging from three hundred to four hundred feet above the level of the valley, in rare cases rising to eight hundred. It is, however, incorrect to speak of this as a range of hills. Seen from the south it presents an almost uninterrupted series of headlands with projecting promontories and receding bays, like a weather-beaten coast line; but these form the abrupt termination of a tableland, and are not an independent range of hills. It would be difficult to point out a finer example of cliffs, once formed by the denuding action of shore-waves, but now far inland, than is exhibited along this range. From the summit of these cliffs, however, there is no descent to the north corresponding to their southern declivity; on the contrary the plateau is found to stretch away in this direction in gentle undulations. The northward slope, though slight, commences from the very edge of the escarpment, and a reference to the map will show that the Betw\u00e1, the Dhas\u00e1n, and the Sun\u00e1r rivers have their origin in places overhanging the valley of the Narbad\u00e1. In one or two localities, where the\n\n* From Jabalp\u00far to Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d, about 165 miles, the fall is stated by Dr. Impey (\"Physical character of the Narbad\u00e1 River\") not much to exceed 50 feet, but the real fall is 338' feet. Vide article \"Narbad\u00e1.\"\n\u2020 Dr. Impey on the Narbad\u00e1, Bombay Government Records, New Series, No. xiv. para 8\n\u2021 Memoirs of the Geological Survey of India, vol. ii. part 2, p. 238.\nlatter river in its winding course flows close to the north side of its valley, the southern limits of the drainage area of the Ganges may there be seen to reach to within little more than a mile of the actual main stream of the Narbad\u00e1.\n\n\"On the south side of the valley the hills present a more broken and less regular outline than on the north. Instead of a uniform range of escarpment like that of the Vindhyan hills, we here have irregular groups of hills of different heights and different forms of contours, and which are composed of different rock.\n\n* * * * * * *\n\n\"The great escarpments north and south of the valley above mentioned are no doubt sufficiently remarkable when considered simply as physical phenomena; but they become still more interesting when, as is found to be the case, they are known to coincide with geological boundaries.\n\n\"Thus the tableland of M\u00e1lw\u00e1 and Bundelkand is formed of the sandstones seen in the Vindhyan escarpment, and described in the following pages under the name of 'Vindhyan Sandstones'\u2014a group of rocks not known to occur anywhere south of this line of the north escarpment of the Narbad\u00e1 valley, at least not within the area mapped.\n\n\"In a similar manner the line of escarpment bounding the valley on the south marks the northern limit of a series of rocks, which will be found described below, as including those formations called in our lists 'T\u00e1lchir,' 'Dam\u00fad\u00e1,' 'Mah\u00e1deo,' &c., and no rocks belonging to any of these groups are known, within our area, to occur north of this line of escarpment.\n\n\"On both sides of the valley the high ground is often occupied by basaltic trappean rocks. On the north such rocks spread into wide patches over the country towards Bhop\u00e1l, S\u00e9gar, and Damoh, in which direction they gradually die out; on the south and south-west the trap is found to cover considerable areas among the Gondw\u00e1na hills, and it extends gradually more and more the prevailing surface rock in this direction, and, so far as known, connects itself with the great trap area of the Deccan.\n\n\"Besides the rocks already mentioned several other varieties exist. Granitic and gneissose rocks and crystalline schists are exposed in many places in the banks of the Narbad\u00e1, in those of its numerous tributaries, and in many other parts of the valley, sometimes covering considerable areas, and often forming prominent features in the scenery of some of the most picturesque parts of the country.\n\n* * * * * * *\n\n\"The hills near Hinoti\u00e1 village, south of Narsinghp\u00far, are mostly made up of this syenite porphyry; here the detached crystals are of pink felspar.\"\n\nThe formation of the Vindhyan series is thus described, pp. 141, 142:\n\n\"The prevalence of regularly-bedded fine-grained grits, with a characteristic red colour, is the most striking lithological feature of the Vindhyan group: and speaking of the formation generally, its most marked characteristic certainly is the persistency of this lithological aspect over great areas. This sameness of texture is strongly in contrast with the prevailing character of all those more recent sandstone formations to the south, to be hereafter described.\"\n\"This general constancy in lithological character does not of course imply the entire absence of varieties among the beds of the series: instead of clear quartz grits, slightly earthy sandstones are found, and in many places ferruginous clay has been so largely accumulated as to form a considerable ingredient in the mass.\n\n\"This earthy matter most commonly occurs at the partings of the arenaceous beds, and sometimes exists as irregular aggregations through the mass of the beds themselves; less commonly the argillaceous and sandy ingredients have been mixed together, producing an earthy or a shaley sandstone.\n\n\"In many places the sandstone is mottled and spotted at the surface, from the decomposition of grains of magnetic iron, which is often abundantly scattered through the rock, and may on a fresh fracture generally be detected in its undecomposed condition.\n\n\"Mica is not a common ingredient of the Vindhyan sandstones, yet occasionally this mineral is present in quantities sufficient to constitute the rock a micaceous flag, and it seems generally to cause or accompany a laminated and fissile structure.\n\n\"Ripple-marking may be considered as a phenomenon characteristic of the Vindhyan series; almost totally absent in all the other groups of sandstone of Central India, it is almost everywhere throughout them found preserved in the most extraordinary perfection.\"\n\nThe southern range consists of a mere narrow strip belonging to the Mah\u00e1deo and Upper Dam\u00fad\u00e1 series\u2014which will be found described in the article on the Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d district, where they are seen on a much larger scale\u2014lying between rocks of metamorphic formation to the north, facing the valley, and the great trap overflow of the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1 plateau to the south.\n\nA broad strip, walled-in on either hand by low hill ranges, and green from end to end with young wheat: such is the appearance of this section of the valley in the winter months, when strangers usually visit it; for the black soil roads are almost impassable in the monsoon, and the temperature in the hot season, though far more moderate than in the parched-up plains of Upper India, is sufficiently severe to make travelling for the time a matter rather of duty than of pleasure. But though the regularity of the hill ranges and the general absence of detached peaks give the landscape an open appearance on the whole, yet the abruptness of the drainage system is such as to leave a very distinct mark on the surface of parts of the valley. The actual fall of this section of the Narbad\u00e1 bed is comparatively inconsiderable, but the nearness of the hill ranges gives the affluents of the main rivers an impetus which, augmented ever by the gentle slope of the valley towards the sea, tells very markedly on the deep alluvial soil. Indeed it has been remarked, and with justice, that never was a river system attended with deeper or more widely ramifying ravines than that of the Narbad\u00e1 valley. These features are of course most prominently exemplified in the case of the Narbad\u00e1, by far the largest river in the district, though perhaps no part of its course is less precipitous and broken. In the whole length of seventy-five miles there are only two low falls\u2014one near Ghugri, the other almost opposite the village of Umari\u00e1. But this last is the spot in which some of the principal rivers of the district unite and join the Narbad\u00e1 through a close network\nof ravines, which seam the surrounding country for miles. Although, however, the characteristic vehemence of the stream is much modified in this section, yet it retains, throughout, the narrow basaltic bed and the high precipitous banks which are its distinctive features. Running in a confined unyielding channel through a narrow valley, its floods are so vehement and sudden as to impose serious difficulties in the way of either navigators or engineers. The house built for visitors on a seemingly inaccessible point near the famous marble rocks (in the Jabalpur district) was washed away after standing untouched for many years. The Narbad\u00e1 railway bridge at Belpath\u00e1r, designed after the most careful inquiry to give waterway to the highest flood then known, was found to be inadequate, fortunately before completion, to meet floods such as that of 1864.\n\nThe Narbad\u00e1 is fed almost entirely from the south, as the watershed of the Affluents of the Narbad\u00e1. Vindhyan tableland stands but little back from its southern face. Its principal affluents are the Sher and the Shakar, the latter of which, according to native tradition, was once known by the less dignified name of \"S\u00faar\" or pig, and owes its new appellation to the euphemistic scruples of a Mohammadan of rank, who emptied into it a cart-load of sugar. These, with their tributaries, the M\u00e1ch\u00e1-Rew\u00e1 and Ch\u00edt\u00e1-Rew\u00e1, take their rise in the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1 tableland, and are essentially mountain torrents throughout. Their streams, rapid but irregular, pour through deep rocky channels, fringed on either hand with unbroken series of ravines. Here and there however, more especially in the Shakar and Ch\u00edt\u00e1-Rew\u00e1, their beds open out into small oases of the richest alluvial deposits, which are tilled like gardens with the finer kinds of sugarcane and vegetables. In the second rank are the D\u00fadh\u00ed, B\u00e1ru-Rew\u00e1, and Soner. The latter resembles the rivers already described. The two former differ from them in the sandy character of their channels, which are little utilised except by an occasional melon bed. The smaller rivers are too numerous for separate notice; but it may be mentioned as an illustration of the extraordinary rapidity of rise which is common to them all, that the Singhri\u2014a little stream which rises not ten miles from Narsinghp\u00far and Kandeli\u2014has been more than once known to inundate the town of Kandeli, and to occasion serious loss both of life and property to the townspeople.\n\nExcepting, however, where the soil has been denuded by the action of Villages. water, the undulations of the surface are few and insignificant, save in the Trans-Narbad\u00e1 tahsil of Ch\u00e1nwarpath\u00e1, where frequent isolated peaks shoot up in the very heart of the black soil. In other parts of the district the rich level is but seldom broken, except by occasional mounds of gravel or kankar (nodular limestone), which are most serviceable for village sites. The hard black soil after rain softens into a stiff bog, in which every step is a fresh difficulty. Hence the preference for sites often bare and repulsive in appearance, and the poverty of the crops immediately surrounding villages, in direct contrast to the \"G\u00e1onr\u00e1\" fields of Hindust\u00e1n, which are, as is natural, the best irrigated and most highly manured lands in the village area. It is only the poorer villages, however, that suffer much in appearance from this peculiarity of location, and poor villages are scarce in so flourishing a district. The inequalities of the surrounding surface are sometimes so far advantageous that they facilitate the construction of artificial tanks and reservoirs, in themselves picturesque, and generally adorned by the graceful domed temples, which here take the place of the needle-shaped spires so common in the Hind\u00fa shrines of Upper India. There are few villages which are not embellished by deep mango-groves, and old p\u00edpal and tamarind trees.\nIndeed the commonest names for villages are those derived from trees. Thus, Pipari\u00e1 (from the pipal), Imalt\u00e1 (from the imli or tamarind), Umarl\u00e1 (from the umar or wild fig), abound in every part of the district. Less universal, but still frequent, are A mg\u00e1o, \"the mango village,\" and S\u00e1gont, from the s\u00e1gon or teak tree. The better villages do not lose on a closer view. The m\u00e1lguz\u00e1r's house usually stands well above the other buildings, and is often a handsome two-storied building of brick and stone. Inside are large court-yards, well stocked with cattle, and surrounded by dwelling-houses and granaries. On one side are generally piled up large mounds of white cotton on raised platforms, which stand out as landmarks from afar. Few houses are without their pets\u2014spotted-deer, antelopes, or rams,\u2014and everything tends to create an impression of rude comfort and plenty. The cultivators' houses, though of course inferior to those of their landlords, are by no means devoid of all pretension to appearance. The better kind are neat cottages with tiled roofs. The gaily-painted verandah posts and the clean plastered platforms, bordered by moulded cornices, and ornamented by large flower jars, show a decided taste for comfort, and even for luxury. The meaner quarter of the village, tenanted by the weavers, the labourers, and the menial classes of the little community, has seldom, it is true, other than a squalid appearance. But even here the Gonds, who fill the place of hewers of wood, though not of drawers of water, are better lodged than in the wretched grass huts, which barely shelter them in their own wilds.\n\nBut as soon as the limits of the \"haweli,\" or black soil tracts, are passed, the characteristics of the country change. Below either range of hills, but more especially on the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1 side, are broad belts of red gravelly soil, which merge through woody borders into the lower slopes of the high land. The wheat of the valley is here replaced by rice, sugarcane, and the poorer rain crops; the village roofs are thatch instead of tile; forest trees take the place of mango-groves, and reservoirs are replaced by mountain streams. The country is in short less rich and productive, but more picturesque and beautiful. The open glades, covered by short sward and dotted with old mhowa trees, suggest the idea of English park scenery, and the river gorges are often of rare beauty, combining, as they do, all the grand features of hill scenery and tropical vegetation with a moist freshness, which is the one thing wanting to the lifeless surrounding forests.* The hill country included in the Narsinghp\u00far district is insignificant in extent. To the north in the Ch\u00e1nwarp\u00e1th\u00e1 tahsil the boundary is the outer watershed, that is the watershed of the smaller streams, and this limit includes no whole villages. Between the Ch\u00e1nwarp\u00e1th\u00e1 tahsil and the smaller Trans-Narbad\u00e1 block, known as the H\u00edr\u00e1p\u00far t\u00e1luka, the river itself is the northern boundary. This portion of the H\u00edr\u00e1p\u00far t\u00e1luka, some 14,000 acres in extent, and containing ten villages, is perhaps the only compact block of hills in the district, as the Bach\u00e1l and Srinagar parganas, though broken by spurs of the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1 range, contain more valley than hill, and the strip of hill, facing the Narsinghp\u00far and G\u00e1darw\u00e1r\u00e1 parganas, seldom exceeds three or four miles in depth. This perhaps is the wildest part of the district, as the passes from the plain are generally difficult of access to any but mountaineers, and the country is more broken and precipitous than the inner tracts of the tableland; but it is not sufficiently extensive to form an appreciable element in the composition of the district.\n\n* The Narsinghp\u00far jungles are ill-stocked with large game, and are remarkable for the scarcity of their birds.\nThe possessors of this fertile valley are a Hind\u00fa race, with a substratum of aboriginal Gonds. The population of the Nar-singhp\u00far district is in round numbers 336,000 souls, of whom rather more than one-third are returned as belonging to the non-agricultural classes. The average population rate is about 175 to the square mile. At first sight it must seem singular that a given area in this magnificently fertile valley should only support one man, when in the sandy plains of Upper India the same extent of land affords sustenance to three, or even four. But it must be remembered that the Narbad\u00e1 valley is, to all intents and purposes, a new country, which has only been reclaimed from wild forest within the last two or three centuries. Little by little the body of agricultural immigrants have grown and spread, till the whole valley has passed into their hands. But the same difficulties of communication which for so long formed a perfect barrier round the valley have operated even under more favourable circumstances to isolate it from external influences. There has been little or no trade, and therefore no inducement to congregate in towns. The soil is so bountiful that small exertion is needed to secure an ample return from it; but the means of carrying off the surplus produce have been so deficient, that it has attracted but little external demand. In short, the inhabitants may be few, but the land asks little expenditure of toil in return for a yield more than ample for local wants; and external requirements have only now begun to raise up a demand which must surmount serious obstacles, both natural and artificial, before it can bring about a higher development of cultivation, by increasing the agency employed in the production of food-grains.\n\nThe composition of the population is almost purely Hind\u00fa. The Mohamma-dans number little more than three per cent of the whole. The Gonds have not been separately registered, as most of this race who dwell in the valley conform to Hind\u00fa rites and observances. Therefore, besides the Mohammadans, the only dissentients from the Hind\u00fa faith are a few Jain merchants and mountain Gonds. The most influential landholding classes are Br\u00e1hmans, R\u00e1jputs, R\u00e1j-Gonds, Lodh\u00eds, Kurm\u00eds, and K\u00e1onr\u00e1s. The Br\u00e1hman and R\u00e1jput zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs are scattered all over the district. The R\u00e1j-Gonds and K\u00e1onr\u00e1s are to be found principally in the Western subdivision\u2014G\u00e1darw\u00e1r\u00e1, the Lodh\u00eds in the Eastern and Central subdivisions, and the Kurm\u00eds in Narsinghp\u00far. Besides genuine R\u00e1jputs and K\u00e1onr\u00e1s there are three other castes, well represented among the landholding body, who claim R\u00e1jput descent, viz. Bundel\u00e1s, Raghubans\u00eds, and Kir\u00e1rs. The total number of landholding classes is thirty-two, and the total number of castes represented in the district is not less than twice that number.\n\nIsolation and a purely agricultural life have had their natural effects on all classes. The very dress and appearance of the residents of the valley have assumed a distinct type from those of the picturesque races of Upper India. Though the people of the valley are generally well grown, few among them are pre-eminent for great stature or striking appearance. Their costume too is unbecoming. Among men the favourite colour of the angarkh\u00e1, or long coat, is yellow, with a green shade from the mhowa dye. The sleeves are turned back on the wrists, and the waist-cloth is worn on or below the hips. This, with a white turban, is the ordinary dress of a well-to-do peasant. The Chiefs affect the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 turban, tied so much on one side as almost to cover one eye, or what appears to be a Gond fashion\u2014a turban composed of innumerable folds of cloth twisted like a rope.\nTheir dress seldom corresponds with their pretensions, and some of the oldest R\u00e1j\u00e1s and Th\u00e1kurs might be taken for poor peasants. It is true that titles of honour are so common as to have lost much of their significance. R\u00e1j\u00e1s, Th\u00e1kurs, R\u00e1os, D\u00edv\u00e1ns, and Chaudh\u00e1r\u00eds abound in every part of the district, and it is so much the custom to adopt any available distinction, that such designations as Jamad\u00e1r and Mukht\u00e1r are pressed into the service as hereditary honours. There is certainly neither the closeness of ritual observance, nor the rigidity of social usage, which prevail in Hindust\u00e1n. Among Br\u00e1hmans the Kanoj\u00e1s still keep up their intercourse with their parent country, and adhere to their traditionary rights and habits; but the Sanori\u00e1s, who take a high rank in Upper India, are here very lax, forming connections with women of other classes, and neglecting the niceties of Hind\u00fa worship.\n\nThe predatory classes belong rather to the history than to the present population of the district. But it may be interesting to note that of the three principal Pindh\u00e1r\u00ed leaders of the \"Sindi\u00e1 Shah\u00ed\" two had possessions in the Narsinghp\u00far district. Chit\u00fa, a chief who led 5,000 horsemen, held B\u00e1rh\u00e1 in j\u00e1g\u00edr. Kar\u00edm Kh\u00e1n, a commander of more than 1,000 horse, had at one time lands in Paloh\u00e1. The Pindh\u00e1r\u00eds are fortunately a thing of the past; and though the complete extinction of the Thugs cannot be predicated with equal confidence, it is at least curious now to hear that in Captain Sleeman's time a gang of Thugs* lived not four hundred yards from his court-house, and that the groves of Mandesar, some twelve miles from Narsinghp\u00far, were one of the greatest \"bels\" or places of slaughter in all India, though nothing of this was known to Captain Sleeman till seven or eight years afterwards, in 1831.\n\nThe four known periods of the history of this part of the valley are the Gond dynasty. Gond rule, the dominion of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 S\u00fabas of S\u00e1g\u00e1r, the rule of the Bhonsl\u00e1 R\u00e1j\u00e1s of N\u00e1gp\u00far, and our own administration. The origin of the Gond R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Garh\u00e1 Mandla is lost in antiquity, but the Gond R\u00e1jput family\u2020, which was supplanted by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, is said to have sprung from J\u00e1dhava R\u00e1ya, a R\u00e1jput, who succeeded his father-in-law, the Gond R\u00e1j\u00e1 N\u00e1gdeo, in A.D. 358. Forty-eighth in descent from him was R\u00e1j\u00e1 Sangr\u00e1m S\u00e1, who is stated to have extended his dominions over fifty-two districts, only three or four of which he received from his father. The Narsinghp\u00far district came under the Mandla rule in his reign, and he is said to have built the fort of Chaur\u00e1garh.\n\nThere could be little to connect an outlying district like Narsinghp\u00far with the history of its princes had it not been for the existence in it of this old fortress. Situated on the crest of the outer range of the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1 tableland, and embracing within its circle of defences two hills, it is less a fort than a huge fortified camp. The vast scale of the whole work, its numerous tanks and wells, excavated at so unusual an elevation, and the massive debris of its buildings, attest the lavish outlay incurred in its completion, and the importance which was attached to it as a royal stronghold. In fact there is scarcely a marked vicissitude in the history of the Mandla dynasty the crowning scene of which did not occur in Chaur\u00e1garh. The first great blow to their power was the invasion by A'saf Kh\u00e1n, one of the imperial\n\n---\n\n* \"Ramaseeana,\" by Captain Sleeman, p. 32. Edu. 1836.\n\u2020 Sleeman's Note on History of Garh\u00e1 Mandla R\u00e1j\u00e1s, Asiatic Society's Journal, No. 68, August 1837.\nviceroys, in A.D. 1564. He defeated and killed Durgavati, the still famous Rajput princess, widow of the Gond-Rajput, Raj\u00e1 Dalpat S\u00e1, and took by storm Chauragarh, and with it, it is said, the enormous booty of 100 jars of gold coin and 1,000 elephants. This invasion is remarkable as having probably opened out the valley, for the first time, to the foreign immigration which has been the means of reclaiming it from barbarism. Asaf Khan held Garha for some years as an independent principality, and there are various circumstances which indicate an incursion of northern settlers nearly contemporaneous with his epoch. Tradition is almost silent now with regard to ages so remote, but Sleeman says that in his time, that is forty years ago, \"it spoke of an intercourse with Delhi, \"and a subjection, nominal or real, to its sovereigns from Akbar downwards,\"* but that no mention was ever made of any such connection in the period before Akbar's reign. He adds that the oldest rupees found in the earth, along the line of the Narbad\u00e1, were of the reign of Akbar; and in connection of these first signs of the introduction of northern influence with the facts of northern immigration, he adduces the histories of many of the principal families in the district, which then dated back from twelve to sixteen generations.\n\nThe Ranf Durgavati's successor, Chandra S\u00e1, re-obtained his ancestral dominions through the recognition of Akbar, on cession of the ten districts which afterwards constituted the principality of Bhop\u00e1l. But the now contracted principality was again lost (about A.D. 1593) by Chandra S\u00e1's grandson, Prem Narayan, who incurred the anger of Bir Singh Deo, raja of Orchha, and brought upon himself an invasion from Jujhar Singh, that prince's son. Prem Narayan took refuge in Chauragarh, where he was for months closely besieged. On his death, by treachery, the fort fell, and all the other garrisons of Garha followed its example.\n\nAs Chauragarh had before been the theatre of two events so important in the annals of the Gond dynasty, so was the closing scene of their history played out in it. It was here that Narhar S\u00e1, the last of the Mandla raj\u00e1s, took refuge when pressed by Moraji, the Maratha s\u00faba of Sag\u00e1r. The Gond prince was betrayed, and ended his days in imprisonment at Kura\u00ed, while his dominions fell into the hands of his conquerors in A.D. 1781. The Sag\u00e1r administration lasted only seventeen years, and is little remarkable, except as having made way for a considerable influx of Hind\u00fa immigrants from the north.\n\nThe Sag\u00e1r s\u00fabas were in their turn expelled by the powerful Bhonsl\u00e1 raj\u00e1s.\n\nBhonsl\u00e1 dynasty. The Nagpur army, before occupying Narsinghpur, overran Hoshangabad, which, being thus left perfectly defenceless, was periodically plundered by the Pindh\u00e1ris and the Naw\u00e1b of Bhop\u00e1l, until A.D. 1802. The distress thus occasioned amounted in 1803 and 1804 to actual famine, and forced a number of people into the more secure and prosperous district of Narsinghpur. In the years 1807 to 1810 similar accessions were received from Bhop\u00e1l, which had been ravaged by Amir Kh\u00e1n and the Pindh\u00e1ris. Thus largely recruited, and possessing a ready market for its produce in the consumption of the troops, Narsinghpur attained, in Sleeman's words, \"a state of cultivation and prosperity which it had never before known, \"and from which it has, generally speaking, been declining ever since, with the exception of the first three years of our government, while the market the district had lost was more than supplied by our own.\"\u2020 This gleam of prosperity was, however, of short duration. In 1807 the Narsinghpur and Hoshangabad\n\n* Manuscript Records, Narsinghpur District office.\n\u2020 Ibid.\ndistricts were made over to Naw\u00e1b Sad\u00edk \u00c1lf Kh\u00e1n for the support of the frontier force. But as the military expenses amounted in all to about ten l\u00f3khs of rupees, while the joint revenue of the two districts was only seven l\u00f3khs, it was arranged that the balance of three l\u00f3khs should be remitted annually from N\u00e1gp\u00far. For two or three years the remittances arrived regularly, but in 1810 supplies from head-quarters began to fail, and at this inopportune moment Am\u00edr Kh\u00e1n invaded the district. He was repulsed, and his defeat was followed up by the invasion of Bhop\u00e1l. But in these campaigns Sad\u00edk Ali Kh\u00e1n incurred expenses which could only be met by increased taxation, and the smaller j\u00e1gird\u00e1rs took the combined opportunity, afforded by his pressing wants and by his absence, to give full vent to their natural rapaciousness. When extortion by main force failed, other devices were not wanting; patels were tempted by titles and dresses of honour to bid against each other, and were alternately coaxed and squeezed till they had nothing left to make them worth attention. The law itself was made the instrument of illegal exaction from merchants and others not ostensibly connected with land. Courts of justice were created, whose whole staff consisted of a guard of soldiers and a few ready witnesses. The only crime of which cognizance was taken was adultery, and procedure was simplified by throwing the burden of proof on the accused, who was of course a rich man.\n\nThe commencement of British rule dates from 1818. In November 1817, on the first intelligence of the commotions at N\u00e1gp\u00far and the treachery of the r\u00e1j\u00e1, \u00c1p\u00e1 S\u00e1hib, Brigadier-General Hardyman was directed by Lord Hastings to advance his force from the frontier of Rew\u00e1 in the direction of N\u00e1gp\u00far. On arrival at Jabalp\u00far he engaged and defeated a considerable body of N\u00e1gp\u00far troops. Shortly afterwards he was apprised of the success at Sit\u00e1bald\u00ed on the 16th December 1817, and was recommended to take up a position between Jabalp\u00far and G\u00e1darw\u00e1r\u00e1 in the Narsinghp\u00far district, for the interception of the fugitives from N\u00e1gp\u00far. Additions were accordingly sent to a force already stationed at G\u00e1darw\u00e1r\u00e1, under Lieutenant-Colonel Macmorine, who, thus reinforced, was enabled to attack and defeat the Sr\u00ednagar garrison, consisting of 3,000 foot and 4,000 horse. Chan-r\u00e1garh, however, still continued to hold out, and Colonel Macmorine\u2019s detachment while encamped at the foot of the fort-hill was even fired on by a body of guerilla troops. The fort was, however, evacuated by the enemy on the approach of the left division of the army under Brigadier-General Watson, and British ascendancy was thus finally established in the district. We found the country, as may be imagined, in a much exhausted condition; and Colonel Sleeman has left it on record that the two most laborious and anxious years of his life were spent in trying to keep together the agricultural communities of his charge. His hands were strengthened by the wise liberality of Mr. Molony, the chief civil authority of the province; and each successive settlement of the land revenue lightened the burdens of the agricultural class, till in 1835 they were in a position to reap the full benefits of the first long-term settlement, which was made on terms of unprecedented liberality. Secure at once from foreign raids and domestic exactions, the people have grown rich; and the western part of the district, which is the most recently developed, may well bear comparison with most similar tracts in India.\n\nThe bed of the valley has already been described as consisting of a deep bed of black soil, flanked at the base of the hills on either side by bands of the more recent sandstone detritus, and scoured away on river banks by the converging drainage of the\nvalley. It is from this rich central deposit that the valley derives its chief wealth. Wheat is taken from it year after year without any attempt at relieving it, either by manure or by a system of rotation. But though its annual tribute is unfailingly rendered, it is useless to deny that the powers of the soil have deteriorated under so constant a strain. The average return of wheat is six maunds, or about eight bushels per acre, being not more than four times the seed sown. Captain Sleeman, writing in 1824, says that in Samvat 1863 (corresponding to A.D. 1807) land newly broken up in this district yielded from fifteen to twenty returns. That after twenty years' uninterrupted tillage the returns of the same land had sunk to from eight-fold to five-fold, but that in the adjoining districts belonging to Bhop\u00e1l and to Sindia, lying on the other side of the Narbad\u00e1, the returns were, at the time of his writing, equal to those recorded in this district in Samvat 1863, and that many cultivators had thrown up their lands because they only yielded nine-fold. He adds that the average returns of the Narsinghp\u00far district are not more than from four to seven-fold, the mean therefore being five and a-half fold. Some landholders' accounts of their home-farms for the same period show the average returns at five-fold and six-fold. The next returns, in point of time, consist of an investigation of produce made in 1828, in which average wheat produce is recorded as five-fold. Captain Ouseley in his settlement report of 1836, though he has left no regular statistics on the subject, casually mentions in one place that three-fold is a very low return, and eight-fold is a very high one for wheat. From that it seems probable that in his time the rate of produce was much the same as in 1828, viz. five-fold. It will, however, be noticed from these figures that while twenty years' cultivation reduced the returns from twenty-fold to six or seven-fold, it has taken nearly double that time (from 1828 to 1866) to reduce them from five-fold to four-fold. The present rate of diminution is so minute as to be imperceptible. Therefore for all practical purposes it may be assumed that the rates of produce will remain constant at the present point, even if improved modes of cultivation are not introduced, with the development of the country.\n\nThe principal implements of husbandry now employed are the \"bakhar\" and the ordinary plough. The former is a kind of scarifier, having, instead of a share, a broad iron blade set horizontally and at right angles to its body. It is used in preparing the land for the rain crops, twice if possible before the setting in of the rains, and twice afterwards. The seed is then sown broadcast, and a heavy beam of wood is dragged across the land, to crush in the seeds and to break the clods. For the winter crops a little more trouble is taken. The bakhar is used about four times before the conclusion of the rains, when breaks admit of it. After this preparation the land is furrowed by a regular plough, to which a simple apparatus is attached for dropping the seed as the plough goes on. Another plough follows, marking its furrow a little to one side of the last, and the earth thus turned up covers the seed deposited by the first plough. This rude process, effected by implements of the lightest and most elementary construction, is all that is done for the soil, which is expected to produce an unfailing crop of wheat. It has been already remarked that the unbroken succession of wheat crops returned by the same land is often surprising; but sometimes the soil shows signs of complete exhaustion. In these cases gram, or some other pulse, is usually substituted for wheat for two or three years. Cultivators are afraid to leave their lands fallow, even for a single year, for the vacant ground is immediately occupied by rank \"kans\" grass, which no exertions can eradicate till it has run its appointed time. This is in the best soils ten or twelve years, in poorer land\nproportionately less. At the expiry of this time of forced rest the land is restored to the cultivator, refreshed and re-invigorated; but so much is the long fallow feared, that landlords will take up, even at a loss, lands unexpectedly thrown out of cultivation by their tenants.\n\nManuring and irrigation are almost unknown, except for sugarcane and vegetables. There is a fine tract, containing fifty or sixty villages, lying on the borders of the G\u00e1darw\u00e1r\u00e1 and the Narsinghp\u00far parganas, in which both these processes are very profitably adopted. The staple produce of these villages is sugarcane, irrigated from unlined (kach\u00e1) wells, by means of a Persian wheel. The favourable lie of the substrata gives unusual facilities for irrigation here, but there is nothing to prevent the general use of manure except long habit to the contrary. In the adjoining Jabalp\u00far district the practice prevails to some extent. The neglect of so important an adjunct to agriculture arises probably rather from apathy than from any want of means. In Upper India, with a far greater deficiency of ligneous fuel, it is found possible to manure a very large portion of the cultivated area. Here, although the general excuse for non-manuring is that all the available cattle-manure is required for fuel, there are some who are candid enough to admit that the process is too laborious for them. The nature of the soil has something to do with this apathy. It is deep, retentive of moisture, and most tenacious in its texture. Hence the amount of working and irrigation which might amply fertilise lighter soils, would here be thrown away. It must be, and in the case of sugarcane, is kept constantly irrigated, to prevent the rapid induration and subsequent fissility, which characterise it in its drying state. Therefore irrigation here necessitates more labour and expense than in lighter soils; and though, by softening the soil, cultivators would avoid two great sources of damage to which they are now subject, viz. loss of the seed which drops into the fissures of the earth, and occasional loss of land, which dries up before they can plough it, they prefer the present easy system, under which they are certain of a maintenance, to a life of laboriousness which would neither suit their habits nor seem required by their necessities.\n\nThe principal products of the district are sugarcane, wheat, gram, and cotton; though among food grains\u2014rice, sh\u00e1m\u00e1kh (panicum colonum), kodo (paspalum frumentaceum), kutk\u00ed (panicum miliaceum), and to a very small extent barley, are represented. Among oil-seeds\u2014linseed, til (sesamum indicum), castor-oil, and mustard. Among millets\u2014jaw\u00e1r (Indian millet), b\u00e1jr\u00e1 (Italian millet), and kangn\u00ed (spiked millet). Among pulses\u2014arhar or r\u00e1har (pigeon pea), urad (dolichos pilosus), mung (phaseolus mungo), mas\u00far (ervum hirsutum). Among dyes\u2014\u00e1l (morinda citrifolia). Among fibres\u2014hemp and \u00e1mb\u00e1r\u00ed (hibiscus cannabinus). And among garden products\u2014tobacco, sweet potatoes, potatoes, onions, turnips, and radishes. The wheat is of two kinds\u2014\"jal\u00e1li\u00e1\" (large), and \"piss\u00ed\" (small). In one village only (Bachal) is the \"kathy\u00e1,\" or red wheat, grown, but that is said to be unsurpassed in quality. Sugarcane is of five kinds\u2014two large, one of which is indigenous, and the other is the Otaheite cane, imported by Colonel Sleeman. These are used only for eating. Of the smaller kinds, one alone\u2014the \"katbar\u00e1h\"\u2014is put into the mill; gur is made from its juice, but no sugar. There remain the white, \"kusi\u00e1r,\" and the \"pachrang\u00ed,\" or five-coloured cane, used exclusively for eating. The finest canes are produced by irrigation. But on the edges of forests a practice prevails of protecting the young shoots by layers of brushwood till they attain strength. Cotton is grown, not on the so-called black cotton soil, but on the light undulating soils on the banks of\nrivers and n\u00e1l\u00e1s. No artificial means of stimulating its growth being employed, the crops have ordinarily the poorest appearance, and some estimates rate the average produce as low as eight or ten lbs. of cleaned cotton per acre. It is probably about three times as much.\n\nThe district is even better known for its mineral stores than for its agricultural wealth, as an English company has been formed to work its iron and coal. The selected mines are almost on the same meridian of longitude; but the iron pits lie north of the Narbad\u00e1, near the Vindhyan hills; and the excavations for coal have been made at Mohp\u00e1n\u00ed, in the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1 hills, at the debouchure of the Ch\u00edt\u00e1-Rew\u00e1 river. The place is distant eleven miles from the G\u00e1darw\u00e1r\u00e1 railway station. It has been worked by the Narbad\u00e1 Coal and Iron Company since 1861, under a mining license, but up to the present time little coal has been extracted. The field is described in the Memoirs of the Geological Survey of India, Vol. II. Part 2, p. 169. In the section exposed in the gorge, through which the Ch\u00edt\u00e1-Rew\u00e1 river escapes from the hills, the three seams of coal aggregate nineteen feet thick\u2014the first seam being ten feet, the second five feet, and the third four feet. Several galleries have already been sunk, and a steam-engine has been put up to draw out the loaded trucks. The miners are principally Gonds, whose insensibility to fear qualifies them well for underground work. Mr. Fryar, mining geologist in connection with the Geological Survey, who has lately visited these mines, draws the following conclusions from his inspection of them*:\n\n\"1st.\u2014That although the present openings at Mohp\u00e1n\u00ed show the coal-seams to be considerably disturbed by faults, there is yet a certainty of coal supply of 60,000 tons per annum for twenty-four years.\n\n\"2nd.\u2014That there is a probability of these seams being in a workable condition between the trap dykes Nos. 1 and 2.\n\n\"3rd.\u2014That the coal-seams north of No. 2 trap dyke, which are marked on the map \"Mr. Knolles' mine,\" evidently extend in an easterly direction far into the Narbad\u00e1 Coal and Iron Company's property, and will yield a large supply of coal.\n\n\"4th.\u2014That the same series of seams as seen in Ch\u00edt\u00e1-Rew\u00e1 (S\u00edt\u00e1-Rew\u00e1) river at Mohp\u00e1n\u00ed may by judicious searching be found to extend in a profitably working condition to a great distance south-west from the mines at present in operation.\n\n\"5th.\u2014That the seams at present being worked by Mr. Knolles are likely to yield a large yearly out-put both in depth and in westerly extent.\"\n\nAnd he gives the following description of the mines:\n\n\"The coal-bearing rocks extend for many miles to the south and southwest from Mohp\u00e1n\u00ed; and when once the coal mines of the district are in full operation, and the demand for coal such as to induce a vigorous effort in the search for coal by enterprising individuals and companies, I am of opinion that the coal resources of the field will be found to be equal to the demand for very many centuries to come.\n\n\"The Narbad\u00e1 Coal and Iron Company seem to have made very praiseworthy attempts to properly establish their mining works. The coal-\n\n---\n\n* Report by Mr. Fryar, printed with letter No. 2436-247, dated 10th August 1868, from Secretary to Chief Commissioner Central Provinces to Secretary to Government of India, D.P.W. pp. 2\u20144.\nseams have been entered by levels driven into the hills on the north side of the river, as indicated by the section on the skeleton map. Two pits have been sunk (to the coal I am informed\u2014one on the north side of the river, and the other on the south side); but at neither of these pits have any machinery-arrangements yet been made either for drainage or for raising coal. A steam-engine has been erected at the top of an incline leading into No. 2 coal on the north side of the river, and this is at present in operation, raising water and coal to the surface by haulage up the incline. This is a well-made coupled horizontal engine, with ten-inch cylinders, and works into gearing of about one to twelve. An engine of the same description is on the works ready for erection and use, and a small portable engine is at work driving a lathe in the fitting-shop. Pump-trees, working-barrels, pump-rods, and bobs are all on the ground ready for use wherever and whenever they may be required.\n\n\"There is no coal in store;\u2014all that has hitherto been worked seems to have been sold or used up at the mines.\n\n\"The method of subterranean work pursued is that generally known in England by the name of 'pillar and stall.' Galleries are excavated at right angles to each other, and blocks or pillars are left to support the roof.\n\n\"* * * * * I have formed a favourable opinion of this coal as a steam fuel. That it contains a large amount of ash as compared with English coal is doubtless correct, but the same is the case with all Indian coals at present used as steam fuel by the East Indian Railway. In a report given of the Narbad\u00e1 coal by R. Haines, Esq., Acting Chemical Analyster to the Government of Bombay, dated 12th July 1860, it is stated to contain 66\u00b763 per cent coke and 33\u00b737 per cent of volatile matter, or 45\u00b754 per cent of coke after deducting ash, and 18\u00b709 per cent of ash.\n\n\"The coals examined by Mr. Haines at the date mentioned could only have been surface-specimens, and consequently not a fair sample of the workable seams from the interior of the mine. From a rough experiment by distilling coal in a ghar\u00e1, at the Mohp\u00e1n\u00ed mines, I found that it contained seventy-five per cent of carbon and twenty-five per cent of volatile matter. I had no safe or ready means of estimating the amount of ash, but from observing the burning of the coal, and the amount of ash made in the English fire at the works, I am of opinion that the eighteen per cent of ash given by Mr. Haines is in excess of what will be found to be the case in using the coal as locomotive engine fuel. To use practical engineering phraseology, it is a strong non-coking coal, capable of doing a fair amount of duty as a steam fuel, and making, I believe, an amount of ash not greater than what is made by the generality of Indian coals now used by the East Indian Railway.\"\n\nCoal is also found in the rivers Sher and Shakar, but in small quantities. A specimen from Sihor\u00e1 gh\u00e1t, on the Sher river, exhibited by the Deputy Commissioner, gained the first prize at the N\u00e1gp\u00far Exhibition. It is said to be like Cannel coal\u2014hard, compact, jetty, and free from pyrites of iron. The seam from which it was taken is not believed to be very extensive. Lately a seam has been discovered to the west of the Chit\u00e1-Rew\u00e1, which has been profitably worked by one of the Railway Company's engineers, Mr. T. Knolles. The Narbad\u00e1 Coal and Iron Company have not yet commenced operations at Tend\u00fakher\u00e1, and the iron which bears the name of that town is still worked by native miners. Tend\u00fakher\u00e1 itself\nis situated on the banks of a hill stream, about two miles south of the Vindhyan escarpment, and thirty-five miles from the G\u00e1darw\u00e1r\u00e1 railway station. From the employment of charcoal exclusively in smelting, the town has not the smoky appearance with which we are accustomed to associate manufacturing cities; but the ceaseless clink of hammers, which may be heard from some distance, marks it as distinct in character from the agricultural villages of the valley. The mines are in the open plain, though not far from a long low limestone hill, about two miles to the south-west of the town. They are mere open pits, cut to the depth of about thirty feet through the black soil and the underlying clay, and require to be reconstructed yearly after the rainy season. The iron produced is of excellent quality. Mr. Blackwell, late Mineral Viewer to the Bombay Government, says of it, that \"it will contain on an average about forty per cent of iron, \"and is calcareous ore, somewhat similar to the Forest of Dean ores, worked in \"the mountain limestone of Gloucestershire.\"*\n\nThe forest produce of Narsinghp\u00far is insignificant. There is probably no district in the province so devoid of extensive waste tracts. Parts of the valley of the D\u00fadh\u00ed (in G\u00e1darw\u00e1r\u00e1), of the Sher and M\u00e1ch\u00e1-Rew\u00e1 (in Bachal), and of the Umar and Soner (in Sr\u00ednagar), come legitimately under the denomination of forest land; but they do not now contain any fine timber, except mhowa trees, which are too valuable for purposes of sustenance to allow of their being cut down. These lands have been marked off into lots, and can be purchased from Government at an upset price per acre. The usual forest produce\u2014lac, honey, wax, gum, mhowa, and chironjf\u2014are found in the waste tracts, but the means of access to them are too easy to allow of their being very plentiful.\n\nThere are only two real trading towns at present, Narsinghp\u00far and G\u00e1darw\u00e1r\u00e1, though there are a few merchants and bankers located about the district, at such places as Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 and Kauri\u00e1 on the main road, and Singhp\u00far, Paloh\u00e1, S\u00e1inkher\u00e1, and B\u00e1rh\u00e1 in the interior. Narsinghp\u00far is now a thriving place, containing with Kandeli, which adjoins it, nearly ten thousand inhabitants. The value of the imports and exports is stated in the trade report for 1868-69 at Rs. 6,33,323. The former are described as consisting of the staples ordinarily required for Indian domestic consumption, viz. sugar, salt, spices, grain, cloth, tobacco, opium, hardware, &c. The exports are principally wholesale consignments to smaller towns or fairs. Narsinghp\u00far is in fact an entrep\u00f4t for the rest of the district; and the trade, though insignificant measured by that of the commercial centres of India, will not seem inconsiderable, viewed with regard to the former status of the town and of the district. The banking and mercantile houses by whom the trade is now carried on are mostly branches of large firms established in important cities, who sent down their agents in the wake of the grand army in 1818. Similarly, G\u00e1darw\u00e1r\u00e1, which has now some five thousand five hundred inhabitants, and a mercantile capital probably amounting to eight or ten l\u00f3khs of rupees, is said not to have possessed a single trader of any standing under the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, though the head-quarters of the s\u00faba, Naw\u00e1b Sad\u00edk \u00c1l\u00ed Kh\u00e1n, and his force, were for some time located there.\n\nHitherto, in the absence of any large mart, the distribution of foreign necessaries has been effected a good deal by means of an extensive fair, which is held yearly in the months of November and December on the sands of the Narbad\u00e1 at Birm\u00e1n,\n\n* Selections from Records of Bombay Government, No. xlv., New Series, p. 12.\ndistant fourteen miles from Narsinghp\u00far. The primary object of the fair, as of all such assemblages in India, is religious; but the shops and booths now fully hold their own against the temples. The goods brought to this fair in 1868 were estimated by the Deputy Commissioner as worth Rs. 8,00,000, of which about half found a sale. The principal item of merchandise was English cloth, of which three l\u00f3khs worth was received, after that lac ornaments, and then copper utensils. The attendance was estimated at about seventy-five thousand, but there must have been a much larger gathering upon the sacred nights, when crowds of Hind\u00fas assemble to bathe in the river at the moon\u2019s change, while the average number of persons who come merely to buy and sell cannot be less than twenty thousand.\n\nThe only export of any consequence until lately has been cotton. The mercantile firms of Narsinghp\u00far and G\u00e1darw\u00e1r\u00e1 have taken full advantage of the extraordinary English demand, and the wealth and extended views thus acquired will be turned to good account when the opening of the railroad expands the trade of the valley.\n\nThe manufactures of the district may be dismissed in a few words. Brass and bell-metal vessels are made at Chichl\u00ed, where there are forty or fifty families of brass-founders, but not to a sufficient extent even to supply local consumption. A kind of stamped cotton fabric is made at G\u00e1darw\u00e1r\u00e1. Iron is manufactured at Tend\u00fakher\u00e1, and tasar silk is woven at Narsinghp\u00far, where also are made saddle-cloths, which have a rather wide local reputation.\n\nThe highroad from Jabalp\u00far towards B\u00f3mpay runs right through the Narsinghp\u00far district from east to west. It is a good fair-weather road, but unmetalled, and only partially bridged, and therefore impracticable during the rainy season. There are travellers\u2019 bungalows at Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1, Narsinghp\u00far station, and N\u00e1dner. The route from Narsinghp\u00far northwards across the Narbad\u00e1 towards S\u00e1g\u00e1r is the ordinary line of communication between the Western N\u00e1gpur and Narbad\u00e1 districts, and Bundelkhand. After crossing the Narbad\u00e1 this road is taken through an opening in the hills, by which all ascent is avoided until the level Ch\u00e1nwarp\u00e1th\u00e1 valley ends at the Jhir\u00ed\u00e1 Gh\u00e1t, at the base of the Vindhyas. The road towards Seoni runs southwards to Sr\u00ednagar to the foot of the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1s, crossing the rivers Sher and Umar. The road to Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 passes by Har\u00e1l. None of these are yet metalled, but the more difficult watercourses have been bridged, and each season advances the work of improving the communication. The Great Indian Peninsula Railway passes through the length of the district from east to west, with stations at Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1, Korakbel, Narsinghp\u00far, Karel\u00ed, Sihor\u00e1, Mandesar, and G\u00e1darw\u00e1r\u00e1. A first-class military road will connect S\u00e1g\u00e1r with the line at one of these points, and a system of railway-feeders has been undertaken.\n\nThe administration of the district is conducted by the usual civil staff, consisting of a Deputy Commissioner, three Assistant and Extra-Assistant Commissioners, a Civil Surgeon, and a District Superintendent of Police at head-quarters, and Tahsild\u00e1rs at Narsinghp\u00far, G\u00e1darw\u00e1r\u00e1, and Ch\u00e1nwarp\u00e1th\u00e1. The police force has a strength of 377 of all ranks. They have station-houses at Narsinghp\u00far, G\u00e1darw\u00e1r\u00e1, Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1, Bach\u00e1i, Tend\u00fakher\u00e1, and Birm\u00e1n, besides fifteen outposts. The customs line\npasses through the district, and there is a patrol's station at Paloh\u00e1. The revenues of the district for 1868-69 are as follows:\n\n**Imperial.**\n\n| Item                  | Amount |\n|-----------------------|--------|\n| Land                  | Rs. 4,18,056 |\n| Excise                | Rs. 29,185 |\n| Stamps                | Rs. 67,070 |\n| Assessed taxes        | Rs. 11,367 |\n| Forests               | Rs. 3,426 |\n\n**Local.**\n\n| Item                  | Amount |\n|-----------------------|--------|\n| School cess           | Rs. 8,361 |\n| D\u00e2k do                | Rs. 2,090 |\n| Road do               | Rs. 8,361 |\n| Ferry and pound       | Rs. 11,283 |\n| Naz\u00fbl                 | Rs. 7,525 |\n| Municipal             | Rs. 9,531 |\n\nTotal...Rs. 5,76,205\n\n**NARSINGHPUR**\u2014The eastern revenue subdivision or tahsil in the district of the same name, having an area of 993 square miles, with 568 villages, and a population of 145,168 according to the census of 1866. The land revenue of the tahsil for the year 1869-70 is Rs. 2,09,337-6-0.\n\n**NARSINGHPUR (with KANDELI)**\u2014The head-quarters of the district of the same name, situated on the west bank of the Singri, which has been dammed up to furnish a water-supply for the town. The original name of the place was Gadari\u00e1-kher\u00e1. Under the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s it became the head-quarters of the force maintained in the Narbad\u00e1 valley, and was then known as Chhot\u00e1 G\u00e1darw\u00e1r\u00e1. The name was again changed to Narsinghpur, after the erection of a large temple to Narsinha, one of the avat\u00e1rs of Vishnu. The town is now prosperous, and will become more so when the railway opens. It has no manufactures of importance, but it is one of the chief entrep\u00f4ts for the grain and cotton trade of the rich Narbad\u00e1 valley. The main street is well built and well kept. The principal government buildings are the courts and offices of the Deputy Commissioner and the Police Superintendent. There are also here a jail, a dispensary, a travellers' bungalow, and a native travellers' rest-house. The post-office is under the control of a native deputy postmaster. The zil\u00e1 school-house is a commodious building, and has now (1869) an attendance of two hundred and fourteen scholars, of whom seventy learn English. There are in addition two private schools and a police school.\n\n**NAWA'GARH**\u2014A town fifty miles south-west of Bil\u00e1sp\u00far, containing a population of 2,500 souls. It derives its name from having been in ancient times the chief of a group of nine forts, and is said to have been established three hundred years ago. The ruins of an old and extensive earthwork exist, but there are no other noticeable remains. It was formerly the chief place of a sub-collectorate.\n\n**NAWAKHALA'**\u2014A village in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, containing three hundred houses, and situated one mile north-west of N\u00e1gbh\u00edr. It has two fine irrigation-reservoirs.\n\n**NAWEGA'ON**\u2014A town six miles north of Garhbor\u00ed in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, containing 756 houses. The streets are wide and straight, and the town gene-\nrally is one of the neatest in the district. At some little distance is a very fine tank. A large quantity of cotton-cloths are manufactured here for export, and rice is extensively grown. The population is principally Mar\u00e1th\u00e1; and there are government schools for boys and girls.\n\nNAWEGA'ON HILLS\u2014In the Bhand\u00e1ra district, encircle the large tank or lake of that name, and, though scantily clothed with vegetation, are infested with wild animals. They are about two hundred feet above the level of the plain.\n\nNAWEGA'ON\u2014This fine artificial lake, in the Bhand\u00e1ra district, is seventeen miles in circumference, and has an average depth of forty feet, increasing in places to ninety feet. It is surrounded by hills showing eight distinct peaks, which are known in the neighbourhood as the \"seven sisters and their little brother.\" Numerous streams pour their waters into this rocky basin, which is closed by two weirs or embankments, 330 and 540 yards in length respectively. The work was constructed about a century and half ago by Chimn\u00e1 Patel, the great-great-grandfather of the present proprietor of the village of Naw\u00e9g\u00e1on, and now irrigates some five hundred acres of rice and sugarcane land.\n\nNERI.\u2014A town in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, situated on a tributary of the Andh\u00e1r\u00ed, five miles east-south-east of Chim\u00far, and containing 917 houses. The population is Mar\u00e1th\u00e1, with a sprinkling of Telinges, principally of the Panch\u00e1l caste. Rice is largely grown in the neighbourhood, and brass and copper utensils and cotton-cloths are manufactured for export. There is a considerable trade in these goods, and also in grain, groceries, and salt. The place is divided into the old town and the new town, with an extensive stretch of rice cultivation between. The antiquities are two old forts, now in ruins, and an ancient temple of no small size and beauty, the pillars and carving of which resemble those met with in the cave-temples of Ajant\u00e1. Of more modern construction are some graceful Panch\u00e1l tombs, in which husband and wife sleep side by side. There are schools here both for boys and girls.\n\nNIMA'R*\u2014\n\nCONTENTS.\n\n| Page | Page |\n|------|------|\n| General description | 373 |\n| Geology | 378 |\n| Minerals | 376 |\n| Early history | 377 |\n| Hind\u00fa period | ib. |\n| Ghori kings of M\u00e1lw\u00e1 | 378 |\n| Fird\u00f3ki dynasty of Kh\u00e1ndesh | ib. |\n| Conquest of Akbar | ib. |\n| Invasion of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s | 379 |\n| Acquisition of Nim\u00e1r by the Niz\u00e1m | ib. |\n| The Peshw\u00e1's administration | ib. |\n| The district transferred to Sind\u00ed\u00e1 | 380 |\n| The \"Time of trouble\" | ib. |\n| The Pinjdh\u00faris | ib. |\n| British administration | ib. |\n| Our early Revenue management | 381 |\n| The mutiny of 1857 | ib. |\n| Recent changes in the district | 382 |\n| Completion of the land revenue settlement | ib. |\n| Other revenues | ib. |\n| Administration | ib. |\n| Communications | 388 |\n| Population | ib. |\n| Soils | 384 |\n| Agricultural system | 386 |\n| Domestic animals | ib. |\n| Trade | ib. |\n| Forests | 386 |\n| Culturable wastes | ib. |\n| Climate | 387 |\n| Wild animals and sport | ib. |\n| Maps of the district | ib. |\n| Principal places of interest | ib. |\n\nNim\u00e1r is the westernmost district of the Central Provinces. On the east it marches with the Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d district, the Chhot\u00e1 Taw\u00e1, and its tributary the Gang\u00e1p\u00e1t to the north and the Gul\u00ed to the south, marking its boundary.\n\n* This article is by Captain Forsyth, Settlement Officer and Deputy Commissioner of Nim\u00e1r.\nalmost from point to point; on the north it touches the territories of the Ponw\u00e1r of Dh\u00e1r and of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 Holkar; and on the west it is bounded throughout by the dominions of Holkar. On the south it meets the Kh\u00e1ndesh collectorate of the Bombay presidency and the border of West Ber\u00e1r.\n\nThe modern district has an area of about 3,340 square miles. It includes but a small portion of the ancient Hind\u00fa subdivision of Pr\u00e1nt Nim\u00e1r, which occupied the whole of that portion of the Narbad\u00e1 valley lying between the Vindhyan hills on the north and the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1 range on the south, and extending east and west about 225 miles, from a point near the junction of the Narbad\u00e1 and Ganjal rivers, in east longitude 77\u00b0 10', to the Haranp\u00e1l (deer's-leap) in longitude 74\u00b0, being thus about 9,000 square miles in area. On the other hand that part of the modern district which lies south of the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1s in the Tapt\u00ed valley was no part of old Pr\u00e1nt Nim\u00e1r, but belonged to the Hind\u00fa division of Talner, subsequently called by the Moham-madans Kh\u00e1ndesh.\n\nThe northern section of the district in the Narbad\u00e1 valley is much broken up by low irregular hills, and does not anywhere present the open and level surface remarkable in the districts higher up the valley, which gives them their great natural fertility. It is drained by the small rivers called the Sukt\u00e1, Abn\u00e1, Wan\u00e1, Bh\u00e1m, B\u00e1ld\u00ed, and Phipr\u00e1r, which unite in a considerable stream\u2014the Chhot\u00e1 Taw\u00e1\u2014before joining the Narbad\u00e1, and by the Ajn\u00e1l, K\u00e1ver\u00ed, and B\u00e1k\u00far, which fall directly into that river. The best parts of this tract are the basin of the Abn\u00e1 and Sukt\u00e1 surrounding the town of Khandw\u00e1, and the tract along the Narbad\u00e1 in the extreme north-west corner of the district, which forms the commencement of the fourth natural basin in the valley of that river\u2014the kernel of old Pr\u00e1nt Nim\u00e1r. The principal towns in this northern section are Khandw\u00e1, which is also the civil station; Pandh\u00e1n\u00e1, a large grain mart, containing 500 houses and a population of 2,400; Bh\u00e1mgarh, Mund\u00ed, Beri\u00e1, and K\u00e1nipur, the chief towns of the parganas of the same names. This section of the district is tolerably well cultivated, except in the north-east corner, where there is a large tract quite waste along the Chhot\u00e1 Taw\u00e1 and Narbad\u00e1 rivers. But it is so broken up with unculturable elevated ridges that it does not present at all a rich appearance to the casual traveller. Its average elevation above the sea is about 1,000 feet.\n\nThe southern section of the district, in the Tapt\u00ed valley, is naturally much more open and fertile. The western part of it is completely cultivated, but higher up the valley the land, though of exceeding richness, is still completely desolate. In this valley is situated the large city of Burh\u00e1npur and the considerable towns of Bah\u00e9durp\u00far, Lon\u00ed, and Sh\u00e1hp\u00far. The average elevation, above the sea, of the Tapt\u00ed valley is about 850 feet.\n\nThe central range which divides these valleys is very irregular and broken. On its highest point stands the fortress of A's\u00edrgarh, about 800 feet above the general level of the country and 2,200 feet above the sea, and commanding a pass through the range which has for centuries been the chief highway between Upper India and the Deccan. This range has an average width of about fifteen miles, and is almost entirely unculturable. It is the only part of the great hilly backbone of the Central Provinces, generally called in maps the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1 range, which is really known by that name to the common people.\n\nThe southern boundary of the district is formed by the watershed of another branch of the same great range. This is a continuation of the G\u00e1walgarh hills,\nand is known in Nim\u00e1r by the name of the Hatt\u00eds. The watershed is close to its southern edge, the descent to the plains of Ber\u00e1r being usually steep, while that towards the Tapt\u00ed valley is long and gradual, including some plateaus of considerable extent, and in places of excellent soil. The general elevation of this range is 2,000 feet, and the highest point (in the extreme south-east corner of the district) 3,000 feet above the sea.\n\nAltogether about half the area of the district is thus composed of land incapable of any sort of cultivation. Only 310,366 acres, or less than one-seventh of the whole area, are now under the plough, leaving about 758,000 acres of culturable waste to be taken up. 340,318 acres of this are private property, and about 418,000 acres are State property available for sale or lease.\n\nThe following description of the geology of Nim\u00e1r has been given by Mr. W. Blanford in his paper on the \"Geology of the Tapt\u00ed and Narbad\u00e1 valleys.\"*\n\n**Section 4.\u2014Narbad\u00e1 valley south of that river, from the smaller Taw\u00e1 on the east to the Jharkhal on the west, including the Barw\u00e1n\u00ed hills.**\n\n\"The whole of this country, with the sole exception of one small strip in the immediate neighbourhood of the river between the Taw\u00e1 and Barw\u00e1\u00ed, consists of trap. The excepted tract is composed of Vindhyaans, being a portion of the area occupied by those beds in the Dh\u00e1r forest. Close to the Taw\u00e1, and just south of the village of Bijalp\u00far, there is a small patch of granite or granitoid gneiss. To the south of it, intervening between it and the trap, is impure nodular gritty limestone, which may possibly be inter-trappean, but which appears to resemble the upper limestone of the B\u00e1gh beds more closely than any other formation. It contains small fragments of quartz and felspar, besides minute portions of fossil wood. No distinct organisms could be made out; some markings resembling fragments of shells were seen, but their nature could not be determined.\n\n\"This bed is also seen at N\u00e1gp\u00far on the Taw\u00e1, where it is in parts decidedly conglomeritic, containing quartzite pebbles in considerable quantities. In a n\u00e1l\u00fa on the west side of the river, just above N\u00e1gp\u00far, a soft white sandstone with ferruginous conglomerate beneath it, about one foot in thickness, and apparently lower in position than the limestone, is seen resting upon metamorphic rocks. This much strengthens the probability of the whole belonging to the B\u00e1gh beds. North of the little patch of metamorphics, and just south of the village of Bijalp\u00far, Vindhyaans come in, and at the village trap occurs. No intervening beds are seen.\n\n\"To the north of Bijalp\u00far, Vindhyaans re-emerge almost immediately from beneath the traps and rise into hills which continue steadily to the westward. The beds are undulating, and resemble precisely those already described on the north bank of the river.\n\n\"Just west of Pun\u00e1s\u00e1 near the village of Bhorl\u00e1 a considerable expanse of ground is covered with sedimentary rocks, apparently of the same age as the B\u00e1gh beds,\n\n* Memoirs of the Geological Survey of India, vol. vi. part 3, pp. 103\u2014106.\nand intervening between the trap and the Vindhyans. At the tank close to Bhorl\u00e1 porcelanic clay is seen, probably hardened by trap, which is in place close by. Just west of Bhorl\u00e1 massive nodular grey limestone in horizontal beds crops out on the north side of the road to T\u00e1kl\u00ed. This appears to be higher in position than the clay, and may possibly, in parts at least, be intertrappean, more especially as blocks of typical intertrappean beds with the usual fossils (cyprides and plant remains) occur near T\u00e1kl\u00ed. The Bhorl\u00e1 limestone contains irregular cherty lumps and fragments of fossil shells in abundance.* To the north of the tank the ground is covered by black soil. About one-half or three-quarters of a mile north of Bhorl\u00e1 the Vindhyans crop out. Just south of them, and resting upon them, are sandstones and conglomerates precisely similar to those underlying the traps in Dh\u00e1r forest, and to the beds of A\u2019lamp\u00far north-west of Bet\u00fal. There can therefore be little question about the occurrence in this spot of beds of cretaceous age.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome of the conglomeritic sandstones north of Bhorl\u00e1 have very much the appearance of the Vindhyans\u2014an appearance due to their being composed principally, if not entirely, of detritus derived from those beds. On closer examination the difference is easily seen: the Vindhyans are dense, homogeneous, and compact, scarcely a trace of structure being discoverable, while the separate grains of which the cretaceous beds are formed may be distinguished in general with the naked eye. The jungle covering the two rocks also is very distinct. Here, as elsewhere, that on the Vindhyans is characterised by the absence of underwood, the thinness of the grass, and the prevalence of the s\u00e1lai (boswellia thurifera), which in places is almost the only tree, while the jungle on the cretaceous beds is varied in kind, and both grass and underwood are thick and luxuriant.\n\n\u201cVindhyans continue nearly as far west as to opposite Barw\u00e1\u00ed, and end close to the spot where they cease on the north bank of the river. A few patches of overlying trap occur upon them. They present no features of interest.\n\n\u201cWith the exception of the small tract just briefly described, the whole of the country comprised in this section consists of trap. Near the river, accumulations of cotton soil, sometimes of considerable thickness, are of frequent occurrence between Barw\u00e1\u00ed and Barw\u00e1n\u00ed. West of the latter town all the country is very hilly, and the river runs through a deep rocky gorge.\n\n\u201cThroughout by far the greater portion of this tract the traps appear to be horizontal. The exceptions are to the east in Nim\u00e1r, where they have a low south dip, so small in the neighbourhood of Khandw\u00e1 as to be scarcely perceptible, and in the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1 hills west of A\u2019s\u00edrgarh. Beneath that fortress itself the beds are horizontal, but in the low hills immediately to the west there is a strong southern dip, in places amounting to as much as 10\u00b0 or 15\u00b0. This is an exception, but low dips of 2\u00b0 or 3\u00b0 prevail largely throughout the range, both on the Kh\u00e1ndesh and on the Nim\u00e1r side.\n\n* \u201cMr. Wynne obtained marine fossils from Bhorl\u00e1, but it is not quite certain from what portion of the limestone; it was before the beds of this part of the country were well known. It is clear that both intertrappean and cretaceous beds occur at this spot.\u201d\n\"Beds of volcanic ash are of frequent occurrence, and occasional strata of red boulder are met with. With these exceptions the whole of the broad undulating plain of Nim\u00e1ri consists of various forms of basalt, usually more or less amygdaloidal. On the railway from Burh\u00e1np\u00far to the Narbad\u00e1 plain there are no sections of any importance, and very few are seen on the sides of the low hills which occur here and there throughout the country, the surface of the trap being generally much decomposed and concealed.\"\n\nThe formation of the Tapt\u00ed valley section of the district is also thus described by Mr. Blanford *:\n\n\"The sandstones end out twenty miles above Melgh\u00e1t, and no beds from beneath the traps emerge thenceforward throughout the whole course of the Tapt\u00ed. The bed of the river from Melgh\u00e1t to Burh\u00e1np\u00far presents no peculiar geological interest. Basaltic columns occur in two or three places near Melgh\u00e1t, and they appear to be as common here as they are in the lowest beds of trap beneath the M\u00e1lw\u00e1 plateau. These Tapt\u00ed beds must also be amongst the oldest of the lava flows. Some of the best basaltic columns are seen about two miles above Melgh\u00e1t, and again lower down near the small village of Hard\u00e1. Passing down the river, alluvium begins to be found in considerable quantities near Sindw\u00e1l, and to form a large proportion of the river's bank. It gradually increases in amount, and covers more of the adjoining country. Still there is no continuous alluvial plain along the river till near Burh\u00e1np\u00far. The alluvium presents the usual characters.\n\n\"The hills north of the Tapt\u00ed between Melgh\u00e1t and Burh\u00e1np\u00far are of no great height. They consist entirely of trap. The Hills north of Tapt\u00ed. great G\u00e1walgarh range between the P\u00farn\u00e1 and the Tapt\u00ed is entirely composed of basaltic rocks. The beds along the southern border dip to the north; the features of the scarp will be noticed in the next section. Near the Tapt\u00ed the dips, when any are seen, are to the southward. Only the verge of these hills was examined, but in the streams running from them none but trap pebbles could be found.\n\n* * * * * * * *\n\n\"Below Burh\u00e1np\u00far very little rock is seen in the Tapt\u00ed. North of the Country near Burh\u00e1np\u00far. town there is thick alluvium, but a little to the west trap comes in. On the north, on the road to A's\u00edrgarh, trap is met with. About five miles from Burh\u00e1np\u00far, near to this spot, a little east of the road, and about a mile north-east of the village of Limestone and sandstone near Ch\u00falkh\u00e1n. Ch\u00falkh\u00e1n, there is a singular patch of limestone. It is compact, but shows no signs of crystallisation, and it appears to contain no fossils. It is quite isolated, all around being trap, and about fifty feet in length. At one end of it there is a white sandy rock, resembling decomposed gneiss in appearance, and standing on end as if it were part of a vertical bed; it, however, contains rounded grains, and is probably sandstone. Some red clay is associated with it. This mass of sedimentary rocks is evidently a portion\n\n* Memoirs of the Geological Survey of India, vol. vi. part 3, p. 113 ff.\nof some intertrappean formation, very probably Lamet\u00e1 or B\u00e1g\u00e9h, either brought up by a dyke, or included in a lava flow, like the granite in the river bed at Mandleswar. As frequently happens, the rocks around are not sufficiently well seen to prove which of these is the case, but there is no evidence of a dyke.\n\n\"The traps in the hills around A's\u00edrgarh are not horizontal, but dip very irregularly, and the same is the case for a long distance to the west. At a considerable distance south of the main range there are low rises stretching across from Burh\u00e1ngur to near R\u00e9ver. The traps in them appear to dip north at about 5\u00b0.\"\n\nMr. Blanford writes as follows on the iron-ores in the northern part of the district.* A much more detailed account of the minerals of Nim\u00e1r (iron and limestone) will, however, be found in No. XIV. of the published Selections from the Records of the Bombay Government:\n\n\"Coal is entirely wanting throughout the tract under description; no trace of any of the rocks usually accompanying it having been anywhere seen where lower beds appear from beneath the trap.\n\n\"The iron manufactured in the Dh\u00e1r forest near Pun\u00e1s\u00e1 and Ch\u00e1ndgarh has already been fully treated of by Dr. Oldham in the second volume of the Memoirs, p. 271.\n\n\"Some fine works were subsequently built by the Indian Government at Barw\u00e1i under the superintendence of Mr. Mitander, a very able Swedish metallurgist. Every difficulty was overcome, and the works were perfectly ready for the manufacture of iron, when the Government, finding that additional European assistance was necessary in order to carry on the manufacture, declined to sanction any further expense, and offered the works for sale in 1864. Unfortunately, despite the great demand for iron throughout the country, no attempt has been made by any private person or public company to carry on the working.\u2020\n\n\"The ore at Barw\u00e1i is found in irregular masses of breccia, the matrix of which is chiefly brown h\u00e6matite in the Bij\u00e1war series. It is not clear that there is any distinct bed, but the ore is rich, and found in several places.\n\n\"The few furnaces which still exist around Ch\u00e1ndgarh (the manufacture is fast dying out on account of the difficulty of procuring fuel) are similar in form and size to those employed in other parts of India, but differ in a few peculiarities: they are hollowed out of a bank (as in B\u00eerbh\u00fam) and not built up, and are square inside, not round. They are about five feet high. The bellows used are worked by the hand.\n\n* Memoirs of the Geological Survey of India, vol. vi. part 3, pp. 215\u2014217.\n\u2020 These works have subsequently been made over to His Highness Holkar, with Pargana Barw\u00e1i.\nThroughout the trap country limestone is in general wanting, except where beds of calcareous intertrappeans occur. These are only found near the base, and are in general wanting to the westward. A bed near Barw\u00e1\u00ed afforded the best limestone for iron smelting that could be found in the neighbourhood. With this exception the only source of lime in the trap country is the kankar, which abounds wherever there is a deep soil above the rocks, and especially in the larger masses of alluvial clay.\n\nBefore proceeding to describe further the modern district it will be well to sketch its history. It has always been, as it still is, a \"border land.\" The aboriginal inhabitants even belong to two distinct divisions\u2014the Bhils and Kol\u00eds of Western India here meeting the Gonds and Kurk\u00fas of the Eastern Central Provinces. Hind\u00fa sacred literature states that M\u00e1hishmat\u00ed, the modern Maheswar, a city of Pr\u00e1nt Nim\u00e1r (now Holkar's), was the capital of the Haihaya kings.* A deposit of silver coins, probably belonging to them, was found here in 1838, and has been described by the Rev. Dr. Wilson in the Central Provinces Antiquarian Journal No. 1. The Haihayas are said to have been expelled by the Br\u00e1hmans, who established the worship of Siva, in the form of the Linga \u00d3mk\u00e1r, on the island of M\u00e1ndh\u00e1t\u00e1, in the river Narbad\u00e1.\n\nWe next read in R\u00e1jput poetry of the country being ruled by the Chauh\u00e1n R\u00e1jputs who held \u00c1'sirgarh, though their capital was at Mak\u00e1vati\u2020 (Garh\u00e1 Mandl\u00e1). They were supporters of the gods of the Br\u00e1hmans, and appear to have been at last overcome by the Pram\u00e1ra R\u00e1jputs\u2021 who established the great Buddhist kingdom of M\u00e1lw\u00e1. A branch of this family called T\u00e1k\u00a7 held \u00c1'sirgarh from the beginning of the ninth to the close of the twelfth century of our era. Several times during this period are the T\u00e1ks of \u00c1'sir mentioned by the poet Ch\u00e1nd, as leaders in the Hind\u00fa armies battling in Northern India against the Mohammadan invader. During this period the Jain religion\u2014a schism from Buddhism\u2014was paramount in Nim\u00e1r, and numerous remains of finely-carved temples &c. yet remain at W\u00fan, Barw\u00e1n\u00ed, and other places in Pr\u00e1nt Nim\u00e1r,|| and at Khandw\u00e1 and near M\u00e1ndh\u00e1t\u00e1 in the modern district. Before the invasion of the Mohammadans, the Chauh\u00e1ns again seem to have recovered \u00c1'sirgarh and the southern part of the district. In A.D. 1295 Sult\u00e1n Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn, returning from his bold raid in the Deccan, took \u00c1'sir, and put all the Chauh\u00e1ns to the sword, excepting one, whose descendants were afterwards the r\u00e1s\u00e1s of Harauti.\u00b6 The present R\u00e1n\u00e1 of P\u00edplod in Nim\u00e1r also claims descent from the \u00c1'sir Chauh\u00e1ns, and his pretensions are in great measure supported by his genealogy and family history. Northern Nim\u00e1r about this time came into the possession of a R\u00e1j\u00e1 of the Bhil\u00e1la tribe (which is believed to be a cross between Bhil and R\u00e1jput blood), and his descendants are still to be found in the chiefs of Bh\u00e1gargarh, M\u00e1ndh\u00e1t\u00e1, and Sil\u00e1n\u00ed.

The tale, however, seems doubtful, to say the least of it. It is almost\ncertain that the country was wholly in the hands of the Chauh\u00e1n and Bhil\u00e1la\nchiefs above mentioned at the time of the Mohammadan conquest:\n\nNorthern Nim\u00e1r became part of the independent Mohammadan kingdom of\nM\u00e1lw\u00e1 about A.D. 1387. Its capital was at M\u00e1nd\u00fa\non the crest of the Vindhyan range. It is now a\ndesolate ruin, but with many fine remains of the Ghor\u00ed dynasty. A description of\nit would be out of place in a work referring only to the Central Provinces, but\nfull details concerning it will be found in Briggs' Farishta, Malcolm's Central\nIndia, Fergusson's Architecture, and in a volume of excellent sketches of the\nplace, with descriptive letter-press, published by Captain Harris of the Madras\nArmy.\n\nIn A.D. 1370 Malak R\u00e9j\u00e1 F\u00e1r\u00fak\u00ed obtained Southern Nim\u00e1r, then uncon-\nquered, from the Delhi emperor,* and after estab-\nlishing the Mohammadan power in the Tapt\u00ed\nvalley, was succeeded by his son Nas\u00edr Kh\u00e1n,\nwho assumed independence, and established the F\u00e1r\u00fak\u00ed dynasty of Kh\u00e1ndesh in\nA.D. 1399. He captured A's\u00edrgarh (according to Farishta\u2020 from A's\u00e1 Ah\u00edr),\nand founded the cities of Burh\u00e1np\u00far and Zain\u00e1b\u00e1d, in honour of the Moham-\nmadan sheikhs Burh\u00e1n-ud-d\u00edn and Zain-ud-d\u00edn, on opposite banks of the river\nTapt\u00ed. The F\u00e1r\u00fak\u00ed dynasty held Kh\u00e1ndesh, with their capital at Burh\u00e1np\u00far,\nduring eleven generations, from A.D. 1399 to A.D. 1600. Their independence\nwas, however, of a very modified sort, as they were throughout under the\nsuzerainty of the more powerful kings either of Gujar\u00e1t or M\u00e1lw\u00e1, and whenever\nthey ventured to throw off their vassalage, or attacked their neighbours, were\nquickly brought to their senses by a force which they in no case successfully\nresisted. Burh\u00e1np\u00far was several times sacked by different invaders, and the\nF\u00e1r\u00fak\u00eds were driven to retreat to A's\u00edrgarh. They are said, however, to have\nexacted tribute\u2021 from the Gond country to the east as far as Garh\u00e1 Mandla,\nand A'dil Kh\u00e1n, the fifth of the dynasty, assumed the title of Sh\u00e1h-i-Jh\u00e1rkhand,\nor King of the Forests. They built the fine Jama Masjid and several other\nmosques and I'dg\u00e1hs in Burh\u00e1np\u00far. They are also said to have had fine palaces\nthere, but if so, none of them now remain.\n\nIn A.D. 1600 the Emperor Akbar annexed Nim\u00e1r and Kh\u00e1ndesh, capturing\nConquest of Akbar.

He induced many cultivators to immigrate from Hindust\u00e1n and the Deccan, and subsidised the principal chiefs of the surrounding hills to act as repressors of the hill-robbers. In the reign of Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n the city of Burh\u00e1np\u00far attained the height of its prosperity.\n\n\"It is probable,\" says Sir R. Temple in his Report on Nim\u00e1r, \"that during the Mohammadan period Nim\u00e1r reached the highest degree of prosperity it has ever known\u2014a prosperity much exceeding that which it enjoys now, even after forty years of British rule succeeding the general pacification of 1818. Though the territory was diversified by hills, rocks, and forests in many directions, still the plains and valleys were doubtless well cultivated. There was a government, which, though of foreign extraction, was yet strong and considerate. The towns were flourishing; there was a well-to-do non-agricultural population; there were large military and other establishments. Emperors, governors, and armies passed this way. There were good markets for agricultural produce; there were nobles and chiefs with their retinues to give encouragement to trade. The road-stages were thronged with traffic to and fro between the capitals of M\u00e1lw\u00e1 to the north and the Deccan to the south. The villages had strong and industrious communities; there was much artificial irrigation. In short, the face of the country was sprinkled over with public buildings or works of improvement, with caravanserais, with rest-houses and wells, with aqueducts, with tanks and reservoirs.\"\n\nIn A.D. 1670 the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s first invaded Kh\u00e1ndesh and plundered the country up to the gates of Burh\u00e1np\u00far.* During successive harvest seasons they returned, and in 1684 plundered the city itself immediately after Aur\u00e1ngzeb had left it with his rash and unwieldy army to subdue the Deccan. By 1690 they had overrun Northern Nim\u00e1r,\u2020 and in 1716 the chauth or fourth of all revenues, and the sardesmukht or ten per cent on revenue, were formally conceded to them by the Moghals.\n\nIn 1720\u2021 the Niz\u00e1m, A\u2019saf J\u00e1h, seized the government of the Deccan, confirming at first the alienations of revenue to the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. Disputes, however, continued between the Niz\u00e1m and the Peshw\u00e1, and Nim\u00e1r was often plundered by the latter, until, by the treaty of Munge Pattan, Northern Nim\u00e1r became the Peshw\u00e1\u2019s in A.D. 1740.\u00a7 B\u00e1i R\u00e1o Peshw\u00e1, however, died the same year at R\u00e9ver on the banks of the Narbad\u00e1, which he was just about to cross on a second invasion of Hindust\u00e1n. His cenotaph of variegated sandstone is still to be seen at R\u00e9ver. Eight years later his great rival A\u2019saf J\u00e1h died at Burh\u00e1np\u00far. In 1755 Southern Nim\u00e1r was also conceded to the Peshw\u00e1, except Burh\u00e1np\u00far and A\u2019stergarh, which, however, followed in 1760.||\n\nOne N\u00e1ro Ball\u00e1l Bhuskute became the Peshw\u00e1\u2019s manager in Nim\u00e1r, and the family afterwards attained great power as possessors of the hereditary offices of Sar Mandlo\u00ed and Sar K\u00e1n\u00fango. The Peshw\u00e1\u2019s administration seems to have done much to recover the district from the evils which had overtaken it during the struggle for power of the Moghal and the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s.\n\n* Grant Duff\u2019s History of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, vol. i. p. 248 (old Edn.)\n\u2020 Malcolm\u2019s Central India, vol. v. p. 61.\n\u2021 Grant Duff\u2019s History of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, vol. i. p. 464.\n\u00a7 Revenue Papers, Nim\u00e1r.\n|| Grant Duff\u2019s History, vol. ii. p. 125.\nIn A.D. 1778 the whole country now included in the district, excepting parganas K\u00e1n\u00e1pur and Beri\u00e1, reserved for the support of B\u00e1j\u00ed R\u00e1o, was transferred to Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja Sindi\u00e1.* Holkar at the same time acquired most of the rest of Pr\u00e1nt Nim\u00e1r.\n\nUp to A.D. 1800 the district was left in tolerable peace, but from that year till the close of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 and Pindh\u00e1ri wars in 1818 it was subjected to one unceasing round of invasion and plunder, still known as the \"time of trouble,\" inflicting a blow on its prosperity from which it has not yet nearly recovered. In 1801 and 1802 Yaswant R\u00e1o Holkar repeatedly devastated Sindi\u00e1's districts. In 1803 Sindi\u00e1 gathered a large army at Burh\u00e1npur, which grievously oppressed the people, and a failure of rain at the same time occurring, a terrible famine resulted, which was general throughout the Deccan. Wheat sold in Burh\u00e1npur for one seer per rupee, and many persons are said to have perished throughout the district. Many tracts date their relapse to desolation, from which they have never recovered, to this year.\n\nIn 1803 Southern Nim\u00e1r was taken by the British after the battle of Assaye,\u2020 but again restored to Sindi\u00e1. During the next fifteen years the district was regularly laid under contribution by Holkar's officers, by the Pindh\u00e1ris, and by Sindi\u00e1's own semi-rebellious local governors, particularly Yaswant R\u00e1o L\u00e1r, the castellan of \u00c1s\u00edgarh.\n\nThe Pindh\u00e1ris may in fact be said to have been at home in Nim\u00e1r. Their chief camps were in the dense wilds of Handi\u00e1, between the Narbad\u00e1 and the Vindhyan range. Chit\u00fa, the most daring of their leaders, usually frequented the jungles of Irw\u00e1s and L\u00edmanp\u00far due north of Nim\u00e1r. In 1817 the British troops attacked the Pindh\u00e1ris and drove them out of these haunts. Chit\u00fa himself, after fleeing to Pachmarhi and \u00c1s\u00edgarh, being again driven to the haunts he knew so well, was killed by a tiger in the S\u00edt\u00e1 Ban jungle of L\u00edmanp\u00far, a place still well known to British sportsmen as a sure find for tigers.\n\nThe last Peshw\u00e1, B\u00e1j\u00ed R\u00e1o, took refuge in Nim\u00e1r after his defeat in the Deccan, and surrendered to Sir John Malcolm in A.D. 1818. \u00c1s\u00edgarh, in which \u00c1p\u00e1 S\u00e1hib, the ex-r\u00e1j\u00e1 of N\u00e1gpur, had taken refuge, was reduced by the British troops in the same year, and unhappy Nim\u00e1r was at last allowed to be at rest.\n\nWe acquired parganas K\u00e1n\u00e1pur and Beri\u00e1 in 1818 as successors to the British administration. Peshw\u00e1. \u00c1s\u00edgarh and seventeen villages round it came under our management by treaty with Sindi\u00e1 in A.D. 1824-25. We found the country nearly depopulated. The tracts in the Narbad\u00e1 valley \"exhibited,\" says Colonel Smith, who took charge of them, \"nothing but one continued scene of desolation and ruin; all traces of former cultivation had ceased to be perceptible, and extensive tracts were observed overgrown with jungle; and with the exception of K\u00e1n\u00e1pur, not a dwelling nor an inhabitant was to be seen in any part of the country.\" Southern Nim\u00e1r, if not quite so bad as this, was yet in a sufficiently deplorable state. Measures were at once taken for the resuscitation of the district, and with the return of peace many of the cultivators, who had fled to\n\n* Revenue Papers, Nim\u00e1r.\n\u2020 Grant Duff's History, vol. iii. p. 244.\nquieter places, or joined the plundering bands, returned to their old places. For some years the Bhils were troublesome, but they were at length quieted, chiefly by the efforts of Captain (afterwards Sir James) Outram.\n\nAt first our revenue management was moderate and judicious, but soon the pressure placed on the local officers for increased Our early revenue management. revenue led to the deplorable system of farming the revenue to speculators on short leases. The district was greatly over-assessed; Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 rates were retained after the high prices of war times which enabled them to be paid had ceased. At the same time no roads were made, no tanks nor wells were dug, nothing was done to assist the enfeebled country. As a later district officer remarked, \"while exacting the rights of property, we forgot its duties.\" The farming system hopelessly broke down in 1845, and all the villages were again taken under direct management. The ancient hereditary patels (village headmen), whose \"watans\" or rights of property were as old as the Aryan settlement of the country, and had been fostered and defined by the Mohammadans, were reinstated in their proper position as heads and managers of their villages. The cultivators were also secured in the possession of their lands at a moderate revenue assessment. Advances of money for the extension of agriculture, digging wells, &c., were freely made. Many new tanks were constructed, and old ones repaired. The chief of these is the fine reservoir of Lachhora, near Mauza Beria, originally constructed by the Ghor\u00ed kings of M\u00e1nd\u00fa. Schools were everywhere established, and several dispensaries built. Rest-houses for travellers were made at every important village. The main road between Indore and Burh\u00e1npur was greatly improved, gh\u00e1ts being made, and several fine masonry bridges thrown over the principal rivers. The fiscal and police establishments were reorganised on an economical, but efficient scale. Sir R. Temple writes after inspecting the district in 1864: \"I have never yet seen any district in which so much has been done by the civil authorities alone for public works as Nim\u00e1r.\"\n\nThe names of Captains French, Evans, and Keatinge, to whom the district owes these benefits, will long be remembered as household words by the people. In 1852 a settlement for twenty years of the land revenue was commenced under the instructions of the Lieutenant-Governor of the North-Western Provinces, and during the succeeding years was completed for about half the district. The occurrence of the mutiny of 1857 interrupted this work, and for various reasons nothing more was done until 1866.\n\nThe district passed through considerable excitement and danger in 1857, though no actual disturbance occurred. \u00c1's\u00edrgarh and Burh\u00e1npur were garrisoned by a detachment of the Gwalior Contingent. Major Keatinge, then in charge of the district, collected a local force, and fortified the Kat\u00ed Gh\u00e1t\u00ed pass on the Southern Road, and also an old fort at Pun\u00e1s\u00e9, where the European families and treasure were secured. The \u00c1's\u00edrgarh troops were, however, quietly disarmed by a detachment of Bombay infantry. In 1858 T\u00e1t\u00e1 Topi\u00e1 traversed the district with a numerous body of starving followers. Considerable plundering occurred, and several police stations and public buildings, particularly those at P\u00edplod, Khandw\u00e1, and Mokalg\u00f3n, were burnt. The people of the district, however, showed no signs of disaffection during the mutiny.\nIn 1854 several parganas were transferred from Hoshangabad to Nimar, Recent changes in the district. and in 1860 Sindhi's parganas of Zainabad and M\u00e1njrod, with the city of Burhanpur, were obtained by exchange. At the same time all Sindhi's parganas which we had been managing for him since 1824 became British in full sovereignty.* In 1864 Nimar was attached to the Chief Commissionership of the Central Provinces, and became a district of the Narbad\u00e1 division, the head-quarters of which are at present at Betul, but are shortly to be transferred to Hoshangabad. The civil head-quarters of the district used to be at Mandleswar, which, as the district is now constituted, is inconveniently situated for the greater part of the population. Khandwa, in the heart of Nimar and on the railway line, was therefore constituted the new civil station. Subsequently, in 1867, three parganas in the north-west corner of the district\u2014Kasr\u00fawad, Dharg\u00f3n, and Barw\u00e1\u2014were transferred, in exchange for some territory in the Deccan, to the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja Holkar. Mandleswar was also included in this transfer.\n\nSince Nimar has been attached to the Central Provinces the settlement of the land revenue has been resumed and completed. Completion of the land revenue settlement. From the majority of the records having been destroyed during the mutiny, it was found necessary to re-measure the whole of the previously-settled parts and prepare the records afresh. The whole district is now settled for twenty years from 1867-68. All proprietary rights have been inquired into and determined. Every cultivator of any standing has been secured in the proprietorship of his holding; while the hereditary patels have been fully restored to their ancient rights, by being constituted the responsible managers of these small properties, with a small percentage on the assessment as remuneration for their trouble and risk in collecting the revenue. They have also been constituted sole proprietors of the waste land, and of land held by tenants settled on it by themselves, subject only to the right of the proprietary cultivators to add to their holdings by taking up additional unoccupied waste. The land revenue payable under the new settlement is Rs. 1,71,408, exclusive of alienations, which are very large in this district. This assessment is at the rate of ten annas one pie (one shilling and three pence) per acre of cultivated land.\n\nOther revenues. In addition to the receipts from land the following revenues were collected in 1868-69:\n\n| Revenue          | Amount |\n|------------------|--------|\n| Excise           | Rs. 93,116 |\n| Forest revenue   | Rs. 9,650 |\n| Stamps           | Rs. 69,823 |\n| Assessed taxes   | Rs. 15,672 |\n\nTotal......Rs. 1,88,261\n\nor with land revenue, Rs. 3,59,669 (\u00a335,967). This taxation falls at the rate of one rupee and fourteen annas (three shillings and nine pence) on each unit of the population. In addition to this, close on a lakh of rupees (\u00a310,000), or about one shilling per unit of the population, is raised for local purposes.\n\nThe cost of the regular administration for the year 1867-68 amounted to Rs. 1,29,988 (\u00a312,998). The district is now divided into three subdivisions, each of which is\n\n* Aitchison's Treaties, vol iv. p. 271.\nin charge of a Tahsild\u00e1r, or sub-collector of revenue, who is also usually vested with petty civil and criminal jurisdiction within his subdivision. The Deputy Commissioner and other civil officers reside at Khandw\u00e1, and there is usually an Assistant Commissioner at Burh\u00e1npur. The garrison of A\u015b\u00edrgarh consists of two companies of Europeans and a wing of Native infantry. There are no regular artillery in the fort. The police force consists of 390 constables of all ranks, and has police station-houses at Khandw\u00e1, Burh\u00e1npur, A\u015b\u00edrgarh, Dh\u00e1ngon, P\u00edplod, and Mund\u00ed, and twenty-three outposts distributed through the district. The larger towns are guarded by municipal police.\n\nThere is now one government school, English or Vernacular, to every ten villages, and there is one scholar in every seventy-nine resident souls of the population\u2014a result much above the average of other parts of India.\n\nThere are three dispensaries maintained partly by State grants, and partly by private subscriptions\u2014one at Khandw\u00e1, and two at Burh\u00e1npur. There are six district post-offices, besides the imperial offices at Burh\u00e1npur and Khandw\u00e1.\n\nThe Great Indian Peninsula Railway traverses the district throughout. The Communications. stations are\u2014L\u00e1l B\u00e9gh, for Burh\u00e1npur (distant two miles, with a travellers\u2019 bungalow at the station); Ch\u00e1ndn\u00ed, for A\u015b\u00edrgarh (distant eight miles); Dongarg\u00e1oon, for Pandh\u00e1n\u00e1; Khandw\u00e1, the civil station; J\u00e1lwar, a passing station; and B\u00edr, for Mund\u00ed. At present (1869) the line is opened only as far as B\u00edr, but it is hoped that communication will be established throughout the valley early in 1870. The principal road in the district is that between Khandw\u00e1 and Indore. It carries a very large traffic in opium, cotton, &c., and has recently been put in thorough repair; there are travellers\u2019 bungalows and rest-houses at easy stages. A new road between Khandw\u00e1 and the Narbad\u00e1 by a better line, in supersession of this one, is under consideration. The other district roads are of little importance as through trade routes. The continuation of the old Deccan road by A\u015b\u00edrgarh, Burh\u00e1npur, and Ichh\u00e1p\u00far, now superseded by the railroad, is still in tolerable repair, but the staging bungalows have been closed.\n\nThe road towards Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d for Jabalp\u00far runs easterly up the valley from Khandw\u00e1. There are no staging bungalows along this line, which was never metalled or thoroughly bridged, and which is now to a great extent superseded by the railway, in respect to all but local communication. The other roads are fair-weather tracks kept in decent repair. The principal are, a road passing east and west through the northern part of the district by Gh\u00eds\u00far, Mund\u00ed, and Pun\u00e1s\u00e1, to Barw\u00e1i; another from Khandw\u00e1 running south to the important town of Borg\u00e1oon; and one from Burh\u00e1npur penetrating the Upper Tapt\u00ed valley as far as G\u00e1ngr\u00e1 in Ber\u00e1r, much used by Banj\u00e1ra carriers, and for the export of forest produce.\n\nThe population of Nim\u00e1r numbers 190,440 souls, at the rate of seventy to the square mile. It is much denser, however, in the really inhabited parts of the district. Twenty-eight per cent only of the people are recorded as agricultural occupants of land, though many others are more or less engaged in its cultivation as temporary labourers, &c. The population has increased by fifty-two per cent since 1833, the area under the plough having also increased by seventeen per cent since 1852, before which no data are available for comparison.\nOf the whole population, 34,805 are aboriginal Bhils, Kurk\u00fas, &c. There are scarcely any Gonds in Nim\u00e1r. The Kurk\u00fas are the same tribe that occupies the G\u00e1walgarh hills of Ber\u00e1r and K\u00e1l\u00edbh\u00edt in Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d, and whose manners and customs have been ably described in Mr. Elliott\u2019s Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d Settlement Report. The Bhils, as a distinct tribe, are found chiefly in the block of hills surrounding the fortress of A\u2019\u00e1rgarh. Many of them were converted to Mohammedanism during the rule of Aurangzeb over the Deccan, but their adherence to this faith is now confined to the performance of the most elementary rites, and their worship is almost entirely\u2014that of their women especially\u2014the old aboriginal fetichism. Until of late years they were a troublesome set of robbers, and are still a dissipated and idle race. They are improving however, and a good many of them have become possessed of cattle, and have settled down to regular cultivation. Nearly every village in Nim\u00e1r has a family of Bhils, who are its hereditary watchmen.\n\nThe Hind\u00fa immigrants number 118,508 souls, and the Musalm\u00e1ns 18,279. Dhers, M\u00e1ngs, and other outcaste tribes amount to 18,446, and there are 402 Europeans, Eurasians, and members of other foreign races. The best cultivators are the Kunb\u00eds, Gujars, M\u00e1l\u00eds, and R\u00e9jputs. Br\u00e1hmans are numerous (6,983), but do not engage much in agriculture. They are chiefly from the Deccan, and fill nearly all the public offices. The common language of Nim\u00e1r is a dialect composed of Hindi and Mar\u00e1thi, with a good many Persian words. It is written in a peculiar current Dev\u00e1n\u00e1gari character.\n\nThe soil of Nim\u00e1r is chiefly formed from the decomposition of the underlying trap-rock. The process may still be seen going on wherever railway cuttings, &c., have laid bare the previously unexposed rock. Partially decomposed trap is called muram, and is used for metalling roads, but in a short time it becomes wholly decomposed, and is then painfully recognised by travellers as their old enemy\u2014the black cotton soil. In the course of ages this soil has got washed down by the floods to the lowest levels along the banks of the numerous streams, which intersect the country in every direction, and has been enriched by constant admixture of vegetable mould. Thus we find the quality of the soil gradually deteriorating as we leave the river-banks and reach higher ground, till on the ridges we meet with the bare trap which underlies all.\n\nThough of course varying by infinitely gradual shades of quality, for convenience sake the soil of Nim\u00e1r has been roughly divided by the people (a division also adopted in revenue classification) into four classes:\n\n1. Gatt\u00e1\u2014the rich black mould along rivers, which will yield two crops each year without irrigation.\n\n2. Goh\u00e1l\u00ed\u2014a black soil found a little higher up, which will yield a rab\u00ed crop (wheat, &c.) without irrigation.\n\n3. M\u00e1l\u2014a brown soil, stiffer and less deep than the preceding, which will not in ordinary seasons carry a rab\u00ed crop unirrigated, but yields the best khar\u00edf (rain) crops. When this soil is underlaid by a substratum of muram to carry off the excess of moisture, it forms an admirable soil for the production of cotton, and it is the prevailing soil throughout Nim\u00e1r.\n\n4. Khard\u00e1\u2014the highest and lightest of all, either light brown or red, often strewn with trap boulders, and mixed with kankar (nodular limestone) and gravel, yields only rain crops, and is apt to fail when the rains are light.\nThe first class produces rice, s\u00e1nw\u00e9, and bh\u00e1dl\u00ed (inferior species of rice) as a rain crop; and wheat, gram, mas\u00far, &c., in the r\u00e1b\u00ed harvest. The second yields wheat, gram, and all cold-weather crops, also jaw\u00e1r\u00ed and cotton in rotation. The third is principally sown with jaw\u00e1r\u00ed, the staple article of food in the district, also cotton, t\u00fbr, and oil-seeds as a rotation, and wheat, &c., with irrigation. The fourth yields the poorer sorts of jaw\u00e1r\u00ed and inferior cotton, also b\u00e1jr\u00e9, kutk\u00ee, til, &c. There is very little land of the first two classes, and consequently the autumn or monsoon harvest is much the most important one in Nim\u00e1r. All these soils are manured, but chiefly the better classes, the poorer being treated to a periodical fallow instead. Little manure is wasted in Nim\u00e1r. Irrigation is also a good deal practised both from wells, for which the closeness of the water-bearing strata to the surface in many places is favourable, and from dams across the smaller streams, on the system which appears to have been carried on by the Path\u00e1n and Moghal conquerors of India, wherever they obtained power. The irrigated crops are opium, tobacco, g\u00e1nj\u00e9 (cannabis sativa), wheat, gram, sugarcane, chillies, and garden stuffs. Some tolerably good grasses are grown about \u00c1\u2019s\u00edrgarh. Altogether the Nim\u00e1r cultivator is both skilful and industrious, understanding well the value of manure, irrigation, and the rotation of crops, and thus he is enabled, notwithstanding a much inferior soil, both to raise heavier crops, and to pay a higher land revenue, without difficulty, than his neighbours who occupy the more fertile parts higher up the Narb\u00e1d\u00e1 valley. There is a large number of very fine mango and mhowa trees all over Nim\u00e1r, the produce of which adds not a little to the wealth of the landholding classes.\n\nThe great peculiarity of the agriculture of Nim\u00e1r is the preponderance of the monsoon (autumn) harvest over the spring harvest. The quantity of land fitted to grow spring crops of wheat, gram, &c., without irrigation is very limited, and irrigation has not as yet extended sufficiently to allow the bulk of the cultivators to raise a spring crop by it. Thus for a considerable part of the year many of the cultivators are idle, or employ themselves and their farm-cattle in the carrying-trade. A heavy plough called \u201cn\u00e1g\u00e1r\u201d is used in breaking up waste land, but thereafter the plough is seldom used, unless the field gets overrun with the k\u00e1ra grass, when it receives a ploughing and fallow. The land is usually prepared for sowing by the bakhar instead. This is a sort of large bullock-hoe, which pares the surface of the land for four or five inches, which is considered sufficient depth of working for the rain-crops. Sowing is performed with a drill-plough of two or three barrels (dosan or t\u00edfan), and the seed is afterwards fielded up by the bakhar. Garden crops are sown by hand; weeding is done with a smaller bullock-hoe called \u201ckolp\u00e1,\u201d or by hand. The staple crops are cut and harvested in November and December, and by the end of January the cultivator is again idle until towards the end of May.\n\nA fine breed of cattle is produced in Nim\u00e1r, especially in the western parts of the old Pr\u00e1nt. The cattle bred there are called \u201cp\u00e1nch mahalas,\u201d and sometimes sell for Rs. 300 and Rs. 400 a pair. Those now produced in the modern district are not so large and showy, and fetch much lower prices, Rs. 60 to Rs. 150 being a fair price for a pair of plough-oxen. Few are now exported, the production being barely sufficient for the local demand in extending cultivation, &c.\n\nNim\u00e1r produces annually about 280,000 quarters of food-grain, which is some 2,000,000 quarters short of the requirements of its population. The deficit is supplied chiefly\nby importation of wheat from Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d. Nor does the soil yield any other article which is not locally consumed, excepting a little cotton and a small amount of forest produce. The district imports altogether about twenty l\u00f3khas of rupees (\u00a3200,000) worth of goods. Its exports are almost entirely composed of the fine gold-embroidered cloth-fabrics made at Burh\u00e1npur. This industry has been described in the article on Burh\u00e1npur. There is a very large through traffic in Nim\u00e1r, some 60,000 tons being carried every year. The Railway and other public works also require much labour and carriage. This gives employment to a large number of persons and cattle, so that labour and carriage of every description are extremely dear. So much of the food-supply having to be imported, the price of grain is also much higher than in other districts of the Central Provinces; wheat selling for eleven or twelve seers per rupee, while the rate is nineteen or twenty seers in Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d. This inequality will be to some extent removed when the Railway penetrates the Upper Narbad\u00e1 valley. The ordinary b\u00e1z\u00e1r grain-measure is the \"chauki,\" which holds four seers of eighty tol\u00e1s (or two lbs.) each. Sixteen chaukfs make a maund, and twelve maunds a mani. Weekly b\u00e1zars are held in twenty-four of the principal towns, and three large annual fairs combined with religious gathering are held, viz. at Omk\u00e1r M\u00e1ndh\u00e1t\u00e1 in October, Sing\u00e1j\u00ed in September, besides several other minor annual fairs. At these fairs English piece and other goods, country cloth and copper vessels, and cattle form the chief articles of traffic.\n\nOf the extensive forest lands in this district the only tract reserved by Government is the Pun\u00e1s\u00e1 forest, which stretches over an area of about one hundred and twenty square miles, lying in a strip along the southern bank of the Narbad\u00e1, and containing a very fine growth of teak saplings. The south-eastern corner of the district in the Tapt\u00ed valley is also covered with a promising young forest of teak and other valuable timber trees. It is a continuation of the K\u00e1l\u00edbh\u00edt forest in Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d, and exhibits much the same character: its area may be four hundred square miles. Pargana Ch\u00e1ndgarh, north of the Narbad\u00e1, also contains a promising growth of young teak and some fine timber of other kinds. Besides these forest tracts proper, there is much land overspread by low jungle; there are also extensive waste tracts, culturable and unculturable.\n\nThe principal timber trees are the teak (*tectona grandis*), s\u00e9j (*terminalia tomentosa*), and the anjan (*hardwickia binata*). The latter is the most abundant timber tree now in the district.\n\nTeak of very large girth does not exist, but s\u00e9j and anjan of great size may be found in the forest along the Narbad\u00e1. The Nim\u00e1r forests yield all the usual produce in gums, lac, bark, and the like; but their chief product is the gum of the dh\u00e1ur\u00e9 tree (*conocarpus latifolia*), which is exported to be converted into the gum arabic of trade. It is a very pure and excellent gum, and there are large forests of this tree north of the Narbad\u00e1. The trade has as yet been but little-developed. Bees' wax is also very plentiful in the same tract, many of the precipitous hill-sides in the Ch\u00e1ndgarh pargana being perfectly covered with bees' nests, the honey of which is of excellent quality; but neither honey nor wax are exported to any extent.\n\nThe waste lands available for sale or lease amount to some 418,000 acres. Culturable wastes. They are now in course of being surveyed in convenient blocks, and plans and descriptions of them will shortly be available. They, however, offer small attractions at present to the European settler, being mostly remotely situated, and having an extremely\nunhealthy climate. They comprise the naturally richest lands in the district, much of them consisting of the finest black soil, capable of growing anything. In many places, too, works of irrigation might be easily constructed. The upset price of these waste lands, free of all revenue demand, is at present Rs. 2-8 (five shillings) per acre. They may also be leased, subject to the payment of land tax, on very favourable terms.\n\nThe climate of the open parts of Nim\u00e1r is on the whole good, though the heat is very fierce in the Narbad\u00e1 and Tapt\u00ed valleys during April and May. Central Nim\u00e1r does not suffer excessive heat in summer, while during the monsoon months the air is cool and clear, even during the lulls which are usually so unpleasant in other districts of such small elevation above the sea. The average rainfall is thirty-five inches, of which twenty-eight fall between June and October. Fevers are rather prevalent about the close of the monsoon in the lower parts of the district, and epidemic cholera used to be an almost annual scourge of the district. But since the stoppage in 1864 of the great religious gatherings of pilgrims in the Upper Narbad\u00e1 valley during the hot season, cholera has only once visited the district. The jungle parts of Nim\u00e1r are extremely malarious from July to December, and are consequently inhabited only by aboriginal tribes.\n\nNim\u00e1r offers great attractions to the sportsman. Tigers are numerous, and are easily got along most of the rivers in the hot season. Cattle and game being easily procurable by them, the Nim\u00e1r tigers seldom become regular man-eaters. Bears, panthers, and wolves are also numerous in many parts. The Upper Tapt\u00ed valley is a favourite haunt of the bison (*bos frontalis*). S\u00e1mbar and spotted-deer are very numerous in some parts, and nilg\u00e1i and wild hogs are plentiful throughout the district. There are very few antelope, as little of the district consists of the open plains which they frequent. Of small game, the painted partridge, quail, hares, and pea-fowl are the chief. Jungle-fowl are found in the Tapt\u00ed valley. Sheets of water being rare, wild-fowl and snipe are unusually scarce. The larger rivers yield excellent fish. Several parties of sportsmen have lately run up from Bombay to enjoy a month\u2019s shooting in Nim\u00e1r, and there are few places in India at once so accessible, and affording so promising a field for such excursions. A party has only to bring tents and horses to the L\u00e1l B\u00e1gh railway station, where plenty of cart-carriage is always available for hire, and march fifteen or twenty miles up the Mohn\u00e1 valley, south-east of Burh\u00e1npur, to be in the centre of a very sportsman\u2019s paradise. It is, however, no use to attempt it earlier than March, when the jungle grass gets burnt.\n\nThe Bengal Revenue Survey is now surveying the district, and a map of the northern section will be ready almost immediately. The complete map of the district may be looked for about the close of 1870. In the meantime there are good MS. maps in the district offices; and the Indian atlas sheets No. 8 (R\u00e1jput\u00e1n\u00e1), and No. 54 (G\u00e1walgarh), give a tolerably correct idea of the district. The map published of the Central Provinces is very incorrect as regards this district, but a new edition is shortly expected. Major Keatinge\u2019s litographed map of Nim\u00e1r is on the whole the best of those published as yet, but is difficult to procure.\n\nThe places of main interest in the district are Burh\u00e1npur, \u00c1\u015birgarh, Khandw\u00e1, R\u00e9ver, and Omk\u00e1r M\u00e1ndh\u00e1t\u00e1, and on these separate articles will be found, also one on the Tapt\u00ed river.\nNUGU'R\u2014The principal village of the estate of the same name, in the Upper God\u00e1var\u00ed district. The agent of the chief resides here. The district post line passes through the place, and there is a small bungalow for travellers. The water-supply is from a tank close to the village.\n\nNUHTA'\u2014A village in the Damoh district, on the main road to Jabalp\u00far, near the confluence of the Guraiy\u00e1 and the Bairm\u00e1 rivers. The ruins of some Jain temples in the neighbourhood are well worth seeing. A branch dispensary and a police station are located here, and there is an encamping-ground for troops outside the village.\n\nO\n\nOMKA'R MA'NDHA'TA'\u2014See \"M\u00e1ndh\u00e1t\u00e1.\"\n\nP\n\nPACHMARHI'\u2014A chiefship in the Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d district, consisting of twenty-four villages, in the very heart of the Mah\u00e1deo hill-group. It contains much beautiful sal timber, and the chief has arranged for its being preserved by the Government Forest department. The zamind\u00e1r, who is a Kurk\u00fa by caste, is the principal of the Bhop\u00e1s, or hereditary guardians of the temple on the Mah\u00e1deo hills, and receives Rs. 750 per annum in lieu of pilgrim tax, against which is debited a quit-rent of Rs. 25 per annum on his estate.\n\nPACHMARHI'\u2014A plateau in the Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d district, round which the Chaur\u00e1deo J\u00e1t\u00e9 Pah\u00e1r and Dh\u00fapgarh hills stand sentinel; it is about 3,500 feet high, or 2,500 feet above the plain in which Sol\u00e1gpur lies; and its average temperature is probably from seven to ten degrees lower than that of the valley. It is not free from fever, and in the rains the violence of the downfall and the growth of the jungle would be disadvantages; but when the roads of approach to it are finished, and houses built, the residents of the valley will be able to escape from heat and glare to one of the greenest, softest, and most lovely of sanitaria that exist in India. There are some interesting ancient temples at Pachmarhi.\n\nPADMAPU'R\u2014Vide Chandrap\u00far article.\n\nPAGA'RA'\u2014A zamind\u00e1r\u00ed or chiefship, situated in the Mah\u00e1deo hills, in the Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d district. It originally comprised only ten villages. In A.D. 1820 four villages from an estate in Prat\u00e1pgarh were added, making a total of fourteen villages. The chief is one of the Bhop\u00e1s, or hereditary guardians of the places of pilgrimage on the Mah\u00e1deo hills.\n\nPAHA'R SIRGIRA'\u2014An old Gond chiefship, now attached to the Sambalp\u00far district. Tradition says that the family originally came from Mandla some seven hundred years ago, and settled at P\u00e1tkoland\u00e1 near Bhedan; in fact the chiefs of Pah\u00e1r Sirgir\u00e1, Bhedan, and P\u00e1tkoland\u00e1 are sprung from the same stock. The estate is situated some fifteen miles due west of the town of Sambalp\u00far, and consists of six villages, with an area of some forty miles, about three-fifths of which are cultivated. The population is put down at 1,056 souls, chiefly belonging to agricultural tribes, viz. Kolt\u00e1s, Gonds, and S\u00e1onr\u00e1\u00eds. Rice is the staple product, and great quantities of sugarcane are also grown. The principal village is Pah\u00e1r Sirgir\u00e1, which has a population of 626 souls. There is a good school where ninety-three pupils are receiving instruction.\n\nPALASGA'ON\u2014An extremely wild estate in the Bhand\u00e1ra district, consisting of fourteen villages, situated in the hilly tracts seven miles east of the\nextensive Naweg\u00e1on lake. It has an area of 134 square miles, of which less than two square miles are under cultivation. The population amounts to 794 souls only. The present chief is a Halb\u00e1 by caste, and the majority of the residents belong to the same class. The forests on the estate yield some valuable timber of the reserved kinds, and are said to contain herds of wild buffalo and bison.\n\nPALASGA'ON\u2014A village in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, on the Andh\u00e1r\u00ed river, twelve miles south-east of Chim\u00far, and possessing a very fine irrigation-reservoir.\n\nPALASGARH\u2014A hilly estate (zam\u00edn\u00e9d\u00e1ri) in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, situated twenty miles north-north-east of Wair\u00e1g\u00e1rh, and containing fifty-one villages. It has the remains of a hill-fort, which, after the conquest of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1, was attacked and occupied by the Mar\u00fat\u00e1s. The chiefship was formerly held by a Gond prince of the Wair\u00e1g\u00e1rh family, and now belongs to a R\u00e1j-Gond of the Saigam section.\n\nPALKHERA\u2014A small zam\u00edn\u00e9d\u00e1ri or chiefship in the Bhand\u00e1ra district, situated near the north-east boundary of the S\u00e1ngarh\u00ed pargana, about three miles from the source of the Pangol\u00ed, and traversed by the main road from K\u00e1mth\u00e1 to S\u00e1kolf\u00ed. A good deal of sugarcane is grown on the estate, and there are some patches of s\u00e1l and bjes\u00e1l in the forests. The area amounts to fifty square miles, of which about one-fourth is under cultivation. There are altogether twelve villages, the principal being Palkher\u00e1 and Gir\u00e1ri. Until 1856 the estate was a dependency of K\u00e1mth\u00e1. The chief and most of the inhabitants belong to the Kunbf caste.\n\nPA'MGARH\u2014An insignificant village in the Bil\u00e1sp\u00far district, on the road to Seor\u00edn\u00e1r\u00e1n, twenty miles east of Bil\u00e1sp\u00far. In the early history of Ratanp\u00far the fort of P\u00e1mgarh occupies a prominent position as a formidable stronghold. The remains of a high earthwork, covering a large area, and enclosing a tank, still exist in a partially complete condition.\n\nPA'NA'BA'RAS\u2014A zam\u00edn\u00e9d\u00e1ri in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, situated eighty miles east-north-east of Wair\u00e1g\u00e1rh. It has now very little cultivated land, but it is stated that at one time 360 villages dotted its valleys and hill-sides. The whole country is mountainous, and is covered with forests, in which are thousands of noble teak trees. From these forests was supplied the teak used in the construction of the N\u00e1gp\u00far palace, the K\u00e1mth\u00ed barracks, and the Residency at S\u00edt\u00e1bald\u00ed; but of late years the timber has been much thinned by timber contractors. Wild arrowroot (tikh\u00far) grows abundantly in the valleys, and large quantities of wax and honey are obtained in the hills. The climate is moist and cool, even in the summer months, so much so that natives of P\u00e1n\u00e1b\u00e1ras feel the heat oppressive when at Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1. Included in P\u00e1n\u00e1b\u00e1ras is a dependent zam\u00edn\u00e9d\u00e1ri called A'undhf\u00ed. The chief of P\u00e1n\u00e1b\u00e1ras is the first in position of the Wair\u00e1g\u00e1rh zam\u00edn\u00e9d\u00e1rs.\n\nPA'NA'BA'RAS\u2014A forest in the chiefship of the same name in the southeastern parts of the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, containing a large quantity of fine teak timber. In the words of the Conservator, who explored the country in the season of 1866, \"there is more teak collected here within a few square miles than during six years' exploration I have seen in all the rest of the Central Provinces together.\" The entire zam\u00edn\u00e9d\u00e1ri estate is described as lying in the centre of the dense belt of jungle which skirts the left bank of the Waingang\u00e1 river from its source in the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1 range to its junction with the Wardh\u00e1, where the joint\nstream is known as the Pranhita. This whole area is covered with scrub jungle, consisting principally of \u00e3in, dh\u00e3ur\u00e3, kaw\u00e3, kumbh\u00e3, and other timber trees common to the Province; but the teak is confined to the block of hills in the south-east corner and along the streams below them, and covers an area of about twenty-five square miles, the boundary of which has been cleared and demarcated by the Forest department. No complete enumeration of the trees fit for felling has yet taken place, but the measurement, carried out on a few acres, gives on an average for each acre fifteen logs of from four to eight feet in girth, and about thirty feet in length, many of the trees being forty feet up to the first branch. In places single trees measured twelve feet in girth by fifty feet in length, $13'8'' \\times 45', 12'5'' \\times 35', 10'3'' \\times 40', 11' \\times 60'$, and so on, some of them containing from 150 to 200 cubic feet of timber. The system of d\u00e3hya cultivation seems to be unknown in this wild region. The inhabitants are Gonds. A temporary agreement has been entered into with the chief for working the forest on behalf of Government, but beyond collecting a number of logs lying in the forest and cut in former years, little has been done in the shape of felling operations.\n\nPA'NA'GAR\u2014A growing town in the Jabalpur district, distant nine miles and a quarter from Jabalpur on the Northern Road, and containing 1,303 houses, with a population of 4,063 people. The majority of the inhabitants are agriculturists. In the neighbourhood are several iron mines; and iron is the principal article of trade.\n\nPANCHAMNAGAR\u2014A village in the Damoh district, situated on rising ground on the bank of the river Bi\u00e3s, twenty-four miles north-west of Damoh. From the number of ruined houses and stone enclosures around and about the place it would appear to have been once much larger than it is now. The population amounts to 2,024 souls according to the census of 1866, and the village is principally known as the seat of paper manufactures. The paper produced here has a considerable reputation, and sells for from three to eight rupees per \"gaddi\" of ten quires. There are here a police station-house and a village school.\n\nPA'NDA'TARA'TI\u2014A village in the Bilaspur district, about fifty miles west of Bilaspur, near the foot of the Maikal range, which separates the Mandla highlands from the Chhattisgarh plateau. It is said to be a very ancient town, and heaps of buried debris are often come upon in making excavations in the neighbourhood. It has now a considerable trade, being visited annually by carriers from Jabalpur, who come for the grain of the country. The population amounts to about 5,000 souls, and includes several traders, shopkeepers, goldsmiths, and weavers. The weekly market held here is the largest in the Pandari\u00e3 chiefship. The houses are mostly of the meanest description.\n\nPANDALPU'R\u2014A village near Rehl\u00e3 in the S\u00e3gar district. A well-known fair is held here in November and December, chiefly for religious purposes; and there is a temple in the village dedicated to Pandharin\u00e3th.\n\nPANDARIA'\u2014A chiefship in the Bilaspur district. This may be called a sister estate to Kaward\u00e3, which it adjoins. They possess physical features of a similar character, one-half of either chiefship being covered with hills, while the other half is level plain, studded with villages, and extensively cultivated. A great portion of the level area consists of first-class black soil, and, owing to the gently undulating character of the surface, is largely devoted to cotton. Wheat, gram, and other rabi crops are also extensively grown, and there is a considerable acreage under sugarcane. The estate consists of 292 villages, and covers an area of 486 square miles.\nIt is one of the oldest of the Chhattisgarh chiefships, and is said to have been conferred on an ancestor of the present holder, a R\u00e9j-Gond, some three hundred years ago by the Gond R\u00e9j\u00e1 of Garh\u00e1 Mandla.\n\nPANDHA'NA'\u2014A market-town and trading mart in the district of Nim\u00e1r, ten miles south-west of Khandw\u00e1, with a population of 2,500 souls. A weekly market is held here on Tuesdays, and the place is a great centre of trade in grain, forest produce, and cloth.\n\nPA'NDHURNA'\u2014A municipal town in the Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 district, situated about fifty-eight miles south-west of Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1, on the main road from Betul to N\u00e1gpur. The villages of Bamn\u00ed and S\u00e1warg\u00e1on adjoin P\u00e1ndhurn\u00e1, and the three united form one town, with a population of 5,084 souls, mostly engaged in agriculture. The soil in the neighbourhood is rich, and produces a good deal of cotton. There are here a police station-house, a travellers' bungalow, a sar\u00e1\u00ed, and a government school.\n\nPARASGA'ON\u2014A small estate, consisting of two villages, situated nine miles south-east of S\u00fakolfi in the Bhand\u00e1ra district. The area is 1,834 acres, of which 780 only are cultivated. The inhabitants number 403 souls. The chief is a R\u00e9jput, but the estate is under mortgage, and he lives on an allowance from his creditor. The holding only differs in name from an ordinary m\u00e1lguz\u00e1ri tenure.\n\nPARASWA'RA'\u2014The chief town in the highland portion of the B\u00e1li\u00e1gh\u00e1t district. It is situated in the centre of a well-cultivated plain, the boundaries of which are yearly extending with the rapid increase of population. A n\u00e1ib tahsild\u00e1r and police station-house are located here.\n\nPARJAKOT\u2014A chiefship in the extreme north-west portion of Bastar, with an area of five hundred square miles, and fifty villages.\n\nPARNASALA'\u2014A village on the God\u00e1var\u00ed, about six miles from Dumagudem, in the Upper God\u00e1var\u00ed district. There is a temple here, which is connected with those at Bhadr\u00e1challam, and is supported from the same grant. But this place is chiefly noted as being the point at which most of the timber felled in the forests of Bastar is collected before being finally bought up and exported to the Coast. Timber merchants from R\u00e9j\u00e1m\u00e1ndri, Ellore, and Masulipatam collect here, and make their purchases from the local agents or traders. The population of four hundred souls consists chiefly of Telingas.\n\nPARPORI'\u2014A chiefship attached to the R\u00e9jp\u00far district, the greater part of which lies to the west of the Dhamd\u00e1 pargana. Its area is rich and well cultivated, and comprises thirty-five villages. The chief is by caste a Gond.\n\nPARSEONI'\u2014A town in the N\u00e1gpur district, situated in the Do\u00e1b of the Kanh\u00e1n and the Pench, about eighteen miles from N\u00e1gpur. The population amounts to about 4,000 souls. A weekly market is held here, which supplies the whole of the wild hill-tracts of Bheogarh. There are two very fine temples in the town. The only manufactures are coarse cloth and some tolerable pottery. P\u00e1n (betel-leaf) is a good deal cultivated in the neighbourhood.\n\nPATAN\u2014A town in the Jabalp\u00far district, situated twenty-one miles to the north-west of Jabalp\u00far. It consists of 669 houses, and has a population of 2,513 souls. The only trade is in grain. There are a government school and a police post here.\nPA'TANSA'ONGI'\u2014A town in the N\u00e1gp\u00far district, situated on the left bank of the Kol\u00e1r near its junction with the Chandrabh\u00e1g\u00e1, fourteen miles from N\u00e1gp\u00far. The plain around is very fertile, and considerably elevated above the bed of the river. The population numbers nearly 5,000 souls. Cotton stuffs are manufactured here, and exported to a considerable extent. Tobacco is also much cultivated and exported. The chief improvements of late in the town have been the building of a good market-place and a sar\u00e1\u00ed, and the construction of metalled roads and streets. The place is of considerable antiquity. Traditions in the \"Swasth\u00e1nik\" (Gond r\u00e9j\u00e1s') family tell how in A.D. 1742, in the struggle between Wal\u00ed Sh\u00e1h and the legitimate princes, 12,000 men were massacred by the victorious party in and around the now-ruined fort. It continued to be the station of a troop of horse up to the decease of the late r\u00e9j\u00e1. Until lately it was the head-quarters of a tahsil.\n\nPATERA'\u2014A village in the Damoh district, situated eighteen miles northeast of Damoh, and containing a population of 2,120 souls. The local industries are brass-working and the grain-trade. A good market is held here.\n\nPATHARIA'\u2014A considerable village in the Damoh district, situated twenty-four miles west of Damoh, on a low range of trap hills, which is crossed here by the main road between Jabalp\u00far and S\u00e1g\u00e1r. Under the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s an \u00c1mil lived here, and there are still several respectable Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 families in the town. From the great quantity of hewn stone lying about in all directions, the place would seem to have been once much larger than it is now. There are here a large government school, a dispensary, a police-station, and a travellers' bungalow.\n\nPAT'KOLAND\u00c1'\u2014This is a small but very ancient chiefship, now attached to the Sambalp\u00far district. It is situated about thirty-five miles to the southwest of Sambalp\u00far, between the two chiefships of Barp\u00e1l\u00ed and Bhedan, and consists of six villages. The area is not more than eight square miles, the whole of which is under cultivation. The population amounts to 1,095 souls, chiefly belonging to the agricultural classes, viz. Kolt\u00e1s, Gonds, and S\u00e1onr\u00e1s. The chief product is rice. The principal village is P\u00e1tkoland\u00e1', which has a population of 635 souls. The occupant family is Gond.\n\nPAT'NA'\u2014This was formerly the most important of all the Native States attached to the Sambalp\u00far district, and the head of a cluster of States known as the eighteen Garhj\u00e1ts. It lies between 82\u00b0 45' and 83\u00b0 40' of east longitude, and between 20\u00b0 5' and 21\u00b0 of north latitude; and is bounded on the north by the Bor\u00e1s\u00e1mb\u00e1r zam\u00edn'd\u00e1ri of the Sambalp\u00far district, on the east by the feudatory state of Sonp\u00far, on the west by the zam\u00edn'd\u00e1ri of Khari\u00e1r, belonging to the R\u00e1jp\u00far district, and on the south by the feudatory state of K\u00e1l\u00e1hand\u00ed. The average length is about fifty miles long by as many broad, giving an area of some 2,500 square miles. The country is an undulating plain, rugged and isolated, with hill-ranges rising in various directions,\u2014a lofty irregular range forming a natural boundary to the north. The soil is for the most part light and sandy. About two-thirds of the whole area are under cultivation, the rest being for the most part dense jungle. Indeed for some thirty miles round the town of P\u00e1t'n\u00e1 there is a vast forest of s\u00e1l, s\u00e1j, b\u00edjes\u00e1l, dh\u00e1ur\u00e1, ebony, and other woods, with small clearings here and there. These jungles are infested with tigers, man-eaters being common; wild buffaloes, bears, and leopards are also numerous.\n\nThe principal rivers are, the Tel, which forms the boundary on the southeast between P\u00e1t'n\u00e1 and K\u00e1l\u00e1hand\u00ed; the Ong, which divides P\u00e1t'n\u00e1 from the Sambalp\u00far kh\u00e1lisa.\non the north; the S\u00faktel, and the Sundar. There are no roads of any importance, but a few Banj\u00e1ra tracks cross the state from the north and west to the south and east.\n\nThe temperature is very much the same as that of the plains generally; in the cool months the thermometer is often as low as 45\u00b0 Fah. at daybreak, and at midday rarely rises above 80\u00b0. The hot months are from April to the middle of June, the thermometer rising then sometimes as high as 110\u00b0 in the shade. The climate is reputed to be very unhealthy, but the inhabitants appear to be generally robust and well-looking. Cholera visitations are frequent, especially in the larger villages.\n\nNo correct return of the population has as yet been received, but judging from the returns of other states it may be estimated in round numbers at 90,000, belonging chiefly to the agricultural classes. The most common Hind\u00fa castes are Br\u00e1hmans, Mahantis, R\u00e1jputs, Aghari\u00e1s, and Kolt\u00e1s. The aboriginal tribes are the Gonds, Khonds, and Binj\u00e1l\u00e1s (Binjw\u00e1rs.) There are a few artisans in most of the larger villages.\n\nIron-ore is found to the south, and is smelted by certain castes and made into agricultural implements. The staple agricultural product is rice, but oil-seeds, pulses, sugarcane, and cotton are also grown.\n\nThe main subdivisions of the state are\u2014\n\n(1) The kh\u00e1lsa or directly administered country, consisting of some thirty villages, and two estates held by relations of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1, viz.

Bagamund\u00e1, Bubarkh\u00e1, Low\u00e1, Hald\u00ed, Talga\u00fak\u00e1, Safar Pah\u00e1r, Saintal\u00e1, Top\u00e1, and Upargauk\u00e1.\n\nA detailed account of the history of the P\u00e1ttn\u00e1 family was written by the late Major Impey in 1863, from which the following sketch is abstracted, with a few necessary modifications:\n\n\"The Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1s of P\u00e1ttn\u00e1 claim direct descent from a race of R\u00e1jput r\u00e1j\u00e1s of Garh Sambar, near Mainpur\u00ed, and trace it through thirty-one generations. It is alleged that Hitembar Singh, the last of these r\u00e1j\u00e1s, offended the king of Delhi, and was killed; that his family had to abandon their country and fly in every direction; and that one of his wives, who was at the time enceinte, found her way down to P\u00e1ttn\u00e1, which was, it seems, at that time represented by a cluster of eight 'garhs,' and the chief of each\n\n* S\u00e1ligr\u00e1m, the chief of this estate, was transported in 1864 for harbouring rebels. The Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 of P\u00e1ttn\u00e1 has resumed the estate.\ngarh took it in turn to rule for a day over the whole. The Chief of Kol\u00e1garh received the R\u00e1n\u00ed kindly, and in due time she gave birth to a boy, who was called Rama\u00ed Deva. The chief adopted him, and eventually abdicated in his favour; and when it came to his turn to rule, he took the first opportunity of causing the chiefs of the other seven garhs to be murdered, and setting himself up as ruler over the whole, with the title of 'mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1.' He contrived to preserve his position through the influence which he had obtained by a marriage with a daughter of the then ruler of Orissa. Between the reigns of Rama\u00ed Deva and Bajjal Deva, the tenth mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1, or during a period of some three hundred years, P\u00e1t\u0144\u00e1 obtained considerable accessions of territory, viz. the states of Khari\u00e1r and Bindr\u00e1 Naw\u00e1g\u00e1rh on the west, Phuljhar and S\u00e1rangarh to the north, and B\u00e1mail, G\u00e1ngp\u00far, and B\u00e1mr\u00e1 to the north-east, which were all made tributary dependencies; while the zam\u00edn\u00e1ri of Rai\u015bkhol, with a tract of land to the eastward on the left bank of the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed, was annexed. A fort was also erected in the Phuljhar state, and the Chandrap\u00far pargana, also on the left bank of the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed, was forcibly wrested from the ruler of Ratanp\u00far. Narsingh Deva, the twelfth mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 of P\u00e1t\u0144\u00e1, ceded to his brother Balr\u00e1m Deva such portions of his territories as lay north of the river Ong. The latter founded a new state (Sambalp\u00far), which very soon afterwards, by acquisition of territory in every direction, became the most powerful of all the Garhj\u00e1ts; while from the same time the power of P\u00e1t\u0144\u00e1 commenced to decline, and though for some generations a certain amount of allegiance was paid to it by the surrounding states, by degrees it sunk into insignificance, and it is now one of the poorest of all the Garhj\u00e1ts.\n\n\"The only relics of former ages are some old temples on the banks of the Tel, and others at a place called R\u00e1n\u00ed Jhir\u00e1, which are said to be at least one thousand years old, and to have been constructed by a pious R\u00e1n\u00ed of the Chauh\u00e1n tribe. There is nothing to show that since the advent of the Chauh\u00e1n rulers of P\u00e1t\u0144\u00e1, now some 750 years ago, there has been any attempt to construct works either of beauty or utility. During all that time the people have been apparently cut off from all communication with the outer world, and have lived on in the darkest ignorance. Within the last two or three centuries, however, some of the better classes have by degrees crept in from the Cuttack districts, and have settled here as landholders.\n\n\"Sur Prat\u00e1p Deva, the present mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1, is the twenty-sixth ruler of P\u00e1t\u0144\u00e1. He is by no means wanting in intelligence, reads and writes Uriya and Urd\u00fa, and understands a little Persian. He is, however, sensual and lazy; rarely stirs out of his house to transact business, and indulges in opium. The consequence is that his affairs are left in the hands of native mukht\u00e1rs, who not unfrequently abuse their power to serve their own ends. The following is a list of the mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1s of P\u00e1t\u0144\u00e1 from the time of Rama\u00ed Deva to the present mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1, showing approximately the period that each reigned:\n\n1.

After a northerly course of thirty-five\nmiles it falls into the Bairm\u00e9 on the right bank. For some distance this river\nforms a boundary between the Pann\u00e1 state and the Jabalp\u00far district.\n\nPATTAN\u2014A town in the Bet\u00e1l district, about ten miles to the south-east\nof Mult\u00e1i. The population amounts to 1,887 souls. There are here a govern-\nment school and a customs post. Local tradition has it that the climate is fatal\nto pigs because a Musalm\u00e1n saint once staid here.\n\nPAUNA\u2019R\u2014A town in the Huz\u00far tahsil of the Wardh\u00e1 district, situated on\nthe right bank of the river Dh\u00e1m, about five miles to the north-east of Wardh\u00e1.\nThis is a very old place, and is associated in the minds of the people round with\nmany curious traditions. Tradition tells of a Pawan r\u00e1j\u00e1\u2014a Kshatri of the race\nof the sun\u2014who ruled over Paun\u00e1r, Paunl, and Pohn\u00e1. He is said to have pos-\nsessed the philosopher\u2019s stone, so that his cultivators, who were Gaulfs, paid\nno rent, but merely gave him the iron of their ploughs, which forthwith was\nchanged into gold. He kept no standing army, and the people after a time\nbegan to reflect that if an enemy were to come they would be despoiled. The\nr\u00e1j\u00e1 assured them that he had only to take a bundle of reeds and cut them into\nsmall pieces, and any enemy\u2019s army would be destroyed. The people, wishing\nto prove his power, separated into two bands and got up a fight, in which\nblood was drawn. This, they informed the r\u00e1j\u00e1, had been done by an enemy\u2019s\narmy. After thrice asking them if they spoke the truth, and being answered each\ntime in the affirmative, the r\u00e1j\u00e1, who was a man of his word and \u201cof one wife,\u201d\ncalled for the reeds and began to chip them, and having done so, he assured the\ndeputation that the enemy was destroyed. On their return they found that\nthe heads of the Gaulfs in the wood had been miraculously cut off. Yielding,\nhowever, to the supplications of the widows and children of the men thus slain,\nthe r\u00e1j\u00e1 restored them to life. His power was thenceforward acknowledged\nuntil the arrival of one Saiyad Sh\u00e1h Kabir, a greater enchanter than himself, who,\nhearing that the r\u00e1j\u00e1 could decapitate his enemies from a distance, took the\nprecaution of removing his own head before visiting him. The Pawan r\u00e1j\u00e1 on hearing this perceived his rule was over, and with his wife sank into the deep waters of the Dh\u00e1m, under the fort of Paun\u00e1r. Strange stories are told of the pool into which the royal pair disappeared. One is that for twelve years a herdsman, who grazed his cattle on the bank of the river, observed a strange black cow feeding with his cattle. He received no pay for looking after it, and at last asked it whose it was. As the cow, on being questioned, was about to step into the pool, the herdsman caught hold of its tail and disappeared with it. Under the water he found a temple, where was a stranger, who began to tie up the cow, but the herdsman demanded first his hire for looking after the cow so long. He was given some vegetable bulbs, but rejected them angrily, and laying hold of the black cow's tail emerged with it from the water. The next day he found that a little of the vegetable still left with him was gold. More homely than this is the story of how the people of Paun\u00e1r, when they required dishes for their entertainments, could always get them by going to the pool, making known their wants, and throwing in an offering of rice. The next day they would find the dishes on the bank; but they were required always to put them back again after having used them, when the dishes would disappear in the water of themselves. But on one occasion a man kept back a dish, and from that day the marvel ceased.\n\nPaun\u00e1r contains a ruined fort, which must formerly have been a place of considerable strength, built as it is on a height surrounded on two sides by a deep reach of the river Dh\u00e1m. The ruins of the old town-wall can still be traced, and one of the gateways\u2014a large imposing structure of stone\u2014yet remains. Another was recently razed to make way for some municipal improvements. Sir Richard Jenkins, in his Report on the Territories of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of N\u00e1gpur (1827), notes that Paun\u00e1r was formerly the chief seat of the Musalm\u00e1n government east of the river Wardh\u00e1, and that an officer styled the Fa\u00fajd\u00e1r of Paun\u00e1r resided there, and was charged with the collection of the tribute then paid by the Gond R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Deogarh to the Emperor of Delhi. In A.D. 1807 the Pindh\u00e1ris attacked Paun\u00e1r and looted the town. Under the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 rule it was the chief place of a kam\u00e1visd\u00e1rf\u00ed, and the pensioned families of several Desmukhs and Desp\u00e1ndy\u00e1s now live there. At the recent census it was found to contain 2,441 inhabitants, principally cultivators of the lands around. But the numerous scattered ruins of former houses show that it has immensely fallen off since the day when it was the seat of power, and a place to be sought for the protection offered by its fort.\n\nPAUNI.\u2014A large enclosed town in the Bhand\u00e1ra district, situated on the Waingang\u00e1, about thirty-two miles south of Bhand\u00e1ra. It is surrounded on three sides by high ramparts of earth and a ditch, the walls being in some parts crowned with stone battlements; and on the fourth side, to the east, is the scarped bank of the Waingang\u00e1. Two or three handsome stone gh\u00e1ts lead down to the water's edge, and some temples of fair architecture, interspersed with fine trees, overlook the river. The town contains 2,719 houses, with a population of 11,265 souls. Many of the houses, however, are deserted and in ruins, and the number of the inhabitants has considerably decreased within the last twenty years. This decay is owing partly to the unhealthiness of the climate, and partly to the removal of the wealthier residents to N\u00e1gpur. There is still, however, a considerable trade in cotton-cloth and silk pieces; and some of the finer fabrics manufactured in this town are exported to great distances, and are noted for their beauty and closeness of texture. There are numerous Hind\u00fa temples here,\nsome of great antiquity, but the great temple of Murlidhar, though comparatively a recent construction, is the only one of much repute. This is a handsome and lofty building, surrounded by a fortified wall. The public establishments are a large and flourishing government school, a police station, a district post-office, and a small rest-house for travellers on the bank of the river. The watch and ward and conservancy of the town are provided from the town duties. The town is considered very unhealthy, the causes apparently being its enclosed position, and the dense jungle both in and around it. The water, too, of the wells is generally brackish, and most of the inhabitants use the river water for all domestic purposes.\n\nPAWI MUTANDA\u2014A chiefship in the Chand\u00e1 district, situated sixteen miles east of Ch\u00e1murs\u00ed. Excellent iron-ore is found here, and the forests produce a good deal of teak, ebony, and bljes\u00e1l. The estate consists of thirty-five villages.\n\nPENCH\u2014A river rising on the Mot\u00far plateau in the Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 district. In its windings it collects the waters from the central tableland of Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1; and its principal affluent, the Kolb\u00edr\u00e1, is itself a stream of considerable size. For a few miles after leaving the highlands its course is south-easterly up to M\u00e1ch\u00e1ghor\u00e1, a famous fishing locality; thence it trends southwards to near the village of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1, where it turns north-east, until stopped by the hills dividing the Seoni and Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 districts; thence it flows due south until its junction with the Kanh\u00e9n in the N\u00e1gpur district. The length of the Pench may be about 120 miles. A scheme is under consideration for damming up its waters as they emerge from the hills, and forming an immense irrigation-reservoir.\n\nPENDRA\u2014The northernmost chiefship of the Bil\u00e1sp\u00far district, is situated on the hilly uplands of the Vindhyan range, and though intersected by hills, consists mainly of an extensive plateau, part of which is fairly cultivated. It contains no less than 165 villages, and covers an area of 585 square miles. The extent of cultivation is 40,000 acres, and there is a culturable area of over 300,000 acres. The chief is a R\u00e1j-Gond, and is said to have obtained the grant more than three centuries ago from the Haihai-Bans\u00ed rulers of Ratanp\u00far.\n\nPENDRA\u2014The head-quarters of the chiefship of the same name, in the Bil\u00e1sp\u00far district, is a good-sized town, on the direct road from Bil\u00e1sp\u00far to Rew\u00e1, along which there is a constant flow of traffic by carriers in the cold months. There are the remains of a fort here. A magnificent grove of mango trees, interspersed here and there with wide-spreading tamarind trees, affords a pleasant encamping-ground.\n\nPERZA'GARH\u2014A range of hills in the Chand\u00e1 district, forming the eastern boundary of the Chim\u00far pargana, and dividing it from Brahmapuri. They are thirteen miles long by six broad, and terminate on the south in a striking-looking scarped cliff, which commands the surrounding country, and can be seen for forty miles to the south. This cliff, which gives its name to the range, is also called the \"S\u00e1t Bahin\u00ed,\" from seven sisters who are supposed to have lived in religious seclusion on its summit. Some of the valleys in these hills have patches of rice cultivation.\n\nPHEN\u2014A river in the Mandla district, rising in the Chilp\u00ed Gh\u00e1t and flowing into the Burhner.\n\nPHULJHAR\u2014This is one of the cluster of states formerly known as the eighteen Garhj\u00e1ts, and is now included amongst the ordinary kh\u00e1lea zamind\u00e1r\u00eds of the Sambalp\u00far General description.\ndistrict. It is about forty miles long by twenty-five broad; and its area may be computed at about 1,000 square miles, about three-fifths of which are cultivated. The soil is light, and has a good deal of sand mixed with it, except here and there in the valleys. To the west there are some fine belts of sal jungle on either side of the main road between R\u00e1\u00edpur and Sambalp\u00far, especially near the banks of the Jonk.\n\nThe climate is similar to that of Sambalp\u00far Proper. Rice is the staple crop; but pulses, cotton, oil-seeds, and sugarcane are also produced. Here and there also small quantities of gram are grown. Iron-ore of good quality is to be found. The jungle along the whole length of the main road was a few years ago so infested with tigers, that it was quite unsafe to travel through it; they used frequently to attack the d\u00e1k horses and runners. They have, however, been pretty well cleared off during late years. The Deputy Commissioner, Major Cumberlege, has killed ten, all near the highroad, two of which were confirmed man-eaters. Wild buffaloes are to be found near the Jonk river, also bears, leopards, &c. in the hills.\n\nThe census returns of 1866 give the population at 32,721. The agricultural classes are chiefly Aghari\u00e1s, Kolt\u00e1s, and Gonds, but there is a sprinkling of other castes, such as Br\u00e1hmans, Mahant\u00eds, Tel\u00eds, M\u00e1l\u00eds, &c. A few Khonds are also settled here and there. There is a school in Phuljhar, at which some fifty boys are receiving instruction.\n\nThe chiefship is subdivided into eight smaller estates, viz. 1st, Phuljhargarh, held by Dharm Singh, Garhoti\u00e1, an Aghari\u00e1, which consists of fourteen villages great and small. 2nd, Kelind\u00e1, held by Manbodla Pargani\u00e1, consists of twelve villages. 3rd, Boit\u00e1ri, held by Bha\u00edr\u00e1o Singh Diw\u00e1n,* consists of twelve villages. 4th, Basn\u00e9, held by Parmig S\u00e1 Diw\u00e1n, consists of twelve villages. 5th, Bal\u00e1d\u00e1, held by Udaya Singh Diw\u00e1n, consists of ten villages. 6th, Borsar\u00e1, held by Sundar Singh Pradh\u00e1n, consists of eleven villages. The 7th, Singhor\u00e1, held by D\u00ednbandhu Jamad\u00e1r, consists of seven villages. This last petty zam\u00ednd\u00e1ri has been only established of late years, the Jamad\u00e1r having been made guardian of the Singhor\u00e1 Gh\u00e1t\u2014a hill-pass through which the road from R\u00e1\u00edpur to Sambalp\u00far is carried. The 8th, S\u00e1nkr\u00e1, is held by Jagann\u00e1th Diw\u00e1n, and consists of seventeen villages, lately granted rent-free for five years on condition of clearing the jungle. The total annual land revenue paid in cash for these zam\u00ednd\u00e1ri tenures is stated to be but Rs. 500, but there are doubtless payments made in kind also. Besides the zam\u00ednd\u00e1ris, there are some 250 kh\u00e1lisa villages in the estate, that is, villages held directly by the farmers from the chief. The chief estimates his annual income at but little over Rs. 5,000; but taking payments in kind, nazr\u00e1na (fees on renewal), &c. into account, it will probably not fall much short of Rs. 8,000. The annual tribute paid by him is Rs. 500.\n\nThe chief's family is R\u00e1j-Gond. The chiefship was created some three hundred years ago by the P\u00e1tin\u00e1 r\u00e1j\u00e1s, and has been held by the same family ever since. It was granted in reward for service rendered in the field.\n\nPI'PARWA'NI'\u2014A large village in the Seoni district, about thirty-five miles south of Seoni. It contains 439 houses, and has a population of 1,111 souls. There are here a village school, a weekly market, and a police outpost.\n\n* Diw\u00e1n in this connection is ordinarily employed to mean a relation of the Chief.\nPITHORIA'\u2014A revenue-free estate in the S\u00e1gar district, about twenty miles north-west of S\u00e1gar. It contains twenty-six villages, with an area of fifty-one square miles, and yields a revenue to the proprietor of Rs. 4,545 per annum. In A.D. 1818, when the whole of S\u00e1gar, &c. was made over by the Peshw\u00e1 to the British Government, the present j\u00e1g\u00edrd\u00e1r of Pithori\u00e1, R\u00e1o R\u00e1mchandra R\u00e1o, who was then only ten years old, was in possession of Deor\u00ed and the \"Panj Mah\u00e1l.\" In 1819 the Panj Mah\u00e1l were transferred to Sind\u00eda,* but owing to the tender age of the R\u00e1o, his mother preferred taking compensation, in the form of a cash pension of Rs. 1,250 per mensem, to receiving another estate. Soon after this she died, and he requested the Government to assign him a tract of land in lieu of the money-payment. On this the village of Pithori\u00e1 and eighteen others were assigned to him; but as the revenue of these villages did not equal the required amount, seven other villages were added, making twenty-six in all, yielding a yearly revenue of Rs. 14,300. These villages are still in the possession of the j\u00e1g\u00edrd\u00e1r; but the estate has deteriorated, and the revenue has fallen off considerably during the last forty years.\n\nPithori\u00e1 itself is a village of no importance. It contains 566 houses and 1,786 inhabitants. The fort was built about A.D. 1750 by one Umr\u00e1o Singh, a R\u00e1jput, to whom the place had been given rent-free by Govind Pandit, the Peshw\u00e1's lieutenant at S\u00e1gar. A market is held here every Thursday, but no trade worth mentioning is carried on.\n\nPITHIRA' (PUTERA)\u2014A rent-free estate, situated to the extreme southeast of the S\u00e1gar district, and separated from the Narsinghp\u00far district by the river Narbad\u00e1. It contains 104 villages, with an area of 231 square miles, and yields about Rs. 22,667 per annum revenue to the r\u00e1j\u00e1. The whole estate, with the exception of eight villages, is situated in the subdivision of Deor\u00ed, the chief place of the Panj Mah\u00e1l. Deor\u00ed was seized about A.D. 1731 by the Gond R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Gaurjh\u00e1m\u00e1r, who was in his turn driven out by the troops of the Peshw\u00e1 ten years later. His son, however, procured assistance from Mandla, and began to plunder the country about, when the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s induced him to come to terms by making over to him the four \"tapp\u00e1s\" or estates of Pitihr\u00e1, Mu\u00e1r, Kcal\u00ed, and Tarar\u00e1, containing eight villages. He died in A.D. 1747, and his grandson Kir\u00e1j Singh obtained in A.D. 1798 another \"tapp\u00e1\" called Ball\u00e1i, consisting of fifty-three villages, from the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. At the cession of S\u00e1gar to the British Government in 1818, Kir\u00e1j Singh was not disturbed. But when he died in A.D. 1827, thirty villages from the estate of Ball\u00e1i were resumed, and the remainder, consisting of 104 villages, were secured to his son Balwant Singh, who is still in possession. The head-quarters of the r\u00e1j\u00e1 are in Pitihr\u00e1, a small village on the banks of the Narbad\u00e1, containing 230 houses, with 804 inhabitants.\n\nPOHNA'\u2014A village in the Hingangh\u00e1t tahsil of the Wardh\u00e1 district, on the river Wardh\u00e1, thirty-one miles south of Wardh\u00e1 town. It is said to have been founded some three hundred years ago by the ancestors of the Desp\u00e1ndy\u00e1s who now hold it. Under the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 rule it gave its name to a pargana. It contains 1,500 inhabitants, principally cultivators, and pays a land revenue of Rs. 1,700. A small weekly market, principally for agricultural produce, is held here on Fridays; and there is a good village school.\n\nPOTR'GA'ON\u2014A chiefship in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, situated sixteen miles east-north-east of Ch\u00e1murs\u00ed, and containing eleven villages. The country is hilly; and s\u00e1j, bijes\u00e1l, and ebony grow in considerable abundance.\n\n* Aitchison's Treaties, vol. iv. p. 256.\nPOTIKALL\u2014A small chiefship of the Bastar dependency, with an area of 350 square miles, and thirty villages. It is held by a Telenga, but the population is almost all of the Koi caste. Potikall, the chief village, consisting of about one hundred houses, is situated on the left bank of the Tal river.\n\nPOTPURI\u2014A river which rises in the eastern chiefship of A'mbgason, and after a westerly course of twenty miles falls into the Wainganga five miles below Garhchiroli, in the Chand\u00e9 district.\n\nPRANHITTA\u2014The name of the united streams of the Wardha and Wainganga up to their junction with the Godavari at Sironcha. It is about seventy miles in length. Some forty miles above Sironcha occurs what is known as the third barrier, which is a far more formidable obstruction to navigation than either of the other Godavari barriers. The river has a broad, sandy bed, which in the rainy season is full from bank to bank with a rushing flood, but in the dry weather consists for the greater part of broad reaches of sand, with small and shallow streams flowing through them.\n\nPRATAPGARH\u2014A chiefship in the west of the Chhindwara district, situated near Motur. With Sonpur it formed a portion of the Harai zamindari; but in the early part of the present century it was separated from the parent estate, and came under the management of the Harai chief's brother. It has the largest area of all the chiefships in this quarter, and comprises 181 villages, which pay no revenue to the Government.\n\nPULGAON\u2014This is the name of the railway station which is reached immediately on crossing the river Wardha from the Bombay side, about twenty miles west of Wardha. The site was unoccupied until the commencement of the railway works, but when the spot was fixed on for a railway station, land was set aside for a village also. As the cotton and other produce of the rich Wardha valley must come here for transport by rail to Bombay and other markets, it is possible that Pulgaon will some day be an important place. A road connecting it with the cotton marts of Deoli and Hinganghat to the south-east is now nearly completed, and another road running north to Arvi and A'shti has been laid out. There is a police station-house here, and a dispensary has been commenced. Near Pulgaon is a picturesque waterfall on the river Wardha. The Hindus consider this a holy place, and have built a temple in the neighbourhood. Lately an annual fair has been started here in view to aiding the new town.\n\nPUNASA\u2014A proposed forest reserve in the north of the Nimar district, of about 150 square miles in extent.\n\nPUNASA\u2014A market town in the north of the Nimar district, about thirty-three miles from Khandwa. It was at one time a considerable place, and was held by Ranas of the Tuar clan. A large stone-fort, built by Ram Kusal Singh in A.D. 1730, and still in good preservation, formed a safe refuge for the European families in the troubles of 1857. The country round is mostly waste, never having recovered from the destruction wrought by the Pindharis at the commencement of the present century. There is a large tank here, which was repaired by Captain French in A.D. 1846, and a weekly market is held on Saturdays.\n\nPURARA\u2014A small zamindari or chiefship, consisting of six villages, situated on the Bagh river, near the south-eastern confines of the Bhandara district. The area is thirty-nine square miles, seven of which only are cultivated.\n\nThe occupant family is Gond, and the residents are chiefly Gonds and Goaras. Purara itself is a large village, and has an indigenous school. The forests on the estate contain some good building timber, and are noted for the number of tigers which infest them.\nPURWA'\u2014A village in the Mandla district, situated at the confluence of the Narbad\u00e1 and the Banjar, by the former of which it is separated from Mandal, and by the latter from Mahar\u00e1jpur. An annual fair is held here, which was established by Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h in A.D. 1751.\n\nRA'HATGARH\u2014The chief town of a tract of the same name in the S\u00e1g\u00e1r district, is situated about twenty-five miles west of S\u00e1g\u00e1r. After passing through various hands it seems to have come into the possession of a branch of the Bhop\u00e1l family, to one of whom\u2014Sult\u00e1n Mohammad Kh\u00e1n\u2014the fort is attributed. His descendants remained in possession till A.D. 1807, when it was taken by Daulat R\u00e1o Sind\u00ed\u00e1, after a siege of seven months. In A.D. 1810 R\u00e1hatgarh was made over to the British among other districts for the payment of the contingent,* and in 1861 it was given over entirely to the British Government, in accordance with a treaty made with the Government on the 12th December 1860.\u2020 In 1857, when the Mutiny commenced, Naw\u00e1b \u00c1'dil Mohammad Kh\u00e1n and his brother F\u00e1zil Mohammad Kh\u00e1n, descendants of the Sult\u00e1n Mohammad Kh\u00e1n mentioned above, who were in possession of a tract in the Bhop\u00e1l state, by name Garh \u00c1'm\u00e1p\u00e1n\u00ed, came down with a band of insurgents and took possession of the fort. In February 1858 the fort and town were invested and captured by Sir Hugh Rose with the Central India Force, and the rebels were defeated with great slaughter. \u00c1'dil Mohammad Kh\u00e1n fled, but F\u00e1zil Mohammad Kh\u00e1n was taken and hanged. The fort was also destroyed in a great measure, but the ruins still remain, showing what an enormous structure it was originally.\n\nR\u00e1hatgarh is a good-sized town, well situated on the banks of the B\u00edn\u00e1, which has many picturesque and beautifully wooded reaches close to it. There is a travellers' bungalow here, and the place is a favourite resort of the residents of S\u00e1g\u00e1r for change of air. A fine bridge of fourteen arches crosses the river about a mile from the fort, over which the Bhop\u00e1l and Bombay road passes. The shoes made here are highly esteemed, and are sent for sale to S\u00e1g\u00e1r and to the different towns in Bhop\u00e1l. Native cloth of a kind called \"dos\u00fati\" is also largely manufactured and exported. There is a weekly market on Fridays, at which the abovementioned articles, with grain of all kinds, are sold.\n\nThe fort is situated on a lofty eminence to the south-west of the town, and surrounded by it on the south, west, and north sides. As mentioned above, it was chiefly built by Sult\u00e1n Mohammad Kh\u00e1n, but was afterwards altered and added to by his successors, and thus took upwards of fifty years to complete. It is the largest fort in the S\u00e1g\u00e1r district, and probably in all the adjoining country. The outer walls consist of twenty-six enormous towers, some of which were used as dwellings, connected by curtain-walls, and enclose a space of sixty-six acres. This space was for the most part covered with buildings of all descriptions, and contained a large b\u00e1z\u00e1r and numerous temples and palaces. One of these latter is called the \"B\u00e1d\u00e1l Mahal,\" or cloud palace, from its great height and elevated situation. It is attributed to one of the R\u00e1j-Gond chiefs of Garh\u00e1 Mandla. Most of the buildings are now in ruins, and the outer fort-walls are also in a ruinous state. The east wall was breached for a distance of nearly a hundred yards by\n\n* Aitchison's Treaties, vol. iv. p. 239. \u2020 Ibid, p. 279.\nSir Hugh Rose's siege guns in 1858, when he captured the fort from the rebels. The view from the fort of the surrounding country, and of the river B\u00edn\u00e1, flowing at the base of the hill on which it stands, is of great beauty and interest.\n\nA government school has been established here. The population amounts to 8,426 souls according to the census of 1866.\n\nRA'IGARH\u2014An old chiefship now attached to the Sambalp\u00far district. It lies between 83\u00b0 and 83\u00b0 35' of east longitude, and between 21\u00b0 45' and 22\u00b0 35' of north latitude, and is bounded on the north by the native states of Sirguja and G\u00e1ngp\u00far under Chot\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur, on the south by the river Mah\u00e1n\u00e1di and the Sambalp\u00far kh\u00e1lasa, on the east by the zamind\u00e1ri of Jaipur or Kol\u00e1bira, on the south-west by the zamind\u00e1ri of Chandrap\u00far, and on the north-west by the feudatory state of Sakt\u00ed under Bil\u00e1sp\u00far.\n\nIts extreme length is about sixty miles, by thirty-five miles in breadth. The southern portion towards the Mah\u00e1n\u00e1di is fertile and well cultivated, but the soil is naturally poor, having in it a large admixture of sand. The northern and eastern portions are a mass of hill and jungle, and contain a good deal of s\u00e1l (shorea robusta), sj\u00fa (terminalia tomentosa), bijes\u00e1l (pterocarpus marsupium), and many other kinds of useful building timber, but no teak (tectona grandis) of any size. The principal rivers are the Mah\u00e1n\u00e1di and its affluents the Ted\u00ed, M\u00e1n, and Kel\u00fa. The direct road from Sambalp\u00far to Bil\u00e1sp\u00far passes through the southern portion of this state, but there are no other roads of consequence. The climate is similar to that of Sambalp\u00far Proper, and is considered very unhealthy.\n\nAccording to the census lately taken by the r\u00e1j\u00e1, the population amounts to 31,925 souls, chiefly belonging to the agricultural classes. Rice is the main crop, but cotton, pulses, oil-seeds, and sugarcane are also produced. The manufactures are brass and bell-metal vessels, tasar-silk fabrics, and coarse cotton-cloths. Iron-ore is found in considerable quantities, and the forests produce lac, tasar, cocoanuts, and r\u00e1l, or s\u00e1l resin.\n\nThe principal castes are:\u2014(Agricultural) Kolt\u00e1s, Aghari\u00e1s, Kanwars, S\u00e9onr\u00e1s Gonds, and Bh\u00fami\u00e1s; (others) Br\u00e1hmans, R\u00e1jputs, Mahantis, with a fair proportion of artisans.\n\nThere are altogether some 500 villages in the state; and it has four subordinate zamind\u00e1ris held by connections of the r\u00e1j\u00e1, viz. those of\u2014\n\nAnj\u00e1r Singh, consisting of ........................................... 12 villages.\nAmar Singh, ditto .................................................. 5 do.\nTh\u00e1kur Raghn\u00e1th Singh, consisting of ......................... 30 do.\nTh\u00e1kur Parameshwar Singh, ditto ......................... 30 do.\n\nThe chief's family has no written records, but according to tradition one of its ancestors, Th\u00e1kur Dary\u00e1o Singh, for some assistance afforded by him to the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, obtained the title of \"r\u00e1j\u00e1.\" He was succeeded by his son J\u00fajh\u00e1r Singh, who again was succeeded by Deon\u00e1th Singh. His son Ghanasy\u00e1m Singh, the present r\u00e1j\u00e1, has now (1869) held for six years. This territory includes the once independent neighbouring chiefship of Bargarh, which was conferred on the family some forty years ago.\n\nThe ruling family is Gond. Ghanasy\u00e1m Singh, the present r\u00e1j\u00e1, is a very quiet, unpretending man, and has neither ability nor energy to look very closely after the affairs of his state, but he has some sensible intelligent relatives around him who assist him in every way, and on the whole he gets on very well. There is a fair school at R\u00e1igarah, with some forty or fifty pupils receiving instruction.\nRA'IPU'R *\n\nCONTENTS.\n\n| Page | Page |\n|------|------|\n| Position of the district | 403 |\n| Features of country | 404 |\n| River system | 405 |\n| Hill country | ib. |\n| Geological characteristics | 406 |\n| Soil and water-supply | ib. |\n| Rainfall and climate | 407 |\n| Towns and buildings | ib. |\n| Metalled and fair-weather roads | 408 |\n| Early history | ib. |\n| Haihai-Bansi rule | 409 |\n| Conquest of Chhattisgarh by the Marathas | 410 |\n| British administration | 411 |\n| Re-introduction of Maratha rule | ib. |\n| Introduction of British rule in 1854, and subsequent administration | ib. |\n| Population | 412 |\n| Chamirs | ib. |\n| Gondis | 413 |\n| Kanwars | ib. |\n| Halbis | 414 |\n| Aboriginal tribes | 415 |\n| Landholding classes | ib. |\n| Peculiar tribes | 416 |\n| Agriculture | ib. |\n| Rain-crops | ib. |\n| Rabi cultivation and sugarcane | 417 |\n| Quality of agriculture | ib. |\n| Forests | ib. |\n| Jungle produce | 418 |\n| Trado | 419 |\n| Trade routes | 420 |\n| Administration | ib. |\n| Education | 421 |\n| General condition of the people | ib. |\n\nA district lying between 80\u00b0 28' and 82\u00b0 38' east longitude, and 19\u00b0 48' and 21\u00b0 45' north latitude. Within these limits is comprised the larger part of the tract known by the name of Chhattisgarh, together with a large area formerly attached to Sambalpur. It is about 150 miles in breadth from east to west, and 135 miles in length from north to south. Besides the khalsa portion of the district, which is more directly under the management of the district authorities, there is a large area of country held by petty chiefs, called zamindars, holding their estates at low quit-rents, and by semi-independent feudatories. These estates are as follows:\n\nFeudatories\n\nZamindar of Nandgaon.\nDo. of Khairagarh.\nDo. of Chhukhadan.\nDo. of Kaner.\n\nParpori.\nLohara Sahaspur.\nGandai.\nBarbaspur.\nSilheti.\nThakurtola.\n\nWariband.\nKhujji.\nDaundi Lohara.\nGundardehi.\nFingeswar.\nSutarmar.\nNarru.\nKauria.\nDeori.\nKhariar.\nBindra Nawagarh.\n\nBelonging to Chhattisgarh.\n\nEastern\n\nLately attached to Raipur, formerly belonging to Sambalpur.\n\n*This article consists almost entirely of extracts from the Land Revenue Settlement Report on Raipur, by Mr. J. F. K. Hewitt.*\nThe whole area of these tracts as shown by the Settlement Records is as follows:\n\n| Acres          | Square Miles |\n|----------------|--------------|\n| Kh\u00e1l\u1e63a, inclusive of Government wastes | 50,442,365   | 7,881       |\n| Chhatt\u00edsgarh\u00ed zam\u00edn\u1e0d\u00e1ris                  | 1,130,844    | 1,767       |\n| Sambalp\u00far zam\u00edn\u1e0d\u00e1ris attached to R\u00e1jp\u00far |              | 2,800       |\n| Feudatories                                |              | 2,940       |\n| **Total**                                  |              | **15,388**  |\n\nOf these areas only those of the kh\u00e1l\u1e63a and Chhatt\u00edsgarh zam\u00edn\u1e0d\u00e1ris are given from actual measurements made by the Settlement department. Those of the Sambalp\u00far zam\u00edn\u1e0d\u00e1ris are calculated from the maps of the Topographical Survey; while the area of the feudatoryships are only approximate guesses, as there are as yet no maps of these tracts.\n\nThough the name of Chhatt\u00edsgarh was originally applied to a portion only of the country now included in the R\u00e1jp\u00far and Bil\u00e1s-p\u00far districts, yet the whole of the area of both districts is geographically homogeneous, and may be shortly described as the basin of the Upper Mah\u00e1n\u00e1di and its tributaries, together with the hills in which these tributaries take their rise. The whole of this tract is surrounded by ranges of hills branching from the great Vindhyan chain of Central India. Below the hills to the west and south of Chhatt\u00edsgarh there is a broad belt of black soil. The north-western portion of this belt is in the district of Bil\u00e1s-p\u00far, while the remainder of the tract belongs to the zam\u00edn\u1e0d\u00e1ri estates of Parpor\u00ed, Loh\u00e1r\u00ed, Sahasp\u00far, Gand\u00e1i, Silhet\u00ed, and Barbasp\u00far, and to the feudatories of Chhuikhad\u00e1n, Khair\u00e1garh, and N\u00e1ndg\u00e1on. To the south the black soil tract is, with the exception of a portion in the Gundardeh\u00ed zam\u00edn\u1e0d\u00e1ri, entirely within the kh\u00e1l\u1e63a parganas of R\u00e1j\u00edm, Dhamt\u00e1r\u00ed, B\u00e1lod, and Sanj\u00e1r\u00ed. The centre of Chhatt\u00edsgarh beyond the black soil is an undulating plain, intersected by numerous rivers and n\u00e1l\u00e1\u00eds, with broad fertile valleys, which are separated from one another by rolling downs. This formation affords peculiar facilities for irrigation, which have as yet been by no means fully utilised. Almost the whole of this is cleared of jungle, inhabited, and cultivated. To the east of the Mah\u00e1n\u00e1di the hills come close to the stream, leaving, except in the R\u00e1j\u00edm pargana, and in the north-east of that of Dhamt\u00e1r\u00ed, but a small share of fertile plain between the hill-country and the river. The kh\u00e1l\u1e63a lands are now separated into four tahs\u00edl subdivisions, viz. Simg\u00e1, R\u00e1jp\u00far, Dr\u00fag, and Dhamt\u00e1r\u00ed. To make these as compact as possible it has been found necessary to disregard in many instances the old pargana boundaries.\n\nOf these tahs\u00edls the most northern is Simg\u00e1. It contains the very fertile tracts of Naw\u00e1g\u00e1rh, Deorbij\u00e1, and the northern portion of the Dhamd\u00e1 pargana. The rest of the tahs\u00edl has been recently cleared, but still contains a good deal of low scrub-jungle here and there. This is, however, retained rather to satisfy the requirements of the people than from their inability to clear it, and a good deal of it is rocky soil, and more valuable as jungle than if it were cultivated; but there is also a large portion which remains uncultivated because of the thatching-grass it yields\u2014a product which is quite as valuable as an average crop of cereals. In the R\u00e1jp\u00far tahs\u00edl the western portion is well cultivated and populous, but in the east there is a large area of jungle and the extensive Government waste of Laun, Sirp\u00far, and Kh\u00e1l\u1e63\u00e1ri. Dr\u00fag has no jungle whatsoever within its limits, and the whole of the tahs\u00edl is well cultivated, while Dhamt\u00e1r\u00ed presents the greatest\ncontrasts of all the tahsils. There are, except in Laun, no such wild tracts in the district as the Sehaw\u00e1, Dhamtar\u00ed, B\u00e1lod, and Sanj\u00e1r\u00ed jungles, while the villages in the black-soil tract in the centre of Dhamtar\u00ed and of B\u00e1lod are the most fertile and populous in the country.\n\nWithin the country above described there are two principal river systems which subsequently unite and form the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed proper. The first of these\u2014the Seon\u00e1th\u2014which contains much the larger supply of water, rises in the hills of the P\u00e1n\u00e1b\u00e1ras zam\u00edn\u00e1ri in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, and flows, after its entrance into R\u00e1ip\u00far, in a direction for the most part north-east for about one hundred and twenty miles, till it is joined by the H\u00e1mp from the west; after this junction it turns eastward for about forty miles, till it joins the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed in the north-east corner of the district. Its tributaries in the R\u00e1ip\u00far district are on the left bank, proceeding from the south, the Gumari\u00e1, \u00c1'm, S\u00far\u00ed, G\u00e1r\u00e1gh\u00e1t, Ghogw\u00e1, and H\u00e1mp; on the right bank, the Karkar\u00e1, Tend\u00e1l\u00e1, K\u00e1r\u00fan, and Khors\u00ed. In the latter part of its course, after the junction with the H\u00e1mp, it forms the boundary between the Bil\u00e1sp\u00far and R\u00e1ip\u00far districts, except where it flows to the north of the Tareng\u00e1 pargana, belonging to Bil\u00e1sp\u00far, but lying to the south of the Seon\u00e1th. The stream known as the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed in R\u00e1ip\u00far, though it ultimately gives its name to the river, is of very little importance to the country as compared with the Seon\u00e1th and K\u00e1r\u00fan. It takes its rise a few miles to the east of the town of Sehaw\u00e1 in the extreme south-east of the district, in an insignificant puddle in the middle of a rice-field, and thence flows due west through the Sch\u00e1w\u00e1 pargana and the K\u00e1nker feudatory estate for about thirty miles, after which it turns sharply to the north-east through a very narrow valley, in some places not much more than five hundred or six hundred yards broad, through which it flows for about twenty miles. It continues in this course till it reaches a point about sixteen miles to the north-east of the town of Dhamtar\u00ed, where it turns more to the north, and thence flows in a north-east direction till its junction with the Seon\u00e1th. The Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed receives no large tributary till it reaches R\u00e9j\u00edm, about thirty miles to the south-east of R\u00e1ip\u00far, where it is joined by the Pair\u00ed, which flows from the south-east, rising in the Bindr\u00e1 Naw\u00e1g\u00e1rh zam\u00edn\u00e1ri, and flowing in a north-easterly direction through a hilly country for about sixty miles before its junction with the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed. About fifteen miles to the south of R\u00e9j\u00edm the Pair\u00ed is joined by the Sundar\u2014a river of nearly equal length, which rises in the Jaip\u00far estate under the Madras Government, and flows through a similar country to the Pair\u00ed. The other tributaries of the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed are the Kesho, Kor\u00e1r, and Nain\u00ed, all of which flow from the east through hilly tracts, watering narrow, but fertile valleys. Along the western bank it only receives a few insignificant n\u00e1ls, and the space of fertile black-soil plain which lies between it and the uplands of the interior of the district is generally narrow. The general character of the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed and the rivers in the east of the district is very different from that of the Seon\u00e1th and its tributaries. The latter streams generally flow over a rocky or gravelly bottom, and consequently retain water for the whole, or greater part, of the year; while the beds of the former are wide wastes of sand, dry for more than half the year, and at no time, except during high flood, containing much water. The Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed is occasionally, but very seldom, navigable for boats of light draught from \u00c1'rang, about fifty miles below its junction with the Seon\u00e1th.\n\nAs above stated the whole of the country to the east of the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed occupied by the zam\u00edn\u00e1ris of Deor\u00ed, Kauri\u00e1, Narr\u00e1, S\u00faarm\u00e1r, Fingeswar, Khari\u00e1, and Bindr\u00e1 Naw\u00e1g\u00e1rh.\nis hilly and covered with jungle, and the same may be said of the tract to the south of the district occupied by the pargana of Sehaw\u00e1, the K\u00e1nker feudatory state, and the southern portion of the Dhamt\u00e1r\u00ed, B\u00e1lod, and Sanj\u00far\u00ed pargannas, together with the zamind\u00e1ris of Daund\u00ed-Loh\u00e1r\u00e1, and Khujj\u00ed. To the west the feudatories of N\u00e1ndg\u00e1on, Khair\u00e1g\u00e1rh, and Chhuikhad\u00e1n hold but a small portion of hill country, the hills in this direction for the most part belonging to the Bhand\u00e1ra and B\u00e1lagh\u00e1t districts, and the same may be said of the zamind\u00e1ris to the north-west, where the Th\u00e1kurtol\u00e1 zamind\u00e1ri is the only one of which the whole, or greater part, of the area is occupied by hill and jungle. The hills are generally low, rarely rising over 1,500 or 1,600 feet high, except the Gaur\u00e1g\u00e1rh plateau, and the range in the south of Sehaw\u00e1, extending into Bastar and K\u00e1nker.\n\nThe district has not yet been geologically surveyed, but the following Geological characteristics. characteristics may be accepted as a fairly correct account of the leading geological features. The hilly tracts on the outskirts of the district are mostly composed of gneiss and quartzite, while the sandstone rocks are intersected with trap dykes. Iron-ore is abundant, and that found in Dall\u00ed in the Loh\u00e1r\u00e1 zamind\u00e1ri, and in the hills to the west of Gandai, is particularly good. Lead has also been found in the southwest of the N\u00e1ndg\u00e1on zamind\u00e1ri, and the red ochre of Gandai and Th\u00e1kurtol\u00e1 is celebrated. In the interior of the district the stratum below the alluvial deposits is invariably a soft sandstone slate, covered generally by a layer of laterite gravel, and in many places the shale has been converted into hard vitrified sandstone, forming an excellent building stone. Below this again lies the blue limestone which crops out in numerous places on the surface, and is invariably found in the beds of the rivers.\n\nThroughout the plain country the soil is generally fertile, about fifty-seven Soil and water-supply. per cent being equally adapted for the growth of rain and cold-season crops; while of the remainder about twenty-three per cent, though not fitted for rabi crops, produces better rice crops than any soil but that of the best first-class. The rest is either rocky or hard poor laterite, which will only occasionally yield a second-rate crop of the inferior grains, such as kodo. In the hilly country the soil is mostly poor, except in the narrow valleys, in which the constant supply of water, and the natural barriers to its outlet furnished by the hills, keep the land almost always in that swampy state which is necessary for the production of the best crops of rice. One of the most distinguishing features of the district is the great number of tanks. These are generally formed by throwing a dam across a hollow; but in most large villages there are one if not more tanks to be found embanked on all four sides, and planted with trees,\u2014the work of some public-spirited villager, or perhaps of some enterprising Banj\u00e1r\u00e1 who used to pasture his cattle in the village in the day when the jungle was uncut. These tanks, which depend almost entirely on the rainfall for their water-supply, are considered on that account to give better drinking-water than those formed by throwing a dam across the valleys, and in this respect they must be allowed to have some advantages; but as but little care is taken to keep them clear, the water before the hot weather is generally a muddy mass of impurity. Besides the trees round the tanks, there are but few to be seen throughout the greater part of the district, and mango-groves, so common in Upper India, are here few and far between. Wells were unknown in the district till the last two years; but the recent orders granting rent-free land to persons digging wells have led to the construction of wells lined with masonry in many of the kh\u00e1l\u015ba villages. Along the banks of the\nMah\u00e1nad\u00ed and to the south of the district water is found at from twelve to twenty-four feet from the surface, but in the east it is not so easily procured.\n\nThe average rainfall is about forty inches. The hills which encircle the district generally insure the fall of an adequate, or nearly adequate, supply of water, and within the last fifty years, beyond which no records are available, only one very severe famine has been known in R\u00e1\u00edp\u00far. This occurred in 1835, and numbers of people are said to have died of hunger. There is no trustworthy evidence extant from which the extent of the calamity can be learnt, but that it must have been severe is shown by the fact that the revenue of almost all the villages in the district declined considerably in the next few succeeding years, while another, but less severe, famine occurring in 1844, completed the ruin of many villages.* The climate is generally good, varying less than in the districts of Bengal and Upper India, and though the cold season is very different from that of Behar or even of Bengal, yet the rains are always cool and pleasant. The district has been for the last few years generally healthy, though previously it had a bad reputation from the cholera which had visited it almost every year for twenty years; but the last\u2020 bad outbreak of the disease was in 1866, and then it was confined to the north of the district only. The people attribute this immunity in a great measure to the sanitary precautions which have lately been introduced, and the coincidence of the cessation of cholera and the introduction of sanitary reform is certainly fortunate, as it has induced the people to take up with a sort of enthusiasm a system of precautions which is generally distasteful to the natives of the country. It is to be hoped that their newly-born faith may not sink under a premature trial. Besides cholera the prevalent disorders are fevers and small-pox; the former are very frequent during the rains and the beginning of the cold weather; but, except in the jungles, the fever is generally of a mild type. Small-pox has hitherto yearly carried off a large number of children, but now that vaccination has been introduced, its ravages may be mitigated, if it be not entirely exterminated. Stone is also very prevalent, and a large number of operations for this disease are yearly performed at the R\u00e1\u00edp\u00far dispensary.\n\nThere are no large towns in the district except R\u00e1\u00edp\u00far, but Dhamtar\u00ed and R\u00e1j\u00edm are rising places. The population of these three towns is as follows:\n\n| Town          | Population |\n|---------------|------------|\n| R\u00e1\u00edp\u00far        | 16,645     |\n| Dhamtar\u00ed      | 4,632      |\n| R\u00e1j\u00edm         | 2,571      |\n\nR\u00e1\u00edp\u00far is the head-quarters of the grain trade of the district, and the residence of the principal merchants, while Dhamtar\u00ed and R\u00e1j\u00edm derive their importance principally from the jungle-produce which is brought there for sale. The trade is a somewhat speculative one, but very lucrative to those who succeed, and the number of those who engage in it is yearly increasing, as the value of the jungle-produce becomes better known. A\u2019rang was formerly the seat of a considerable trade in lac, but the clearing of the jungles to the east of the district has greatly diminished its importance. Among agricultural villages, Kurudh, Pal\u00e1r\u00ed, and A\u2019md\u00ed\u2014all of them in Dhamtar\u00ed\u2014are the most populous.\n\n* There has been drought and severe distress this year also (1869-69).\n\u2020 Cholera again appeared this year (1869) among the half-fed gangs of pauper-labourers on relief works.\nDr\u00fag, as the head-quarters of a tahsil, and Dhamd\u00e1, as the former residence of a Goad dynasty, only extinct within the last seventy or eighty years, also contain a considerable number of inhabitants; while in the other parts of the district, Kusml, Laun, and S\u00e1r\u00e1g\u00e1o in the Simg\u00e1 tahsil, and Kur\u00e1 in that of R\u00e1jp\u00far, deserve mention. In R\u00e1jp\u00far, Dhamd\u00e1, P\u00e1tan, Dr\u00fag, Dhamtar\u00ed, and B\u00e1lod there are the ruins of old forts of considerable extent; but, except in Dhamd\u00e1, these remains are of little architectural beauty. In Laun, along the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed, the forts are almost as numerous as the villages, but they are invariably rude, and now ruined structures, made for the security of the inhabitants, on the occasion of the periodical raids of the Binjw\u00e1rs from the Son\u00e1kh\u00e1n hills. At \u00c1rang in the R\u00e1jp\u00far tahsil, at Deobalod\u00e1 in the Dr\u00fag tahsil, and at Gandai in the zamind\u00e1ri of that name, there are fine Buddhist or Jain temples, and at R\u00e1j\u00edm the original portion of the temple which still exists shows a good deal of artistic skill and taste. Throughout the district there are numerous ruins of temples, and almost every village has, as its deity, some old statue reft from a decayed building, often showing considerable refinement in the sculptors, and almost always exhibiting a skill which would now be sought for in vain in Chhatt\u00edsgarh. Of more extensive ruins those of Sirp\u00far may be mentioned, consisting of the remains of temples and palaces of stone, for the most part hidden in the jungle.\n\nThe only metalled road in the district is the Great Eastern Road\u2014the imperial line running from N\u00e1gpur to Sambalp\u00far through R\u00e1jp\u00far. The part of the road between R\u00e1jp\u00far and the western boundary of the district towards N\u00e1gpur is nearly finished, but that between R\u00e1jp\u00far and Sambalp\u00far has not been begun. Two fair-weather roads have been made from local funds\u2014one to Dhamtar\u00ed, and the other via Simg\u00e1 to N\u00e1ndgh\u00e1t on the banks of the Seon\u00e1th, where it meets the Bil\u00e1sipur district road leading to that station. A branch from Simg\u00e1 to join the road from Bil\u00e1sipur to Jabalp\u00far over the Chilpi Gh\u00e1t is now being begun, and a road from R\u00e1jp\u00far to Seor\u00ednhar\u00e1n has also been commenced. On the Simg\u00e1 road a few bridges have been built; but, except on the Great Eastern Road, no bridges have yet been attempted on the other lines.\n\nThe isolated state of Chhatt\u00edsgarh from the earliest times renders the facts of its history, except as they illustrate the growth of its present institutions and customs, of little interest or value, while the paucity of the materials extant renders it a task of some difficulty to obtain even such an outline as is necessary for the purpose of this Gazetteer. However, from traditions\u2014many of which, owing to the heterogeneous character of the population, and the fact that most of the inhabitants are descended from recent immigrants, are vague\u2014incriptions either existing in the original, or in copies made by orders of Colonel Agnew when in charge of Chhatt\u00edsgarh from 1818\u20141825, and hints found in the customs of the people, a not wholly inadequate account of the past history of the district may be framed.\n\nLike the rest of Central India, Chhatt\u00edsgarh seems to have been inhabited in the earliest times by Bhunjy\u00e1s and other Kolarian races from the East. These, however, having little administrative ability or instinct for cohesion, never succeeded in establishing anything like a regular government, and were in very early times conquered and driven to the hills by the Gonds, by whom the first system of government was founded; and in this system, though greatly corrupted\n\u2014and in the last three or four hundred years almost obliterated\u2014will be found\nthe key to the innumerable anomalies which now perplex the inquirer into the\ncustoms of Chhatt\u00edsgarh. To the east of the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed the Bhunj\u00edy\u00e1s and\nBinjw\u00e1rs maintained themselves till a late period. The last Binjw\u00e1r chief of\nSon\u00e1kh\u00e1n was hanged in the Mutiny; while tradition still tells of the Gond\nconquest of Bindr\u00e1 Naw\u00e1garh, and the victories of the Gond heroes over the\nbarbarian giants, though the latter were assisted by magical and supernatural\ngifts.\n\nIt is impossible to say exactly when R\u00e1\u00edp\u00far became part of the dominions\nof the ancient Haihai-Bansi dynasty, but it\nappears to have been cut off from the Ratanp\u00far\nkingdom, and separately governed by a younger branch of the reigning family\nabout the ninth century. An inscription in a temple at R\u00e1j\u00edm,* dated Samvat\n796, commemorates the conquests in these parts of a chief named Jagatp\u00e1l,\nwho appears to have acquired the fort of Durga or Dr\u00fag in the R\u00e1\u00edp\u00far district\nby a marriage connection with R\u00e1j\u00e1 Prithv\u00ed Deva of the Haihai-Bansi line.\nFrom the time of this inscription to Samvat 1458, corresponding to A.D. 1401,\nin which year a r\u0101j\u00e1 named Lachhman Deva appears, from an inscription\nformerly existing in the R\u00e1\u00edp\u00far fort, to have reigned, there is no trustworthy\nrecord of the history of this principality. But from an inscription at Ratanp\u00far\nit would seem that as late as the end of the eleventh, or commencement\nof the twelfth century the reigning prince of the elder line, which always\nretained a feudal superiority over the R\u00e1\u00edp\u00far branch, were driven back from\nRatanp\u00far to the hills by an uprising of R\u00e1kshas\u00e1s, or aboriginal tribes,\nso that the R\u00e1\u00edp\u00far government was probably not very solid until some\ncenturies after its establishment. Under the Haihai-Bansi dynasty the\ngovernment seems to have been a patriarchal aristocracy, the system being\nderived from the Gonds. Under the nomad invaders of the Turanian\nrace the unit seems not to have been, as among some at least of the\nmore civilised Aryans of Upper India, the family, but the clan: hence, while in\nUpper India the family developed into the village community, among the\nTuranian races the clan settled themselves in a number of neighbouring villages,\nwhich were formed into a t\u00e1luka. All the original inhabitants of each of\nthese t\u00e1lukas were attached to their chief by the ties of blood or community of\ninterest. As long as the original tradition of a connection between the members\nof each t\u00e1luka, and of the different t\u00e1lukad\u00e1rs with one another under a\ncommon chief, existed, the aggregate thus formed was a powerful state, formi-\ndable alike for attack and defence; but as the hereditary bond of connection\nwas weakened by time and the loss of the constant stimulus of common action,\nthe parts separated from each other and fell easily, one by one, under the yoke\nof a common invader. Such an invader would replace the indigenous chiefs by\nstrangers attached to himself, and hence the system would receive a further\nshock from the absence of any bond between the new t\u00e1lukad\u00e1rs and their\nsubordinates, and this process had probably taken place once at least before the\nconquest of the district by the Haihai-Bansi princes. They introduced a number\nof adventurers from Hindust\u00e1n, making over to them the lands of the older\nsettlers; and the lists of Bil\u00e1sp\u00far t\u00e1lukad\u00e1rs prepared in the time of Lachhman\nSen show that the greater part of the t\u00e1lukad\u00e1rs were of foreign extraction.\nAs there are no such lists extant for R\u00e1\u00edp\u00far, it does not appear how far the\n\n* Asiatic Researches, vol. xv. pp. 500 ff.\nchange had been carried in this part of the country; but there can be little doubt that the old system had been even at this time greatly changed, while in succeeding generations it was almost obliterated, and not only were the older holders ejected from their talukas, but the boundaries of talukas were disregarded, and two, or three, or even single villages were given to applicants, while the Gond ryots were swamped by foreign settlers. It is clear that under such a system the only bond that united the whole country was their common dependence upon a united authority, and when that authority was weakened by the gradual decay of the ruling race, the Marathas met with little or no opposition when they invaded the country.\n\nThe first Maratha invasion took place in A.D. 1741, when Bhaskar Pandit, while on his way to attack Bengal, defeated the Marathas.\n\nConquest of Chattisgarh by Raghunath Singh, the representative of the older branch of the Haihai-Bansi race, at Ratanpur; but neither he nor Mohan Singh, who was put in charge of Chattisgarh by Raghoji Bhonsle, raja of Nagpur, in 1745, seems to have at first interfered with Amar Singh, the representative of the younger branch ruling in Rajpuri. He continued to administer the government till 1750, when he was quietly ousted, and received for his maintenance the parganas of Rajm, Patan, and Rajpuri, for which he paid a yearly tribute of Rs. 7,000. On his death, in 1753, his son Seoraj Singh was absent on a pilgrimage, and the Maratha government confiscated the parganas; but when Bimbaji, the younger brother of Janoji, the heir of Raghoji, assumed the government in 1757, he gave Seoraj Singh the village of Bargao in the Rajpuri tashil free of revenue, and one rupee on every village in the district for his maintenance. This arrangement continued till 1822, when in lieu of one rupee on every village in the district, Raghunath Singh, son of Seoraj Singh, received the villages of Govind, Murben, Nandgaon, and Balleswar, all near Bargao, free of revenue, and these he still holds. When the Marathas undertook the government of the country, decay had already in all probability reduced it to a state very much inferior to that which it had attained during the earlier days of the Haihai-Bansi rule; and the raids of the Binjwars of Sonakhana (a tribe allied to the Bhinjiyas living in the hills to the east of Laun, between the Mahanadi and the Jonk) had seriously affected the prosperity of the eastern parganas of Laun, Sirpur, Khalari, and the eastern portion of Rajpuri, and a continuance of these disorders gradually caused their almost total depopulation. So entirely was the country ruined that the revenue of the three first named tracts, which had amounted to Rs. 63,160 in A.D. 1563, was reduced to between 3,000 and 4,000 Nagpur rupees in A.D. 1817, and it is only within the last few years that they have begun to recover their original prosperity. After the assumption of the government of Chattisgarh by Bimbaji, order was maintained, though chiefly by the strong hand of military rule, and some efforts were made to harmonise the Maratha and Chattisgarh institutions, which had already been assimilated by the influx of immigrants accustomed to the village system of Upper India. On his death in 1787 his widow, Anandi Bai, managed the country for a year, and was succeeded by a subadar, Vitthal Divakar, who is said to have introduced a form of pargana accounts on the village system known to the Marathas. After his time the government seems to have degenerated into anarchy: insurrections were, as is stated by Colonel Agnew, frequent, and the revenue of the khalsa lands was raised in the eighteen years between 1799 and 1817 from Rs. 1,26,000 to Rs. 3,83,000. The character of the administration may be judged from the description of Major Agnew in 1819, who says that the country \"presented one\nuniform scene of plunder and oppression, uninfluenced by any considerations but that of collecting, by whatsoever means, the largest amount possible.\"*\n\nAfter the deposition of A'p\u00e1 S\u00e1hib in 1818 the country was taken under British administration. British superintendence during the minority of the younger Raghjot, and Captain Edmonds was the first officer put in charge of Chhattisgarh. He, however, had scarcely succeeded in putting down the disturbances in Dongargarh, in the west of the district, when he died, a few months after his arrival, and was succeeded by Colonel Agnew. This officer, whose name is still well remembered throughout the country, was superintendent from 1818 to 1825. His first task on assuming charge was to put down the pretended heirs of the Gond r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Dhand\u00e1, who had rebelled, and to compel the Binjw\u00e1r chief of Son\u00e1kh\u00e1n to give up the government lands he had usurped during the disturbances. Having restored peace, and adjusted the large balances of revenue shown as due in the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 accounts, he proceeded to organise the civil administration. In doing so his leading principle was to work as much as possible through the people themselves, and under his mild, but firm administration the country rapidly began to improve. The clearance of the fertile black-soil tracts to the south of Dhamtar\u00ed and B\u00e1lod, the greater part of the R\u00e1j\u00edm pargana and that of the eastern part of R\u00e1jp\u00far, which had been allowed to lapse into jungle, was commenced, and everywhere the area under cultivation increased. But the progress of the country is best shown by the revenue of the kh\u00e1l\u00e1s of Chhattisgarh, which increased from Rs. 3,31,470 in 1818 to Rs. 4,03,224 in 1825, or over twenty-one per cent in eight years.\n\nFrom 1830 till 1854, when Chhattisgarh with the rest of the dominions of the N\u00e1gpur R\u00e1j\u00e1 lapsed to the British Government, Chhattisgarh was governed by s\u00fabas; but the general system followed was the same as that organised by Colonel Agnew. The country seems to have been on the whole well administered; and it might have improved rapidly had it not been for the famines of 1835 and 1844, which checked the increase of the population and ruined many villages. However, on the whole, progress was made, and the district was in a much more flourishing condition when taken over in 1854 than when Colonel Agnew received charge in 1818. The revenue of R\u00e1jp\u00far alone in 1855\u2014the year after the annexation\u2014amounted to 2,78,536 Company's rupees, equal to about 3,25,886 N\u00e1gpur rupees, or very nearly the revenue paid by the whole of Chhattisgarh in 1818.\n\nThe first officer appointed to the charge of Chhattisgarh after the annexation was Captain Elliot. His jurisdiction, of which the limits were the same as in the time of Colonel Agnew, included not only the whole of Chhattisgarh, but also Bastar\u2014an extent of country which necessitated at first the continuance of a system of patriarchal government similar to that instituted by Colonel Agnew; but from 1856, when the country was divided into three tahsils, of which two\u2014Dhamtar\u00ed and R\u00e1jp\u00far\u2014were in the R\u00e1jp\u00far district, a more regular system began to be introduced. In 1857 Dr\u00fag was made a tahsil, and in 1861 Bil\u00e1sp\u00far was separated from R\u00e1jp\u00far, and in 1863 a fourth tahsil at Simg\u00e9, completing the number now existing, was added to R\u00e1jp\u00far. R\u00e1jp\u00far suffered but little during the mutiny, the only disturbances being those which were excited by N\u00e1r\u00e1yan Singh of\n\n* R\u00e1jp\u00far MSS. records.\nSon\u00e1kh\u00e1n. He was hanged in 1858, and his estate confiscated. Since that time the Binjw\u00e1r raids into the east of the district have been completely discontinued, and the flourishing tracts of Lann, Sirp\u00far, and Khal\u00e1ri, which had so long suffered from the oppression of these hill tribes, are rapidly becoming one of the most flourishing portions of the district.\n\nThe first census taken in Chhatt\u00edsgarh seems to have been that made in 1820-21 by Colonel Agnew. It is not clear what area it comprised, but even if it was confined to the population of the kh\u00e1l\u015ba area of Bil\u00e1sipur and R\u00e1lp\u00far, the number of 571,915 inhabitants would only give about fifty persons to the square mile. If this could be relied on as an accurate enumeration of the people, it would show more forcibly than any words could do the wretched condition to which the country was then reduced. The next census taken was on the night of the 5th November 1866. The population then counted amounted to 952,754 souls, or about 101 persons to the square mile over the whole area of the kh\u00e1l\u015ba and the Chhatt\u00edsgarh zamind\u00e1ris, exclusive of the Feudatories and the wild tracts of Khari\u00e1r and Bindr\u00e1 Naw\u00e1garh. In the kh\u00e1l\u015ba the total population was 835,874 souls, giving, after deducting the 1,350 square miles of uninhabited waste, an average of about 130 persons to the square mile; while in the more populous portions of the Dhamtar\u00ed tahsil the population is from 210 to 230 per square mile. In the Feudatory estates the population was found to amount to 317,275 souls, giving an average of about 108 persons, or if the wild tract of K\u00e1nker be excluded, about 140 to the square mile; while in Khari\u00e1r and Bindr\u00e1 Naw\u00e1garh the total population was only 52,633 souls, or about eighteen to the square mile.\n\nThe population of R\u00e1lp\u00far has been recruited from all quarters; but the most important immigrants, and the earliest after the first great Gond invasion, are those who have come from the north. From the east the immigration has been very small, and the immigrants consist chiefly of a few wild wanderers in the jungles, while from the south and west there has been a considerable influx of population. Of the immigrant tribes, the Kurmis, Tel\u00eds, Lodh\u00eds, Cham\u00e1rs, Ahirs or G\u00e1ir\u00e1s, G\u00e1nd\u00e1s, and Kanwars seem to have come from the north, though a large section of Tel\u00eds and some few Kurmis have come from N\u00e1gp\u00far. The greater number of immigrants from the south and west are Halb\u00e1s from Bastar and Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1, and Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. The principal cultivating castes are Kurmis, Tel\u00eds, Cham\u00e1rs, and Halb\u00e1s, though of these only the Kurmis and Tel\u00eds are large landholders.\n\nThe Cham\u00e1rs lay claim to a very high antiquity among the inhabitants of the district; but the truth of their assertions appears open to doubt. They all call themselves Raid\u00e1s\u00eds\u2014a name which none of them can explain, but which evidently comes from Rai D\u00e1s\u2014a Cham\u00e1r reformer and disciple of R\u00e1m\u00e1nand, who is said to have lived about the fifteenth century in the country lying to the south of Oudh and in Rew\u00e1. The creed he preached seems to have been very similar to that of Gh\u00e1s\u00ed D\u00e1s, the celebrated Satn\u00e1m\u00ed teacher, who started the great movement among the Cham\u00e1rs fifty years ago, which has excited so much attention, and who seems rather to have revived the teaching of Rai D\u00e1s than preached a new religion. The name of Satn\u00e1m\u00ed was that assumed by the followers of Rai D\u00e1s, and the constant reference to his name shows that his doctrine must have sunk deeply into their minds before they came to Chhatt\u00edsgarh, as there is no trace of Rai D\u00e1s having ever visited the country. Again, the\nCham\u00e1rs are chiefly found in the north-west of the district, there being very few south of the R\u00e1ip\u00far tahsil, and they have never, like the Gonds, Tells, and Ah\u00edrs, spread all over the district\u2014a fact which seems to show that they are immigrants of a comparatively late date. It is generally supposed that the names of \"Satn\u00e1m\u00eds\" and Cham\u00e1rs are synonymous; but this is by no means the case, as the Satn\u00e1m\u00ed religion does not refuse to receive proselytes from any class. But as the Cham\u00e1rs form the majority of the sect, and as no distinctions of caste are admitted among its members, all converts of other castes become, in the eyes of the Hind\u00fas, Cham\u00e1rs. Under the influence of Gh\u00e1s\u00ed D\u00e1s a considerable number of men of other castes became Satn\u00e1m\u00eds, especially Ah\u00edrs, and similar accessions must have taken place from time to time, otherwise it is hard to account for the very large numbers of Cham\u00e1rs found in the district. As a class, too, they do not present the same degraded appearance as their brethren in other parts of India, and as a rule they are lighter in colour than the members of other cultivating castes, while some of the men, and many of the women, are remarkable for good looks.\n\nAlthough the Cham\u00e1rs are, in the parts of the district where they are chiefly found, by far the most numerous of all the castes, they have failed in securing a leading position in any part of the country. They are looked down upon by the Hind\u00fas; the Cham\u00e1r, and Hind\u00fa \"P\u00e1r\u00e1s,\" in villages where both classes are found, being always separate and distinct; but at the same time the Cham\u00e1r ryots are a power in the land. As a class they always act together, and are persistent assertors of their rights, real and fancied, and a terror to encroaching m\u00e1lguz\u00e1rs, few being found bold enough to stand up against the resistance of Cham\u00e1r ryots to unpopular measures. Outwardly though, as Satn\u00e1m\u00eds, scrupulous about their eating, they are slovenly and untidy in their habits, and the houses of even the wealthiest of them are generally miserable hovels. They are generally industrious though careless cultivators, and frugal in the extreme, indulging in no extravagance in dress or jewellery. The dress of the men is usually a single cloth, one end of which encircles their loins and another their head, and the women wear little or no jewellery; yet they rarely make money, and seem to want the talent of getting on in the world. Their villages are seldom prosperous, though there are some few m\u00e1lguz\u00e1rs who form conspicuous exceptions to the rule. Though this apparent inability to improve their position is partly due to Hind\u00fa opposition, yet one great cause of the phenomenon seems to be their individual fickleness and want of perseverance. A very slight cause will send a Cham\u00e1r cultivator away from his village, and though they generally return after a short interval, yet these migrations must necessarily hinder the accumulation of property.\n\nThe G\u00e1nd\u00e1s or Pank\u00e1s deserve notice as Kab\u00edranth\u00eds, or followers of Kab\u00edr G\u00e1nd\u00e1s\u2014a founder of a sect who is said to have appeared in the weaver caste, in the same country, and at the same time, as Rai D\u00e1s, both being disciples of R\u00e1m\u00e1nand, and their doctrines being similar in many respects. Though they cultivate the land, they are not generally esteemed as cultivators, while the few villages they hold as land-holders are miserable in the extreme.\n\nThe Kanwars are usually looked upon as aborigines, and though their appearance and their preference for the jungles to the cultivated tracts, as well as their abstinence from Hind\u00fa observances, would seem to point to this opinion, there is also some ground for supposing them to be imperfect Rajputs, who settled in early\ntimes among the hills of the Vindhyan range, and so failed in becoming Hind\u00faised like other warlike immigrants. Probably they are of Turanian origin, but they seem to be distinct from the Kolarian and Dravidian races. Early documents extant at Ratanpur show that they conquered the north-east of the Bilaspur district from the Bhuy\u00e1s; and there can be little or no doubt that the chief counsellors and the most trusted followers of the Haihai-Bans\u00ed princes were Kanwars. It was to Kanwar chiefs that they entrusted the hill fortresses of Bilaspur on their descent into the plains; while the assistance rendered by the Kanwars in the conquest of the south of Rajp\u00far and Bastar was rewarded by large grants of land, which are still held by their descendants in Dhamtari, the Gundardehi Zamind\u00e1r and the Talukadar of Bhutideh\u00ed being both descendants of these colonists. They have always made a claim, though in a half-hearted way, to be considered as Rajputs connected with the Tuar tribe of the North-West, and their claim has certainly been recognised in one instance, as the first Kanwar chief of Narr\u00e1 received his estate as a dowry with the daughter of the Rajput chief of Khari\u00e1r. Though the warlike traditions of the race are preserved in their worship of Jh\u00e1g\u00e1 Kh\u00e1nd (or Jh\u00e1g\u00e1 Kh\u00e1nd\u00e1) under the form of a sword\u2014a form of worship not uncommon among Rajput tribes, and recalling to mind the sword which was the national deity of the Huns under Attila\u2014yet whatever they may have been originally, the Kanwars of the present day are the most peaceable and quiet of men, and, when once fairly settled in a cultivated country, are industrious and good cultivators and landlords. In the jungles they have conformed generally to the customs of their neighbours, and worship D\u00fal\u00e1 Deo and Burh\u00e1 Deo, as their Gond brethren do; and they always seem to be ready to take up with the belief of those about them, though all of them, except the richer classes, who wish to be considered good Hind\u00fas, avoid Br\u00e1hmans. They bury their dead; and marriages are performed before the elders of the village. In the kh\u00e1l\u00e1s they are chiefly found in the north-east of the district, and, except the colony in Dhamtari, they are rarely found in other parts, though they are numerous in the feudatory states.\n\nThe Halb\u00e1s are immigrants from the South, and are only found in large numbers in the south of the district, their principal colony being in the south-west of the Drug tahsil, where they hold thirty-seven flourishing villages. They gain their living chiefly by distilling spirits; and worship a pantheon of glorified distillers, at the head of whom is Bah\u00e1dur Kal\u00e1l. But this description most probably applies only to a section of the tribe. In this district they are, next to the Tel\u00eds, the best cultivators in the jungle-villages, and show themselves quite able to hold their own in the open country, where their villages are always prosperous. Except in the jungles, they have generally become Hind\u00faised, and abandoned most of their peculiar observances, but in the jungles they maintain their traditional customs and usages. Their religion does not impose an elaborate or frequently-repeated ceremonial. All that is necessary for a good Halb\u00e1 is that he should sacrifice once in his life three goats and a pig, one to each of the national deities, called N\u00e1r\u00e1yan Gos\u00e1\u00edn, Burh\u00e1 Deo, Sat\u00ed, and Ratn\u00e1. Of these, the two former are male, and the two latter female divinities, and it is to N\u00e1r\u00e1yan Gos\u00e1\u00edn that the pig is sacrificed. But though their own religion imposes no heavy burden on them, they yield to no tribe in their superstition and devotion to the local deities, who abound on every high hill and under every green tree. There is nothing peculiar in their form of marriage; but they bury their dead, and worship their ancestors, prayers to a deceased father being supposed to be very efficacious against the attack of a tiger.\nOf the purely aboriginal tribes the Gonds are alone of importance, and taking the area of the whole district, they form the most numerous section of the population. Though the oldest settlers in the country, they have succumbed to the Hind\u00fa invaders, and are now rarely found holding villages, except in the jungles, the average revenue of the 294 villages in the possession of Gond m\u00e1lguz\u00e1s being only eighty-nine rupees. In the open country they are almost entirely Hind\u00faised; and though some of them show energy and industry, yet generally speaking they are a down-trodden race, and rarely attain wealth or comfort. In the jungles also the old religion of the tribe is disappearing, and while all Gonds worship Burh\u00e1 Deo and D\u00fal\u00e1 Deo (the latter being the household god), they know little of Paur\u00edtol\u00e1 (or Kar\u00edtol\u00e1), Barangasura, and Gum\u00e1rtol\u00e1, who, with Burh\u00e1 Deo, form the distinctive gods of the Dh\u00far Gonds, to which tribe most of the Chhatt\u00edsgarh Gonds belong. They are all intensely superstitious, and worship the numerous local deities assiduously; though, except in the jungles, the Baig\u00e1 or village priest, whose business it is to propitiate the evil spirits of the neighbourhood, is as often as not a Kewat, Teli, or Ahir, as a Gond. The other aboriginal tribes are the Bijnjw\u00e1s, Bhunj\u00edy\u00e1s, S\u00e1onr\u00e1s, N\u00e1hars, and Kam\u00e1s. Of these the Bijnjw\u00e1s are allied to the Baig\u00e1s, who are found in the Mandla district. They chiefly live in the north-east of R\u00e1ip\u00far, and occasionally cultivate. The Bhunj\u00edy\u00e1s are comparatively numerous all through the east of the district, and are particularly so in the Khari\u00e1r and Bindr\u00e1 Naw\u00e1g\u00e1rh zamind\u00e1r\u00eds, where they hold a good many fairly-cultivated villages. The S\u00e1onr\u00e1s are only found in Khal\u00e1r\u00ed in the east of the R\u00e1ip\u00far tahsil. They are very few in number, but are the most industrious of all the jungle tribes. The N\u00e1hars and Kam\u00e1s utterly refuse to cultivate, and generally live in the most remote jungles, supporting themselves on jungle-fruits and small game. All these jungle tribes seem to have come from Orissa, and their dialects are all akin to Uriya. Except the S\u00e1onr\u00e1s, they all gain their livelihood more by collecting jungle produce than by cultivation.\n\nThe largest landholders are the Br\u00e1hmans, who hold 606 villages, and of these 185 are held by Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 Br\u00e1hmans and recent immigrants, while the remainder are in the hands of residents of long standing in the district, whose families, as tradition asserts, were brought from Kan\u00f3j by Kaly\u00e1n Sah\u00ed, the great Hailhai-Bans\u00ed r\u00e1j\u00e1, in the sixteenth century. These Chhatt\u00edsgarh Br\u00e1hmans are regarded as impure by their brethren who have more recently left the land of orthodoxy, and they are said to be exceedingly immoral; but they make good landlords, and are not unpopular with their ryots. The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 Br\u00e1hmans and other Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 proprietors are all of recent origin, and the villages held by them have for the most part been cleared and peopled by their relations. This is, however, chiefly true of the Dhamtar\u00ed tahsil in R\u00e1ip\u00far. Almost all the villages held by Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 Br\u00e1hmans have been acquired by the ousting of older proprietors. The R\u00e1ip\u00fat and Baniy\u00e1 proprietors, who between them hold fifty-five villages, for the most part belong to families who have been settled in Chhatt\u00edsgarh for generations, and but few of the villages originally held by these castes are in the hands of strangers. The R\u00e1ip\u00fats are generally descendants of immigrants from the north, though in the Dhamtar\u00ed tahsil there are some few who have come from the Jaipur state under the Madras Government, and it is only this latter class who will hold the plough. The remainder of the landholding classes, with the exception of the Gos\u00e1ins, are all cultivators.\nBesides the cultivating and landowning classes, there are some others which may not be considered undeserving of notice. Of these the most important are the Banj\u00e1r\u00e1s or carriers, of whom a large number are found in the district. They are, however, retreating to the east as the jungle disappears; and it is most probable that, as the kh\u00e1lsa lands are cleared, they will leave these tracts and betake themselves to the jungles of the zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs, where alone they can find pasturage for their cattle. The Beld\u00e1rs or Uriyas are an interesting caste. They are tank-diggers by profession, and are all under the command of a chief called a jam\u00e1d\u00e1r, who holds three villages in the district. Under the jam\u00e1d\u00e1r are a number of n\u00e1iks, each of whom has the command of a gang. These gangs have no settled home, but go wandering about the district wherever they can get work. They rendered good services in the expedition against N\u00e1r\u00e1y\u00e1n Singh, the Son\u00e1kh\u00e1n zam\u00ednd\u00e1r, in 1858, and their chief was rewarded by the grant of two villages in the Dr\u00fag tahsil, which are held free of revenue.\n\nThe great staple produce of Chhatt\u00edsgarh is rice, and it would appear to have been at one time almost the only crop grown. At present the ryots in the jungles rarely grow rab\u00ed crops, alleging that the labour of watching both khar\u00edf and rab\u00ed is too much for them; and it is the rice crop alone that is under the special protection of Th\u00e1kur Deo, the great local deity, and his priest the Baig\u00e1; while the important question as to the time of sowing the more modern wheat crop, the colour of the bullocks to be yoked to the plough, and the direction in which the sower is to proceed, are referred to the Purohit. The ryot who cultivates both khar\u00edf and rab\u00ed crops, called locally \"sy\u00e1ri\" and \"unh\u00e1ri,\" leads by no means an idle life; though, as he has little to fear from theft or from wild animals, except in the comparatively few villages near the jungle, he has not to undergo the labour of watching and fencing, and consequently has not to work so hard during certain seasons as the people of most other districts of the Central Provinces. In the hot weather he begins by preparing the land for the \"sy\u00e1ri\" crops, and planting sugarcane, if he is fortunate enough to be able to get a little land below the village tank. After the first heavy fall of rain he must sow his rice, and the sowing of the rice is rapidly followed by that of the kodo, cotton, arhar, and til crops. During the rains his time is occupied in tending his rice and other khar\u00edf crops, and in ploughing the land for rab\u00ed. In October the rab\u00ed crops are sown; and the khar\u00edf harvest begins and lasts during November up to the beginning of December. As soon as it is over, the rice and kodo has to be trodden out, the sugarcane cut, and the remainder of the year is taken up with the cutting of the rab\u00ed crops, winnowing, husking, and storing the produce, any spare time being devoted to selling his crop, or bringing in timber and grass from the jungles. Besides rice the principal khar\u00edf crops are kodo, arhar, til, and cotton. For all of these the land is ploughed twice before sowing, and the seed is sown broadcast. In hard soils the seed is raked in with the \"dat\u00e1ri\" after sowing, but in black soils this is not necessary. Cotton and kodo are weeded, but the other crops are left to themselves after being sown. Kodo is a grain of great importance to the country, as it is the food of the greater number of the poorer classes, and one much appreciated for its prolific yield (often a hundred-fold), and for its satisfying qualities. Another advantage is that it does not require so much water as rice, and will yield a fine crop in a year when, from a deficient rainfall, there is a small yield of rice. A pound of kodo will be an ample meal for a full-grown man, who would eat double the quantity\nof rice. Arhar or t\u00fbr is principally grown in the west of the district, and two kinds are known\u2014the small and early arhar called \"harona,\" and the large and later kind called \"m\u00eel\u00ee.\" Both are sown at the same time, but the former ripens about two months before the latter. Of til there are also two kinds\u2014the white and black til, the former sown in the beginning of July, and the latter in the beginning of August. Both til and arhar are frequently sown in the same field with kodo. The cotton of the district is very poor, and is principally used for home consumption, what little is exported being chiefly from the feudatory states and the western zam\u00eend\u00e2ris, where the quality is slightly superior to that grown in the kh\u00e2lsa.\n\nThe fields in which the unh\u00e2ri or cold-weather crop is sown are called Rab\u00ee cultivation and sugarcane. locally \"Barhi.\" The principal and most valuable grain is wheat, which is only sown in the best soils after repeated ploughings. For gram and castor-oil the soil is generally by the better class of ryots prepared as carefully as for wheat; but most content themselves with ploughing the land only once or twice, both for these as for the other rab\u00ee crops. Sugarcane is a crop of which the area is yearly increasing, and though the produce of the small canes of Chhattisgarh is scanty as compared with that of the larger Otaheite cane, yet it is one of the most valuable crops a ryot can grow, even if the great labour attending the cultivation is taken into account. For sugarcane the land must be ploughed ten times at least, and the clods thoroughly pulverised. It is grown from cuttings, which are planted in the open about the end of April or beginning of May, and the crop must then be watered thrice daily till the rains begin; after that, if the rains are plentiful, artificial irrigation is not much required till the end of the rainy season, but from that time till the crop is cut it must be regularly carried on.\n\nThe rotation of crops is, as might be supposed, utterly unknown in Chhattisgarh; but there is a theory current that the proper crop to sow in newly broken-up black soil is linseed, which is generally followed by kodo, after which wheat or some more valuable crop is sown. On the whole the agriculture of the R\u00e9p\u00fbr district is exceedingly slovenly,\u2014the result not so much of any want of industry on the part of the ryots, as of the smallness of the population, the bad distribution of land resulting from district customs, the inferiority of the cattle, and want of means.\n\nThe forests of the district surround the cultivation on all sides except to the north; but though they occupy an area of at least 5,000 square miles, with the exception of the great sal forests of Sehaw\u00e1 and Bindr\u00e1 Naw\u00e1g\u00e2rh, and that along the Kamtar\u00e2 n\u00e1l\u00ee in the Deori and Kaur\u00ee zam\u00eend\u00e2ris, they are of but little value as timber-yielding tracts; nor do they present many attractions to the settler, as the forest-country is almost all hilly and stony, with but little arable soil. In former times teak grew luxuriantly along the banks of all the rivers and n\u00e1l\u00ees, but of these vast forests there are only scanty remains now left, and among these only the forests on the Ud\u00e9t river in the Khari\u00e1r and Bindr\u00e1 Naw\u00e1g\u00e2rh zam\u00eend\u00e2ris, and that in the south-west of the K\u00e1nker feudatory state, contain any good timber available for present use. In addition to the regular forests there are large tracts containing teak trees, more or less advanced in growth. The most important are those in the Gandai and Loh\u00e2r\u00e2 zam\u00eend\u00e2ris\u2014along the sources of the S\u00fbrfi and its tributary streams in the former, and along the Korkar\u00e2\nriver and the south-western valleys in the latter estate. Besides sal and teak the other timber trees found in the Chattisgarh jungle are, saj (pentaptera tomentosa), bahera (terminalia bellerica), dhauri (conocarpus latifolia), tendu (diospyros melanoxylon), bijesal (pterocarpus marsupium), kawal (terminalia arjuna), hardu (nauclea parviflora), mhowa (bassia latifolia), tinsal (dalbergia ooegeinensis), shisham (dalbergia latifolia), gambhari (gmelina arborea), rohat (soymida febrifuga); but except mhowa, few fine specimens of these trees are to be found in the khalsa jungles, except on the sides of some of the hills to the east of the Mahanadi in Laun, Sirpur, and Khalari. In the less elevated jungles of Khalari and Dhamtari there is a fair number of good bijesal trees; and among the hills of the Gauragarh plateau, as well as on the high range in the south of Bindra Nawagarh and Schawa, where the Pairi and Sundar take their rise, there are noble forests of saj and tendu. Fine specimens of tinsal, shisham, and rohat are very rare. The mhowa is common everywhere, and is the one tree which is always preserved when other trees are cleared away. It is, however, especially abundant in the jungles of the Dhamtari tahsil. Other useful jungle trees and shrubs commonly found are, kusam (schleichera trijuga), palas (butea frondosa), khair (acacia catechu), dhauri or dhowai (grislea tomentosa), makur tendu or wild mangosteen (garcinia mangostana), aunla (phyllanthus emblica), jamun (syzygium jambolanum) bel (aglae marmelos), chironji (buchanania latifolia), kurri (gardenia lucida), gular (ficus racemosa), gurla (sterculia urens), silat (boswellia serrata), harsingar (nyctanthes arbor-tristis), sendh or dwarf palm. The arnotto shrub (bizza orellana), the kuchla (strychnos nux-vomica), and the ningar (rottlera tinctoria), are also found, but are rare. The arnotto shrub is very commonly grown by the better class of ryots near their houses.\n\nThe trade in jungle-produce in Raiapur is still in its infancy, and many products which are valued in other parts of the country are either unknown or disregarded in Chattisgarh. The products which are regarded as most valuable are bamboos, thatching-grass, and lac. Bamboos are becoming scarcer every year, and it is only in the remote jungles in the hills to the north-east of the Raiapur tahsil, in those of the north-western zamindaris, or in the still more remote forests of Khariar, Bindra Nawagarh, and Schawa, that they are found in any great quantity. Thatching-grass will probably long continue to be greatly in demand, as the clay of Raiapur is not well adapted for tile-making, and potters are everywhere rare. The best thatching-grass, called locally \"gandli,\" only grows on first-class black soil, and is chiefly found in the fertile tracts of Laun in the north-east of the Raiapur and the east of the Simga tahsils, and it is regarded as so valuable that a plot of thatching-grass will fetch nearly as high a rent as a similar area of cultivation. The lac trade owes its origin to the Mirzapur and Jabalpur merchants, who export yearly large quantities from Raiapur. Lac is chiefly produced on the kusam and palas trees; but the produce of the former is twice as valuable as that of the latter. The mode of propagation on both trees is similar, but takes place at different seasons of the year. The propagation of the most important crop\u2014that of the kusam lac\u2014is begun at the end of January or February. At that time freshly-cut sticks on which the lac insect has made its cells are wrapped in bundles of grass, and tied on to the branches of the tree on which the new lac is to be grown, four bundles being generally the complement for one tree; and from these centres the insects propagate themselves in all directions, covering all the smaller twigs with their excretions. The crop is collected in the month of November or December following the\nsowing, and the yield very much depends upon the quantity of rain,\u2014light rains bringing a light crop. The process of propagating lac on the p\u00e1l\u00e1s tree is similar to that described above, except that it is begun in September and October, and the crop is gathered in the following July. The cultivation of the lac is the occupation of the wild Gonds, Bhunjiy\u00e1s, N\u00e1hars, and Kam\u00e1s of the jungles; and they sell the crop to middlemen, who again dispose of it to the great dealers, who live chiefly in Dhamtar\u00ed, B\u00e1lod, and R\u00e1j\u00edm. Other articles of jungle-produce are dye from the dengl\u00e1,* dh\u00e1ur\u00e1, or dhow\u00e1i shrubs, fruits of the wild mangosteen, the gardenia lucida, the gardenia grandiflora, j\u00e1mun, bel, gular, and chironj\u00ed, oil from the kusam, mhowa, gurl\u00fa and gardenia lucida, the last yielding the dik\u00e1m\u00e1l\u00ed oil so useful as a plaster for wounds, dried mhowa flowers, gum from the gurl\u00fa and s\u00e1\u00edf trees, charcoal, s\u00e1\u00ed bark for tanning, bees\u2019 wax, and wild arrowroot. Tas\u00e1r cocoons are occasionally brought to the Dhamtar\u00ed and R\u00e1j\u00edm markets by the jungle tribes; but the greater number of those brought are wild: and but little attempt has been made to propagate the tas\u00e1r worm, though the large number of s\u00e1\u00ed trees in the jungles afford peculiar facilities for doing so. Only Kewats will attend to the cultivation. The value of the khair tree is utterly unknown to the people, and though it abounds in the jungles, no attempt has, so far as is known, been ever made to extract catechu from it.\n\nThe trade of R\u00e1jp\u00far may be said to have been created only since the country came under British rule, for, before, the transit duties levied by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 Government were an almost total bar to its development in these remote tracts; and though those who exported produce from Chhatt\u00edsgarh made large profits, owing to the extraordinary cheapness of grain, yet it was only after the establishment of the British Government, and the restoration of tranquillity after the Mutiny, that the trade reached such proportions as to have any great effect upon prices. Even at present the export trade only is of importance. The only branch of import trade which universally affects the people is that in metals; while that in English piece-goods has not penetrated beyond the official and mercantile classes and the wealthier m\u00e1lguz\u00e1rs, the great bulk of the people still taking the produce of their patch of cotton to the native weavers (one or more of whom are to be found in most villages), to be converted into clothing for themselves and families. These weavers form a prosperous class, who export a good deal of coarse cloth, and make money. The following table shows the trade of the district for 1868-69:\n\n|                | Cotton. | Sugar. | Salt. | Edible Grains. |\n|----------------|---------|--------|-------|---------------|\n|                | Weight. | Value. | Weight. | Value. | Weight. | Value. | Weight. | Value. |\n| Mds.

Its botanical name is uncertain.\nOf this trade by far the most important part is that between R\u00e1ip\u00far and N\u00e1gp\u00far, which follows two principal routes\u2014one along the Great Eastern Road, and the other by a line about twenty miles to the north, passing through the town of Khair\u00e1g\u00e1rh, and thence by K\u00e1mth\u00e1 and Tumsar in Bhand\u00e1ra to N\u00e1gp\u00far. The trade with the Eastern Coast is chiefly carried over a route running south-east through Fingeswar and the north-east of the Bindr\u00e1 Naw\u00e1g\u00e1rh zam\u00edn\u00edd\u00e1r\u00eds, whence it turns due south through the valley of Khari\u00e1r, and thence through Jun\u00e1g\u00e1rh and Jaipur to the coast. This route is joined in the Jaipur state by another running south from Seh\u00e1w\u00e1, along which a great deal of the traffic passes. The trade with Jabalp\u00far is not as yet of much importance to the district generally, and little of the produce, except that of a portion of the north-west of the district, follows this route. The two principal lines along which this traffic is carried are, that by the Chilp\u00ed Gh\u00e1t in the Bil\u00e1spt\u00e1r district by Bindr\u00e1 to Mandla, and that over the Mois\u00e1r or Pipardh\u00e1r gh\u00e1ts in the Gand\u00e1i and Loh\u00e1r\u00e1 Sahasp\u00far zam\u00edn\u00edd\u00e1r\u00eds of this district, and thence by the village of Bher, about ten or twelve miles to the south of Mandla, to Jabalp\u00far. Besides these routes, others less frequented are those through B\u00e1lod and Daund\u00ed in the Daund\u00ed Loh\u00e1r\u00e1 zam\u00edn\u00edd\u00e1r\u00ed to Wair\u00e1g\u00e1rh on the Waingang\u00e1 in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, and that via Dh\u00e1mt\u00e1r\u00ed and K\u00e1nk\u00e9r to Bastar and the God\u00e1v\u00e1r\u00ed.\n\nAdministration.\n\nThe imperial revenues of the district are as follows:\n\n| Description       | Value |\n|-------------------|-------|\n| Land              | Rs.   6,34,175 |\n| Excise            | Rs.   24,904   |\n| Stamps            | Rs.   34,220   |\n| Forest            | Rs.   14,136   |\n| Customs           | Rs.   2,09,681 |\n| Assessed taxes    | Rs.   25,664   |\n| **Total**         | Rs.   9,42,780 |\n\nThe district staff consists ordinarily of a Deputy Commissioner, three Assistant Commissioners or Extra-Assistant Commissioners, four Tahsild\u00e1rs or Sub-Collectors, and a Civil Surgeon. The police number 496 of all ranks, under a District Superintendent. They have station-houses at R\u00e1ip\u00far, A\u2019rang, Dhamt\u00e1r\u00ed, Dr\u00fag, Simg\u00e1, B\u00e1lod, Dhamd\u00fa, War\u00e1rb\u00e1ndh, R\u00e1j\u00edm, Narr\u00e1, Laun, and Seh\u00e1w\u00e1, besides twenty-five outposts. The Customs line runs through the district, having patrol stations at Dhamt\u00e1r\u00ed, A\u2019rang, and S\u00e1nkr\u00e1, and a Collector of Customs at R\u00e1ip\u00far.\nEducation can scarcely be said to have as yet made any great progress, and though the fifty-eight schools now in existence, with a daily attendance of 2,355 pupils, show a great advance upon the total blank which existed ten years ago, when there was not a school in the district, yet a great deal of up-hill work remains to be done before any sensible impression can be made on the prevalent mass of ignorance.\n\nThe general condition of the people till within the last few years may be shortly described as one of rude plenty and comparative comfort, combined with utter stagnation\u2014one which almost realised a state which some philosophers have considered as the ideal of happiness. They knew little of the value of time, the division of labour, or the perturbations of trade. Each family had sufficient to support life without exhausting labour, and the wealthiest had little to boast of in point of comfort over his poorer brethren. Debt was only a luxury for a few hardy speculators, and among the landholding population there were very few who owed anything to speak of. As they had no recognised right in their villages, and were liable to be turned out at any time by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 government, no one would lend them anything on the security of their lands; and though their cattle were generally numerous, yet they represented too small a value in money to allow of debts being contracted on such security; and when a m\u00e1lguz\u00e1r was in want of money, his only resource was to give up his village, sell the greater number of his cattle, and take to cultivating on a small scale. The few landed proprietors who are in debt are men introduced lately under the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 rule, who have contracted debts in their capacity of traders, not as landholders.\n\nWith regard to the cultivators, similar causes operated; and though many ryots got seed-grain from the m\u00e1lguz\u00e1r for which they paid twenty-five per cent interest, yet these debts pressed but lightly on them, and as they were generally paid in grain, were almost always settled at the end of each harvest. At present, as far as can be ascertained, about one-third of the ryots borrow seed-grain; but most pay from year to year, and there are few or none who have old accounts pending. Under these circumstances, with an industrious population free from debt, well supplied with grain, and enriched beyond all former example by several years of a trade more active than has been hitherto known, R\u00e1ip\u00far has much to hope, and little to fear, for the future. Except the isolated position of the district, there is nothing to hinder its progress; but at present, where there is so much scope for improvement within its limits, this hindrance will not be much felt, and it can wait in patience for the day when it will be brought nearer to the outer world, and when perhaps it may find itself called on to supply the necessities of manufacturing centres yet to be created for the development of the metallic wealth of the hills of Central India.\n\nRAIPUR\u2014The central revenue subdivision or tahsil in the district of the same name, having an area of 3,260 square miles, with 1,195 villages, and a population of 282,453 souls according to the census of 1866. The land revenue of the tahsil for the year 1869-70 is Rs. 1,41,035.\n\nRAIPUR\u2014The only place worthy of being called a town in the district to which it gives its name. It is situated in the midst of an open plain or plateau, at an elevation of some nine hundred and fifty feet above the sea, about one hundred and eighty miles due east of N\u00e1gp\u00far, on the road from that city to Calcutta, via Sambalp\u00far and Midnapur. Of the early history of R\u00e1ip\u00far but little\ncan be gathered, but it would appear to have been a place of little note till the beginning of the ninth century, when a branch of the Ratanpur king's family established its court at R\u00e1jp\u00far. The site of the town in those days was considerably more to the south and west than it is at present, and extended to the banks of the river at Mah\u00e1deo Gh\u00e1t. In A.D. 1818 the country was placed under British superintendence, and Colonel Agnew, who was sent as Superintendent by the British Resident at N\u00e1gp\u00far, moved the head-quarters of his charge from Ratanpur to R\u00e1jp\u00far. From that time some degree of security for property, and confidence in the Government, began to arise, and the town gradually increased. In A.D. 1830 Colonel Agnew laid out what is now the main street of the town. He also encouraged the building of shops and houses on an approved plan, which has greatly added to the appearance of the place. In the same year the country was again made over to the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 Government. The British Superintendent was withdrawn, and S\u00fabas from N\u00e1gp\u00far governed in R\u00e1jp\u00far till A.D. 1854, when the district was finally annexed to the British territories. In that year a civil officer, a military commandant, and a medical officer marched up with the troops, and took up a position on the east side of the town. They each built a house on the spot where they had respectively pitched their tents, and since then eight or ten other houses have sprung up around them. Since 1863 a church, a travellers' bungalow, a district courthouse, central jail, tahs\u00edl, sar\u00e1\u00ed, and market-place have been erected. In the latter part of 1859 Captain Smith, who was then Deputy Commissioner, completed the main street through the town commenced by Colonel Agnew. This street is now nearly two miles in length, and contains a good b\u00e1z\u00e1r and many fine houses, some of them remarkable for the elaborate wood-carving of their pillars and balconies. The town is surrounded by tanks and groves of trees, and has a prosperous appearance.\n\nThe most remarkable of the old buildings is the fort, which is said to have been founded by R\u00e9j\u00e1 Bhuvaneswar Singh in A.D. 1460. A gh\u00e1t in the B\u00farh\u00e1 tank at the main gate of the fort was added by R\u00e9j\u00e1 Tribhuvan Singh of Ratanpur some years after. Before the days of gunpowder the fort must have been a place of immense strength. The ramparts and bastions are built of stone and mud, and were pierced by three large gates and one postern. The main gate near B\u00farh\u00e1 tank, on the north side, was entire when the British took possession of the country in 1818. Immense masses of fine limestone and granite were used in the construction of these walls, though no old quarries exist in the neighbourhood, nor can stones of the same kind and magnitude be procured now without great difficulty. The fort appears to have been nearly a mile in circumference, and to have had five bastions, with connecting-curtains. It was protected on the east by the B\u00farh\u00e1 tank, and on the south and half round the west side by the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00ed tank, while the old town lay on the north and east of it. When knocking down one of the old bastions lately the workmen came upon some old tombs at least twenty feet below the surface, and carefully protected by stone walls. These tombs are probably above four hundred years old, but there was no inscription to tell their history.\n\nThere are numerous tanks and reservoirs in and about the town, of which the B\u00farh\u00e1 tank is the most ancient, being according to tradition coeval with the fort, that is nearly five hundred years old. It lies on the east face of the old fort, and was very large, covering at least one square mile of country, but has lately been reduced in extent and much improved by the local committee, who have constructed a masonry embankment near the north-eastern corner of the fort.\nThe accumulated silt of so many years had reduced this fine tank to the condition of a pestilential swamp in many parts, and it is expected that the recent alterations, by confining the water within well-defined limits, will tend to keep it deeper, and prevent the accumulation of mud. On the east side of this tank public gardens have been laid out. The Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00ed tank was originally a swamp on the south side of the old fort, from which the country falls steadily for nearly half a mile. About one hundred years ago an embankment was constructed half a mile from the fort by one Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j D\u00e1ni\u2014a revenue farmer under the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. This changed the swamp into a fine tank, which was named the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00ed in honour of the maker. Though not deep, it is a large tank covering about half a square mile of ground. To the south of this tank, and close to the embankment, is a temple to R\u00e1mchandra, built and endowed in A.D. 1775 by Bimb\u00e1\u00ed Bhonsl\u00e1, r\u00e1j\u00e1 of R\u00e1ip\u00far. The Koko tank is perhaps the most substantial in the place, and was constructed by one Kodand Singh, kam\u00e1visd\u00e1r of R\u00e1ip\u00far, about forty years ago. It is supposed to have cost about Rs. 30,000, and has stone retaining-walls on three sides, with steps down to the water. Into this tank are thrown the images of Ganpati at the close of the festival of Ganes Chaturth\u00ed. The \u00c1mb\u00e1 tank is supposed to be about two hundred years old, and was originally constructed by a Teli, whose name has been lost. It had got much out of repair about twenty years ago, when it was thoroughly repaired and faced with massive stone terraces, having steps to the water on three sides. This work was done at a cost of Rs. 10,000, by one Sobh\u00e1r\u00e1m Mah\u00e1jan, who is still living in R\u00e1ip\u00far. This tank lies to the north of the town, at about a quarter of a mile distance, and supplies good drinking-water to a large number of the inhabitants. The R\u00e9j\u00e1 tank lies to the west of the city, at about a mile distance. It is said to have been constructed in the days of R\u00e9j\u00e1 Bari\u00e1r Singh, two hundred years ago. One side only is faced with stone. The Teli B\u00e1ndh was constructed by D\u00edn\u00e1n\u00e1th, father of Sobh\u00e1r\u00e1m Mah\u00e1jan, about forty years ago. One side is faced with stone. This tank, though small, holds deep water, and is much valued by the inhabitants. The Kank\u00e1l\u00ed tank is in the middle of the city, and was constructed of stone throughout, about two hundred years ago, by Kirp\u00e1l Gir Mahant, who also built a small temple to Mah\u00e1deva in the middle of it. The water has a fetid smell, and it is disagreeable to come near it; yet the people of the city esteem it highly, and use the water for washing purposes.\n\nR\u00e1ip\u00far has now a considerable trade in grain, lac, cotton, and other produce, and is steadily rising in importance. At the first accession of the British rule, in A.D. 1818, there were only ten or twelve small shopkeepers in the place. The town consisted of about 700 grass huts, with not one tiled or masonry building. Coin was not current, every transaction being carried on in kind or with cowries. Grain sold for four or five khand\u00eds per rupee; lac and cotton were ten rupees a bojha of 176 lbs. The ground now occupied by the district court-house was then covered with low jungle. Tigers and other wild beasts were not unfrequently met with. The population was then computed at between 5,000 and 7,000 souls. In A.D. 1830, when Colonel Agnew, the first British Agent, left the station, R\u00e1ip\u00far had more than doubled in size. As already stated, the main b\u00e1z\u00e1r street had been opened out, and shops formed along both sides of it. The M\u00e1rw\u00e1r\u00eds' shops alone had increased to nearly one hundred in number. The N\u00e1gpur rupee was current in the town itself, but in the district generally cowries were still the only circulating medium. Since 1854, when the N\u00e1gpur State lapsed to the British Government, material and intellectual progress has made rapid strides. Formerly it was difficult to find any man who could read and write sufficiently to keep the\nmost elementary accounts; now the Mah\u00e1jans of the place, as a body, are tolerably well educated. Trade has expanded; competition is to a slight extent beginning to be felt in the ruling prices of the b\u00e1z\u00e1r; and the principles of free trade being strictly enforced, the place is daily increasing both in wealth and importance. The internal trade of the city itself is considerable, upwards of Rs. 20,000 being realised from the octroi duties. The population has increased from about 5,000 in A.D. 1818 to 12,000 in 1830, and to about 17,000 in 1866.\n\nThe garrison consists of a regiment of Native infantry, which is under the orders of the Brigadier-General commanding the K\u00e1mth\u00ed force. As the headquarters of the Chhatt\u00edsgarh division of the Central Provinces, there is at R\u00e1ip\u00far the court, civil and criminal, of a Divisional Commissioner, besides the ordinary district offices. It is also the head-quarters of a Circle of education; and possesses a thriving Anglo-vernacular school, and a Normal school for the training of vernacular masters. There are also a main and branch dispensary, an excellent travellers' bungalow, and a first-class sar\u00e1\u00ed for native travellers; a post-office; a central jail; and a handsome kotw\u00e1l\u00ed or town police station-house.\n\nRAIRA KHOL\u2014A chiefship attached to the Sambalp\u00far district. It was formerly subordinate to B\u00e1mr\u00e1, but was erected into an independent state, and constituted one of the Garhj\u00e1t cluster, by the P\u00e1tna r\u00e1j\u00e1s, about a century ago. It lies between 84\u00b0 and 84\u00b0 48' east longitude, and between 20\u00b0 55' and 21\u00b0 20' north latitude. It is bounded on the north by B\u00e1mr\u00e1, on the east by A\u2019tmalik and Ang\u00fal, on the west by the Sambalp\u00far kh\u00e1lss, and on the south by Sonp\u00far. It is of irregular formation, the extreme length east and west being some fifty miles, and the extreme breadth thirty miles. The mean length is, however, not more than forty miles, and the breadth twenty. The total area may be about eight hundred square miles, of which some three-fifths are cultivated, the rest being dense forest and hill. The soil is light and sandy. There are some fine s\u00e1l forests in the state, and plenty of other useful timber for building purposes, but for want of means of transport it can find no market. The principal rivers are the Chanp\u00e1l\u00ed and the Tikkir\u00e1. They are, however, insignificant streams. The main road from Sambalp\u00far to Cuttack via Ang\u00fal passes through the state to the south; there is also to the northward another road to Cuttack, now fallen into disuse. The climate is similar to that of Sambalp\u00far Proper.\n\nThe census returns for 1866 give the population at 25,000 souls. S\u00e1l resin and bees-wax are the only articles of forest-produce collected. Rice is the staple crop; but the pulses, cotton, oil-seeds, and sugarcane are also produced. The non-agricultural castes are Br\u00e1hmans, R\u00e1jputs, and Mahant\u00eds. The agricultural castes are Tas\u00e1s, Kolt\u00e1s, and Dum\u00e1l\u00eds.\n\nThere is also a sprinkling of the cloth-manufacturing and artisan classes, chiefly iron-smelters and manufacturers of iron implements. Notwithstanding that iron-ore is so plentiful throughout the Sambalp\u00far country, this is the only part of it where smelting is carried on to any extent. Here there are some eight or ten villages, the inhabitants of which are constantly thus employed. Traders from Cuttack come up periodically and carry off the iron on pack-bullocks. The r\u00e1j\u00e1 derives little or no income from the trade; the smelters merely pay him a very trifling tax for the right to work up the ore. It is said that the iron is very good indeed, and that traders make an enormous profit by its sale. The smelters are all deeply in their books for advances, and are therefore compelled to work for them, and them only. The chief is by caste a Chauh\u00e1n R\u00e1jput.\nRA'JA'BORA'RI'\u2014A state forest of about 160 square miles in extent, on the southern border of the Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d district, and extending from S\u00e1ul\u00edgarh on the east to K\u00e1l\u00edbh\u00edt and Makr\u00e1i on the west. It has been much exhausted by indiscriminate cutting, and will require many years' rest.\n\nRA'JGARH\u2014The north-centre pargana of the M\u00fal tahs\u00edl, in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, bounded on the north by the Garhbor\u00ed pargana, on the east by the Waingang\u00e1, on the south by the Gh\u00e1tk\u00fal pargana, and on the west by the parganas of Gh\u00e1tk\u00fal, Hawell, and Garhbor\u00ed. Its area is about 447 square miles, and it contains 140 villages. It is intersected from the north by two branches of the Andh\u00e1ri, which meet about its centre, and a third branch flows along its western boundary in a south-easterly direction. The western and northern portions are hilly and covered with forest. The soil is chiefly sandy, producing rice and sugarcane. Telugu is the general language, the most numerous agricultural class being the K\u00e1pew\u00e1rs. S\u00e1ul\u00ed and M\u00fal are the principal towns. This pargana formerly belonged to the Gond princes of Wair\u00e1g\u00e1rh,\n\nRA'JGHATA'\u2014A small village in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, five miles north-east of Garhchiroli, with a fine irrigation-reservoir.\n\nRA'JI'M\u2014A town in the R\u00e1ip\u00far district, situated on the right bank of the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed at the junction of the Pair\u00ed with that river, and about twenty-four miles to the south-east of R\u00e1ip\u00far. It is celebrated for the temple of R\u00e1jiva Lochan, and for the annual pilgrimage and fair held in his honour in April. The fair lasts for a month, and usually attracts between 20,000 and 30,000 people. In the temple is an image of R\u00e1mchandra,* four feet high, of black stone, in a standing posture, facing the west. It has four arms, holding the four common Hind\u00fa emblems\u2014the sankh (conch), the chakra (discus), the gad\u00e1 (club), and the padma (lotus). Garuda (the bird and vehicle of Vishnu), as usual, faces the god in a posture of devotion, and behind him on a separate terrace are images of Hanum\u00e1n and Jagatp\u00e1l\u2014the king who is said to have built the temple. The latter is in a sitting position. Between these two is a doorway, beautifully sculptured with representations of N\u00e1gas (serpent demi-gods) entwined together in endless folds. This doorway leads to two modern temples of Mah\u00e1deva, and a third behind them is dedicated to the wife of an oil-seller, respecting whom there is a popular story connected with the ancient image of R\u00e1jiva Lochan, which makes her contemporary with Jagatp\u00e1l. In the same court of the great temple are shrines dedicated to Narsinha, W\u00e1man, Var\u00e1ha, Bedr\u00e1n\u00e1th, and Jagann\u00e1th. There are two ancient inscriptions on the walls of the temple of R\u00e1mchandra, one of which bears the date Samvat 796, or A.D. 750. Both of them relate to the origin of Jagatp\u00e1l, and to his prowess in subduing many countries, and they give the names of the enemies conquered, or assailed by Jagatp\u00e1l. Mention also is made of a fort called Durga being obtained on his marriage. This is no doubt the fort of Dr\u00fag, situated twenty-five miles to the west of R\u00e1ip\u00far, which, according to local tradition, Jagatp\u00e1l obtained by marrying the daughter of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Dr\u00fag. On a small rocky island at the junction of the Pair\u00ed and Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed is a temple of Mah\u00e1deva called Kuleswar, said to have been built by the R\u00e1n\u00ed of Jagatp\u00e1l.\n\n* This account is taken from an article in \"Asiatic Researches,\" vol. xv. p. 499 ff. From the symbols here mentioned, the image would appear to be that of Vishnu and not R\u00e1mchandra, who is usually represented with a bow and arrow, and a quiver, and with Hanum\u00e1n before him, rather than Garuda.\n\n54 CPG\nThere is an inscription on the wall, but it is now entirely illegible. R\u00e9j\u00edm is a pretty little town containing 700 houses, with between 3,000 and 4,000 inhabitants. It has a town school, a district post-office, and a police station. There are agencies here for the collection and export of lac, of which from 3,000 to 4,000 bullock-loads are annually sent to the Mirzapur and Jabalpur markets.\n\nRA'JOLI'\u2014A small zamindari or chiefship in the south-eastern corner of the Bhandara district, consisting of thirteen villages, with an area of nearly forty-three square miles, of which about a square mile and a half may be under cultivation. The holder is a Mohammadan, and the grant is of some standing. The residents belong mostly to the Gond and Gauli castes, and the forests afford pasturage for large herds of cattle.\n\nRA'JPU'R\u2014A chiefship now attached to the Sambalpur district. It is said to have been created by Madhukar S\u00e1, a former r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Sambalpur, in favour of a son by a left-hand marriage (Ph\u00fal Sh\u00e1di), about three hundred years ago. It is situated about thirty miles due north of Sambalpur, and has an area of some thirty square miles, about three-fourths of which are cultivated. It consists of twenty-one villages, and the population, which is chiefly agricultural, is numbered at 2,756. Rice is the staple product. Iron is found in parts. There is also some good timber to be met with (s\u00e1l and s\u00e1j), but no teak. The prevailing castes are Agharias, Kolt\u00e1s, S\u00e1onr\u00e1s, and Gonds.\n\nRA'JULI'\u2014A thriving village in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, eight miles north of M\u00fal. Three miles to the north-east of it, in the basin of hills, is a magnificent artificial lake.\n\nRA'MDIGHI' POOL\u2014See \"Keslabori.\"\n\nRA'MGARH\u2014The north-eastern revenue subdivision or tahsil in the Mandla district, having an area of 2,503 square miles, with 681 villages, and a population of 71,620 souls according to the census of 1866. The land revenue for the year 1869-70 is Rs. 17,286-4-0.\n\nRA'MGARH\u2014A village in the Mandla district, situated on a rocky eminence, at whose base flows the Burhner, separating R\u00e1mgarh from the village of Amarpur. The encamping-ground is at the latter place. In A.D. 1680 the whole of the territory bearing this name was bestowed by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Narendra S\u00e1, together with the title of \"r\u00e1j\u00e1,\" on a chief who had given him great assistance in recovering his ancestral dominions, from which he had been expelled by a cousin, aided by a Mohammadan contingent. The quit-rent payable by the Th\u00e1kur was fixed at Rs. 3,000 or Rs. 3,500, which was still in force at the British occupation in 1818. On the execution of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Shankar S\u00e1, the representative of the Gond kings of Garh\u00e1 Mandla, at Jabalpur in 1857, the R\u00e1nf\u2014who then represented the family on behalf of her lunatic son Am\u00e1n Singh\u2014broke into rebellion, drove the officials from R\u00e1mgarh, and seized the place in the name of her son. Eventually a small force was sent against her. She behaved with great bravery, and is said to have headed her own troops in several skirmishes, but was eventually compelled to flee to less accessible parts of the district. When the pursuit grew warm, she dismounted from her horse, seized a sword from an attendant, and plunged it into her stomach. She was carried into the victor's camp, where she was attended by a surgeon, but medical skill was unavailing, and she expired. After her death, the insane R\u00e1j\u00e1 and his two sons surrendered themselves. The former was deprived of the title of r\u00e1j\u00e1 and\nof his estate, and a stipend was assigned to the family for their support. R\u00e1mgarh is now the head-quarters of a tahsil, and there are here a police station and a school.\n\nRA'MNAGAR\u2014A town in the Mandla district, situated about ten miles to the east of Mandla, at one of the most beautiful spots in the whole surrounding country. Here the Narbad\u00e1 makes a bend, and from where the present palace stands the most enchanting views of both reaches of the river are obtainable. R\u00e1mnagar was selected as a royal residence in A.D. 1829 by Hirde S\u00e1, the 54th king of the Garh\u00e1 Mandla line. The power of the Gond dynasty had received so severe a shock from the storm of Chaur\u00e1garh by the Bundelas, and was so rapidly being overshadowed by the growing Moghal empire on the one hand, and by the rising strength of the Deogarh Gond line on the other, that it became advisable for the Garh\u00e1 Mandla kings to select a more retired stronghold than Garh\u00e1, or Chaur\u00e1garh in the Narbad\u00e1 valley. This place then became the capital of the Garh\u00e1 Mandla kingdom, and must at one time have been a town of considerable size. There still exists a b\u00e1oli, now four miles to the east of the palace, which is represented to have then been in the heart of the town. The ruins are very extensive, the most remarkable being those of a palace built by Bhagwant R\u00e1o, the prime minister of Hirde S\u00e1. It is said to have been of five stories, and to have over-topped the palace of the king, who therefore ordered that its walls should be lowered. R\u00e1j\u00e1 Hirde S\u00e1's own palace is a quadrangle built round an open courtyard, and divided into numberless small rooms and narrow winding passages. In the centre of the open court is a small tank, with remains of fountains to raise water, for which a dam was made in the river almost opposite to the palace. Close by is a small temple with a Sanskrit inscription on stone, recording the names of the Gond line from Samvat 415 to the time of Hirde S\u00e1. R\u00e1mnagar remained the seat of government for eight reigns, until R\u00e1j\u00e1 Narendra S\u00e1 removed to Mandla.\n\nRAMPUR\u2014A chiefship now attached to the Sambalp\u00far district, and created in the reign of Chhatra S\u00e1, r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Sambalp\u00far (A.D. 1630), by whom it was conferred on Pr\u00e1n N\u00e1th, a R\u00e1jput. It is situated about twenty-five miles north-west of the town of Sambalp\u00far, and consists of sixty-three villages, with an area of some hundred square miles. The population is computed at 5,288 souls, belonging chiefly to the agricultural classes. The prevailing castes are Aghar\u00e1s, Gonds, and Bhuy\u00e1s. The agricultural products are rice, oil-seeds, the pulses, &c. Iron-ore is found in considerable quantities. There is also a good deal of useful timber, such as s\u00e1l (shorea robusta), s\u00e1j (pentaptera tomentosa), dh\u00far\u00e1 (conocarpus latifolia), ebony (diopsyros melanoxylon), &c. Dary\u00e1o Singh is the present chief. In the time of R\u00e1j\u00e1 N\u00e1r\u00e1yan Singh (A.D. 1835) several of his relations were murdered by the brothers Surendra S\u00e1 and Udant S\u00e1, who for this offence were sentenced to imprisonment for life. They were undergoing their sentence at Haz\u00e1r\u00edb\u00e1gh when they were released, in the year of the great rebellion in 1857; by the mutineers, and in the same year they came down and set on foot rebellion in Sambalp\u00far.\n\nRA'MTEK\u2014The north-eastern revenue subdivision or tahsil in the N\u00e1gp\u00far district, covering an area of 1,072 square miles, with 560 villages, and a population of 134,846 souls according to the census of 1866. The land revenue of the subdivision for 1869-70 is Rs. 1,85,301.\nRA\u2019MTEK\u2014The head-quarters of the tahsil of the same name, in the N\u00e1gp\u00far district. It is situated twenty-four miles north of N\u00e1gp\u00far, and four miles east of the N\u00e1gp\u00far and Jabalp\u00far road, at the southern foot of a ridge of hills detached by a few miles of cultivation from the undulating forest country, which extends up to the base of the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1s. The town is built on gravelly soil, and is surrounded by extensive groves planted about the base of the hill. The houses are generally good and substantial. The population amounts to 7,933 souls. Of these one-twelfth are Musalm\u00e1ns, one-eighth are Br\u00e1hmans, and one-eighth Bar\u00e1\u00eds (p\u00e1n gardeners). Of the remainder, one-half are cultivators. There are also many Parw\u00e1r shopkeepers of the Jain religion. The trade of R\u00e1mt\u00e9k is not important, except that from hence a great quantity of betel-leaf is exported. The quality of the R\u00e1mt\u00e9k \u201cp\u00e1n\u201d has long been well known, and large quantities have always been taken into Seoni, Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1, Jabalp\u00far, the Ber\u00e1rs, and other districts. During the last ten years the cultivation had languished till the opening of the railway, since which time a large export has begun towards Bombay. Prices have considerably risen, and the area of cultivation is increasing. The cultivation of p\u00e1n is said to have flourished here for three centuries, having been introduced from Deogarh by an ancestor of the present owner of the gardens. The sums realised from octroi are spent by the town committee in the support of their schools and town police, and on municipal works. A good metalled road from Mansar, on the trunk line between Jabalp\u00far and N\u00e1gp\u00far, is now nearly completed through the town to the village of Amb\u00e1l\u00e1, where, on the banks of a small lake, an annual fair is held in the month of \u201cK\u00e1rtik,\u201d corresponding to November. Last year (1868) there were not far short of 100,000 people present during the busy fortnight. There is an excellent bungalow on the ridge of the hill, about 500 feet above the plain. From this spot a varied and extensive view is obtained in every direction. The tahsil\u00ed is a commodious structure at the western end of the town.\n\nR\u00e1mt\u00e9k has ever been a chosen seat of religious veneration amongst the Hind\u00fas. Of the many old temples the oldest appears to be one in a small dell on the north side of the hill. It is built of hewn stones, well fitted together without mortar. From its shape and structure it is probably a Jain temple, though local tradition would make it the work of one Hem\u00e1r Pant, by some said to have been a Br\u00e1hman, by others a \u201cR\u00e1kshasa,\u201d with whose name many remains of buildings in the Bhand\u00e1ra and N\u00e1gp\u00far districts are connected. Near this temple are the modern \u201cParw\u00e1r\u201d temples\u2014a large and handsome group, enclosed in courts well fortified against approach from the plain to the north. The centre of interest, however, is the group on the western extremity of the hill, where the temple of R\u00e1m (R\u00e1mcandra), the tutelary god, stands conspicuous above the rest and above the walls of the citadel. The hill on the south and west sides is protected by a lofty natural scarp; the north side alone is very steep, and has a double line of defence. The inner line belongs to the citadel; the outer one from the western point, running below the citadel walls, gradually diverges more and more, till some 300 yards beyond the inner portion it turns to the south, and is carried across a narrow valley which leads down to Amb\u00e1l\u00e1. From the place where it meets the bluff on the south side of the hill, facing the town of R\u00e1mt\u00e9k, it is continued along the edge, here strengthened with a bastion, there with barrier-walls, blocking up the small ravines which creep up the hill-side, till it joins, at the extreme west point, the more recent walls of the citadel. This outer fortification is now in ruins. Though of rude construction, being made by piling ponderous stones on one another, it was\nhigh and strong. It is without doubt very old, and is believed to be a work of the Gaul\u00eds. Within it was a considerable village, a few traces of which are still to be seen. The citadel is at the western and highest extremity of the enclosure, having the chief temples at the apex of the angle. It was only on the eastern side that the approach of an enemy could be feared. To ascend to the citadel from the Amb\u00e1l\u00e1 side, the road passes under a small wooded hill, having on its top a fortified summer-palace, accessible from one side only, which is said to have been built by a r\u00e1j\u00e1 of the S\u00farya-Vans\u00ed (Solar) race. Following this road, which, after passing through the town, winds first round the outer and then round the inner side of the southern ridge of the hill, we have in front the embankment of the tank, along which a line of defences, with strong bastions flanking the gateway, was built by Raghoj\u00ed I. Inside this is Amb\u00e1l\u00e1, with its pretty lake, its bathing gh\u00e1ts, and numerous temples, each belonging to one of the old Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 families of this country. From the western corner of the tank flights of stone stairs, half a mile in length, lead up to the citadel, passing through the Gaul\u00ed walls by a narrow gateway. All pilgrims going to worship at the temples ascend the hill by this way. Nearly at the top, on the right, is a large and very ancient open b\u00e1oli, with a dharm\u00e1s\u00e1la attached. To the left are two plain, but very old, temples of Krishna in the avat\u00e1r of Narsinha. Opposite to these is a plain mosque, said to have been built in commemoration of a great man in the retinue of the Emperor Aurangzeb.\n\nFrom this a flight of steps leads up to the outer gate, a massive building, which, with all the outer line of walls belonging to the citadel, was built by the first Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 ruler. Inside the gateway, on the right, are Hind\u00fa temples of N\u00e1r\u00e1yan; on the left are other temples, where Parw\u00e1rs annually resort. Passing through this lower court, the Singhp\u00far gate in the second line of walls is reached. The buildings here are much more ancient than those in the first line, and are referred to the time of the S\u00farya-Vans\u00eds. In the second court the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s had their arsenal, of which a few wall-pieces are still left. The third court is reached through a very fine gateway called the Bhairava Darw\u00e1za; in this part the walls and bastions restored by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s are in very good repair. This innermost court has on either side the dwellings of the servants of the temples, and at the further end the Gokul Darw\u00e1za\u2014a building of the most fantastic architecture leading to the shrines of Ganpati and Hanum\u00e1n; and lastly, built on the edge of the bluff, the shrine of R\u00e1ma. From this inner court another series of stone-stairs lead down into the town of R\u00e1mtek. In the time of Raghoj\u00ed I. the fort, with its temples, must have been safe from any force which could then have been brought against it.\n\nThough the name of R\u00e1mtek is seldom heard in Hindust\u00e1n as a celebrated resort of pilgrims, yet the annual number of visitors to it is very great. The great fair attracts people from R\u00e1jpur, Bhop\u00e1l, and Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d. All attempts to obtain from the traditions of the people a coherent or intelligible history of the various ancient shrines and ruins have proved fruitless. The buildings themselves throw little light on the past. The present fortress was in great measure built or restored by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. In the beginning of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 times two very fine old b\u00e1olis, which had for ages been covered over by earth, were discovered, long after all tradition of their existence had been lost. These were probably built before the ascendancy of the Gonds. These b\u00e1olis and much of the temples and citadels must be ascribed to Hind\u00fas, such as the traditional\nS\u00farya-Vans\u00ed r\u00e1j\u00e1s\u2014immigrants from Ayodhy\u00e1. Anterior to these are the Gaul\u00ed walls, and traces of a Gaul\u00ed town; and still earlier the small Jain-like temples built without mortar. The architectural characteristics of the different races are easily distinguishable the one from the other; but what gaps of time separated the eras of the Jain and the Gaul\u00ed, the S\u00farya-Vans\u00ed, and the Gond, can only be the subject of conjecture.\n\nRA'MTI'RTH Temple\u2014See \"Ball\u00e1lp\u00far.\"\n\nRANEH\u2014A town in the Damoh district, situated about twenty-one miles north-east of Damoh. The population, according to the census of 1866, exceeds three thousand souls. Some cotton-cloth is manufactured here, and the town has a police-station and a government school.\n\nR\u00c1NGI'\u2014A chiefship in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, situated twelve miles south-east of Wair\u00e1garh, and containing seventeen villages. The soil is sandy, producing rice and in some places sugarcane. The eastern portion is very hilly, with a good deal of teak; but s\u00e1j and mhowa trees are more common. A weekly market, attended by some three hundred visitors, takes place at the village of R\u00e1ngi', which is the head-quarters of the zam\u00ednd\u00e1ri. At Ing\u00e1r\u00e1 there is an ancient temple, on which there is a carving of a warrior with a short straight sword and a shield.\n\nRANGIR\u2014One of the oldest villages in the S\u00e1g\u00e1r district, about twenty-two miles south-east of S\u00e1g\u00e1r. An annual fair is held here in March, at which the attendance in 1869 was 65,000 persons.\n\nRANMACHAN\u2014A village in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, situated six miles south-east of Brahmapur\u00ed, at the point where the Bot\u00e9w\u00e1hi falls into the Wain-gang\u00e1. In the vicinity a battle was fought between the M\u00e1n\u00e1 princes of Wair\u00e1garh and Brahmapur\u00ed, in which the latter was defeated.\n\nRASUL\u00c1BA'D\u2014A village in the \u00c1rv\u00ed tahsil of the Wardh\u00e1 district, eighteen miles west of Wardh\u00e1. It was founded some two hundred years ago by Naw\u00e1b In\u00e1y\u00e1t Kh\u00e1n of Ellichpur\u00ed, who called it Ras\u00fal\u00e1b\u00e1d in honour of his son Ras\u00fal Kh\u00e1n. It now contains 2,565 inhabitants, chiefly cultivators. A government village school, lately opened here, is doing well. A large weekly market is held here on Fridays, and town duties are collected. The village lands are rich and well cultivated.\n\nRATANPUR (RATNAPUR)\u2014A town in the district of Bil\u00e1sp\u00far, situated twelve miles north of Bil\u00e1sp\u00far town. It was here that the ancient r\u00e1j\u00e1s of the country first held their court, and it was from this point that the early Hind\u00fa settlers, gradually acquiring strength, displaced the aborigines, reclaimed the wilderness, and spread over the plain their civilisation and faith. Although the importance and ancient glory of Ratanpur have long since departed, there is probably no town in Chhattisgarh which to the antiquarian or archaeologist would be more interesting and attractive. The town is situated at the base of the Kend\u00e1 offshoots of the Vindhyan range, and lies in a hollow, almost surrounded by isolated hills. The result is that nothing is seen of it till its precincts are entered, though the white edifice which crowns Temple Hill distantly indicates its position, and often creates a delusive hope that it has been nearly reached. Like all towns once populous but now declining,\nthere is about many of the streets of Ratanp\u00far an air of dilapidation and deserton. A cluster of houses is met with in one spot, then a great gap, then another cluster, and so on, over a long straggling disconnected stretch of habitations. There are here and there a few houses of permanent masonry\u2014the melancholy relics of past greatness\u2014amid a throng of thatched and tiled buildings; then we come on the crumbling arches of the old fort, the broken walls and scattered debris of the ancient palace, and the partially-filled moat which surrounded the city\u2014all speaking of days gone by. Nothing, however, seems so striking, or dwells so vividly in the memory in connection with Ratanp\u00far, as its numerous groves, temples, and tanks. Ruins are a heritage common to all old cities, and there is admittedly nothing of marked interest or beauty about those of Ratanp\u00far. But here is a township covering an area of fifteen square miles, and containing within its limits a perfect forest of mango trees, amid the luxuriant shade of which are scattered an almost countless number of tanks and temples. It is quite possible to wander for days through these groves, ever discovering some new tank or stumbling upon some fresh temple, and although the inquirer may have occasion to do so often, he will always find some new pile, till then unobserved, to enter and examine. Mixed up with the temples are great blocks of masonry, of much the same shape, sacred to distinguished \"Satis\"\u2014those unhappy victims to a melancholy religious fanaticism. The most prominent of these is near the old fort, where a large building, gracefully adorned on all sides with arches and minarets, proclaims that here, some 230 years ago, twenty R\u00e1n\u00eds of R\u00e9j\u00e1 Lachhman Sah\u00ed became voluntary martyrs to Br\u00e1hmanical cruelty and popular feeling. Ratanp\u00far is essentially a city of the past, and has declined much in population even within the last few years. Less than two years before the census a house-to-house enumeration was made, and the population stood at 8,462, which at the time of the census had fallen to 6,910, or a decrease of 1,552 inhabitants. The establishment of Bil\u00e1sp\u00far as the head-quarters of the district has doubtless been the cause of this decrease, and Ratanp\u00far has only now probably reached its standing-point. The community comprises a fair sprinkling of traders, who have considerable dealings in lac, cloth, spices, and metals with Mirz\u00e1p\u00far; but its distinctive element is a large section of lettered Br\u00e1hmans\u2014the hereditary holders of rent-free villages\u2014who are the interpreters of the sacred writings, and the ministers of religious ceremonies, for a great portion of Chhattisgarh. The palmy days of Ratanp\u00far ended with R\u00e9j\u00e1 Bimb\u00e9j\u00ed Bhonsl\u00e1 in A.D. 1787.\n\nRA'VER\u2014A small town in the Nimar district, situated on the banks of the Narbad\u00e1, about forty miles from Khandw\u00e1. It is noteworthy only as containing the cenotaph of the Peshw\u00e1 B\u00e1iji R\u00e1o, who died here in A.D. 1740 when on the point of crossing the Narbad\u00e1 to invade Hindust\u00e1n for the second time. It is an unimposing structure of variegated sandstone, enclosed in a spacious dharm-s\u00e1l\u00e1 of strong masonry. A handsome gh\u00e1t, opposite the platform in the centre of the river, where his funeral obsequies were performed, has now been a good deal destroyed by the annual floods. The place is now quite off any main line of traffic, but is easily accessible from the Barw\u00e1\u00ed or Dhang\u00e1\u00f3n travellers' bungalows, being a short ride only from either. Boats can also go from Barw\u00e1\u00ed to R\u00e9ver on the Narbad\u00e1.\n\nREHLI'\u2014The southern revenue subdivision or tahs\u00edl of the S\u00e1g\u00e1r district, having an area of 1,268 square miles, with 723 villages, and a population of 147,407 souls according to the census of 1866. The land revenue of the tahs\u00edl for the year 1869-70 is Rs. 1,31,025.\nREHLI\u2014A village in the S\u00e1gar district, situated about twenty-eight miles south-east of S\u00e1gar, at an elevation above the sea of 1,350 feet. According to tradition its first rulers were the Gonds, to whom succeeded a race of shepherds known as Baladeos. Their first settlement was a village named Khamari\u00e1, which is about a mile from Rehl\u00ed, but in time they removed their quarters to Rehl\u00ed itself, and here a fort was built by them. Thenceforward the population of Rehl\u00ed began to multiply, and soon the village rose to the dignity of a town. The place next passed into the hands of the Bundel\u00e1 chief of Pann\u00e1, R\u00e9j\u00e1 Chhatra S\u00e1l, who, having defeated Mohammad Kh\u00e1n Bangash, the s\u00faba of Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d, with the assistance of B\u00e1j\u00ed R\u00e9o Peshw\u00e1, made over to the latter, in acknowledgment of his services, a part of his territory, including Rehl\u00ed, of the annual value of about thirty l\u00f3khs of rupees, in A.D. 1735. Rehl\u00ed thus came under the Peshw\u00e1, and the fort which still exists there was built by him. In A.D. 1817 Rehl\u00ed was made over to the British, with S\u00e1gar, by the Peshw\u00e1. From the year 1827 to 1833 it formed a district subordinate to S\u00e1gar, and included the subdivisions of Tejigarh, Hatt\u00e1, Damoh, Garh\u00e1kot\u00e1, Deor\u00ed, Gaurjh\u00e1mar, and N\u00e1harm\u00e1\u00fc. The old court-house (a large flat-roofed bungalow, situated about half a mile from the town overlooking the river) is still in existence, and is kept in repair by the S\u00e1gar local funds committee. It is frequently resorted to for change of air by the residents of S\u00e1gar.\n\nRehl\u00ed is now remarkably prosperous and flourishing. This may be considered as partly owing to the natural advantages of the place, such as the healthiness of the climate and the fertility of the soil, and partly to the fact that the settlement of the land revenue, which has just expired, does not appear to have borne so heavily on the people of this subdivision as on those of other parts of the district. The wealth of the inhabitants of this subdivision is indeed apparent from the fact that more civil suits are filed in Rehl\u00ed than in the whole of the remainder of the district, including the town of S\u00e1gar. The bulk of the population may be said to consist of Br\u00e1hmans and Gonds. Good skilled labour is readily procurable here. The chief export is \u201cgur\u201d\u2014a kind of coarse sugar\u2014which is manufactured largely in the town and surrounding villages. Grain of all sorts, but especially wheat, is also largely exported. Weekly markets are held here on Mondays and Thursdays. An octroi has been levied in Rehl\u00ed since 1863. From the proceeds the town police and conservancy charges are paid, and the surplus is used in improving the town.\n\nThe fort, as mentioned above, was built by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s nearly 150 years ago. It stands on the north bank of the Sun\u00e1r, opposite to the junction of that river with another small stream called the Deh\u00e1r, on a considerable eminence overlooking the town. The space enclosed within it\u2014nearly two acres in extent\u2014was once covered with Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 buildings of two or more stories, most of which have been destroyed. A large and handsome flat-roofed building, surrounded with an enclosure-wall, has lately been erected by voluntary contributions from the people of Rehl\u00ed and the surrounding villages for a school-house. The attendance averages 180 boys per diem. Five female schools have also been established here. The average daily attendance of girls in these schools amounts to 125. There are also a dispensary and a post-office. The population, according to the census of 1866, is 3,595 souls.\n\nROHNA\u2014A small market-town in the \u00c1rv\u00ed tahs\u00edl of the Wardh\u00e1 district, situated twenty-three miles west by north of Wardh\u00e1. The weekly market.\nwhich is well attended, is held on Tuesdays in the dry bed and along the bank of the stream flowing past the town. A considerable annual fair is held here in the first half of the month of M\u00e2gh, corresponding with the second half of January and the first half of February. A site for a market-place has been cleared on the bank of the river, and an embankment has been raised to prevent its being flooded in the rains. A village school has also been established from municipal funds. The town contains 2,565 inhabitants, the bulk of whom are cultivators; but there are, besides, some weavers, blanket-makers, and a few families of bangle-manufacturers. The fort was built about one hundred years ago by Krishn\u00e2j\u00ee Sindi\u00e2, who held the village rent-free from the Haidar\u00e2b\u00e2d and Bhonsl\u00e2 governments, in consideration of maintaining a troop of two hundred horsemen. In the neighbourhood of the town are gardens of opium, sugarcane, and spices, and the lands generally are rich and well cultivated.\n\nROHN\u00cd\u2014A village on the bank of the river Wardh\u00e1, in the Huz\u00fbr tahs\u00eel of the Wardh\u00e1 district, about twenty-five miles south-west of Wardh\u00e1 town. It is the site of an annual semi-religious fair held on the 4th of M\u00e2gh Vadya (about the end of January or the beginning of February), on which day Hind\u00fbs resort here to bathe. On the river-bank stands a fine temple dedicated to Koteswar Mah\u00e2deva. Rohn\u00ed contains 878 inhabitants, principally cultivators.\n\nS\n\nSABARI\u2014A river rising in the Eastern Gh\u00e2ts in the Jaipur state. The last twenty-five miles of its course are within the limits of the Upper God\u00e2var\u00ee district, and for this distance it is free from obstructions, but above it is a mass of rocks and rapids. It falls into the God\u00e2var\u00ee in the R\u00e2k\u00e2pall\u00ee taluka, and is the last affluent of any size received by that river before it discharges itself into the Bay of Bengal.\n\nSA\u2019GAR\u2014\n\nCONTENTS.\n\n| Page | Page |\n|------|------|\n| General description | 433 |\n| Rivers | 436 |\n| Climate | ib. |\n| Cattle and produce | ib. |\n| Minerals | ib. |\n| Forests | 437 |\n| Administration | ib. |\n| Education | 438 |\n| Population | ib. |\n| Statistical account | ib. |\n| Trade | 439 |\n| Roads | 440 |\n| Past history, and antiquities | 441 |\n\nA district situated in the extreme north-west of the Central Provinces, and comprised within north latitude 28\u00b0 5' and 24\u00b0 25', and east longitude 78\u00b0 10' and 79\u00b0 15'.\n\nIt is bounded on the north by the Lalatp\u00fbr district, and the native states of Bij\u00e2war, Pann\u00e2, and Charkh\u00e2rf; on the east by Pann\u00e2 and the district, of Damoh; on the south by the district of Narsinghp\u00fbr, and the native state of Bhop\u00e1l; and on the west by Bhop\u00e1l, and the native state of Gwalior. The extreme length from north to south is about eighty-five miles, and the extreme breadth sixty-five miles. The total area is about 4,005 square miles, and the population about 498,642 souls.\n\nThe district may be regarded as an extensive, elevated, and in parts tolerably level plain, broken in places by low hills of the Vindhyan sandstone.\nAll the lower portions have been filled by overflowing trap, in some places rising into hillocks, and pierced occasionally by sandstone hills, as at R\u00e1hatgarh. The general slope is to the north-east; and the plain is bounded on the south by the Bh\u00e1nrer range and its offshoots, and on the north-east by the Vindhyas. The soil of the south and centre is black soil, formed by the decaying trap, and to the north and east is a reddish-brown alluvium. The black soil extends on the north-west right up to Khiml\u00e1s\u00e1. The boundaries of the trap and sandstone are, however, so irregular that the formation can be only thus generally described:\n\nThe country is mostly covered with trap, but there are two great inliers of Vindhyan sandstone\u2014one to the north, running down from the northern scarp of the district to the latitude of S\u00e1g\u00e1r, but a little west of it, broadening out opposite Kura\u00ed and dying away southwards; the other to the east, running south-west from near Garh\u00e1kot\u00e1 to beyond Surkh\u00ed, a distance of about twenty miles, with a mean breadth of some five miles. Garh\u00e1kot\u00e1 itself, and a narrow strip of country as far south as Rehl\u00ed, are on limestone, and north of these the western boundary of the district is marked by a strip classed under \u201cInter-trappean or B\u00e1gh beds\u201d; besides isolated patches of similar formation near R\u00e1hatgarh, Kura\u00ed, Khiml\u00e1s\u00e1, It\u00e1w\u00e1, and Kojanp\u00far. The trappean area is thus described by Mr. Mallet of the Geological Survey:\n\n\u201cThe trappean area is one which presents much diversity in aspect. Plains, more or less level as a whole, in some parts are covered with broad spreads of \u2018cotton soil,\u2019 where wheat is grown in immense quantities. Elsewhere the ground is broken and irregular, and the trappean rocks, without a covering of soil, prevent any but the scantiest vegetation. Innumerable hills, disposed singly or in groups, and ranges and plateaus of limited extent, diversify the prospect, some of them covered with jungle, others stony and barren. The form of the trap hills distinguishes them at once from inlying hills of sandstone, and the vegetation of each is also sufficiently distinct; one of the most characteristic differences being the abundant supply of teak-saplings on the trappean hills, which are quite uncommon on the sandstone.*\n\n\u201cThe boundary is sometimes, as east of S\u00e1g\u00e1r, marked by a clear trappean escarpment, but in other parts it is indicated by no physical feature. The Vindhyans have in places been somewhat altered immediately beneath the trap, but not to any very great extent. To the east and southeast of S\u00e1g\u00e1r the infra-trappean or Lamet\u00e1 limestone is largely developed, attaining a thickness of over one hundred feet in places, but it varies greatly in this respect, sometimes being entirely absent, the trap then resting directly on the Vindhyans. The rolled pebbles which often make up a considerable portion of its bulk have been derived from the Vindhyan sandstones.\u201d\u2020\n\nThe Vindhyan outcrops belong to the group named by the Geological Survey the \u201cUpper Rew\u00e1,\u201d which is described by Mr. Mallet as a \u201cmixture of thick massive strata and false-bedded flags, usually hard and compact, and often\n\n* Memoirs of the Geological Survey of India, vol. vii. part 1, p. 18.\n\u2020 Ibid, p. 24.\n\"Sag\" 435\n\n\"glazed or semi-vitrified, yellowish and greyish-white in colour, sometimes reddish.\"* The curious intertrappean beds of the S\u00e1g\u00e1r, and the silicified trees which they contain, are thus described by Mr. J. G. Medlicott \u2020:\n\n\"So far then as we have to do with them, the beds of this intertrappean age are the remains of lacustrine deposits, formerly accumulated in probably detached basins, and under conditions slightly differing in different places.\n\n* * * * * * * * *\n\n\"The calcareous bands of the intertrappean rocks occur largely near S\u00e1g\u00e1r.\"\n\n* * * * * * * * *\n\n\"From the S\u00e1g\u00e1r parade-ground, along the foot of the hills to the north of the Indore road, a nearly continuous outcrop may be traced for miles. Again, to the south of S\u00e1g\u00e1r, near N\u00e1r\u00e1yap\u00far,\u2021 a similar bed is found, resting on the Vindhyan sandstones, and covered by trap. Here the rock\u2014itself sometimes a mass of minute Paludinae\u2014is hardened into a marble in one place, while a few feet off it is so friable as to crumble between the fingers. Besides the small shells, large specimens of Unio Dacanensis, of Physa Prinsepii and colossal vertebrate bones, are embedded in this calcareous bed. These bones were too much broken for identification. They have been supposed to have belonged to large Pachyderms, or possibly to Cetacea.\n\n* * * * * * * * *\n\n\"Many years ago Dr. Spry,\u00a7 and subsequently to him Captain Nicolls,\u2016 studied and described certain trunks of palm-trees whose silicified remains are found embedded in the soft intertrappean mud-beds near S\u00e1g\u00e1r. Many points of considerable interest are involved in the descriptions and speculations published by both these geologists, for which their papers may be referred to. The trees are embedded in a layer of calcareous black earth, which formed the surface soil in which they grew; this soil rests on, and was made up of the disintegration of a layer of basalt. It is covered over by another and similar layer of the same rock near where the trees occur. The ordinary fossil shells of the intertrappean beds are found in the continuation of the same intertrappean layer which contains the trees both where the tree-bed is still soft black calcareous clay, and further on where it is a hard limestone. Large distorted specimens of Physa Prinsepii have been found in this bed. The trees must have been thrown down or have fallen, and been silicified before the advent of the layer of basalt which now lies on them, and they could not have been transported by water from a distance and deposited here together. Thus they of course cannot be supposed to belong to an older formation, and to have been re-deposited in an intertrappean bed after fossilisation during a geologically anterior period.\u00b6\n\n* * * * * * * * *\n\n* Memoirs of the Geological Survey of India, vol. vii. part 1, p. 72.\n\u2020 Ibid, vol. ii. part 2, pp. 200, 203, 204, 205, 216.\n\u2021 \"Captain Nicolls' fossil locality.\"\n\u00a7 \"Journal of Asiatic Society of Bengal, vol. ii. p. 639.\"\n\u2016 \"Journal of Asiatic Society, Bombay, vol. v. p. 614.\"\n\u00b6 \"Vide contribution to Geology of Western India, by Dr. Carter, Bombay Asiatic Society's Journal, vol. v. p. 614.\"\n\"The palm-trees, now found fossilised, grew in the soil, which in the condition of a black calcareous earthy bed we now find lying round their prostrate stems. They fell (from whatever cause) and lay until their silicification was complete. A slight depression of the surface, or some local or accidental check of some drainage course, or any other similar and trivial cause, may have laid them under water. The process of silicification proceeded gradually but steadily, and after they had there, in lapse of ages, become lapidified, the next outburst of volcanic matters overwhelmed them, broke them, partially enveloped and bruised them, until long subsequent denudation once more brought them to light. They may, no doubt, have been still further shattered by subsequent movements of the rocks, or even by the shock of the next superincumbent flow of basalt, but there is no necessity for resorting to such an idea to explain their present state and position.\"\n\nThe direction of the principal rivers\u2014which are the Sun\u00e1r, the Bi\u00e1s, the Dh\u00fap\u00e1n, and the B\u00edn\u00e1\u2014is northward to the Gangetic valley. The line of watershed dividing the affluents of the northern rivers from those of the Narbad\u00e1 is on the very southern boundary of the district, where the scarp of the Vindhyan tableland rises abruptly from the Narbad\u00e1 valley.\n\nThe climate at S\u00e1g\u00e1r, and generally throughout the district, is very moderate considering the latitude. The minimum temperature may be stated at 40\u00b0 in the cold weather, and the maximum at 109\u00b0 in the hot season. The district is therefore during the greater part of the year very salubrious both for Europeans and Natives. The most prevalent disease is a kind of intermittent fever, which comes on after the rains, in the months of September, October, and November, especially in the second of these months. The rains seldom fall to such an extent as to damage the crops, and the fall varies from thirty-four to forty-six inches.\n\nCattle and buffaloes are bred to a large extent in the district, both for draught and carriage, and also for dairy purposes, especially the manufacture of ghee. At Kura\u00ed\u2014a small town to the north of S\u00e1g\u00e1r\u2014a large cattle-fair is held every week; and at Garh\u00e1kot\u00e1\u2014an important town to the south-east of S\u00e1g\u00e1r\u2014a large yearly cattle-fair is held. Cattle are, however, seldom bred of any size, but some fine specimens are brought from M\u00e1lw\u00e1. Some bulls from Hiss\u00e1r and Mysore have been imported to improve the indigenous breed. There are remarkably few sheep, not enough being raised even for home consumption. The staple food is wheat, which is produced in large quantities all over the district. Sugarcane is also grown in many villages; and gur, or coarse sugar, is largely exported to Lalatpur, Jh\u00e1nsi, &c. The soil is in most places favourable for the growth of cotton, which is now exported to Mirzapur and Bombay via Narsinghpur.\n\nThe mineral produce is small, but iron-ore is found and worked at Hirap\u00far\u2014a small village in the extreme north-east. It is said to be of excellent quality, but at present only a few smelting-furnaces of the commonest native description exist. The greater part of the iron manufacture is sent to Cawnpore. Some of the sandstone is said to be equal to the English \"tiling stone.\" The principal houses in the towns of Kura\u00ed, Khiml\u00e1s\u00e1, Rahatgarh, M\u00e1lthon, and a part of S\u00e1g\u00e1r, are\nentirely roofed with sandstone slabs. The roof of the S\u00e1g\u00e1r church is a fine specimen of sandstone tiling. The slabs are in fifteen or twenty inch squares, and about a quarter or three-quarters of an inch thick. They are arranged diagonally upon bamboos, and each is attached by a single pliant nail. The best sandstone is from a village called \"P\u00e1th\u00e1ri,\" and from Masw\u00e1s\u00ed immediately north of S\u00e1g\u00e1r. It is as well adapted for carving as for building purposes.\n\nThere are several densely-wooded tracts in the district, but there is no very great quantity of the finer sorts of timber.\n\nForests. The largest forest is the \"Ramn\u00e1,\" or preserve to the north-east of Garh\u00e1kot\u00e1, containing chiefly teak and s\u00e1j. In the southern parts of the district there are other small forests, viz. Mohl\u00ed, about fifteen miles east of Rehl\u00ed, and Tarh\u00e1 K\u00eds\u00edl\u00ed to the south of Deor\u00ed. These produce teak and s\u00e1j, and also bamboos. Towards the north of the district, in Sh\u00e1hgarh, there are large tracts of forest, containing chiefly mhowa and s\u00e1j, with some teak, and bamboos in abundance. The reserved forests are those of Garh\u00e1kot\u00e1 and Tigor\u00e1. The Garh\u00e1kot\u00e1 reserve contains eight square miles, and the Tigor\u00e1 or Sh\u00e1hgarh reserve contains an area of two square miles. The total amount of unreserved waste land is 451,430 acres, which is divided into 272 blocks technically called \"chaks.\" These waste lands may either be bought outright, or hired on clearance leases, or farmed for their produce.\n\nThe administration is conducted by a Deputy Commissioner, with ordinarily three Assistants at head-quarters, and Tabild\u00e1rs or sub-collectors, with judicial powers, at the tahsil stations, which give their names to the four subdivisions or tahsils, viz. S\u00e1g\u00e1r, Kural, Rehl\u00ed, and Band\u00e1. Each of these subdivisions consists of two or more minor subdivisions or parganas. The following is a list of the principal towns and villages:\n\n1. S\u00e1g\u00e1r. 5. Garh\u00e1kot\u00e1. 9. It\u00e1w\u00e1. 13. Band\u00e1.\n2. R\u00e1hatgarh. 6. Deor\u00ed. 10. Kanji\u00e1. 14.

Dh\u00e1mon\u00ed.\n\nThe police number 627 of all ranks, under a District Superintendent. They have station-houses at Kural, Band\u00e1, Rehl\u00ed, Gop\u00e1lganj, Khiml\u00e1ss\u00e1, Barod\u00e1, Sh\u00e1hgarh, Baret\u00e1, Dh\u00e1mon\u00ed, Deor\u00ed, Garh\u00e1kot\u00e1, and R\u00e1hatgarh, besides thirty-three outposts. The Customs line passes through the district, having a Collector's station and bonded warehouse at S\u00e1g\u00e1r, and patrol's stations at M\u00e1lthon, Bandr\u00ed, S\u00e1g\u00e1r, Till\u00ed, Gaurjh\u00e1mar, and Deor\u00ed. The total imperial revenue of the S\u00e1g\u00e1r district in 1868-69 amounted to Rs. 10,90,928. It may be exhibited under the following heads:\n\n| Description                                      | Amount   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|----------|\n| Land revenue                                     | Rs. 4,29,830 |\n| Excise, including opium and drugs                | Rs. 35,149 |\n| Customs, including salt and sugar                 | Rs. 5,41,788 |\n| Stamp revenue                                     | Rs. 61,794 |\n| Forest revenue, not including sales of waste      | Rs. 12,926 |\n| P\u00e1ndhr\u00ed                                          | Rs. 9,441 |\n\nTotal Rs. 10,90,928\nIn addition there were collections on account of octroi in 1868-69 amounting to Rs. 64,000. The educational cess also yielded about Rs. 8,600, the road cess the same amount, and the district postal service cess Rs. 2,150. Thus the total revenue may be estimated at Rs. 11,74,278.\n\nThere were in 1868-69 in this district 109 schools and 4,812 scholars. Of these the Government institutions were 78 in number. The best school in the Central Provinces is at S\u00e1gar. The language spoken in the district calls for no particular remark. It is a dialect of Hindi.\n\nThe population of the district amounts to 498,642 souls, of whom 220,070 are returned as agriculturists and 278,572 as non-agriculturists. The best cultivators are Kurmis, K\u00e1chh\u00eds, Lodh\u00eds, and D\u00e1ng\u00eds. The artisans and handicraftsmen are chiefly Loh\u00e1rs, Barh\u00e1s, Kohr\u00edrs, and Sun\u00e1rs. Except in some of the large towns, and the city of S\u00e1gar itself, the manners of the inhabitants generally are decidedly uncouth. Towards the northern part of the district, where it borders on Bundelkhand, their character and tone undergo a decided change for the worse, resulting most likely from their proximity to a part of India famous for a low standard of morals, and whose normal state may be said to be discontent and disaffection. To the south of the district the people are more tractable and yielding, and altogether better satisfied and contented with their condition than those of the north. The tribes most addicted to crime are the Lodh\u00eds, Bund\u00e9l\u00e1s, Br\u00e1hmans, Khang\u00e1rs, Chur\u00e1rs, and Kohr\u00edrs. They are mostly to be found in the borders of the district near native states, where they find protection and concealment if pressed by our police. On the whole the inhabitants of S\u00e1gar may be said to be a sturdy race. They are not high in stature, but they possess a fair share of stamina, muscles, thews and sinews. They are much attached to their own part of the country, and are seldom induced to leave it. They appear to have no fondness for dress. Simple white cloth\u2014the produce of the country\u2014is in common use in the hot season with the poorer class, and cloth of a finer texture, but of the same colour, with those better off. In the cold weather this is changed for a thick cotton padded coat, reaching past the knees; and green \"mhowa\" is the favourite colour, more particularly to the north of the district bordering on Bundelkhand, where this is considered the national colour. Cloth dyed with \u00e1l or madder is also much worn, particularly by females. Grain and vegetables are the staple food. Some of the lower classes, such as Cham\u00e1rs, Gonds, &c., eat flesh when they can get it, and are not particular as to its condition. Those who can afford it eat wheat, barley, and d\u00e1l; the poorer classes content themselves with b\u00e1jr\u00e1, kodo, kutkt\u00ed, and often in seasons of scarcity they subsist on the mhowa berry and other such jungle fruits. The houses are generally built of either stone, or stone and mud, and are tiled. A few of the huts inhabited by the poorer classes, such as Cham\u00e1rs, Sun\u00e1rs, and Gonds, &c., are thatched, with walls formed of wattle and dab; but every endeavour is being made to get them to build permanent residences, not subject to be destroyed by fire.\n\nStatistical account.\n\nThe following is a detailed statistical statement of the S\u00e1gar district:\u2014\n| Name of Tahsil | Name of Pargana | Number of Villages | Land Revenue for 1868-69 | Area in Acres | Number of Houses |\n|---------------|----------------|--------------------|--------------------------|---------------|-----------------|\n| S\u00e1gar         |                |                    |                          |               |                 |\n| S\u00e9gar         |                | 259                | 94,399                   | 368,394       | 23,794          |\n| R\u00e1hatgarh     |                | 134                | 27,571                   | 132,281       | 5,889           |\n| Naraol\u00ed       |                | 95                 | 22,895                   | 112,452       | 4,955           |\n| Jaisinghnagar |                | 51                 | 8,471                    | 55,417        | 2,274           |\n| Total         |                | 539                | 1,53,336                 | 668,544       | 36,912          |\n| Kurb\u00e1\u00ed        |                |                    |                          |               |                 |\n| Kur\u00e1\u00ed Khiml\u00e1\u015b\u00e1|                | 175                | 40,486                   | 183,020       | 7,680           |\n| M\u00e1lthon Dug\u00e1h\u00e1|                | 195                | 24,875                   | 231,308       | 7,029           |\n| Eran          |                | 27                 | 4,672                    | 16,537        | 853             |\n| It\u00e1w\u00e1         |                | 44                 | 8,819                    | 38,982        | 1,452           |\n| Kanji\u00e1        |                | 105                | 18,515                   | 119,581       | 3,388           |\n| Total         |                | 546                | 97,317                   | 589,428       | 20,402          |\n| Rehl\u00ed         |                |                    |                          |               |                 |\n| Rehl\u00ed         |                | 209                | 45,956                   | 240,852       | 12,727          |\n| Deor\u00ed         |                | 328                | 81,955                   | 365,449       | 13,514          |\n| N\u00e1harm\u00e1u      |                | 46                 | 10,689                   | 45,839        | 2,162           |\n| Gaurjh\u00e1mar    |                | 31                 | 9,468                    | 38,006        | 2,401           |\n| Garh\u00e1kot\u00e1     |                | 109                | 31,459                   | 123,646       | 8,145           |\n| Total         |                | 723                | 1,29,527                 | 813,792       | 38,949          |\n| Banda\u00ed        |                |                    |                          |               |                 |\n| Bin\u00e1ik\u00e1       |                | 81                 | 14,539                   | 109,138       | 4,175           |\n| Bher\u00e1         |                | 67                 | 21,397                   | 92,213        | 5,162           |\n| Dh\u00e1m\u00f3n\u00ed       |                | 36                 | 2,837                    | 48,884        | 937             |\n| Sh\u00e1hgarh      |                | 115                | 10,877                   | 191,878       | 8,312           |\n| Total         |                | 299                | 49,650                   | 442,108       | 18,586          |\n| Grand Total   |                | 2,107              | 4,29,830                 | 2,513,872     | 114,849         |\n\nThe district is in parts, especially towards the south, well cultivated; towards the west the cultivation is fast increasing.\n\nTrade. It exports grain to the neighbouring states of Bhop\u00e1l, Gwalior, and Bundelkhand. The town of S\u00e1g\u00e1r is the entrep\u00f4t of the salt trade with R\u00e9jput\u00e1n\u00e1. The following table exhibits the Exports and Imports during 1867-68 and 1868-69:\u2014\nThe principal fairs are held at Bh\u00e1pail or Bh\u00e1pel, Kura\u00ed, Pandalp\u00far, R\u00e1ng\u00edr, and Garh\u00e1kot\u00e1. As has already been mentioned, at Garh\u00e1kot\u00e1 is a great cattle fair. The estimated value of the cattle brought for sale there in 1868-69 amounted to Rs. 1,80,657, and the number actually sold cost Rs. 1,01,635.\n\nThe main lines of communication through the district are, as yet\u2014(Firstly) the road from north-east to south-west, from Jabalp\u00far to S\u00e1g\u00e1r, and from thence towards Indore via R\u00e1hatgarh; from Jabalp\u00far to S\u00e1g\u00e1r it is bridged and metalled in some places; and from S\u00e1g\u00e1r to R\u00e1hatgarh\u2014a distance of twenty-six miles\u2014it is made and bridged throughout, but no further.

There are travellers' bungalows at S\u00e1g\u00e1r and R\u00e1hatgarh. (Secondly) from north-west to south-east from Gwalior via Jh\u00e1ns\u00ed and Lalatp\u00far to S\u00e1g\u00e1r, and from thence towards Narsinghp\u00far. At\nM\u00e1lthon, close to the extreme north boundary of the district, there is a travellers' bungalow. The road is not made nor bridged from Gwalior to S\u00e1g\u00e1r. From S\u00e1g\u00e1r to Singhp\u00far\u2014the southern boundary of the district\u2014the road is partly made and bridged, with the exception of the large streams. (Thirdly) from S\u00e1g\u00e1r in a north-easterly direction towards Cawnpore. This road enters the district in the extreme north-east corner at Hir\u00e1pur. It is not made or bridged till within about ten miles of S\u00e1g\u00e1r. There is no travellers' bungalow on it within the limits of the district, but one has lately been constructed at Sh\u00e1hgarh, about forty miles from S\u00e1g\u00e1r. (Fourthly) from S\u00e1g\u00e1r in a north-westerly direction to Sironj in Sindia's territory, and Mhow via Kura\u00ed, the latter place being at the extremity of the district. This road is made and bridged, with the exception of one stream (the Dhas\u00e1n), from S\u00e1g\u00e1r to Kura\u00ed\u2014a distance of about thirty-six miles. But the road which is destined to be the main artery of communication and outlet of the S\u00e1g\u00e1r district is still under construction. It is to connect S\u00e1g\u00e1r with the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, having Kareli as its terminal point, and crossing the Narbad\u00e1 at the Birm\u00e1n Gh\u00e1t, believed to be one of the best on the river.\n\nThe S\u00e1g\u00e1r district was not always united under one head. Semi-independent rulers of small tracts have co-existed at various places; and whilst the southern half has been governed from Rehl\u00ed, the northern half has been subject to Dh\u00e1mon\u00ed or Sh\u00e1hgarh. It is therefore preferable to narrate the history of these and other centres of domination separately, and thus we may form a correct idea of the past history of the whole district. Antiquities too may perhaps be better described in notices of the places where they actually occur. The articles to which reference should be made are those on the towns of Deori, Dh\u00e1mon\u00ed, Eran, Garh\u00e1kot\u00e1, Garol\u00e1, It\u00e1w\u00e1, Kura\u00ed, Khiml\u00e1\u015b\u00e1, Kanji\u00e1, R\u00e1hatgarh, S\u00e1g\u00e1r, and Sh\u00e1hgarh.\n\nSA'GAR\u2014The central revenue subdivision or tahsil of the district of the same name, having an area of 1,048 square miles, with 539 villages, and a population of 130,340 souls according to the census of 1866. The land revenue for the year 1869-70 is Rs. 1,51,543.\n\nSA'GAR\u2014The principal town in the district of the same name, and said to be the Sageda of Ptolemy. It is situated in latitude 23\u00b0 49' 49\", and longitude 78\u00b0 48' 45\", at an elevation above the sea of about 1,940 feet. Some of the hills have, however, a greater altitude; that on which the magistrate's court is built being upwards of 2,000 feet above the sea level. S\u00e1g\u00e1r is one hundred and nine miles north-west of Jabalp\u00far; two hundred and forty-seven miles via Narsinghp\u00far to the north of N\u00e1gp\u00far; two hundred and twenty-three miles south-west of Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d; two hundred and thirty-three miles south of A'gra; eight hundred and eight miles west of Calcutta; and two hundred and fifteen miles north-east of Mhow. It is situated on the borders of a fine lake of oval shape, with a circumference of about four miles, and nearly one mile across. Local tradition takes back the history of S\u00e1g\u00e1r to a very remote period. Up to the eleventh century of our era it is said to have been held by the aboriginal tribes. Then it fell into the hands of the pastoral Ah\u00edrs, whose chief town was Garh Pihr\u00e1\u2014a place about seven miles to the north of S\u00e1g\u00e1r. They were dispossessed shortly afterwards by the Rajput R\u00e9j\u00e1s of J\u00e1lann in Bundelkhand, who became masters of a territory here, embracing some 350 villages. In A.D. 1660 a small fort was built on the site of the present structure by one of these chiefs, and a village was founded called Parkot\u00e1,\nwhich is now one of the quarters of the modern town. Thus the present town of S\u00e1gar is not more than two centuries old, though the lake from which it derives its name is said to be a Banj\u00e1r\u00e1 work, and much older. The next possessor of S\u00e1gar was Chhatra S\u00e1l, the famous chieftain of Pann\u00e1, whose descendants still hold the estate of Bilihr\u00e1. In A.D. 1733 Chhatra S\u00e1l, being hard pressed by Mohammad Kh\u00e1n Bangash, the governor of Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d and M\u00e1lw\u00e1, asked the aid of the Peshw\u00e1, who drove the Mohammadans out of this part of the country. R\u00e9j\u00e9 Jai Singh was afterwards appointed governor of M\u00e1lw\u00e1, but he came to an agreement with the Peshw\u00e1, and yielded his government to him. On Chhatra S\u00e1l\u2019s death in 1835 he left one-third of his kingdom to the Peshw\u00e1, who sent a confidential agent named Govind Pandit to take charge of his new heritage. The territory made over comprised the districts of S\u00e1gar, Garhp\u00edhr\u00e1, and others, yielding an estimated annual revenue of about thirty-six l\u00f3khs of rupees. Govind Pandit remained in charge as manager, and extended his dominions to K\u00e1lp\u00ed, which he then made his headquarters, leaving his son-in-law Vis\u00e1j\u00ed as his representative at S\u00e1gar. Govind Pandit was killed in 1760 at the battle of P\u00e1nipat. He was succeeded by his son B\u00e1l\u00e1j\u00ed, who was again succeeded by his son Raghun\u00e1th R\u00e1o, commonly known as A\u2019b\u00e9 S\u00e1hib, in whose time S\u00e1gar was twice plundered by the Naw\u00e1b of Tonk and his army. A\u2019b\u00e9 S\u00e1hib died without heirs in A.D. 1802, but his two wives, R\u00e1dh\u00e1 B\u00e1\u00ed and Rukm\u00e9 B\u00e1\u00ed, carried on the government through a regent, one Vin\u00e1yak R\u00e1o. In A.D. 1804 Sind\u00ed\u00e1 plundered the town, and made a prisoner of Vin\u00e1yak R\u00e1o; giving him his liberty, however, on payment of Rs. 75,000.\n\nIn the beginning of the year A.D. 1818, by a treaty concluded between the Peshw\u00e1 B\u00e1j\u00ed R\u00e1o and the British Government, S\u00e1gar, with the greater part of the present S\u00e1gar district, Damoh, Jabalp\u00far, and Mandla, were made over to the British. At that time Vin\u00e1yak R\u00e1o was acting as agent for R\u00e1dh\u00e1 B\u00e1\u00ed and Rukm\u00e9 B\u00e1\u00ed. A small army commanded by General Marshall, with Mr. Wauchope, the Political Agent for Bundelkhand, was sent by Government to take possession of the ceded districts, which was done, and a yearly sum of two and a half l\u00f3khs of rupees was allotted by Government for pensions to Rukm\u00e9 B\u00e1\u00ed, Vin\u00e1yak R\u00e1o, and the other officers of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 Government. A descendant of Bukm\u00e9 B\u00e1\u00ed still enjoys a pension of Rs. 10,000 per annum. The son of Vin\u00e1yak R\u00e1o is now an Honorary Magistrate at S\u00e1gar, with a like pension. In March 1842 occurred the outbreak which is known as the Bundel\u00e1 insurrection. Jaw\u00e1hir Singh, the holder of Chandrap\u00far (a small town about sixteen miles north by west of S\u00e1gar, on the Lalatp\u00far road), with Madhukar S\u00e1 and Ganeshj\u00e1, the two sons of R\u00e1o Bije Bah\u00e1dur, of N\u00e1r\u00e1th (a small hilly tract about forty miles north of S\u00e1gar, now in the district of Lalatp\u00far), having been sued on account of decrees of the Civil Court, broke out into open rebellion, killed several police, and burned and plundered the towns of Khiml\u00e1ss\u00e1, Kur\u00e1\u00ed, Naraol\u00ed, Dh\u00e1m\u00f3n\u00ed, and Bin\u00e1ik\u00e1. On hearing of this, Delan S\u00e1, a Gond chief, living to the south of the district, also rose and plundered Deor\u00ed and the surrounding country. In the following year the two sons of R\u00e1o Bije Bah\u00e1dur were caught by Captain Hamilton, an Assistant at S\u00e1gar, in the Bh\u00e1np\u00far state. One was hanged, and the other transported; the remaining leaders gave themselves up, and were pardoned. The whole district suffered immensely from this outbreak, and the land revenue was realised with difficulty for several years. It was in consequence of the supposed discredit thrown on the British Government by these events that Lord Ellenborough broke up the administration of the S\u00e1gar and Narbad\u00e1 territories, and reorganised it on an entirely new footing.\nIn June 1857, when the Sepoy Mutiny commenced, the regiments stationed at S\u00e1gar were the 31st N. I., commanded by Major Hampden, and the 42nd, by Colonel Dalzell, with the 3rd Irregular Cavalry and a few European gunners. The forces were commanded by Brigadier Sage. As the officers had little reason to believe that their regiments would behave better than others, they, with the European artillery and residents of the station, by order of the Brigadier, moved into the fort on the 27th June 1857, taking all the arms they could collect, and the treasure from the district office. The regiments remained in their lines for a short time, when the 42nd and the Cavalry mutinied, committed several outrages in the cantonments, and burnt a good many houses. They also took possession of all the treasure that had been left. The 31st, however, remained faithful, and made a demonstration against the 42nd and the Cavalry, on which the greater number of the two latter made off towards Sh\u00e1hgarh. When the news of the mutiny of the regiments at S\u00e1gar got about, Mardan Singh, R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Bh\u00e1np\u00far, came down and took possession of the present subdivision of Kur\u00e1t, placing his officers in charge at the different towns. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Sh\u00e1hgarh also took possession of Band\u00e1, Rehl\u00ed, and Garh\u00e1kot\u00e1; and A\u2019dil Mohammad, Naw\u00e1b of Garh\u00ed A\u2019m\u00e1p\u00e1n\u00ed\u2014a place now in Bhop\u00e1l\u2014took possession of R\u00e1hatgarh. In fact these three divided the whole district between them. The Europeans, however, still kept the fort and the town of S\u00e1gar, though postal communication was stopped, and no revenue could of course be collected. All the police and customs officers who had remained faithful were summoned into S\u00e1gar, and assisted in saving the city from plunder. The rebels frequently made demonstrations against the fort, but never dared to actually attack it. Things remained in this state for about eight months, viz. from July 1857 to the end of January 1858. During this time such troops as could be got together at S\u00e1gar had three times engaged the rebels. First, at Bin\u00e1k\u00e1 there was an engagement with the forces of the Sh\u00e1hgarh and P\u00e1tan r\u00e1g\u00e1s, in which our troops captured a gun. Secondly, at Narasol\u00ed, where Colonel Dalzell of the 42nd N. I. and several others were killed. Thirdly, at Bh\u00e1pail. None of these actions were, however, in any way decisive. In February 1858 Sir Hugh Rose arrived at R\u00e1hatgarh with the Central India Field Force, totally defeated the rebels under the Naw\u00e1b of Garh\u00ed A\u2019m\u00e1p\u00e1n\u00ed, and took, and partially destroyed, the fort of R\u00e1hatgarh. From thence he passed on to Barodi\u00e1 Naunagar, about ten miles from R\u00e1hatgarh, where he met and defeated the troops of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Bh\u00e1np\u00far, and then came into S\u00e1gar. In consequence of the abovementioned defeats, the whole of the rebels about R\u00e1hatgarh and Kura\u00ed fled, taking with them the officers whom they had placed in charge. Passing through S\u00e1gar, Sir Hugh Rose went on to Garh\u00e1kot\u00e1, where he met and defeated the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Sh\u00e1hgarh\u2019s troops, and took the fort, where the rebels had left a large quantity of treasure and property of all kinds. Sir Hugh Rose then came back to S\u00e1gar, and went off towards Lalatpur and Jh\u00e1ns\u00ed, leaving the whole district free from rebels. He met the remainder of the Sh\u00e1hgarh r\u00e1g\u00e1s\u2019s troops at Madanp\u00far, and defeated them with great slaughter. By the beginning of March 1858 the whole district had been put into tolerable order again, and the police and revenue offices re-established. The dominions of the Sh\u00e1hgarh r\u00e1g\u00e1s were confiscated, and a part of them was added to the S\u00e1gar district. S\u00e1gar is perhaps a solitary instance of a station and city being held almost intact, while the whole surrounding country was in the possession of rebels. The prestige of the fort was always very great with natives, and now stands higher than ever.\nThe town itself is situated in a hilly tract, considerably elevated above the surrounding country. It is built along the west, north, and north-east sides of the large lake, as already mentioned, which occupies a basin surrounded by hills. The number of houses is about 7,328, and the population about 29,917. The military cantonments and the sadar bazar, though not containing more than one-third of the number of houses in the city, are computed by the military authorities to have a population of 20,463. The town is well built, and most of the streets are wide and handsome. There are several large bathing ghats on the banks of the lake, mostly surrounded with Hind\u00fa temples, which add much to the appearance of the place.\n\nThe chief trade of S\u00e1gar is in salt. Prior to 1863 the city was a free mart; that is salt was allowed to enter free of duty. Since that period a bonded warehouse has been established, where the merchants can store their salt, and from thence at their convenience it is exported to Jabalp\u00far, Rew\u00e1, Narsinghp\u00far, and Bundelkhand. The salt is brought to S\u00e1gar by Banj\u00e1ras, and is of two sorts, called K\u00e1nsi and S\u00e1mbhar, the former coming from the Pachbhadra salt marshes in the R\u00e1jput state of Jodhp\u00far, and the latter from the salt lake at S\u00e1mbhar, which belongs partly to Jodhp\u00far and partly to Jaipur. A Collector of Customs is stationed at S\u00e1gar, and the duties collected by him on salt and sugar are very considerable. During 1868-69 the collections amounted to Rs. 5,41,788, as follows:\n\n| Salt | Rs. 4,99,466 |\n| Sacharine produce | Rs. 42,322 |\n\nA large trade is also carried on in sugar and kir\u00e1na, i.e. grocery, from Mirz\u00e9p\u00far. The latter term includes spices of all descriptions, cocoanuts, tobacco, dried fruit, betelnut, and the like. Cloths of English manufacture are also largely imported from Mirz\u00e9p\u00far, and English piece-goods in large quantities come into the S\u00e1gar markets from Bombay via Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d. The following table exhibits the Import and Export trade of the town for the year 1868-69:\n\n| Articles                  | Imports |          | Exports |          |\n|---------------------------|---------|----------|---------|----------|\n|                           | Quantity| Value    | Quantity| Value    |\n| Cotton                    | 456     | 9,400    |         |          |\n| Sugar and gur             | 17,981  | 1,60,189 | 5,849   | 53,153   |\n| Salt                      | 28,809  | 2,00,592 | 37,939  | 3,38,988 |\n| Wheat                     | 30,144  | 88,817   | 1,858   | 5,585    |\n| Rice                      | 9,474   | 42,281   |         |          |\n| Other edible grains       | 17,059  | 39,631   | 1,504   | 5,334    |\n| Oil-seeds of all descriptions | 7,074 | 28,185   |         |          |\n| Metals and hardware       | 4,531   | 46,508   | 519     | 4,279    |\n| Carried over              | 115,528 | 6,15,553 | 47,669  | 4,07,284 |\n| Articles                        | Imports |          | Exports |          |\n|--------------------------------|---------|----------|---------|----------|\n|                                | Quantity| Value    | Quantity| Value    |\n| Brought forward                | 115,528 | 6,15,553 | 47,669  | 4,07,284 |\n| English piece-goods             | 3,821   | 2,29,256 | 288     | 31,969   |\n| Miscellaneous European goods    | 2,114   | 20,422   |         |          |\n| Country cloth                   | 4,022   | 58,839   | 1,275   | 57,990   |\n| Lac                             | 49      | 392      | 557     | 5,503    |\n| Tobacco                         | 3,919   | 37,720   | 663     | 6,511    |\n| Spices                          |         |          |         |          |\n| Country stationery              |         |          | 17      | 175      |\n| Silk and silk cocoons           | 6       | 552      | 15      | 135      |\n| Dyes                            | 30      | 900      |         |          |\n| Hides and horns                 | 1       | 15       |         |          |\n| Opium                           | 15      | 9,836    |         |          |\n| Wool                            |         |          | 22      | 200      |\n| Timber and wood                 | 18,631  | 17,452   |         |          |\n| Ghee and oil                    | 75      | 1,380    | 1,490   | 29,503   |\n| Cocoanuts                       | 2,224   | 14,991   | 6       | 58       |\n| Miscellaneous                    | 27,215  | 81,245   | 7,549   | 50,564   |\n| Total                           | 172,650 | 10,88,553| 59,551  | 5,89,892 |\n\n| No.                            |         |          |         |          |\n| Horses                          | 15      | 349      | 35      | 665      |\n| Cattle                          |         |          | 50      | 262      |\n| Sheep                           | 100     | 150      | 100     | 150      |\n| Total                           | 115     | 499      | 185     | 1,077    |\n| Grand Total                     |         | 10,89,052|         | 5,90,969 |\n\nTown duties have been collected in S\u00e1g\u00e1r since 1855. From their proceeds the whole cost of the city and cantonment police, and of the lighting and conservancy of the city and cantonment, is defrayed, and the surplus is applied to local improvements in the city and station.\n\nThe fort, as stated before, was commenced by the R\u00e1jputs in A.D. 1660, but was completed as it now stands by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s about one hundred years ago. It stands on the north-west banks of the lake at a considerable elevation, commanding the whole of the city and surrounding country. It has been built on no particular plan, but so as to take the best advantage of the ground on which it stands. It consists of twenty round towers, varying from twenty to forty feet in height,\nconnected by thick curtain-walls, and enclosing a space of six acres. This space is for the most part covered with old Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 buildings of two stories. Since the accession of the British Government, a magazine, a large building now used for medical stores, and a barrack for the European guard, besides other small buildings for the magazine stores, &c., have been constructed. There is only one place of exit and entrance\u2014on the east side. The bulk of the treasure has always been kept in the fort, but orders have lately been received for the construction of a suitable building close to the Deputy Commissioner's court-house for its reception. A large castellated jail was built by the Public Works Department in A.D. 1846, at a cost of Rs. 50,000, about half a mile east of the lake. It is capable of containing 500 prisoners. Its situation is, however, too low. The present Deputy Commissioner's court\u2014a large building situated on a high hill overlooking the city and lake\u2014was built about the year 1820 as a Residency for the Governor-General's Agent. In A.D. 1862 and 1863 a Sessions Court-house was built to the north of the Deputy Commissioner's court-house, at a cost of Rs. 5,000. In 1820, soon after the cession of S\u00e1g\u00e1r to the British, a large and handsome building was erected for a Mint, about a mile east of the lake, by Captain Presgrave, Assay-master. This mint used formerly to employ 400 men, but coining was only continued for about ten or twelve years, when the business was transferred to Calcutta. The building is now used as the office of the Customs department. The present city \"kotw\u00e1l,\" or station-house, is a fine building, situated under the western walls of the fort, close to the banks of the lake, and overlooking one of the principal thoroughfares of the city. It was built in 1856.\n\nUp to the year 1862, to the north-east of the lake, and dividing the main portion of the city from the quarter called Gop\u00e1l Ganj, there existed a large unhealthy swamp quite unculturable, and covered during the rains with low jungle vegetation. In 1862-63 this was thoroughly drained and converted into a large garden, with numerous drives, and a piece of ornamental water surrounding a small island, at a cost of Rs. 30,000.* To it there was then added a small garden which formerly existed to the north-east of the swamp, and the whole now forms a large public garden of upwards of sixty acres, which supplies regularly nearly the whole of the residents in the civil station and cantonments with flowers and vegetables; it is supported partly by its own proceeds, and partly by yearly grants from the S\u00e1g\u00e1r octroi.\n\nThe High School at S\u00e1g\u00e1r was established about 1828 by Captain James Paton, of the Bengal Artillery, and was supported from his private funds. He was greatly assisted by R\u00e1o Krishna R\u00e1o, the son of a Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 gentleman and official. Lord William Bentinck was so pleased with R\u00e1o Krishna R\u00e1o, that he invited him to Calcutta, gave him a gold medal, and procured for him a J\u00e1gir for two generations, valued at from Rs. 600 to Rs. 1,000 per annum. He also gave him the title of \"R\u00e1o.\" R\u00e1o Krishna R\u00e1o is still alive, and is an Honorary Magistrate. The languages originally taught were Persian, Hind\u00ed, and Mar\u00e1thi; but the present curriculum comprises Urd\u00fa, Hind\u00fa, English, and Sanscrit. The school is now located in a commodious building erected at a cost of Rs. 11,000. It is affiliated to the Calcutta University, of which some of its scholars are already members, though still in statu pupillari. The educational staff\n\n*This improvement was principally effected by Mr. J. S. Campbell, the then Commissioner of the S\u00e1g\u00e1r Division.\ncomprises seven English masters on salaries varying from Rs. 30 to Rs. 400 per mensem, and four Vernacular masters. There is also a librarian. The number of pupils on the rolls in March 1869 was 283, and the average daily attendance was 221, all of whom learn English. S\u00e9gar has also a Vernacular middle class school\u2014attended by more than a hundred scholars\u2014several indigenous schools, and a female school.\n\nThe civil station commences with the mint, about a mile east of the lake, and extends northwards for about a mile, till joined by the military cantonments, which again extend in a north-easterly direction for two miles and a half or more. The undulating nature of the ground (the houses being built all over it, and some on the tops and sides of surrounding hills) gives the station a varied and pleasing aspect, particularly in the rainy season, when the ground loses its parched and arid appearance. The church is erected almost in the centre of the military cantonments. It is in the Gothic style, but has few pretensions to elegance. There are some barracks for Europeans erected on an eminence close to the city, but the greater number of barracks, in which the European regiment and artillery are located, are situated on a hill with a level plateau to the top, to the extreme north of the military station. These barracks are, however, only temporary, and the magnificent new two-storied buildings are approaching completion. Before the Mutiny the cantonments were exclusively garrisoned by Native troops, with a detail of European artillery. Ever since, however, a European regiment and two batteries of European artillery, with a Native cavalry and infantry regiment, have been stationed there. There is a large magazine and depot of medical stores in the fort.\n\nSA'IGHA'TA'\u2014A small village in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, six miles west of Brahmapur\u00ed, possessing a fine irrigation-reservoir.\n\nSA'INKHERA'\u2014A small town, with a population of 2,325 souls, situated on the D\u00fadh\u00ed in the extreme north-western corner of the Narsinghp\u00far district. Some cloth, tasar silk, and brass and copper vessels are manufactured here.\n\nSA'KOLI'\u2014The eastern revenue subdivision or tahsil in the Bhand\u00e1ra district, composed of three parganas, viz. S\u00e1ngarh\u00ed, K\u00e1mth\u00e1, and Prat\u00e1pagarh, and having an area of 2,174 square miles, of which 522 are cultivated, 750 culturable, and 902 waste. The population amounts to 262,610 souls, inhabiting 886 towns and villages, and giving an average rate of 121 to the square mile. The land revenue for the year 1869-70 is Rs. 1,22,610.\n\nSAKRI'\u2014A stream in the Bil\u00e1sp\u00far district, which, having its rise in the Chilp\u00ed hills, flows east through the Kaward\u00e1 chiefship and the Mungel\u00ed pargana, and is eventually absorbed in the H\u00e1mp.\n\nSAKTI'\u2014A small feudatoryship, situated at the extreme eastern limit of the Bil\u00e1sp\u00far district, containing 97 villages, and covering an area of 115 square miles. It was originally one of the Garhj\u00e1t states attached to the Sambalp\u00far district, and consists of a curved strip of level country, partly open, partly covered with forest, skirting the base of a prominent range known locally as the Gunj\u00ed hills. The cultivated area is 26,318 acres, and the culturable 42,000 acres. The population is 11,784, giving an average of 102 souls to the square mile. The chief is a Gond.\nSAKTI\u2014The head-quarters of the Sakt\u00ed chiefship in the Bil\u00e1sp\u00far district.

Nothing certain is known of the early history of this tenure, but it is believed to have been one of the grants made for guarding the passes of the hill country, and has been in the family of the present holders for many generations.

It lies between 19\u00b0 10' and 22\u00b0 35' of north latitude, and 82\u00b0 40' and 85\u00b0 5' of east longitude. Its extreme length from north to south is about 250 miles, and its extreme breadth from east to west 165 miles. The kh\u00e1lisa, or Government portion of the district, is computed to comprise 2,500 square miles. It is surrounded by a circle of chiefships, sixteen in number, called the kh\u00e1lisa zam\u00ednd\u00e1r\u00eds, and these again are encircled by eight larger states, hitherto known as the Garhj\u00e1t states. To the extreme south, beyond the P\u00e1t\u00edna Garhj\u00e1t state, is the large feudatory state of K\u00e1r\u00e1nd or K\u00e1l\u00e1hand\u00ed. The total area of the kh\u00e1lisa zam\u00ednd\u00e1r\u00ed lands is estimated at 700 square miles, and the Garhj\u00e1t\u00eds, including K\u00e1r\u00e1nd or K\u00e1l\u00e1hand\u00ed, are about 20,000 square miles, so that at a rough computation the total area of Sambalp\u00far, with all its native states and zam\u00ednd\u00e1r\u00eds, may be some 23,000 square miles. Of the total area about two-fifths are under cultivation, and the remainder is forest, jungle, and waste.\n\nThe eight Garhj\u00e1t states above referred to are:\n\n- P\u00e1t\u00edna.\n- R\u00e9iggarh with Bargarh.\n- Bor\u00e1s\u00e1mbar.\n- B\u00e1mr\u00e1.\n- S\u00e1rangarh.\n- Phul\u00edjar.\n- Sonp\u00far.\n- Rair\u00e1khol.\nThe chiefs of the first six have been recognised by the British Government as feudatories, but the last two now come under the head of ordinary chiefships. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 of K\u00e1rond is also a feudatory.\n\nThe following is a list of the Sambalp\u00far zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs in the Uttart\u00edr or Northern subdivision:\n\nKol\u00e1b\u00edr\u00e1 or Jaikor.  \nR\u00e1mp\u00far.  \nR\u00e1jp\u00far.  \nKor\u00e1bag\u00e1.\n\nLair\u00e1.  \nLoisingh.  \nMach\u00edd\u00e1.  \nChandrap\u00far, with Padmap\u00far.\n\nIn the Southern subdivision or Dakhant\u00edr:\n\nBarp\u00e1l\u00ed.  \nGhes.  \nBasaikel\u00e1.  \nKharsal.\n\nP\u00e1tkoland\u00e1.  \nMandu Mahal Sirgir\u00e1.  \nPah\u00e1r Sirgir\u00e1.  \nUtt\u00e1l or B\u00e1\u00eds\u00ed.\n\nThese places will all be found more fully described elsewhere.\n\nThe kh\u00e1l\u00e1sa portion of the Sambalp\u00far district is divided into two subdivisions, namely, Sambalp\u00far and Bargarh\u2014the former lying to the north and east, and the latter to the south and west of the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed. They are popularly known as the Uttart\u00edr and the Dakhant\u00edr.\n\nThe greater part of this country is an undulating plain, with rugged ranges of hills rising in every direction. The principal of these ranges is the Bar\u00e1 Pah\u00e1r in the Dakhant\u00edr, which is in fact a succession of ranges, covering an area of some 350 square miles. It was the stronghold of Surendra S\u00e1 and his followers during the rebellion. The kh\u00e1l\u00e1sa is well cultivated, rice being the staple crop; and in the Dakhant\u00edr especially, with the exception of the Bar\u00e1 Pah\u00e1r jungle tract, the jungle and forest have been completely cleared, nothing being left but mango, mhowa, and other fruit-trees, and here and there a small patch of s\u00e1l jungle. This part of the country, especially when seen from a slight elevation, is very picturesque, and has the appearance of a vast park. Every village nearly has its one or two tanks; but though some of them are large and deep,* none are faced with stone or otherwise solidly constructed.\n\nMr. Medlicott\u2019s\u2020 remarks on the geological formation may be here quoted:\n\n\"The soil, not being alluvial, varies a good deal with the nature of the underlying rock: and this being, as a rule, highly silicious and indurated, so is the soil light and sandy. A very large proportion of the district is occupied by crystalline metamorphic rocks. A small portion of the north-west corner of the district is composed of the sandstone, limestone, and shale, which cover such a large area in the R\u00e1jp\u00far and Bil\u00e1spur districts. In the north there are outlying patches of various extent of different groups of the Indian carboniferous series, principally composed of soft sandstone.\"\n\nIron-ore is found in nearly all the zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs and Garhj\u00e1t states. It is most plentiful and of the best description in Rair\u00e1khol. There are two or three descriptions of building stone; one sandstone is particularly good, being easy to cut, while\n\n* Of the Geological Survey.\n\u2020 These remarks are taken from a note drawn up for the Deputy Commissioner.\nit hardens on exposure. Limestone is abundant. In the river Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed, near Padmap\u00far, there are large masses of limestone rock, almost as pure in appearance as marble. Gold dust is procured in the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed and in its affluent, the Eb, but the process of collecting it is scarcely remunerative. Diamonds used to be found also in the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed near an island called Hirakhud\u00e1 or the Diamond Isle, also at the spot where the Eb joins the above river. During the period of native rule some fifteen or twenty villages were granted rent-free to a class called Jhir\u00e1s, in consideration of their undertaking the search for diamonds. When the country lapsed in 1850 these villages were resumed; and though an attempt was made to lease out the right to seek for diamonds, the farm only fetched some Rs. 200 per annum for a short time, and even at that low rent it does not appear that the farmer made anything out of it, for he eventually gave it up. Under the native government it was the practice to give the Jhir\u00e1s a village rent-free if they produced a good-sized diamond, land being of little or no value then. The smaller diamonds they used to secrete and sell. As far as can be learnt, the best stones ever found here were thin and flat, with flaws in them, but they were admirably suited for setting in native jewellery.\n\nThere is little or no timber of value to be found in the kh\u00e1lsa portion of the district. In the zam\u00edn\u00e9d\u00e1rs there are tracts of s\u00e1l (shorea robusta), s\u00e1j (terminalia tomentosa), dh\u00e1ur\u00e1 (conocarpus latifolia), b\u00edjes\u00e1l (pterocarpus marsupium), and ebony (dioppyros melanoxylon), and in the Garhj\u00e1t states of Phuljh\u00e1r and Rair\u00e1khol there are vast forests of s\u00e1l.\n\nThe principal rivers are the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed, which rises in the R\u00e1ip\u00far district in a hilly range between Dhamtari and Bastar, and entering the Sambalp\u00far district to the eastward of Seor\u00edn\u00e1r\u00edn in the Bilasp\u00far district, flows due east for some twenty-five miles, when it takes a south-easterly direction for some forty miles, passing Chandrap\u00far and Padmap\u00far, until it reaches the town of Sambalp\u00far. From Sambalp\u00far its course is due south for some forty-five miles, as far as Sonp\u00far, where it suddenly changes to due east, following that direction until it empties itself into the sea beyond Cuttack. Its bed as far as Chandrap\u00far is tolerably free from obstructions, but from Chandrap\u00far to a little beyond Bod it is more or less full of them; its current is more or less hindered by boulders, jh\u00e1\u00fa jungle, and even trees. The other rivers deserving mention are the Eb, the Kel\u00fa, and the Jhir\u00e1\u2014all tributaries of the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed.\n\nThe principal hill ranges in the kh\u00e1lsa are those of the Bar\u00e1 Pah\u00e1r, in the northern portion of the Dakhantir\u2014a succession of ranges covering an area of some 350 square miles. They are all covered with dense jungle, but scattered here and there in the valleys are small villages, with patches of cultivation. The highest point is Debr\u00edfgarh\u20142,267 feet above the plain. The main portion of this network of hills is situated in a bend of the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed, by which it is almost surrounded on three sides; but to the south-west an outlying range projects some thirty miles to a place called \u201cSinghor\u00e1 Gh\u00e1t,\u201d where the road from R\u00e1ip\u00far to Sambalp\u00far winds through it. From this point the hills continue in a southerly direction through Phuljh\u00e1r, and then turning off abruptly to the westward, form a natural boundary for some distance between the two zamind\u00e1rs of Phuljh\u00e1r and Bor\u00e1s\u00e1mber. This Singhor\u00e1\nPass is famous for the numerous actions that have been fought there. Whenever the Gonds of Phuljh\u00e1r, Bor\u00e1s\u00e1mb\u00e1r, and the surrounding states wished to harass enemies approaching from the Chhatt\u00edsgarh side, it was invariably at this pass that they made a stand. It was here that, during the rebellion of 1857, the troops under Captain Wood, Major Shakespear, and Lieutenant Rybot, marching to the relief of Sambalp\u00far, on three separate occasions met with determined resistance from the rebels under Surendra S\u00e1. Another range of importance is that of Jargh\u00e1t\u00ed, in the Uttart\u00edn, which crosses the Chot\u00e1 N\u00e1gp\u00far road some twenty miles north of Sambalp\u00far. Its highest point is 1,693 feet above the plain, and it also was used as a stronghold by the rebels. To the southward, and running parallel with the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed, are a succession of broken ranges for some thirty miles, the highest points of which are Mandhar, 1,563 feet, and Bod\u00e1sp\u00e1l\u00ed, 2,831 feet. There are also numerous isolated hills and small ranges scattered over the kh\u00e1l\u00e1s\u00e1. The most lofty are Sun\u00e1rl\u00ed, 1,549 feet; Chel\u00e1, 1,450 feet; and Rosor\u00e1, 1,646 feet.\n\nThe imperial lines of road in the district are as follows:\u2014The R\u00e1ip\u00far and Sambalp\u00far road, from S\u00e1nkr\u00e1 on the Jonk river to Sambalp\u00far, one hundred miles. The Sambalp\u00far and Cuttack road via Rair\u00e1khol and Ang\u00fal, fifty miles. From Soh\u00e9l\u00e1 to Bink\u00e1\u2014a branch road from the R\u00e1ip\u00far and Sambalp\u00far road\u2014thirty-five miles. The two first-named are kept in tolerable repair by the Public Works Department, wooden bridges being thrown over the principal n\u00e1l\u00e1s; these bridges, however, require to be repaired, and sometimes entirely renewed, after every monsoon. The road from Soh\u00e9l\u00e1 to Bink\u00e1 has merely been lined out, and a little earthwork was commenced some four or five years ago, but it was suddenly stopped, so that it may be called now no road at all.\n\nThe district roads are from Sambalp\u00far to the Bil\u00e1sp\u00far frontier, some seventy miles, via Padmap\u00far and Chandrap\u00far; from Sambalp\u00far to Bink\u00e1, twenty-eight miles, and from Sambalp\u00far towards R\u00e1nch\u00ed, twenty-five miles. All these roads are in very bad order from want of funds. The small amounts available from the local funds scarcely suffice for carrying out the most trifling repairs.\n\nTrade.\n\nThe total value of the Exports and Imports of the district for six years are as follows:\n\n| Year   | Imports\u2014value | Exports\u2014value |\n|--------|---------------|---------------|\n| 1863-64| Rs. 5,58,395  | Rs. 25,328    |\n| 1864-65| Rs. 3,38,939  | Rs. 5,17,577  |\n| 1865-66| Rs. 5,49,808  | Rs. 6,64,899  |\n| 1866-67| Rs. 2,28,370  | Rs. 4,54,084  |\n| 1867-68| Rs. 3,47,910  | Rs. 5,87,882  |\n| 1868-69| Rs. 3,19,688  | Rs. 6,46,942  |\n\nThe falling off in 1866-67 in the trade was owing to the famine in Orissa, and the consequent stagnation of commerce; it was altogether an exceptional year. The principal articles of export are rice, oil-seeds, gur, stick-lac, tasar-silk, cotton, and iron. The chief imports are salt, refined sugar, Europe piece-goods, cocoanuts, muslins, fine cloths of native manufacture, and metals. A wealthy firm at Mirz\u00e1p\u00far employs an agent at Sambalp\u00far to collect lac and export it to Mirz\u00e1p\u00far. The demand fluctuates of course according to the prices that obtain at Mirz\u00e1p\u00far and Calcutta. There has been considerable depression of late years in the trade, but it is expected that it will recover. In ordinary seasons a very high profit is made on this export. The grain exports find their way chiefly to\nCuttack, whence in return come salt, sugar, cocoanuts, &c. During 1866-67 no less than 30,178 maunds of rice, valued at Rs. 1,01,717, were exported to Cuttack to meet the demand caused by the famine.\n\nThe manufactures of this district are few and of no great commercial value. Tasar silk-cloth is about the only article exported; the best is of a very fine description. Coarse cotton-cloths are made in every village nearly, as are also coloured saris and dhonis for the better classes. Vessels of brass and bell-metal, and gold and silver ornaments of rude workmanship, are also manufactured. There are but few skilled artisans in any trade, and to judge from the few architectural remains that exist, there never have been any.\n\nEducation has made wonderful progress in the district during the past three years. At the zil\u00e1 or district school some 141 pupils are receiving education, of whom 74 are learning English. There are also four branch schools in various quarters of the town, where the younger children receive elementary education previous to being transferred to the zil\u00e1 school. There are two town schools, five village schools, two hundred and twenty-three grant-in-aid schools, three zamindari schools, fourteen female schools, and one hundred and ninety indigenous schools. Altogether 13,091 boys and 1,273 girls are receiving instruction. In nearly every village of any size there is a good school-house; and the better classes and landholders show considerable interest in the cause.\n\nThe climate of Sambalpur is considered very unhealthy. Fever is very prevalent, especially from September to November inclusive. Foreigners suffer terribly from it,\u2014natives more perhaps even than Europeans. Cholera appears nearly every hot season, but it is to be traced generally to the gatherings at the temple of Jagannath at Pur\u00ed.\n\nAccording to tradition the first r\u00e9j\u00e1 of Sambalpur was Balram Deva\u2014a brother of Narsingh Deva, the then mahar\u00e1j\u00e1 of Patna, and chief of the group of Garhj\u00e1t states. He obtained from his brother a grant of all the jungle country lying beyond the Ung\u2014a tributary of the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed\u2014and by degrees acquired a considerable territory by conquest from the neighbouring chiefs of Sirg\u00faja, G\u00e1ngp\u00far, Bonai, and B\u00e1mr\u00e1. In A.D. 1493 his eldest son Har\u00ed N\u00e1r\u00e1yan Deva succeeded him. He settled the country now named Sonpur on his second son Madan Gop\u00e1l, whose descendants still hold it. His immediate successors were Bali\u00e1r Singh, Ratan Singh, Chhatra S\u00e1, and Ajit Singh, in whose reigns nothing worthy of notice here occurred. Ajit Singh was succeeded by his son Ubhay\u00e1 Singh (A.D. 1732), and in his reign seems to have occurred the first collision of these wild chiefs with the spreading Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 power.\n\nSeveral guns of large calibre, it is said, were being taken from Cuttack up the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed in boats, in view to their ultimate transport to N\u00e1gp\u00far. Akbar R\u00e9ya, the minister, thinking it a good opportunity for strengthening the Sambalpur fort, caused the boatmen to scuttle the boats in deep water, so that the guns all sunk, and many Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 artillery-men were drowned. The guns were subsequently recovered and mounted on the Sambalpur fort. The R\u00e9j\u00e1 of N\u00e1gp\u00far sent a strong detachment from N\u00e1gp\u00far to avenge the insult and recover the\nguns, but it was repulsed with slaughter. About A.D. 1797, in the reign of Jeth Singh, successor to Ubhaya Singh, another violent quarrel with the N\u00e1gp\u00far Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s took place. It appears that N\u00e1n\u00e1 S\u00e1hib\u2014a relation of the N\u00e1gp\u00far R\u00e1j\u00e1\u2014was going on a pilgrimage to Jagann\u00e1th with a large party of followers. On his way he was treacherously set upon by the S\u00e1rangarh and Sambalp\u00far people, and also by those of Sonp\u00far and Bod. He contrived, however, to push his way to Cuttack, where there were some Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 troops. Bringing these with him on his return, after some severe fighting he took the Bod chief and Prithv\u00ed Singh, the chief of Sonp\u00far, prisoners. He then encamped for the rainy season in the Sonp\u00far country. Meanwhile Jeth Singh had been strengthening the Sambalp\u00far fort in expectation of being attacked. As soon as the rains were over N\u00e1n\u00e1 S\u00e1hib appeared before Sambalp\u00far, and regularly invested the town. For five months he remained before the walls without being able to effect an entrance, but by chance one of his men discovered that the moat near the Saml\u00e1\u00ed gate was fordable. The N\u00e1n\u00e1, on hearing this, assembled his people, made a rush across the moat, and forced the gate. The fort was taken after a fierce resistance, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 Jeth Singh and his son Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j S\u00e1 being taken prisoners. The N\u00e1n\u00e1 S\u00e1hib took them off to N\u00e1gp\u00far with him, and the N\u00e1gp\u00far R\u00e1j\u00e1 had them confined at Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1. Bh\u00fap Singh, a Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 jamad\u00e1r, was left in charge of Sambalp\u00far to collect revenue, and administer the country in behalf of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 government. Bh\u00fap Singh, however, soon got into trouble with his government, and on being summoned to N\u00e1gp\u00far, refused to go. The N\u00e1gp\u00far R\u00e1j\u00e1 then sent a large force to compel him to obedience, but getting the assistance of the R\u00e1igarh and S\u00e1rangarh people, he lay in ambush at the Singhor\u00e1 pass, where he drove back the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, and completely routed their force. He, however, foolishly made an enemy of one Chamr\u00e1 G\u00e1onthiy\u00e1, by \u201clooting\u201d his village, which was near the pass. Consequently some short time after, when a second body of Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s arrived from N\u00e1gp\u00far, Chamr\u00e1, instead of sending word to Bh\u00fap Singh, placed the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 troops in ambush in the same pass where they had been previously defeated, and sending word to Bh\u00fap Singh that a few troopers only were looting the country on the western side of the gh\u00e1t, induced him to bring a force through it, when the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s fell upon his party and almost annihilated it. Bh\u00fap Singh fled to Sambalp\u00far, whence, taking the R\u00e1n\u00eds of Jeth Singh with him, he retired to Kol\u00e1bir\u00e1. While there he implored the assistance of the British in behalf of the R\u00e1n\u00eds, and Captain Roughsedge, with a portion of the R\u00e1mgarh local battalion, was sent to Sambalp\u00far in A.D. 1804. On their arrival, T\u00e1t\u00ed\u00e1 Pharnav\u00eds, the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 manager, who had replaced Bh\u00fap Singh, withdrew with all his people to N\u00e1gp\u00far. Raghoj\u00ed Bhonsl\u00e1, the then r\u00e1j\u00e1 of N\u00e1gp\u00far, remonstrated with the British Government for thus turning him out of a country that he had fairly conquered, and the Government restored it to him.\n\nThe country remained for some years under the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 Government, but Restoration of Sambalp\u00far line. Major Roughsedge, who was in command of the R\u00e1mgarh local battalion at Haz\u00e1ri\u00e1b\u00e1gh, pleaded the cause of J\u00e9th Singh so energetically, that Sir Richard Jenkins, the Resident at N\u00e1gp\u00far, obtained his release from Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 in A.D. 1817. He was restored to power in that year, but died in 1818. The country was then held by the British Government for a year; but Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j S\u00e1, the son of J\u00e9th Singh, was made R\u00e1j\u00e1 in 1820, though without the feudal superiority which the former r\u00e1j\u00e1s had held over the other chiefships, and Major Roughsedge was also established at Sambalp\u00far as Assistant Agent to the Governor-General and Super-\nintendent of Tributary Mah\u00e1ls. Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j S\u00e1 died in A.D. 1827, and his widow, R\u00e1n\u00ed Mohan Kum\u00e1ri, was allowed to succeed. But disturbances almost immediately commenced to break out, and several Zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs and Th\u00e1kurs rebelled. Amongst others were Surendra S\u00e1 and Govind Singh, both \u201cChauh\u00e1ns\u201d and pretenders to the chiefship. The kh\u00e1lisa villages were plundered to within a few miles of Sambalp\u00far, but Lieutenant Higgins, with a body of the R\u00e1mgarh battalion, which was located in the fort, drove off the rebels for a time. Matters were, however, getting so serious that the Agent, Captain Wilkinson, from Haz\u00e1r\u00edb\u00e1g, had to come himself to settle them. Several of the rebels were captured and hanged; but Captain Wilkinson, seeing that there would be endless disturbances so long as the R\u00e1n\u00ed Mohan Kum\u00e1ri remained in power, deposed her, and set up N\u00e1r\u00e1yan Singh, a descendant of Bikram Singh, the eldest son of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 B\u00e1l\u00ed\u00e1r Singh, who, as has before been shown, was not considered qualified to hold the \u201cr\u00e1j,\u201d owing to his mother being of inferior caste. N\u00e1r\u00e1yan Singh was at this time what is called at Sambalp\u00far a \u201cB\u00e1b\u00fa\u201d\u2014a title of no importance, but implying that the individual is of the \u201cChauh\u00e1n\u201d or chief\u2019s family. He was moreover, it would seem, a sort of personal attendant on the R\u00e1n\u00ed Mohan Kum\u00e1ri. He is described to have been perfectly astounded when it was proposed to make him r\u00e1j\u00e1, and to have actually prayed the Agent not to exalt him to so dangerous a position. However, Mohan Kum\u00e1ri was sent off to Cuttack, the Government troops were withdrawn, and N\u00e1r\u00e1yan Singh left to manage his newly-acquired kingdom in the best manner he could.\n\nAs a matter of course, rebellion broke out at once. Balabhadra S\u00e1, zam\u00ednd\u00e1r of Lakhanp\u00far, a Gond, commenced it, and it was a long time before he could be put down, as he always found shelter in the vast range of hills known as the Bar\u00e1 Pah\u00e1r. He was, however, at last slain at Debr\u00edgarh, the highest point of the said hills, and a noted rebel stronghold. In 1839 Major Ouseley succeeded to the appointment of Assistant Agent at Sambalp\u00far, and in the same year there were great disturbances, set on foot chiefly by Surendra S\u00e1, who looked upon N\u00e1r\u00e1yan Singh as an usurper, and himself as an injured person. He considered himself the lawful heir to the throne, on the ground of his being descended from Madhukar S\u00e1, fourth r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Sambalp\u00far. In 1840 he and his brother Udet S\u00e1, with their uncle Balr\u00e1m Singh, ruthlessly murdered the son and father of Dary\u00e1o Singh, zam\u00ednd\u00e1r of R\u00e1mp\u00far. Upon this the three were arrested, tried, and sent off to the jail of Chot\u00e1 N\u00e1gp\u00far as life-prisoners.\n\nN\u00e1r\u00e1yan Singh died in 1849, and his widow, R\u00e1n\u00ed Mukhp\u00e1n D\u00e1j\u00ed, assumed Lapse to British Government. the reins of government; but as he had died without male issue, the country was held to have lapsed to the British Government. Accordingly Mr. Crawford, the Agent to the Governor-General, issued a proclamation to that effect, and sent down two Native officials\u2014Munshi Prasanna L\u00e1l and R\u00e1\u00ed R\u00fap Singh\u2014to take over the R\u00e1j\u00fa\u2019s papers, and to dispose of petty cases, &c. Mr. Crawford himself arrived at Sambalp\u00far with a regiment of the R\u00e1mgarh local battalion in December 1849, bringing with him Dr. J. Cadenhead. The latter officer was left in charge of the district in the position of Principal Assistant to the Governor-General\u2019s Agent; N\u00e1r\u00e1yan Singh\u2019s widow\u2014the R\u00e1n\u00ed Mukhp\u00e1n D\u00e1j\u00ed\u2014being sent off to Cuttack, with a pension of Rs. 100 per mensem. The Native official R\u00fap Singh was also left at Sambalp\u00far in the capacity of Native Assistant. The first acts of the new government were not apparently judicious or conciliatory, for the revenue was at once raised by one-fourth indiscriminately, without reference to the capabilities of the villages; and the whole of the freehold grants, reli-\ngious and other, were resumed; those who held villages entirely rent-free were assessed at half jam\u00e1, without any reference to the period for which the grant had been held, or to the terms of the tenure; all assignments in money or grain from the revenues of villages were resumed, as well as all assignments of land in villages. Great dissatisfaction was consequently created at the outset, and so seriously did the Br\u00e1hmans, who form a numerous and powerful community, look upon it, that they went up in a body to R\u00e1nch\u00ed to appeal. They, however, obtained no redress. In 1854 a second settlement was made on equally indiscriminate principles, the assessments of all villages being again raised by one-fourth.\n\nIn the month of September of the year 1857\u2014a few months after mutiny and rebellion had broken out in the Upper Provinces\u2014Surendra S\u00e1 and his brother Udet S\u00e1, who had been released from the jail at Haz\u00e1r\u00edb\u00e1g by the Bengal sepoys mutineers, re-appeared at Sambalp\u00far. They were joined by nearly all the chiefs. The chief of Kol\u00e1b\u00edr\u00e1 or Jeip\u00far was about the most powerful of these zam\u00edn-d\u00e1s; and on his going in heart and soul for the rebel cause, many of the others followed from the force of example, or were compelled to join by the more influential. A few, however, held aloof, among whom may be mentioned Govind Singh of J\u00e1sugr\u00e1, who has been alluded to before as having revolted against the R\u00e1n\u00ed Mohan Kum\u00e1ri. The fact was that he looked upon himself as the rightful heir to the state, and did not therefore support the pretensions of Surendra S\u00e1. Surendra S\u00e1, having collected a large force, marched straight into the town of Sambalp\u00far, and established himself within the precincts of the old fort, which was in ruins. Captain Leigh, who was the Principal Assistant, went down to confront him, taking with him some Madras infantry and some men of the R\u00e1mgarh battalion. Surendra S\u00e1 demanded the country as his right, but after a long debate it seems that he was induced to give himself up, and to direct his adherents to disperse. He was placed under the charge of the R\u00e1mgarh battalion, but no severe restraint was put on him. The consequence was that one day, on his being remonstrated with rather severely regarding the rebellion of some persons with whom he was supposed to be in communication, he made his escape, and joined the rebels in the hills. From that time up to the early part of 1862 troops were employed in every direction trying to hunt him down and disperse his band, but without success. The most daring atrocities were committed by him. If any villager showed the slightest inclination to afford assistance to the Government, his village would be fired and plundered, and himself and family murdered. A European officer\u2014Dr. Moore\u2014who was proceeding to Sambalp\u00far was barbarously murdered. Lieutenant Woodbridge, of the 40th Madras Native Infantry, was also killed in an engagement on the Bar\u00e1 Pah\u00e1r, and his head carried off. In short, the authorities could not cope with the rebels with the force then employed. In November 1859 the Royal proclamation of amnesty was made known to them, but they refused to take advantage of it. In 1861 the late Deputy Commissioner, Major Impey, arrived at Sambalp\u00far and was placed in charge, subordinate to the Commissioner of Cuttack. He at once adopted a conciliatory policy, and under its operation a great many chiefs surrendered, and returned to their homes. But Surendra S\u00e1 and some of his most trusty adherents obstinately refused to give themselves up unless he was made R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Sambalp\u00far. Among those was H\u00e1th\u00ed Singh of Ghes, and Kunjal Singh his brother, Kamal Singh Deva and Khageswar Deva, descendants of Balabhadra S\u00e1, the\nformer rebel zam\u012bnd\u0101r of Lakhanp\u016br; L\u0101l S\u0101, chief of Khol, a zam\u012bnd\u0101r\u012b of the Khari\u0101r state; Umed Singh and Sufid Singh, also of Khari\u0101r. When, however, Surendra S\u0101 saw many of the better-disposed chiefs and others giving themselves up and being reinstated in their former positions, and when he found also that fresh troops were arriving in view to hunting him down, he resolved, by the advice of his friends, to listen to the overtures of the Deputy Commissioner, but in doing so attempted to stipulate that, if he did give himself up, he should be made R\u0101j\u0101. The Deputy Commissioner of course would not consent to treat on these terms. But at last, seeing that the authorities fully intended to pardon him if he came in, Surendra S\u0101 yielded himself up in May 1862. Strange to say his captains, Kunjal Singh, Kamal Singh, and one or two others, refused to surrender even then. The object of their so refusing was not apparent at the time, but it can now be explained. One of the last excuses made by Surendra S\u0101 was, that Kamal Singh\u2019s band would not let him surrender unless he paid them a certain sum of money. This statement was fully believed by Major Impey, and he actually sent some Rs. 500 to Surendra S\u0101 to distribute amongst Kamal Singh\u2019s followers, who were then in open rebellion. For some time after the surrender of Surendra S\u0101 the country remained quiet. The rebel family had handsome stipends and several villages settled on them, and those who had been instrumental in procuring their submission were also liberally rewarded. On this ground alone one Lokn\u0101th P\u0101nd\u0101, a Br\u0101hman, who had two or three villages only, and who was very nearly being hanged in 1857 for being one of the first to join Surendra S\u0101 in the rebellion, was constituted a Chief, and nineteen kh\u0101lsa villages were made over to him at half assessment for a period of forty years. Mrityunjaya P\u0101nigr\u0101h\u012b, another wily Br\u0101hman, was also freely rewarded on similar grounds. In short, the authorities seemed to think that nothing was too much to give to the men who were considered to have completely and satisfactorily achieved the pacification of the country, which had been a prey to rebellion and bloodshed without intermission for five years. Early in 1863, however, fresh political upheavings commenced to be felt, the first indication of which appeared in the form of a petition. The country had been recently incorporated with the Central Provinces, and the Chief Commissioner, Mr. (now Sir R.) Temple, was about to pay his first visit to the new provinces. The opportunity was therefore taken to revive the old demand for the restoration of Native rule. A petition was got up purporting to be from the landholders, Br\u0101hmans, and influential people of Sambalp\u016br, setting forth that they had been much harassed by the introduction of stamps, taxes, &c.; that there were still rebel zam\u012bnd\u0101rs in the hills whose depredations they dreaded, but that if the lawful heir Surendra S\u0101 was made r\u0101j\u0101 all would be well, and the Government, in place of losing by the country, might demand a heavy tribute, and thereby become gainers by the arrangement. Of course nothing was obtained by the petition, and the Deputy Commissioner was under the impression that it was got up by some designing people, without the knowledge or concurrence of Surendra S\u0101. It has since appeared highly probable that it was set on foot by Surendra S\u0101 and his advisers, the names of many landholders and influential inhabitants having been affixed to it without their knowledge or consent. Shortly after the Chief Commissioner\u2019s departure affairs began to get more serious, Kamal Singh and his gang appearing on the scene, and re-commencing to commit the most savage outrages in the kh\u0101lsa villages. No less than fifteen or sixteen dacoities, attended with aggravated circumstances, took place in six weeks, and a threatening\nletter was sent to the Deputy Commissioner, warning him that the country should know no peace until Surendra S\u00e1's rights were recognised.\n\nIt became evident that Surendra S\u00e1 was still bound up with Kamal Singh and other rebel leaders, and by degrees the most serious plots and intrigues were laid bare, distinctly proving that the surrender of Surendra S\u00e1 in 1862 was merely a blind, and that he had never for a moment intended to abandon the darling object of his life, viz. the recovery of the Sambalp\u00far \"r\u00e1j.\" Major Impey died at Sambalp\u00far in December 1863, but not before he had fully recognised the critical position of affairs at Sambalp\u00far, and the necessity that existed for arresting Surendra S\u00e1 and his immediate relations and adherents. Circumstances, however, tended to prevent the arrest until the 23rd of January 1864, when it was successfully effected by the Magistrate and the Deputy Inspector-General of Police, assisted by the few European officers at the station. Not a single native was entrusted with the secret of the intention, as it was known that Surendra S\u00e1 had a host of friends and spies in the town, even among those who were believed to be faithful servants of Government; and had he got the slightest inkling that his arrest had been intended, or even thought of, there is no doubt that he would at once have taken to the hills and joined the zamind\u00e1rs who were still in rebellion. It was not legally proved that Surendra S\u00e1 was preparing to wage war against the Government, but the Chief Commissioner and the Supreme Government have recognised the necessity for keeping him, with certain of his relations and adherents, in confinement as dangerous political offenders, and the consequence has been that dacoity has now ceased, and profound peace has succeeded the dangerous and critical period preceding Surendra S\u00e1's capture.\n\nThe total population of the district by the census of 1866 was 812,348 souls, of whom 497,774 were classed as agriculturists and 314,574 as non-agriculturists. Of the former the most industrious and respectable agricultural classes are the Kolt\u00e1s; they are Hind\u00fas, and gradually obtained a footing in these parts under successive r\u00e1j\u00e1s. At present they hold most of the best villages in the kh\u00e1l\u1e63a. It is not known precisely where they came from, but Colonel Dalton, in one of his reports, alludes to a similar class in Assam. Next come the Aghari\u00e1s. There are but very few of them in the kh\u00e1l\u1e63a, but they are very numerous in the Garhj\u00e1t states of R\u00e1ig\u0101rh and B\u00e1mr\u00e1, and also in the Chandrap\u00far chiefship. They claim to be R\u00e1jputs by descent, but do not wear the sacred thread. They are remarkably fair and good-looking. A great number of Br\u00e1hmans also, especially the Jh\u00e1rw\u00e1s, are engaged in agriculture. These three are the chief landholding classes. The cultivators are drawn from the inferior cultivating castes, such as P\u00e1b\u00eds, S\u00e1onr\u00e1\u00eds, G\u00e1nd\u00e1s, Gonds, M\u00e1l\u00eds, Go\u00e1l\u00eds, &c. The Mahant\u00eds have acquired some few villages, but they do not themselves hold the plough like the Kolt\u00e1s and Aghari\u00e1s. The principal castes among the population general are Br\u00e1hmans, Mahant\u00eds, R\u00e1jputs, Bh\u00fali\u00e1s, Kosht\u00eds, Mehr\u00e1s, Sun\u00e1s, K\u00e1ns\u00e1rs, Guri\u00e1s, S\u00e1nsi\u00e1s, Tel\u00eds, Musalm\u00e1ns, Barh\u00e1is, Loh\u00e1rs, Kumbh\u00e1rs, P\u00e1nh\u00e1r\u00eds, Tamboll\u00eds, Kewats, and Gh\u00e1s\u00eds.\n\nThere are two classes of Br\u00e1hmans in these parts\u2014the Uriyas and the Jharw\u00e1s. The first have come from Cuttack and Pur\u00ed within comparatively recent times, while the latter settled here many hundred years ago. The Uriyas, who consider themselves the most holy of the two, and will not eat with the Jharw\u00e1s, are a lazy, improvident set, subsisting chiefly by begging. On the other hand,\nthe Jharw\u00e1s, or jungle Br\u00e1hmans as their title denotes, are careful, hardworking, and intelligent; they are not above cultivating the soil, engaging in trade, or in fact turning their hand to anything useful and profitable. The Mahant\u00eds are the K\u00e1yaths, or writers of Orissa; they are immigrants from the districts to the east, and take occupation as clerks in Government offices, schoolmasters, &c. They are an intelligent but somewhat effeminate race. The R\u00e1jputs are few in number, consisting chiefly of the illegitimate offshoots of the R\u00e1jput r\u00e1j\u00e1s and their descendants. The Bh\u00fali\u00e1s are weavers of cotton-cloths. These cloths are not celebrated for fineness of texture, but for brilliancy of colour and variety of pattern they can hardly be excelled among coarse native fabrics. Cotton-cloths are also made by the Mehr\u00e1s. The Kosht\u00eds are weavers of tasar silk-cloth. Their manufacture is justly celebrated; the texture is very even, and the silk has a lustre which never fades, however long it may have been in wear. Prizes were obtained for specimens at the Exhibitions of N\u00e1gpur and A\u0301gra. The Sun\u00e1s, or goldsmiths, are not particularly good workmen, but they are apt imitators, and might improve. They manufacture all the ornaments worn by females, which, by the way, are very peculiar, unlike those used in other parts of India. The prettiest ornaments made here are the \"kanth\u00e1s,\" or neck-laces of large gold-fluted beads, worn often by Br\u00e1hman and R\u00e1jput sepoys of the Native army. The K\u00e1ns\u00e1rs are workers in bell-metal and brass; they make all sorts of vessels and utensils very neatly indeed. The Guri\u00e1s are the sweetmeat sellers. The S\u00e1ns\u00ed\u00e1s are masons and stone-carvers. Their work is rough, but solid, and they soon pick up anything that is shown them. T\u00e9lls are oil-sellers\u2014a numerous and well-to-do class. The few Mohammadans are chiefly merchants and Government servants. P\u00e1nh\u00e1r\u00eds and Tambol\u00eds are betel-sellers. Kewats\u2014fishermen and boatmen combined\u2014are a numerous and hardy race, and sometimes engage in small ventures of trade also. Gh\u00e1s\u00eds are grasscutters and grooms; they will also perform the duties of sweepers.\n\nThe aboriginal tribes of the kh\u00e1l\u015ba are Gonds, P\u00e1bs, S\u00e1onr\u00e1s, Binj\u00e1l\u015b (Binjw\u00e1rs), and Kols or Dh\u00e1ngars. The latter came from the Chot\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur direction. They are as a class hard-working, honest, and light-hearted, and when not engaged in cultivating either for themselves or for others, they will take service of any kind. Road-making, p\u00e1lki-bearing, gardening, pankh\u00e1-pulling\u2014all come alike to them; and the women work equally hard with the men. They are fond of strong drink, but apparently only give way to it on festive occasions. At certain periods of the year they perform the most curious kind of dance. Women and men, all linked together in a circle, pace round in a monotonous but perfectly regular measure, swaying at the same time their bodies backwards and forwards, occasionally almost touching the ground with their heads. They are all decked out in their best, the women ornamenting their hair fantastically with feathers and flowers.\n\nThe administration is conducted by a Deputy Commissioner, with ordinarily one Assistant or Extra-Assistant Commissioner, a Tahs\u00edld\u00e1r, a Civil Surgeon, and a District Superintendent of Police, at head-quarters. There is another Tahs\u00edld\u00e1r stationed at Bargarh. The police force has a strength of 350 of all ranks. They have station-houses at Sambalp\u00far, Bargarh, Amb\u00e1bor\u00e1, Lopang\u00e1, and M\u00far\u00e1, besides eighteen outposts in the interior of the district.\nThe imperial revenues of Sambalp\u00far district for the year 1869-70 are as follows:\n\n| Revenue Item                  | Amount (Rs.) |\n|------------------------------|--------------|\n| Land revenue                 | 65,868       |\n| Assessed taxes               | 11,839       |\n| Excise on spirits            | 7,158        |\n| Opium                        | 8,200        |\n| Drugs                        | 10,205       |\n| Stamps                       | 7,000        |\n| Tribute payable by feudatories| 11,830       |\n| Revenue payable by zamind\u00e1rs or chiefs | 9,850 |\n\nTotal: Rs. 1,31,950\n\nSAMBALPU'R\u2014A tahs\u00edl or revenue subdivision in the district of the same name, consisting of one town, 190 asli or parent villages, and 122 d\u00e1khi'l\u00ed villages or hamlets, and having an area of 1,500 square miles. The total land revenue is Rs. 41,163-4-3. The population is 198,808 souls. Within the limits of this tahs\u00edl are also included eight zamind\u00e1rs, paying in the aggregate to Government Rs. 6,329, and five Garhj\u00e1t states, the aggregate tribute of which amounts to Rs. 9,880 annually. The principal villages are\u2014\n\n| Village     | Population |\n|-------------|------------|\n| Dh\u00e1m\u00e1       | 2,461      |\n| R\u00e1mp\u00e1l\u00ed     | 2,731      |\n| Lair\u00e1       | 2,037      |\n| Arh\u00e1p\u00e1r\u00e1    | 2,065      |\n| T\u00e1lpati\u00e1    | 1,746      |\n| Khind\u00e1      | 1,729      |\n| S\u00e1masing\u00e1   | 1,658      |\n| Katarbag\u00e1   | 1,603      |\n| Bagr\u00e1       | 1,472      |\n| Lopang\u00e1     | 1,305      |\n\nThe population of all these belongs almost entirely to the agricultural classes.\n\nSAMBALPU'R\u2014The chief town in the district of the same name. It is situated in north latitude 21\u00b0 31', and east longitude 84\u00b0 1'. The district court-house, the sub-divisional or tahs\u00edl office, and the houses of the civil officers are pleasantly situated on the north bank of the Mah\u00e1n\u00e1di, to the south and a little to the east of the town. The river is here nearly a mile broad; during the monsoon it is often full from bank to bank, and on one or two occasions has been known to overflow its banks and partially swamp the town. It falls rapidly after the monsoon, and during the greater portion of the year there is only a small stream, some forty or fifty yards wide, which it is necessary to cross in boats. Opposite the town and station the river-bed is a mass of rocks with thick \"jh\u00e1\u00fa\" jungle; the banks on either side are well-wooded with numerous mango and other groves, and to the south there is a splendid background of lofty hills; the scenery altogether is very beautiful. The native town of Sambalp\u00far is also on the river bank, and, including the suburbs, may be about two miles long by a quarter of a mile broad. It is divided into two portions\u2014the town proper, and a large suburb called the Bar\u00e1 B\u00e1z\u00e1r; the two being separated by the area comprised within the old fort walls. In the town proper some fifty or sixty brick, terraced-roofed houses, most of them two stories high, have lately been erected in the main street; about 1,500 houses are tiled, and but few still remain thatched. In the Bar\u00e1 B\u00e1z\u00e1r most of the houses are still thatched.\nTown-dues were only introduced in 1864-65, and have been steadily increasing from year to year, as will be seen from the following figures:\n\n| Year       | Value, Rs. |\n|------------|------------|\n| 1864-65    | 940        |\n| 1865-66    | 6,000      |\n| 1866-67    | 7,370      |\n| 1867-68    | 10,000     |\n\nThe town has of late been much improved. In 1864 it scarcely contained a single tiled house, and it was with difficulty that a cart could go through the main street. Two large streets have lately been made, with drains on either side, through the whole length of the town, and wide roads have been opened out to the river bank. The conservancy and drainage are carefully looked after.\n\nThe fort is to the north-west of the town proper; nothing remains of it but a crumbling stone-wall on the river face, and a few mouldering bastions. The remains of the moat are still visible, but it has been here and there filled up. The only gateway left is that of Saml\u00e1, near the temple of the goddess Saml\u00e1, who was apparently the tutelar deity of Sambalpur. There are several other temples also within the precincts, the principal of which are those of Padmeswari Devi, Bar\u00e1 Jagann\u00e1th, and Anant Saij\u00e1\u2014all built between the years 1500 and 1600 A.D. They are of uniform design, and neither remarkable for beauty of architecture, nor for solidity of structure. There are also some remains of dwellings of former r\u00e1j\u00e1s within the fort, but most of them are in such a dilapidated and dangerous state that it has become necessary to remove them. One only, which has some little pretension to appearance, is about to be repaired, and will be available for the accommodation of native chiefs when they visit Sambalpur.\n\nBeyond the fort is the Bar\u00e1 B\u00e1z\u00e1r. It was formerly a mere market-place, but by degrees, as the town became crowded, people went and settled there. It is chiefly inhabited by goldsmiths, weavers, and \"Kewats\" (boatmen and fishermen). The town has few wealthy inhabitants, and it is only of late years that there has been any trade worth speaking of. The statistics of the traffic for the few past years are as follows:\n\n| Year       | Imports, Value, Rs. | Exports, Value, Rs. |\n|------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| 1864-65    | 1,83,295            | 1,01,284            |\n| 1865-66    | 2,70,294            | 1,19,171            |\n| 1866-67    | 3,00,015            | 1,58,171            |\n| 1867-68    | 3,51,379            | 1,36,353            |\n| 1868-69    | 3,15,418            | 1,33,477            |\n\nBesides the Government court-house and the sub-divisional office, already mentioned, on the river bank, there is a Commissioner's circuit-house, a good post-office, a jail (lately built on the standard plan), a sar\u00e1i near the town, and another in course of erection on the opposite bank of the river. A dispensary building with female wards has lately been built by a liberal native on the standard plan, as also a new district school-building. There is, too, a handsome terraced-roofed covered market-place. The people accept most thankfully the benefits of the dispensary. Indeed their prejudices seem to yield very readily in most matters. To give an\ninstance, it may be mentioned that, though they at first showed the greatest abhorrence of vaccination, during the past five years nearly 30,000 children and adults have been vaccinated, viz:\u2014\n\n| Year | Vaccinated |\n|------|------------|\n| 1864 | 743        |\n| 1865 | 2,744      |\n| 1866 | 373        |\n| 1867 | 1,984      |\n| 1868 | 23,416     |\n\nTotal.....29,260\n\nIn former years the town was almost annually visited by cholera, and the epidemic sometimes remained for months. The people attribute it to the constant influx of pilgrims returning from Jagann\u00e1th: and no doubt their view is correct; but the dirt, the narrow streets, and the crowded state of the town must also have aggravated the disease considerably. During the past few years they have been more fortunate; but everything shows that this has been solely owing to the precautions that have been taken for keeping out pilgrims, attending to conservancy, widening streets, and the like. Small-pox was also very prevalent; but now that the children are vaccinated, instead of being inoculated as formerly, the violence of the disease may abate.\n\nSA'MPN\u00c1\u2014A river which, rising in the hills that shut in the rich basin of Bet\u00fal, unites its waters with the Machn\u00e1 at the civil station of Bet\u00fal, and thence forcing its way through the main chain of the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1 hills, joins the Taw\u00e1 at Kotm\u00ed below Sh\u00e1hpur.\n\nS\u00c1NGARH\u00cd\u2014A town in the Bhand\u00e1ra district, situated about twenty-four miles to the south-east of Bhand\u00e1ra, and three miles south of the Seoni lake. The population, according to the census of 1866, amounted to 4,367 souls. The local industries are the manufacture of cotton-cloth\u2014which, though slightly inferior to that made at Moh\u00e1ri and A'ndhalg\u00e1on, has a good repute, and is largely exported\u2014and silk-spinning. The town is built on a gravelly soil, and is kept fairly clean, but is considered unhealthy, probably owing to the brackishness of the water-supply from most of the wells. The watch and ward and conservancy are provided for from the town duties; and there are here a police post and a large and flourishing government school. S\u00e1ngarh\u00ed derives its name from the old Path\u00e1n fort, now in ruins, which commands it.\n\nSANGRA'MPU'R\u2014A village in the Jabalp\u00far district, thirty miles north-west of Jabalp\u00far on the road to S\u00e1g\u00e1r. It is said to have derived its name from Sangr\u00e1n S\u00e1, the most distinguished of the Gond line of Garh\u00e1 Mandla, who died in A.D. 1530, after having extended his dominion over fifty-two districts.\n\nSANGRA'MPU'R\u2014A small forest of 6,555 acres, on the highroad between Jabalp\u00far and S\u00e1g\u00e1r, in the former district. It comprises the block of hills around the Singaurgarh fort, and was recently selected for a State forest as a particularly favourable locality for the natural production of teak.\n\nSANKARPU'R\u2014A town in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, situated sixteen miles north-north-east of Chim\u00far, and containing five hundred houses, some of which are well built, and a modern fort of earth and brick in tolerable condition. Under the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 rule a cannon-foundry was worked here, and some of the\nhalf-finished guns are still to be seen. The town has government schools for boys and girls.\n\nSA'OLI'\u2014A town in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, situated seven miles east of M\u00fal, and containing eight hundred houses. The population is almost wholly Teling\u00e1. Cotton-cloths, coloured and plain, are manufactured here, and there is some trade in cotton, cotton-cloths, grain, groceries, and gur. There is also a weekly market, with an average attendance of six hundred persons. The town has government schools for boys and girls.\n\nSA'OLI'GARH\u2014A state forest of about 130 square miles in extent, in the northern part of the Bet\u00fal district. It comprises several blocks of hills between the Moran river on the east and north, and R\u00e1j\u00e1b\u00f3r\u00e1r\u00ed on the west. The chief forest growth is of teak and s\u00e1j, the former predominating.\n\nSA'ONER\u2014One of the most prosperous towns in the N\u00e1gp\u00far district, situated twenty-four miles north-west of Nagp\u00far, just off the main road to Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1. It has a population of 4,895 persons, the majority of whom are employed in agriculture. The town\u2014built on both sides of the Kol\u00e1r river, in a plain of considerable fertility\u2014is surrounded by field and garden cultivation. A good deal has been done here of late years in the way of municipal improvement. A good branch road, metalled and planted with trees, connects the town with the imperial line from N\u00e1gp\u00far to Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1, leading into the new market-place at the eastern entrance. The market-place is in the form of a circle, within which are large masonry platforms for the accommodation of the traders and their wares; from it two broad metalled roads, one leading south-west and the other west, traverse the town in the most populous quarters. These two lines are connected by a third street of similar dimensions, running north and south. There is here a travellers' bungalow, and among the more recent structures are a handsome sar\u00e1f, and good buildings for the police and the school, in which ninety-six scholars are now taught English as well as Vernacular. The local industries are the manufacture of cotton-cloth, which is largely exported, and of an inferior kind of snuff which is made by the Musalm\u00e1n population. A large cattle market is also held here weekly. The fort, situated near the centre of the town, is now in ruins. It must formerly have been a place of large extent and great strength; and the lines of fortifications are different from, and more elaborate than, those built in the time of the Pindh\u00e1r\u00ed incursions. According to local tradition, which is as usual vague, it was built before the time of the Gonds by some Gaul\u00ed chiefs; but about the latter the people can give no particulars. However that may be, the town has belonged to the \"Swasth\u00e1nik\" family for many generations continuously, and the present Gond r\u00e1j\u00e1 is now proprietor of S\u00e1oner.\n\nSA'RANGARH\u2014A state which is now attached to the Sambalp\u00far district, General description. but was formerly one of the cluster known as the eighteen \"Garhj\u00e1ts.\" It lies between 83\u00b0 and 83\u00b025' of east longitude, and between 21\u00b018' and 21\u00b036' of north latitude. It is bounded on the north by the zam\u00edn-d\u00e1r\u00ed of Chandrap\u00far and by a portion of the R\u00e1ig\u00e1rh feudatory state, on the east by the kh\u00e1l\u015ba of Sambalp\u00far, on the south by the zam\u00edn-d\u00e1r\u00ed of Phuljh\u00e1r, and on the west by the district of Bil\u00e1sp\u00far. The mean length, north and south, is about twenty miles, and the mean breadth, east and west, about twenty-five, giving an approximate area of some five hundred square miles. The country is generally level, but to the south and east there rise\nabruptly two considerable ranges of hills. The soil is generally light and friable, with a strong admixture of sand. About four-fifths of the whole area are cultivated, while the rest is jungle and hills. It has no forests of any magnitude, but s\u00e1l, s\u00e1j, dh\u00e1ur\u00e1, tend\u00fa, &c. are to be met with in patches here and there. The Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed runs to the north of the state. The only other river of any pretensions to size is the L\u00e1th; but even this is an insignificant stream. The main road between Sambalp\u00far and R\u00e1jp\u00far runs along portion of the southern boundary; there are no other roads of consequence. The climate is, like that of the rest of the Sambalp\u00far district, considered unhealthy, and during the months of September, October, and November fever is prevalent. The inhabitants themselves are not in appearance inferior to those of other parts of India. The thermometer in the coldest weather does not fall below 45\u00b0 Fah., while at the hottest period of the year it rises to as high as 110\u00b0 in the shade. Tigers, bears, and leopards are to be found in the hilly and jungle portions. Formerly there used to be a great number of wild buffaloes, but of late years they have been driven off, the people having taken to attack them with arrows. Wandering herds are, however, still occasionally met with.\n\nAccording to the r\u00e1j\u00e1\u2019s returns the population is put down at 51,619, about three-fourths of whom are engaged in agriculture. Rice is the staple crop produced, with here and there at rare intervals a small quantity of wheat, gram, pulses, oil-seeds, cotton, and sugarcane. The principal castes among the population are Br\u00e1hmans, R\u00e1jputs, Aghari\u00e1s, Kolt\u00e1s, Kosht\u00e1s or weavers, Mehr\u00e1s (also weavers), Dh\u00e1ngars (weavers of coarse cloths and village watchmen), Gonds, Binj\u00e1ls (Binjw\u00e1rs), and Kol\u00eds. The language current is the Lary\u00e1 or dialect of Chhatt\u00edsgarh, and the Hind\u00ed character is used for writing. The only manufactures are tasar silk-cloth and coarse cotton-cloths.\n\nThe family of S\u00e1rangarh is of very ancient date, and has preserved its traditions as far back as the Samvat year 148. It is of the aboriginal tribe known as R\u00e9j-Gond. According to tradition, in Samvat 148, or A.D. 91, Narendra S\u00e1, r\u00e1j\u00e1 of L\u00e1nj\u00ed (in Bhand\u00e1ra), had two sons, V\u00edrbhadra S\u00e1 and Jagdeva S\u00e1. The latter went and offered his services to Narsingh Deva, r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Rat\u00e1npur, who was then at war with a neighbouring chief. On his returning victorious, Narsingh Deva presented him with a khilat, and conferred on him the title of \u201cd\u00edw\u00e1n,\u201d together with eighty-four villages in the S\u00e1rangarh tract. The family retained the title of \u201cd\u00edw\u00e1n\u201d through some forty-two generations, when Kaly\u00e1n S\u00e1, the then d\u00edw\u00e1n, obtained the title of \u201cr\u00e1j\u00e1\u201d in the following manner. Raghoj\u00ed Bhonsl\u00e1 of N\u00e1gpur was proceeding to Cuttack with a small body of retainers via the Sambalp\u00far district. On his arrival at the Singhor\u00e1 Gh\u00e1t, between S\u00e1rangarh and Phuljhar, his advanced guard was opposed by the Phuljhar people, who stopped the passage of the gh\u00e1t and killed several of his men. Raghoj\u00ed sent word of his difficulties to the Ratanpur r\u00e1j\u00e1, Banoj\u00ed, who directed Kaly\u00e1n S\u00e1 to drive off the assailants and clear the gh\u00e1t. Kaly\u00e1n S\u00e1 executed those orders satisfactorily, and in reward he had the title of \u201cr\u00e1j\u00e1\u201d conferred on him, with the right to carry a standard. The title was afterwards confirmed by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Chhatra S\u00e1 of Sambalp\u00far, when S\u00e1rangarh had become a dependency of that state. The r\u00e1j\u00e1s of S\u00e1rangarh seem to have had special warlike proclivities, for in the reigns subsequent to Kaly\u00e1n S\u00e1 we find them constantly called to the assistance of the Sambalp\u00far r\u00e1j\u00e1s, either to suppress rebellion within, or to resist foes from without. For these services they were usually rewarded by grants of parganas,\nvillages, &c., so that by degrees S\u00e1ragarh came to be a state of some importance. In Samvat 1865 also they sent a contingent to aid the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s in the wars in Orissa. They count fifty-three generations from the commencement of their occupancy, including the reign of the present chief, which has lasted thirty-five years.\n\nThe only building of any pretension in the state is the temple of Samleswar Architectural remains. Deva; but it is of no great antiquity, having been erected by one Aditya S\u00e1 Diw\u00e1n in September 1748, or about 120 years ago. At a place called S\u00e1l\u00e1r, about twelve miles to the north of S\u00e1ragarh, is the tomb of a Mr. Elliott, B.C.S., who died on the 12th September A.D. 1778, while on a mission from the Government to the Court at N\u00e1gpur. The monument was erected by the British Government, and has lately been repaired by the S\u00e1ragarh R\u00e1j\u00e1 at the request of the Deputy Commissioner.* It is of simple design, having a square base, with a pyramidal superstructure about ten or twelve feet high, the whole being surrounded by a wall. S\u00e1ngr\u00e1m Singh, the present r\u00e1j\u00e1, is a steady, competent man. He looks after his own affairs, and manages his territory profitably and well. He has established a good school at the head-quarters of his state, where some seventy or eighty pupils are receiving instruction. Lately also he has started a few indigenous schools in the interior of his territory.\n\nSATPUR\u00c1\u2014This name is now generally applied to the great range or table-land which, commencing eastwards at Amarkantak, runs nearly up to the western coast, though the appellation seems to have been formerly restricted to that portion of the range which divides the Narbad\u00e1 and Tapt\u00ed valleys.+ The S\u00e1tpur\u00e1s are thus described \u2021 by Mr. Blanford of the Geological Survey:\n\n\"This range \u00a7 is well defined to the westward, and from Rajpipl\u00e1 to A\u015birgarh consists of a belt of mountainous country, forty or fifty miles in breadth, and of an average height, at the crest of the chain, but little under 2,000 feet above the sea, while many peaks rise above 3,000, and some (and even some table-lands, as Turan M\u00e1) are as high as 4,000 feet. Nearly the whole of this range, both hills and valleys, consists of trap; but towards the west, along the northern boundary of Kh\u00e1ndesh, a series of craggy peaks are met with, such as are but rarely seen in the trap region. Elsewhere the summit of the range is more or less a table-land. Just east of A\u015birgarh there is a break, through which the railway from Bombay and Kh\u00e1ndesh to Jabalp\u00far passes, the highest part of which is only 1,240 feet. It is worthy of notice that this break leads from close to the junction of the two alluvial plains in the Tapt\u00ed and P\u00farn\u00e1 to a flat tract lying between the two Narbad\u00e1 plains. East of this break the trap hills continue till south of Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d, where sandstone and metamorphic rocks emerge and form a great portion of the hills of the Pachmarhi and Bet\u00fal country. There is a table-land of considerable extent round Bet\u00fal, which extends far to the eastward beyond Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 and Seoni, and joins the high plateau of Amarkantak. Upon this plateau trap still predominates, and a great spur from it extends between the Tapt\u00ed and the P\u00farn\u00e1, forming the northern boundary of Ber\u00e1r as far as the confluence of those\n\n* Major Cumberlege.\n\u2020 Thornton's Gazetteer, article \"S\u00e1tpur\u00e1.\"\n\u2021 Memoirs of the Geological Survey of India, vol. vi. part 3, p. 24.\n\u00a7 In Gujar\u00e1t.\nrivers. This range is also of considerable height, in places nearly 4,000 feet. Like most other ranges, it has no definite name, and is generally looked upon as a portion of the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1.\"\n\nIt has been necessary to quote the above description at length, as there appears to be some doubt, which can only be set definitely at rest by geologists, as to the eastern limits of the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1s. By some describers the Amarkantak plateau, and the Maikal range, which, running south-west from it, walls in Chhatt\u00edsgarh on the north-west, are included in the Vindhyan hill system. For present purposes, however, it will be sufficient to assume that the Narbad\u00e1 divides the Vindhyas from the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1s, and that the whole system of continuous or nearly continuous ranges, commencing from Amarkantak, and running south of the river, may be included under the generic name of S\u00e1tpur\u00e1.\n\nIt may here be worth noticing that though the Vindhyan sandstones, north of the Narbad\u00e1, are entirely distinct from the Mah\u00e1deo and other groups which enter into the composition of the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1s, and the two systems are divided by a well-marked valley, the name \"Vindhya\" has been sometimes extended to include them both. Thus Professor Wilson says,* \"Vindhya is the general name of the chain that stretches across Central India. According to \"the V\u00e1yu (Pur\u00e1na) it is the part south of the Narmad\u00e1 or the S\u00e1tpud\u00e1 range.\" The ordinary Puranic appellation for these hills, however, seems to have been the \"Riksha.\"\n\nAccepting Amarkantak as the eastern boundary, the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1s would have a range from east to west of about six hundred miles, and in their greatest depth would exceed one hundred miles from north to south. The shape of the range would be almost triangular. From Amarkantak\u20143,328 feet above the level of the sea\u2014an outer ridge runs south-west, for about one hundred miles, to a point known as the Sal\u00e9t\u00e9kri hills in the Bhand\u00e1ra district, thus forming as it were the head of the range, which shrinking, as it proceeds westward, from a broad table-land to two parallel dorsal ridges, bounding on either side the valley of the Tapt\u00ed, ends, so far as these provinces are concerned, at the famous hill-fortress of \u00c1\u015birgarh.\n\nThe slope of the range is, in the Mandla district, mainly towards the north\u2014a succession of table-lands leading down to the Narbad\u00e1. In the Seoni and Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 districts the country slopes mainly southwards. So also in the Bet\u00fal district, where the main chain of the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1s lies to the extreme north. The Mult\u00e1i plateau in this district is the watershed of the rivers Tapt\u00ed, Wardh\u00e1, and Bel, the former of which flows westwards along the southern base of the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1s, while the latter flow south and south-east into the plain of N\u00e1gp\u00far.\n\nThe different plateaus and valleys may be thus briefly described. In the Mandla district there are four principal upland valleys, each sending down a feeder to the Narbad\u00e1. To the west lies the valley of the Banjar; in the centre are the valleys of the H\u00e1lon, the Phen, and the Burhner; to the east the valleys of the Kharmer, Chirk\u00e1r, and Seoni; and to the north-west the valley of the Salj\u00ed. The eastern valleys are higher than those to the west. The country between the Kharmer and Burhner rivers present a rugged mass of bare and lofty mountains hurled together by volcanic action; the general formation being basaltic intermixed with laterite, with which the higher peaks are capped. There is a\n\n* Hall's edition of Wilson's Vishnu Pur\u00e1na, vol. ii. p. 128 (1866).\nlofty range of hills between the Chirk\u00e1r and Kharmer. On the east of this volcanically-formed country several fine \"d\u00e1dars\" or plateaus and rich valleys, especially those of Sont\u00edrth and Kharmand\u00e1l, occur. These valleys are well watered, and sheltered from the winds; and here, even in April, the streams are fringed with verdant grass. The Chaur\u00e1d\u00e1dar plateau, with an area of about six square miles, is probably one of the most favourable spots for a European settler in the whole of these wilds.\n\nThe Banjar valley, running partly into the Seon\u00ed district, has two large open plains at Baihar and Bh\u00edml\u00e1t, both well watered. The H\u00e1l\u00f3n valley is approached from the Banjar valley by the G\u00e1ragh\u00e1t range, which form the eastern margin of the Banjar. At Bichhi\u00e1 it opens into a fine open and fertile plain, some fifteen miles long by five broad. It is even better watered than the valley of the Banjar. The valley of the Burhner resembles that of the Kharmer, having a general elevation of above 2,500 feet above the sea level, and a pleasant climate. Going on to the Seon\u00ed district the plateaus of Seon\u00ed and Lakhn\u00e1don, ranging in height from 1,800 to 2,200 feet, are well cultivated and clear of jungle. The valley of the B\u00e1ngang\u00e1* may be said to commence after the confluence of its waters with those of the Th\u00e1nwar. It is of varying breadth, sometimes widening out into bays of considerable extent, and sometimes contracted by hill-spurs. The first basin contains the Bhans\u00e1 Bh\u00e1r forest, which is all unreclaimed. The second bay includes Them\u00e1 and a part of Maii, and is about five miles across, and well watered. The third basin includes Narsingh\u00e1, and is here of considerable extent and well watered. South of this basin the hills run parallel to, and a short distance from, the banks of the river, until it receives the Usk\u00e1l and Nahr\u00e1 rivers, from which point the fourth basin commences. The Parasw\u00e1r\u00e1 plateau separates the valleys of the B\u00e1ngang\u00e1 and the Banjar, and has a general width of between six and ten miles, well watered. The Phen valley is more open than the H\u00e1l\u00f3n, to which it is nearly parallel. The valleys of the Usk\u00e1l and Nahr\u00e1 are narrow, but in one or two places they open into plains. In the Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 district the principal upland valleys are those of the Pench and Kolbir\u00e1. In many places they present broad open plains, which about Ch\u00e1nd, Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1, and Chaur\u00e1f are highly cultivated and well watered. The general elevation is about 2,200 feet. Less open are the valleys which follow the course of the river Kanh\u00e1n, through Deogarh, before its descent into the plains. The plateau of Pachmarh\u00ed\u20143,481 feet above sea level\u2014is said to be twelve square miles in extent. The scenery is of surpassing beauty and variety. Through the centre of it there flows, for the greater portion of the year, a fine clear stream, which appears at one time to have been dammed up for the storage of water. The plateau presents many advantages for the establishment of a sanitarium, and is easily reached from the north from Bankher\u00ed\u2014a railway station thirty-five miles distant. On the south it is separated from the great S\u00e1ipur\u00e1 chain by the valley of the Denw\u00e1. Another plateau\u2014that of Mot\u00far (Mohtoor), 3,500 feet high\u2014though inferior in some respects, has many of the characteristics of the higher Pachmarh\u00ed as a sanitarium, and is easily accessible from the south. In the Bet\u00fal district the Machn\u00e1 and S\u00e1mpn\u00e1 rivers traverse a broad level basin of rich and well-cultivated land, in which is situated the chief town of Bet\u00fal. It is shut in by abrupt lines of stony hills on all sides but the west, where it is bounded by the deep valley of the Tapt\u00ed. The Mult\u00e1i plateau to the south is of considerable extent, and is noted for its opium and sugarcane.\n\n* The name by which the upper portion of the Waingang\u00e1 is locally known.\nonly high level plateau in this part of the range is on the hill of Kh\u00e1ml\u00e1, in the south-west corner of the Bet\u00fal district. This is said to be a little below 3,700 feet\u2014the general height of the G\u00e1walgarh hills, with which it is connected. The absence of water on the plateau is the obstacle to its being selected as a sanitarium. Some of the highest points in the range are approximately\u2014\n\n| Location          | Height (Feet) |\n|-------------------|--------------|\n| Chaur\u00e1d\u00e1dar (Mandla) | 3,300        |\n| Kh\u00e1ml\u00e1 (Bet\u00fal)     | 3,700        |\n| Mot\u00far (Mohtoor)    | 3,500        |\n| Pachmarh\u00ed          | 3,481        |\n| Dh\u00fapgarh           | 4,454        |\n\nSATPUR\u00c1 RESERVE\u2014A state forest of about 1,000 square miles in extent, lying along the southern slopes of the hill-range of the same name in the Seoni, Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1, and N\u00e1gpur districts. S\u00e1j abounds in the eastern portion, while in the western teak is the chief growth. The proximity of this tract to the large markets of K\u00e1mthi and N\u00e1gpur has led to the almost complete exhaustion of all but young growing timber, but systematic measures are in progress for preserving what remains. Leases are annually granted for the cutting of the unreserved kinds of timber, and for the collection of jungle fruits, roots, dyes, &c., and also for grazing cattle in certain portions of the forest. Plantation experiments under the superintendence of a European gardener are being conducted at Suk\u00e1t\u00e1 and Sit\u00e1jhari.\n\nSAUSAR\u2014The southern revenue subdivision or tahsil in the Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 district, having an area of 1,076 square miles, with 439 villages, and a population of 94,915 souls according to the census of 1866. The land revenue for the year 1869-70 is Rs. 97,884.\n\nSAUSAR\u2014The head-quarters of the tahsil of the same name, in the Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 district. It is situated thirty-four miles south of Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1, on the main road to N\u00e1gpur, and has a population of 4,077 persons, mostly belonging to the cultivating classes. There are here a government school and a small fort. The proprietor of the village is R\u00e1j\u00e1 Sulem\u00e1n Sh\u00e1h\u2014the representative of the Gond line of Deogarh.\n\nSA\u2019WARGA\u2019ON\u2014A town in the N\u00e1gpur district, situated forty-four miles from N\u00e1gpur, on the road to Bet\u00fal via Narkher. The population, amounting to 2,590 souls, is chiefly engaged in agriculture. The country around is hilly and stony. Since town-duties have been levied, efforts have been made to improve the water-supply, which was deficient; and a new school-house and market-place have been constructed.\n\nSEGA\u2019ON\u2014A town in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, situated thirteen miles northeast of Waror\u00e1, and containing 600 houses. It formerly was a place of considerable trade, and the capital of the pargana, but is now in a decaying state. A weekly market is held here on Fridays. There are here an old stone fort, now in ruins, with a handsome gateway, government schools for boys and girls, and a police outpost.\n\nSEHA\u2019WA\u2019\u2014A forest in a wild hilly tract of the same name in the R\u00e1jp\u00far district. It has not yet been fully examined or demarcated.\n\nSEHA\u2019WA\u2019\u2014A tract of country lying to the south of Dhamtar\u00ed, in the R\u00e1jp\u00far district. It covers an area of about 550 square miles, and contains 288\nvillages, 270 of which are uninhabited. The inhabitants are mostly Gonds, who live by collecting jungle produce. Lac, wax, and thatching-grass abound, and there are some fine sal forests.\n\nSELERU\u2014A river which rises in the Eastern Gh\u00e2ts, and after a course of eighty miles falls into the Sabar\u00ee at a point about twenty-five miles above its confluence with the God\u00e2var\u00ee. For the last twenty miles of its course this stream forms the boundary between a portion of the Upper God\u00e2var\u00ee district and the Jaipur state.\n\nSELU\u2014A town in the Huz\u00fbr tahsil of the Wardh\u00e2 district, situated on the right bank of the Bor river about eleven miles north-east of Wardh\u00e2. The old highroad from N\u00e2gp\u00fbr to Bombay runs through the place; and there is a travellers' bungalow here. Sel\u00fb was, according to tradition, an old Gond settlement, but the fort is attributed to a chief named Kand\u00eal\u00ee Sard\u00e2r. Haz\u00e2r\u00ee Bhonsl\u00e2, former mukh\u00e2sad\u00e2r of Sel\u00fb, had a skirmish here with the Pindh\u00e2ris, which is still remembered. The present population amounts to 3,184 souls, and is principally engaged in weaving and in cultivating. The weekly market\u2014an important one\u2014is held every Tuesday. Native cotton-cloths of all kinds, manufactured by the Sel\u00fb weavers, are among the most important goods offered for sale. A good deal of cotton also changes hands here. The town has a sar\u00e2i, a police outpost, and a vernacular town-school.\n\nSEONATH or SEO\u2014A river rising in the P\u00e2n\u00e2b\u00e2ras chiefship of the Ch\u00e2nd\u00e2 district. The first part of its course is through a hilly tract of country, after leaving which it flows through the territory of the N\u00e2ndg\u00e2on chief, and the richer parts of the R\u00e2ip\u00fbr district. Then, entering Bil\u00e2sp\u00fbr to the north of the town of Simg\u00e2, it turns to the east, and forms the boundary between Bil\u00e2sp\u00fbr and R\u00e2ip\u00fbr, until it reaches the Tareng\u00e2 estate of the Bil\u00e2sp\u00fbr district, which it skirts for about thirty miles, thence again forming the boundary between Lau and Bil\u00e2sp\u00fbr as far as Scor\u00eenar\u00e2in, a few miles from which it joins the Mah\u00e2n\u00e2di at a place named Dev\u00eegh\u00e2t. The chief affluents of the Seo are the A\u2019gar, H\u00e1mp, Mani\u00e2r\u00ee, Arp\u00e2, K\u00e2r\u00fbn, and L\u00eel\u00e2gar.\n\nSEONI\u2014\n\nCONTENTS.\n\n| General description | Page |\n|---------------------|------|\n| Geology             | 470  |\n| Forests and waste lands | ib. |\n| Products            | ib.  |\n| Trade               | 471  |\n\nOne of the most interesting districts of the Central Provinces. It deserves notice as well for the beauty of its scenery, the fertility of its valleys, the elevation of its plateaus, its salubrity and moderate temperature, as on account of its past history, which shows that it once supported a far larger population than it does now. It lies between 21\u00b0 35' and 23\u00b0 55' of north latitude, and between 79\u00b0 20' and 80\u00b0 10' of east longitude; and is bounded on the north by Jabalp\u00fbr and Mandla, on the west by Narsinghp\u00fbr and Chhindw\u00e2r\u00e2, on the south by N\u00e2gp\u00fbr and Bhand\u00e2ra, and on the east by Mandla and B\u00e2l\u00e2gh\u00e2t. The area is about 3,608 square miles, and the population amounts to 421,650 souls, or 116 to the square mile. The fiscal subdivisions are Seoni, Katang\u00ee, and Lakhn\u00e2don, each of which is managed by an officer of the rank of Tahs\u00eeld\u00e2r.\nThe district is a portion of that upland tract formed by the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1 or Gondw\u00e1na range of hills, which extends along the south bank of the Narbad\u00e1 from the plains of Broach on the west to the Maikal range in the east. The slope of the country from the confines of Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 to a line drawn due north and south through the gh\u00e1t range, parallel to the valley of the Banjar river, is from north to south. Between that range and the valley of the Phen river it is from south to north. There is also a general rise from west to east. Thus the watershed of the Banjar is higher than the watershed of the B\u00e1ngang\u00e1 (Waingang\u00e1), and the watersheds of the Phen and the H\u00e1l\u00f3n are higher than the watershed of the Banjar. The Seoni district is geographically divided into four sections\u2014\n\n1st.\u2014The northern section, including the plateau of Lakhn\u00e1don, separating the basins of the Sher and the B\u00e1ngang\u00e1.\n\n2nd.\u2014The western section, including the plateau of Seoni, and forming the western watershed of the B\u00e1ngang\u00e1. This plateau is crossed by the highroad at Kural, where the ascent of 430 feet mounts a spur of the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1, stretching from Bheogarh to Kiol\u00e1ri, and separating the basins of the Pench and the Gang\u00e1.\n\n3rd.\u2014The eastern watershed and elevated basin of the B\u00e1ngang\u00e1 and the valleys of the Nahr\u00e1 and Usk\u00e1l rivers\u2014affluents of the B\u00e1ngang\u00e1. This watershed has a general depression south from the junction of the Th\u00e1nwar and Gang\u00e1, and also a slope to the west.\n\n4th.\u2014The last natural division of the Seoni district is the narrow strip of land at the southern part of the table-land, through the western half of which the highroad passes. This is called Dongart\u00e1l, and though excellent grazing ground, well known for the breed of its cattle, is rocky and unprofitable for purposes of cultivation. The eastern portion belongs to the Katangi valley, and though the soil is light, it is highly cultivated and irrigated, and supports an industrious and dense population.\n\nThe plateaus of Seoni and Lakhn\u00e1don have a varying height of from 1,800 to 2,200 feet. They are well cultivated, clear of jungle, and their temperature is always moderate. They are thus very salubrious. Great part of the B\u00e1ngang\u00e1 valley has lately been transferred to the new B\u00e1lagh\u00e1t district, but the upper portion of it is still in Seoni.\n\nThe rivers are naturally divided into two well-marked groups\u2014\n\n1st.\u2014The affluents of the Narbad\u00e1.\n\n2nd.\u2014The B\u00e1ngang\u00e1 and its affluents.\n\nThe affluents of the Narbad\u00e1 are the Timar and the Sher. The affluents of the B\u00e1ngang\u00e1 are the Hir\u00ed and the S\u00e1g\u00e1r on the right bank, the Theli, the Bijn\u00e1, and the Th\u00e1nwar on the left bank. The Pench forms a portion of the boundary between Seoni and Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1.\n\nThe soil of the Seoni, Chhap\u00e1r\u00e1, and Lakhn\u00e1don plateaus is the rich black cotton soil, or regar, formed by disintegrated trap. Generally it may be said that two-thirds of the Seoni district, including all the loftier plateaus, are composed of black soil. But towards the south, where cliffs of gneiss and other primitive formations occur, the soil is silicious, and contains a large proportion of clay. This is the rice land of the Seoni district. The average rainfall is sixty-one inches.\nThe district of Seoni has not been surveyed geologically, but it may be roughly described as consisting of two portions\u2014the southern, which includes Katang\u00ed and part of the Haw\u00e9li tahsil, and in which the formation consists of crystalline rock; and the northern and larger portion, which geologically is a part of the wide field of overflowing trap that occupies the area between the Pachmarhi hills to the west of Seoni and Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1, and the Maikal range to the east of Mandla. Towards the western boundary of the district the metamorphic rocks (chiefly gneiss and micaceous schist) form the southern face of the gh\u00e1ts that bound the Seoni plateau. Northwards they are lost sight of in the bed of laterite, which lies over this part of the plateau, and covers the trap to within a short distance of the town of Seoni. A few miles east of Seoni the crystalline rock again comes to the surface, and from this point eastward the valley of the S\u00e1g\u00e1r may be considered the line of demarcation between the two formations. The district is hilly throughout, but the physical features characteristic of the two formations form a marked contrast. In the southern portion of the district the hills are more pointed; the valleys more confined; the soil in the valleys is rich, but contains a large admixture of sand; and over both hill and valley forest trees of large size abound. The beds of the streams are composed of loose sand; and there is but little water visible in the dry season. The trap hills, on the other hand, either take the form of ridges with straight outlines and flattened tops, or, rising more gradually, expand into wide undulating plateaus. The valleys are wide and bare, and contain the rich black soil spread over a deep deposit of calcareous clay; and the streams that intersect them, cutting through this deposit, expose broad masses of bare black basalt, alternating with marshy stagnant pools of water. The hills are commonly clothed with small stunted trees; but in the valleys and plateaus, notwithstanding their rich soil, forest trees are very thinly scattered, and are seldom of large size.\n\nThe disposable waste lands in this district are very considerable, amounting in extent to 686,081 acres. In 1868-69 the usufruct of the waste tracts was leased for Rs. 16,039.\n\nIn addition there are the reserved forests of the Forest department\u2014\n\n1st.\u2014The great firewood reserve for K\u00e1mth\u00ed and N\u00e1gp\u00far. The area is about 315 square miles, or 201,600 acres.\n\n2nd.\u2014The reserve in the south of the district for the protection of satinwood (chloroxylon swietenia). This, though managed by the ordinary district staff, is considered to be of some importance, as satinwood is in considerable demand for various purposes in the N\u00e1gp\u00far arsenal.\n\nThe timber resources of the Seoni district must at one time have been very great. On the north side, from the borders of Mandla to Narsinghp\u00far, the hills are more or less covered with teak. But the tree is stunted, and throws out large branches five or six feet above the ground. Along the B\u00e1ngang\u00e1 (Waingang\u00e1) there are a few patches of young teak, and the vast bamboo forest of Son\u00e1w\u00e1n\u00ed in the south-east corner of the district contains fine bijes\u00e1l (pterocarpus marsupium), and tend\u00fa (diospyros melonoxylon), while to the north there is on the gh\u00e1t some fine s\u00e1j (terminalia tomentosa).\n\nAll the usual rabi and kharif crops are grown in this district. As has already been mentioned, there are extensive plains suitable for the growth of rice, while the basaltic soil produces all kinds of aromatic herbs; coffee, and it is thought tea plants,\nmight be profitably cultivated on it. Then sugarcane, opium, wheat, gram (cicer arietinum), flax, masur (ervum lens), may all be produced in almost unlimited quantities. In addition to the ordinary products of the country may be mentioned as specialties of the Seoni district, or at least as more readily to be met with here than elsewhere\u2014\n\n1st.\u2014The sara\u00ed or sal tree (shorea robusta).\n2nd.\u2014The k\u00e1sa grass.\n3rd.\u2014The banslochan.\n4th.\u2014The baher\u00e1 (terminalia bellerica).\n5th.\u2014The harr\u00e1 (terminalia chebula).\n6th.\u2014The manj\u00edt (rubia munjista).\n7th.\u2014The guli bak\u00e1l\u00ed.\n\nThe k\u00e1sa grass yields an oil like the cajipat. Banslochan is a kind of crystallised salt found in the bamboo, and believed to be a febrifuge. It is sold at a considerable price. The Baig\u00e1s are very quick at discovering the bamboos in which the salt is found. The flowers of the baher\u00e1 are used as a dye. Like the sara\u00ed, it is a large forest tree. The nut of the harr\u00e1 is also a valuable dye. There are two kinds of manj\u00edt\u2014\"bel manj\u00edt\" and \"baher\u00e1 manj\u00edt.\" The former is a creeper, the latter is like the baher\u00e1 tree. The manj\u00edt produces the madder root used for dyeing. The best kind is the \"bel manj\u00edt.\" It is not cultivated, but grows spontaneously under the shade of large trees near water. The roots are dug up by Gonds between November and May, and sell at about five seers the rupee. The \"bel manj\u00edt\" will only grow in a moist and comparatively cold climate. The \"baher\u00e1 manj\u00edt\" grows near the Narbad\u00e1, both in the Narsinghp\u00far and Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d districts. Colonel Sleeman, from whom the above facts are derived, mentions that some time ago Rs. 600 were offered for a large tree of this kind in the Narsinghp\u00far district. The tree is \"said to produce neither flowers nor seed.\" The guli-bak\u00e1l\u00ed is a lily celebrated in oriental song. It grows wild about Amarkantak. Besides the above vegetable productions which peculiarly belong to Seoni and its immediate neighbourhood, may be enumerated the satinwood tree, of which a preserve has already been mentioned; the \"rohan,\" a durable heavy wood, of a deep red colour, furnishing a febrifugal bark; the \"tins\u00e1,\" celebrated for its toughness; the \"g\u00e1bd\u00ed,\" of so resinous a nature that splinters of it are used for torches; the \"h\u00e1r sing\u00e1r,\" yielding a deliciously-scented flower, from which a yellow dye is prepared; and the \"d\u00fadh\u00ed,\" prized by turners. There is also the \"mow\u00e1l,\" which, though not a timber tree, is used for drums; it is a very flexible wood. The tend\u00fa or ebony tree, and the bh\u00edja and dh\u00e1ur\u00e1 are also met with.\n\nIron is found in Jun\u00ed and Katang\u00ed; specimens of it have been lodged in the N\u00e1gp\u00far museum.\n\nThere are no manufactures except the common native cloths, and at K\u00e1nhiw\u00e1r\u00e1 there is some pottery, which is perhaps superior to that generally made in the Central Provinces. At Khaw\u00e1s\u00e1, in the midst of the forest, leather is beautifully tanned; but the art is not extensively practised.\n\nThe interior traffic between the different parts of the country is shown in the annual reports on the trade of the Central Provinces. The exports from or through Seoni to N\u00e1gp\u00far and Bhand\u00e1ra amount in bulk to 453,277 maunds, and are valued at Rs. 32,17,449. The imports from or through N\u00e1gp\u00far and Bhand\u00e1ra amount in value to Rs. 11,31,177, and the estimated weight is 142,208 maunds.\nThe principal local markets are L\u00e9labar\u00e1, W\u00e1r\u00e1 Seon\u00ed, and P\u00edparw\u00e1n\u00ed, to which the grain of the rice-producing districts to the south is brought for export to N\u00e1gp\u00far and K\u00e1mth\u00ed. There is also a large salt market at Kohk\u00e1, between W\u00e1r\u00e1 Seon\u00ed and P\u00edparw\u00e1n\u00ed. There are only two annual fairs in the Seon\u00ed district. In 1868-69 the total value of the property brought to these fairs was estimated at Rs. 1,07,570, and the sales amounted to Rs. 54,090.\n\nThe chief artery of communication in the Roads and communications. Seon\u00ed district is the highroad from N\u00e1gp\u00far to Jabalp\u00far.\n\nThe stages from Seon\u00ed to N\u00e1gp\u00far are as follows:\n\n| Names of Villages | Miles | Furlongs | Remarks |\n|-------------------|-------|----------|---------|\n| Mohg\u00e1on           | 11    | 4        | A small village; encamping-ground to the south. |\n| Kura\u00ed             | 8     | 4        | Travellers' bungalow. |\n| Khaw\u00e1s\u00e1           | 8     | 6        | A large village; encamping-ground to the north. |\n\nThe road then enters the N\u00e1gp\u00far district, from which Seon\u00ed is distant about seventy-eight miles.\n\nThe stages from Seon\u00ed to Jabalp\u00far are\u2014\n\n| Names of Villages | Miles | Furlongs | Remarks |\n|-------------------|-------|----------|---------|\n| Bandol            | 11    | ......   | A moderately-sized village; encamping-ground to the west. |\n| Chhap\u00e1r\u00e1         | 10    | 7        | Travellers' bungalow. |\n| Ganesganj         | 9     | 3        | Encamping-ground to the west. |\n| Lakhn\u00e1don         | 7     | ......   | A large village; encamping-ground to the east. |\n| Dh\u00fam\u00e9             | 13    | 5        | Travellers' bungalow. |\n\nThe road then enters the Jabalp\u00far district. A district road with American platform-bridges runs from Seon\u00ed through Katang\u00ed to join the Great Eastern Road. There are besides numerous Banj\u00e1r\u00e1 tracks\u2014\n\n(1) From Barg\u00ed to Jabalp\u00far via Diw\u00e1ri Barel\u00e1, and Sara\u00ed of Seon\u00ed, and thence through B\u00e1lagh\u00e1t to Chhattisgarh.\n\n(2) From Seon\u00ed to Ki\u00f3l\u00e1ri by K\u00e1nhiw\u00e1r\u00e1, and on to M\u0101u, B\u00e1lagh\u00e1t.\n(3) By Khair\u00ed and the S\u00e1d gh\u00e1t of Seoni to the Khair\u00ed gh\u00e1t of R\u00e1ig\u00e1rh in B\u00e1l\u00e9gh\u00e1t.\n\n(4) To N\u00e1gp\u00far from Thiri\u00e1 and the Khair\u00ed gh\u00e1t by Ch\u00e1cher\u00ed near L\u00e1lbar\u00e1, and thence to Katang\u00ed and Deolap\u00e1r.\n\n(5) From Thiri\u00e1 via the Tik\u00fari\u00e1 gh\u00e1t, along the Usk\u00e1l to Ch\u00e1cher\u00ed and L\u00e1lbar\u00e1.\n\n(6) By Dh\u00e1p\u00e9w\u00e1r\u00e1 and Dhuper\u00e1 to Katang\u00ed, and from thence to Deolap\u00e1r.\n\n(7) To Hatt\u00e1, K\u00e1mth\u00e1, and L\u00e1nj\u00ed.\n\nThe present Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab, Sir Donald F. Macleod, who was in 1836 Assistant to the Commissioner of the Narbad\u00e1 territories, sent a copy of an engraved plate\u2014one of five in the possession of one of the Seoni j\u00e1g\u00edrd\u00e1rs\u2014to Mr. James Prinsep, then Secretary to the Asiatic Society of Bengal, a translation of which is to be found in vol. v. (p. 726), of the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal. The character of the inscription is identical with that of the Chhatt\u00edsgarh inscriptions published in the Asiatic Researches (vol. xv. p. 507). The inscription itself is an ordinary grant by R\u00e9j\u00e1 Pravara Sena, of a piece of ground in a conquered territory, to his officiating priest, in perpetuity. For a long time no clue was found to this dynasty, but some light has lately been thrown upon it by the researches of Dr. Bh\u00e1\u00fa D\u00e9j\u00ed of Bombay, and especially by his reading of an inscription in the Zodiac cave at Ajant\u00e1ha. This question will be found more fully discussed in the Introduction. The history of Seoni practically commences from the reign of R\u00e9j\u00e1 Sangr\u00e1m S\u00e1* of Garh\u00e1-Mandla, who in A.D. 1530 extended his dominion over fifty-two districts, three of which \u2020\u2014Ghumsar or Ghansor, Cha\u00far\u00ed, and Dongart\u00e1l\u2014form the main part of the present district. These tracts were in the early part of the eighteenth century assigned by R\u00e9j\u00e1 Narendra S\u00e1 of Mandla to R\u00e9j\u00e1 Bakht Buland of Deogarh, in acknowledgment of assistance given in suppressing a revolt.\n\nShortly afterwards the Deogarh R\u00e9j\u00e1, according to local tradition, placed his relative R\u00e9j\u00e1 R\u00e1m Singh in possession of the Seoni tract. The head-quarters were then at Chhap\u00e1r\u00e1, and R\u00e9j\u00e1 R\u00e1m Singh built the fort there. On his progress through the district, Bakht Buland visited the Gond T\u00e1lukad\u00e1r or Th\u00e1kur of Sulem\u00e9 in Seoni, and there formed the acquaintance of T\u00e1j Kh\u00e1n, a Mohammadan adventurer, with whose bravery in killing a bear with his sword, single-handed, he was so pleased that he conferred upon him the Dongart\u00e1l \u2021 t\u00e1luka rent-free. At the instigation of Bakht Buland, and probably by the assistance of his father-in-law\u2014a resident of Prat\u00e1pgarh in the Bhand\u00e1ra district\u2014T\u00e1j Kh\u00e1n attacked and took S\u00e1ngarh\u00ed in the Bhand\u00e1ra district in the name of the R\u00e9j\u00e1 of Deogarh. He died at S\u00e1ngarh\u00ed A.D. 1734, and was succeeded by his son Mohammad Kh\u00e1n. In 1743 Raghoj\u00ed, the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 ruler of Ber\u00e1r, assumed the government of N\u00e1gp\u00far, and consequently of Deogarh and Seoni. Notwithstanding the death of his legitimate sovereign, and the usurpation of the Bhonsl\u00e1s, Mohammad Kh\u00e1n held S\u00e1ngarh\u00ed for three years. Raghoj\u00ed struck, it is said, with Mohammad Kh\u00e1n\u2019s fidelity, offered him\n\n* Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, vol. vi.

He consented, and repaired to Chhapar\u00e1, whence he governed Seoni with the title of \"diw\u00e1n;\" and at his death in 1759 he is said to have left the country populous and well cultivated. He was not, however, uniformly fortunate in his government, for on one occasion during his absence at N\u00e1gpur the Mandla R\u00e9j\u00e1 attacked and captured Chhapar\u00e1. The people who were killed in the attack were all buried in one large pit, over which a square tomb was erected. This tomb, which is in the fort, still exists. The Diw\u00e1n, advancing from N\u00e1gpur with large forces, speedily drove back the Mandla garrison; and the Th\u00e1nwar and the Gang\u00e1 from its junction with the Th\u00e1nwar were then again declared to be the boundaries between the Mandla and Seoni kingdoms. Maj\u00edd Kh\u00e1n, the eldest son of Mohammad Kh\u00e1n, succeeded his father about A.D. 1761. To him succeeded in A.D. 1774 his son Mohammad Am\u00edn Kh\u00e1n, who removed the district head-quarters from Chhapar\u00e1 to Seoni, where he built the present family residence. After occupying the diw\u00e1n\u00ed for twenty-four years, with much credit to himself, he died in A.D. 1798. He had four sons, the eldest of whom, Mohammad Zam\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n, succeeded his father. Chhapar\u00e1, even after the removal of the diw\u00e1n\u00ed to Seoni, was a considerable place, and at the close of the eighteenth century it is said to have numbered about 40,000 inhabitants, and contained some 9,000 houses. During Zam\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n's time it was sacked by the Pindh\u00e1r\u00eds, and it is now a mere village. Shortly afterwards he was ejected by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s from his diw\u00e1n\u00ed, either because he was incapable, or because Raghoj\u00ed Bhonsl\u00e1 was much impoverished by the cession to the British in A.D. 1804 of the fort of G\u00e1wal and his Ber\u00e1r dominions. The next governor of Seoni was Kharak Bh\u00e1rt\u00ed, a Gos\u00e1in, who obtained the government from Raghoj\u00ed by an offer of Rs. 3,00,000 a year for it. From this period the diw\u00e1n\u00ed's family fell into poverty, until the British accession, when some assignments of money and land were made for their support. It may also be noted that the first Tahsild\u00e1r appointed by the British after the cession of the territory was Bhik Mohammad Kh\u00e1n, who was a son of Roshan Kh\u00e1n, and grandson of Mohammad Kh\u00e1n. Diw\u00e1n Mohammad Zam\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n died without male issue in 1821, and now the head of the family is Najaf Kh\u00e1n, the nephew of the former diw\u00e1n.\n\nThere are few architectural remains in Seoni. At Umargarh, Bhains\u00e1garh, Prat\u00e1pagarh, and Kaub\u00e1garh\u2014all situated on commanding spots along the southern margin of the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1s\u2014there are ruined forts which are popularly attributed to the Bundel\u00e1 r\u00e9j\u00e1s. Of these the Bhains\u00e1garh fort has not been quite destroyed. The walls, bastions, and some of the inner rooms and partition-walls are still standing. There are also two old Gond forts, one in the Son\u00e9var\u00e1 forest, near A'\u00e1hta, and one in the Gond\u00ed t\u00e1luka near U'g\u00edl, called Amod\u00e1garh, which is situated on an isolated and well-nigh inaccessible rock in the bed of the Hirf river. At Ghansor, about twenty miles north-east of Seoni, there are remains of some forty temples, which, it is supposed, indicate the former existence here of a large town. Some of the plinths are still in situ. They are said to be very old, and to have been built by a class of Hind\u00fas from the Deccan called \"Hem\u00e1rpant\u00eds.\"\n\nThe population of the district amounts to 421,650 souls, of whom 135,954 belong to the Gond, Baig\u00e1, and other aboriginal tribes. The Hind\u00fa classes most largely represented are the Ponw\u00e1rs\u2014excellent agriculturists\u2014of whom there are 30,323, and the Ahirs and Gaul\u00eds\u2014pastoral tribes\u2014who have occupied the fine grazing ground to be found in most parts of the district. Mohammadans muster\npretty strong\u2014there being as many as 13,941\u2014probably owing to the footing gained in the district by the Path\u00e1n family, whose head now bears the title of diw\u00e1n.\n\nThe administration of the district is conducted by the usual civil staff, consisting of a Deputy Commissioner, two Assistant or Extra-Assistant Commissioners, a Civil Surgeon, and a District Superintendent of Police at head-quarters, and Tahsild\u00e1rs at Seoni, Katangi, and Lakhn\u00e1don. The police force has a strength of 321 of all ranks. They have station-houses at Seoni, Katangi, Lakhn\u00e1don, Kiol\u00e1ri, and Kurali, besides seventeen outposts.\n\nThe total revenues may be thus exhibited for 1868-69:\n\n| Heads of Revenue | Rupees |\n|------------------|--------|\n| Land revenue     | 2,21,858 |\n| Excise           | 46,407 |\n| Stamps           | 22,035 |\n| Forests          | 20,008 |\n| Assessed taxes   | 13,842 |\n| **Total Imperial** | **Rs. 3,24,150** |\n| Educational cess | 4,437 |\n| Road cess        | 4,437 |\n| D\u00e1k cess         | 1,109 |\n| Octroi           | 8,378 |\n| **Total Local**  | **Rs. 18,361** |\n| **Grand Total**  | **Rs. 3,42,511** |\n\nSEONI\u2014The south-western revenue subdivision or tahsil in the district of the same name, having an area of 1,149 square miles, with 656 villages, and a population of 166,545 souls according to the census of 1866. The land revenue for the year 1869-70 is Rs. 82,840.\n\nSEONI\u2014The central revenue subdivision or tahsil in the Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d district, having an area of 380 square miles, with 170 villages, and a population of 55,347 souls according to the census of 1866. The land revenue for the year 1869-70 is Rs. 63,528-8-0.\n\nSEONI\u2014The head-quarters of the district of the same name, situated on the road from N\u00e1gpur to Jabalp\u00far, nearly half-way between the two; in north latitude 22\u00b0 4', and east longitude 79\u00b0 39'. It was founded in A.D. 1774 by Mohammad Amin Kh\u00e1n, who made Seoni his head-quarters instead of Chhapar\u00e1. It contains large public gardens, a fine market-place, and a noble tank, which has recently been improved and deepened. The principal buildings are the court-house, jail, school-house, dispensary, and post-office. A handsome church is about to be erected. The population of the town proper is 8,608.\nsouls. Including, however, the two outskirts of Mangl\u00ed Peth and Bhairao Ganj (in reality component parts of Seoni) the population is 10,621 souls. The town school contains about 175 pupils.\n\nThe climate of Seoni is sultryious, and the temperature moderate. There are excellent available building sites, and the average price of food is slightly less than either at Jabalpur or Nagpur.\n\nSEONI\u2014A town in the Hoshangabad district. It existed in the time of Akbar; but there are no old buildings about it. The present town dates from the conquest of the country round about by Raghoji Bhonsla of Nagpur, circa A.D. 1750, since when, until the cession, an Amil resided here; and a fort was built, under the protection of which a town grew up. The fort was taken in 1818 by a detachment of British troops from Hoshangabad. Seoni is situated on the highroad to Bombay, and is a most populous and thriving place, only checked in its extension by the difficulty of getting building-ground. It is the chief mercantile town in the Hoshangabad district, and probably in the whole Narbad\u00e1 valley. Its merchants are chiefly engaged in the cotton trade; and all the cotton exported to Bombay from Bhopal and Narsinghpur, as well as the Hoshangabad district, passes through their hands. There is also a large export trade in grain, and import of English cotton fabrics, metals, and spices. The railway passes through Seoni, and has a station there. A sarai has also been built for the accommodation of travellers. An Extra-Assistant Commissioner and a Patrol of the Customs department are stationed here.\n\nSEONI' BAND\u2014An artificial lake of considerable size, in the Bhandara district, about eight miles north-west of the Naw\u00e9g\u00e1n Tank. It was constructed about 325 years ago by D\u00e1d\u00fa Patel Kohri, whose family retained possession of the village of Seoni for about 250 years. In the time of Raghoji I. it was given to B\u00e1k\u00e1 B\u00e1\u00ed, whose descendants hold it now. It is about eight miles in circumference, and has an average depth of about thirty feet. The weir is 630 feet in length.\n\nSEORINARA'TN (SIVARI'NA'RA'YAN)\u2014The eastern revenue subdivision or tahsil of the Bilaspur district, having an area of 1,022 square miles, with 550 villages, and a population of 168,927 souls according to the census of 1866. The land revenue of the tahsil for the year 1869-70 is Rs. 65,992-10-0.\n\nSEORINARA'TN\u2014The head-quarters of the tahsil of the same name, in the Bilaspur district, situated thirty-six miles east of Bilaspur, on the banks of the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed. The population amounts to 1,500 souls. This was in former days a favourite residence of the Ratanp\u00far Court, and the royal ladies at certain seasons repaired here to bathe in the sacred stream. The first settlers are supposed to have located themselves here more than a thousand years ago. The temple to N\u00e1r\u00e1yan, from which the place takes its name, is, from the inscription on one of its tablets, supposed to have been built about the Samvat year 898 (A.D. 841). It is an object of interest on account of its extreme antiquity, but possesses no architectural beauty. The sub-collectorate and police station-house are substantial buildings, facing the river. An annual fair is held at Seor\u00ednar\u00e1n in February, and is an important gathering. In the rains the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed at this point is a magnificent stream, and is navigable from Sambalpur for large boats. Even in the dry season the appearance of the river is not unimposing, and retains a channel with a depth of several fathoms of water.\nSHA'HGARH\u2014The chief town of the tract bearing the same name in the S\u00e1gar district, about forty miles north-east of S\u00e1gar. It is supposed to have originally formed part of the great Gond kingdom, whose head-quarters were at Mandla. In or about the year A.D. 1650, according to tradition, one Sh\u00e1hman, a Bundel\u00e1 chieftain, obtained possession of the village and surrounding tract, defeating and killing Chint\u00e1man, its Gond ruler. It is well known that at that time the notorious free-booters of Bundelkhand frequently found safe shelter in the dense and impenetrable jungles of Sh\u00e1hgarh. Sh\u00e1hman greatly improved and enlarged the village, and built the fort which is now partly standing. In A.D. 1798 Mardan Singh, r\u00e1j\u00fa of Garh\u00e1kot\u00e1, attacked and defeated Kh\u00e1nj\u00fa, the descendant of Sh\u00e1hman, and took possession of the place. He was afterwards killed at Garh\u00e1kot\u00e1 by the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of N\u00e1gpur, and was succeeded by his son Arjun Singh, who died in the year A.D. 1842, and was succeeded by his nephew Bakht Bal\u00ed. This latter joined the insurgents in 1857, taking possession of M\u00e1lthon and Garh\u00e1kot\u00e1, and the present subdivision of Band\u00e1. He was, however, defeated by Sir Hugh Rose at Garh\u00e1kot\u00e1 and Madanp\u00far, and his troops dispersed, soon after which he gave himself up, under the amnesty, at Mar\u00e1ur\u00e1, and was sent as a state prisoner to Lahore, where he still remains. His possessions have been divided into three portions, which have been annexed to the districts of S\u00e1gar, Damoh, and Lalatp\u00far. Sh\u00e1hgarh itself is considered a place of some note, as having been till very lately the head-quarters of an independent chief of ancient lineage. It is, however, by no means a large place, and is scarcely worthy of being called a town. It stands at the foot of a lofty range of hills, and is for the most part surrounded with dense jungle. The only structure of any importance in it is a small fort to the east of the village, which contained the r\u00e1j\u00e1's palace. This was a building of some two or more stories, and was well and solidly built, but is now a total ruin. Excepting the manufacture of iron, there is no special industry in Sh\u00e1hgarh. At the four villages of B\u00e1ret\u00e1, Amarm\u00e1u, H\u00edr\u00e1p\u00far, and Tigor\u00e1\u2014all situated in the northern extremity of this tract\u2014iron-ore is found and smelted. It is chiefly sent to Cawnpore. Bi-weekly markets are held here on Tuesdays and Saturdays, which are attended by the inhabitants of the surrounding villages, who barter small quantities of grain, coarse cloth, cotton, &c., for other products. There are in the village a government boys' school, a girls' school, and a dispensary.\n\nSHA'HPU'R\u2014A village in the Bet\u00fal district, situated twenty-four miles north of Badn\u00far, on the river Machn\u00e1. It is said to have been founded some 125 years ago by Bhaw\u00e1n\u00ed Singh Kilad\u00e1r. The population, according to the census of 1866, amounted to 1,318 souls. There are here a police station-house, a branch dispensary, and a government school; and the Machn\u00e1 is crossed by an excellent bridge.\n\nSHA'HPU'R\u2014A range of hills in the Mandla district, situated north of the Narbad\u00e1, and overlooking the Johil\u00e1 river. This portion of the Pachel gh\u00e1ts would seem to be portion of the watershed of Eastern and Western India. The scenery here is wild in the extreme; and the little villages of Gonds and Baig\u00e1s are few and far between. The rivers Gejar and Ganj\u00e1 flow down from the highlands in a succession of waterfalls, the finest of which is sixty feet in height; while behind the falls are caverns of unknown extent, which are carefully avoided by the people as being the homes not only of wild beasts, but also of evil spirits. Most of the mountain ranges, however, are said to be under the immediate protection of Mah\u00e1deva.\nSHA'HPU'R\u2014A town lying six miles south by west from Burh\u00e1npur, and forty-seven miles from Khandw\u00e1, in the Nim\u00e1r district. It contains 500 houses, with 2,500 inhabitants, all of whom are cultivators, also a Hind\u00ed government school, and a police station-house. There is a large plantation of mango trees to the east and west of the village, which contains some thousands of trees. A weekly market is held here on Thursdays.\n\nSHA'HPU'R\u2014A considerable village in the S\u00e1g\u00e1r district, situated about eighteen miles from S\u00e1g\u00e1r, on the Damoh and S\u00e1g\u00e1r road. The cotton produced here is in very good repute. The encamping-ground, though stony, is good; and there is a sar\u00e1f in the village; a government school has also been established here.\n\nSHA'HPU'R\u2014A large village in the R\u00e1mgarh tahsil of the Mandla district, situated on the road between R\u00e1mgarh and Rew\u00e1, about eighteen miles north-east of the former place. The estates of Sh\u00e1hp\u00far and Sh\u00e1hpur\u00e1, comprising with this 265 villages, were formerly held in talukad\u00e1ri tenure by a Lodh\u00ed family, whose representative joined the rebels in 1857, and consequently lost his lands by confiscation.\n\nSHA'HPU'R\u2014A village in the Mandla district, about fifty miles east of Jabalp\u00far, and twenty-five miles north-west of R\u00e1mgarh, on the direct road between Sh\u00e1hp\u00far and Jabalp\u00far. There are here a police station and a school-house.\n\nSHAKAR\u2014An affluent of the Narbad\u00e1, which it joins about fifteen miles from the north-western angle of the Narsinghp\u00far district, near the village of S\u00e1kalp\u00far. The Shakar rises in the Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 district, and is about fifty miles in length. Coal is exposed in the gorge where it quits the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1 table-land and enters the Narbad\u00e1 valley. Its chief affluent is the Chit\u00e9 Rew\u00e1. About a mile below the junction it is crossed by a railway bridge near the station of G\u00e1darw\u00e1r\u00e1.\n\nSHER\u2014An affluent of the Narbad\u00e1. It rises near Khamari\u00e1 in the Lakhn\u00e1don pargana of the Seoni district, and after a general north-westerly course of some eighty miles, falls into the Narbad\u00e1 at Ratikar\u00e1r Khurd, near the centre of the Narsinghp\u00far district. It is spanned by a fine stone bridge at Son\u00e1i Dongr\u00ed (in Seoni) on the N\u00e1gp\u00far and Jabalp\u00far road, and the Great Indian Peninsula Railway crosses it by a lattice girder bridge about eight miles east of Narsinghp\u00far. Coal has been found in the bed of the river near Sihor\u00e1 (in Narsinghp\u00far), but it is said to be useless commercially. The principal affluents of the Sher are the M\u00e1ch\u00e9 Rew\u00e1 and the B\u00e1r\u00fa Rew\u00e1.\n\nSIHORA'\u2014The central revenue subdivision or tahsil in the Jabalp\u00far district, having an area of 1,106 square miles, with 820 villages, and a population of 176,547 souls according to the census of 1866. The land revenue for the year 1869-70 is Rs. 1,89,465.\n\nSIHORA'\u2014The head-quarters of the tahsil of the same name in the Jabalp\u00far district, containing 988 houses and 4,027 inhabitants. It is on the direct route from Jabalp\u00far to Mirz\u00e1p\u00far, from the former of which it is distant twenty-seven miles. The great majority of the inhabitants are agriculturists. There is a considerable trade in grain and other country produce. Sihor\u00e1 has long been a place of considerable importance. In the time of R\u00e9j\u00e1 Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h (circa A.D. 1760) a Gond S\u00faba resided here. About four miles to the south runs the Hiran river.\nSIHORA'\u2014A town in the Bhand\u00e1ra district, about thirty miles to the north-east of Bhand\u00e1ra. It has a fair trade in the ordinary cotton-cloth of the country, which is manufactured in the town, though of rather inferior quality. The population amounts to 2,634 souls, chiefly of the Kosht\u00ed, Ponw\u00e1r, and Dher castes. The watch and ward and conservancy are provided from the town duties. The town is clean, dry, and healthy; and all the well-water is sweet and wholesome. A large tank, which always contains water, is situated just beyond the southern limits of the town, and is very convenient for the inhabitants. There are here a large and flourishing government school and a police outpost.\n\nSILHETI'\u2014A small zam\u00ednd\u00e1ri or chiefship in the R\u00e1ip\u00far district, situated about sixty miles to the north-west of R\u00e1ip\u00far. It consists of twenty villages, which formerly formed part of the chiefship of Gandai. The zam\u00ednd\u00e1r is a Gond.\n\nSIMGA'\u2014The northern revenue subdivision or tahs\u00edl in the R\u00e1ip\u00far district, having an area of 766 square miles, with 471 villages, and a population of 156,443 souls according to the census of 1866. The land revenue of the tahs\u00edl for the year 1869-70 is Rs. 1,47,450-8-0.\n\nSIMGA'\u2014A town in the R\u00e1ip\u00far district, situated on the Seo river, twenty-eight miles to the north of R\u00e1ip\u00far on the road to Bil\u00e9sp\u00far. It is the head-quarters of a tahs\u00edl (sub-collectorate), and contains about 1,000 inhabitants. There are here a town school, a police post, and a post-office.\n\nSINDE'WA'HI'\u2014A good-sized town in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, situated sixteen miles north of M\u00fal. The population amounts to 4,356 souls, the majority of whom are Telingas. About three miles north-east of the town is a very fine tank, which irrigates a wide extent of rice and sugarcane fields. Great quantities of cotton-cloths, coloured and plain, and some bangles, are manufactured here for export. The trade is principally in cotton, cotton-cloths, grain, and gur. The town has government schools for boys and girls, and a police outpost.\n\nSINDI'\u2014A town in the Huz\u00far tash\u00edl of the Wardh\u00e1 district, lying about twenty miles to the east of Wardh\u00e1 on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, which has a station here. Sind\u00ed was, under the Bhonsl\u00e1 rule, the head-quarters of the Bel\u00e1 pargana. It now contains 5,366 inhabitants, principally weavers and cultivators. Cloths\u2014the coarser native kinds\u2014oil, bangles, and shoes are made here. The weekly market is a flourishing one, and lasts two days\u2014Thursday and Friday. The municipal committee and residents are more spirited than most similar bodies. At their desire an English department has been added to the town school, which has lately been moved into a new and commodious building. The town is kept clean, and the people take a pride in their public garden. A commodious set of dispensary buildings has lately been erected; and facilities have been given to the cotton trade by the construction of a storage-yard near the station for such cotton as the Railway Company are unable to remove at once. A fine broad street has also been opened, which is used as a marketplace. Sind\u00ed will probably rise to be an important cotton mart when the advantages which the railway offers for export come to be more generally known and appreciated. According to the trade statistics the respective values of the imports and exports for 1868-69 were Rs. 3,06,530 and Rs. 3,32,123.\nSINGAURGARH\u2014A hill-fort in the Jabalp\u00far district, situated about twenty-six miles north-west of Jabalp\u00far, on a high hill overlooking the narrow Sangr\u00e1mp\u00far valley. Its origin* is attributed to R\u00e9j\u00e1 Bel, a prince of the Chand\u00e9l\u00e1 Rajput tribe, which was very powerful in this part of the country about the eleventh and twelfth centuries, but it was greatly enlarged and improved on being made the seat of government by R\u00e9j\u00e1 Dalpat S\u00e1, of Garh\u00e1 Mandla, about A.D. 1540. The widow of Dalpat S\u00e1, the famous R\u00e1n\u00ed Durg\u00e1vat\u00ed, was defeated near here by \u00c1saf Kh\u00e1n, an officer of the great Akbar; and the fort is said to have stood a siege of nine months in the days of Aurangzeb. It must have been of immense size. The remains of the outer circumvallation are still most extensive. Of the citadel or inner fort, which is on a high central hill, little remains but a solitary tower and some ruined water-reservoirs. Two smaller towers still stand on neighbouring hills. The place is well worthy of a visit, and is easily accessible.\n\nSINGHPUR\u2014A town in the Narsinghp\u00far district, six miles south of Narsinghp\u00far. The population consists of 3,626 souls, almost all engaged in agriculture. The town school, and some houses and temples belonging to the Th\u00e1kur who owns the village, are the only noticeable buildings.\n\nSINGORI\u2014A flourishing agricultural village in the Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 district, situated on the left bank of the river Pench and on the main road to Narsinghp\u00far, sixteen miles north of Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1.\n\nSIR\u2014A river in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, which rises three miles north of Bhat\u00e1l\u00e1, and after a southerly course of twenty-five miles falls into the Wardh\u00e1 five miles south-west of Bh\u00e1ndak.\n\nSIRKUNDA\u2014A village eighteen miles north-east of Sironch\u00e1, in the Upper God\u00e1var\u00ed district. It is situated at the foot of a hill of the same name, 1,200 to 1,300 feet high, which has been found to answer fairly as a sanitarium for invalids from Sironch\u00e1. There are four small huts on the hill for the use of visitors.\n\nSIRONCHA\u2014The head-quarters station of the Upper God\u00e1var\u00ed district, pleasantly situated on the left bank of the Pranh\u00edt\u00e1, two miles above its confluence with the God\u00e1var\u00ed, and 120 miles south-south-east of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1, the nearest station of the Central Provinces. It is 520 feet above the sea-level according to the Topographical Survey maps, but only 360 according to the levels of the Public Works Department. The space now occupied by the public buildings and European officers\u2019 houses was formerly covered with dense jungle. The buildings all stand on a slightly elevated ridge, which slopes away gradually to the north, towards the village and lower grounds in the vicinity of the river. The soil is sandy, and the drainage good. From the summit of the ridge there is a fine view of the winding course of the Pranh\u00edt\u00e1, and of the distant hill on its bank. The extreme point of land round which the river flows is a high bluff of sandstone, on the top of which are the ruins of a small fort which overhang the river. This is said to have been built about 150 years ago under the auspices of one Walf Haidar\u2014a holy man who was buried here, and whose tomb is considered sacred. There are no manufactures, and the trade consists chiefly of imports for local consumption. The usual establishments of a district head-quarters are located here, including English and Telugu schools.\n\n* Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, vol. vi. pp. 627, 628 (August 1837).\nSIRPU'R\u2014A tract of country in the R\u00e1\u00edp\u00far district, lying to the south of Laun, and having an area of about one hundred and fifty square miles, with eighty-one villages, of which half may be inhabited. The western half is fertile and well cultivated, but the eastern portion is hilly and covered with bamboos and grass.\n\nSIRPU'R\u2014A fine agricultural village in the A'rv\u00ed tahsil of the Wardh\u00e1 district, about thirty-nine miles north-west of Wardh\u00e1. A substantial tomb here is pointed out as that of a fak\u00edr\u2014D\u00ednd\u00e1r \u00c1l\u00ed Sh\u00e1h by name\u2014who has a considerable local repute for sanctity. A small weekly market is held here on Mondays.\n\nSIRSUNDI'\u2014A small chiefship twenty-four miles east of Wair\u00e1g\u00e1rh, in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, containing fifteen villages.\n\nSITANAGAR\u2014A flourishing village in the Damoh district, situated on the right bank of the Sun\u00e1r, near the confluence of that river with the Khopr\u00e1. The population amounts to 2,539 souls. There are here a government school and a police post, and a market is held weekly.\n\nSITAPUR\u2014A small village about twenty miles due south of Jagdalp\u00far. It is situated at the foot of a range of limestone hills, and is celebrated for several large caves which are said to extend a very great distance.\n\nSLEEMANA'BAD\u2014A village in the Jabalp\u00far district, on the Northern Road between Jabalp\u00far and Mirzap\u00far, forty miles distant from the former place. It had its origin in a b\u00e1z\u00e1r, established for the convenience of travellers by the late Sir William Sleeman; hence the name.\n\nSOBHAPUR\u2014A large village in the Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d district, about thirty-six miles east of Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d and six miles from Soh\u00e1gp\u00far. It is the headquarters of the native weaving trade in the neighbourhood; it has the local corn exchange; and at the weekly market, which is the best in the district, there is a large demand for country cloth from Narsinghp\u00far and elsewhere. A Gond r\u00e1j\u00e1 and large landholder lives here.\n\nSOHAGPUR\u2014The eastern revenue subdivision or tahsil in the Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d district, having an area of 629 square miles, with 416 villages, and a population of 115,657 souls according to the census of 1866. The land revenue for the year 1869-70 is Rs. 96,746-3-0.\n\nSOHAGPUR\u2014A town in the Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d district, on the highroad to Bombay, about thirty miles east of Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d. It had a fine stone fort (now dismantled), built about eighty years ago by Faujd\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n, a Mohamadan j\u00e1g\u00edrd\u00e1r, who held the surrounding country for the r\u00e1j\u00e1s of N\u00e1gp\u00far. In 1803 it was attacked by Waz\u00edr Mohammad of Bhop\u00e1l without success. There was a mint here for about ten years, and a Soh\u00e1gp\u00far rupee was struck, which is now very rare; it was worth about thirteen annas. The town was a thriving one formerly, though it has fallen away now. It has still the largest Mohammadan population in the Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d district after Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d itself. Some silk-weaving and lac-melting are carried on here; and there are here a tahsil and police station-house, a railway station, and a good sar\u00e1i for railway travellers. The population is 6,008 souls.\n\nSOIT\u2014A village in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, fourteen miles west-north-west of Waror\u00e1, noted for a rapid of the Wardh\u00e1 in its vicinity. In the winter months the river here is about eighty yards wide, and of great depth. Suddenly\nit plunges through a rift of rock, and narrowing to a few feet, rushes down a steep incline in one seething mass of snow-white water, and then falls into a broad, quiet pool beneath. The best time to visit the rapid is about the middle of October.\n\nSOMNU'R\u2014A small Ko\u00ed village at the junction of the Indr\u00e1vat\u00ed and God\u00e1var\u00ed in the Upper God\u00e1var\u00ed district, and near the head of the second barrier.\n\nSON\u2014A river in the B\u00e1l\u00e9gh\u00e1t district, which, rising in the S\u00e9l\u00e9tekri hills, debouches into the plains to the north of L\u00e9\u0144j\u00ed, and thence keeping southwest joins the B\u00e1gh a few miles above the junction of that river with the Wai\u1e45g\u00e1ng\u00e1.\n\nSONA'KHAN\u2014An estate in the Bil\u00e1sp\u00far district, lying sixty miles southeast of Bil\u00e1sp\u00far and twenty miles from Seor\u00ednar\u00e1n. It consists of two small fertile villages surrounded by hills. At the time of the Sepoy Mutiny (1857) N\u00e1r\u00e1yan Singh, the zamind\u00e1r, rebelled against the Government, in punishment for which he was seized and executed, and his estate was confiscated. The tenantry deserted almost in a body, and the whole tract speedily became a desert. A part of it has recently been taken as a waste-land grant by a European gentleman, and with the application of English capital and energy the property, it is hoped, will soon assume a new aspect.\n\nSONE'GA'ON\u2014A large village in the Wardh\u00e1 district, situated on the Wardh\u00e1 valley road between Deol\u00ed and N\u00e1chang\u00e1on, some thirteen miles to the west of Wardh\u00e1. A long-established religious gathering is held here twice a year\u2014in the months of June and October\u2014in honour of an old image of the god Murk\u00eddhar. The inhabitants are almost entirely cultivators. The village fort was erected about a hundred years ago by an ancestor of the present M\u00e1lguz\u00e1rs.\n\nSONORA'\u2014A large village in the Huz\u00far tahsil of the Wardh\u00e1 district, to the south of N\u00e1chang\u00e1on and some twenty-four miles to the west of Wardh\u00e1, containing 1,078 inhabitants, principally cultivators and weavers. It stands on the right bank of the Chaupan\u2014a tributary of the river Wardh\u00e1. There is here a good village school, and a small weekly market is held every Tuesday.\n\nSONPU'R\u2014Was formerly a chiefship subordinate to P\u00e1t\u00edna, but was constituted a separate State by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Madhukar S\u00e1 of Sambalp\u00far about the year A.D. 1560. Since then it has been counted among the cluster of eighteen Garhj\u00e1t states. It is now attached to the Sambalp\u00far district, and is situated between 83\u00b0 20' and 84\u00b0 18' of east longitude, and between 20\u00b0 40' and 21\u00b0 10' of north latitude. It is bounded on the north by Sambalp\u00far Proper and a portion of Rair\u00e1khol, on the south and south-east by Bod, on the east by Rair\u00e1khol, and on the west by P\u00e1t\u00edna.\n\nThe area is about 1,000 square miles, rather more than one-half of which is situated on the right bank of the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed, and the remainder on the left bank. The aspect of the country is flat and slightly undulating; and isolated hills of no great altitude rise abruptly here and there. The soil is, as elsewhere in this part of the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed valley, poor; it is not alluvial, and contains a considerable proportion of sand. There are no forests of any great extent, and such as exist do not contain any valuable timber. The principal rivers are the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed and the Tel. The Suktel also crosses the southern portion of the state on its way to the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed; and the Jir\u00e1 to the north divides a portion of the state from the kh\u00e1lsa. The Tel is comparatively free from obstruction;\nand during the monsoon months there is some boat traffic from P\u00e1tn\u00e1 and Khari\u00e1r; timber is also floated down. In the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed just opposite Sonpur is a dangerous rapid, which renders the navigation difficult, and even dangerous. There is a fair road on the right bank of the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed\u2014a continuation of the line which branches off southward from the R\u00e1jp\u00far and Sambalp\u00far road at Soh\u00e9l\u00e1; it extends as far as Cuttack; and from Bod, about thirty miles below Sonpur, there are bungalows every ten miles. The climate is similar to that of Sambalp\u00far. According to the census of 1866 the population is about 60,000. The non-agricultural castes are Br\u00e1hmans, Mahant\u00eds, R\u00e9jputs; and the agricultural castes are Tass\u00e1s, Kolt\u00e1s, Aghari\u00e1s, and Gonds. In most of the larger villages will be found a sprinkling of the artisan classes, with a few weavers of coarse cloths\u2014Tell\u00eds, M\u00e1ll\u00eds, &c. As elsewhere in these parts, rice is the principal grain produced. The population is for the most part agricultural: and as the state is tolerably well populated, and consequently highly cultivated, in good years a considerable quantity of rice and oil-seeds is available for export. The export trade is usually carried on via the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed. The pulses, cotton, and sugarcane are also largely cultivated.\n\nThe family is Chanh\u00e1n R\u00e9jput, being an offshoot from the reigning family of Sambalp\u00far. They trace back their lineage to Madan Gop\u00e1l, who obtained the state about 300 years ago. He was the son of Madhukar S\u00e1, fourth r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Sambalp\u00far. The succession has since continued regularly. Nil\u00e1dri Singh Deva Bah\u00e1dur is the present r\u00e1j\u00e1. He obtained the title of \"bah\u00e1dur\" for services to the British Government in the field. He is a well-educated young man, of some thirty years of age; he can read and write Uriya and Urd\u00fa, and also English. His estate is, however, very backward in the matter of education, and though there is nominally a school at Sonpur, it has no regular attendance of pupils.\n\nSONPUR\u2014A chiefship in the Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 district, lying to the southwest of Har\u00e1i. It comprises forty-nine villages. The present chief is a Gond by caste. He pays a quit-rent of ten rupees annually to the Government.\n\nSONPUR\u2014A village in the Jabalp\u00far district, picturesquely situated on the high banks of the Paret\u2014an affluent of the Hiran\u2014about nine miles east-by-north of Jabalp\u00far. Here was stationed in the days of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 rule a body of cavalry; but the place is now only remarkable as giving its name to the pargana. The country around is wild and jungly.\n\nSONSARI\u2014A chiefship in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, situated fourteen miles north-north-east of Wair\u00e1g\u00e1rh, and containing twenty-one villages. The chief is a Halb\u00e1.\n\nSRINAGAR\u2014A town in the Narsinghp\u00far district, situated on the Umar, twenty-two miles south-east of Narsinghp\u00far. It was a flourishing place even in the days of Gond rule, and under the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s attained some importance, being the residence of the local authorities, and maintaining a considerable garrison. It had then, it is said, 2,000 houses, and the remains of buildings all around quite bear out this estimate. There are now not much more than a fourth of that number, and the population is little over 1,500.\n\nSU'ARMA'R\u2014A wild forest tract in the R\u00e1jp\u00far district, situated to the north of the Narr\u00e1 chiefship on the west bank of the Jonk river, and south-east of R\u00e1jp\u00far. It consists of eighty-four poor villages. The chief is a Gond; and the grant is about 150 years old.\n\nSUNA'R or SONA'R\u2014A river which takes its rise at a place called Tarr\u00e1, belonging to the Pitihr\u00e1 r\u00e1j\u00e1, close by the south-west boundary of the\nS\u00fagar district, and flowing thence in a north-easterly direction past the towns of Gaurjh\u00e1mar, Rehl\u00ed, and Garh\u00e1kot\u00e1, passes through the Damoh district, on the north-east frontier of which it joins the Bairm\u00e9.\n\nSUNKAM\u2014An estate in Bastar, consisting of ninety villages, with an area of about four hundred square miles. It lies between the river Sabari and a range of hills. The chief village is Sunkam, on the left bank of the Sabari. The forests contain teak of fair size, and in considerable quantities. The population consists of Kofs, Telings, and Halb\u00e1s.\n\nSUNWARA'\u2014A large village in the Seoni district, thirty miles to the north-east of Seoni. The population amounts to 1,218 souls. There is a village school here, and a market is held weekly.\n\nSUR\u2014A river which rises in the lower gh\u00e1ts to the north of the N\u00e1gpur district, and flows in a north-easterly direction through a very fertile country. Its water is believed to be especially good for irrigating sugarcane, by fields of which its banks may be said almost to be fringed.\n\nSURJ'AGARH\u2014A high and remarkable-looking hill in the north of the Ahir\u00ed chiefship of the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district. About the end of the seventeenth century two chieftains\u2014S\u00e1dhu Varya and M\u00fala Varya\u2014rebelled against the king R\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h, and fortified this hill, from which they made raids into the surrounding country. R\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h thereupon granted the tract, now known as the Ahir\u00ed chiefship, to a relative of his named Kok S\u00e1, who after some years of desultory warfare stormed Surj\u00e1gahr and put the insurgent leaders to the sword.\n\nSURKHI'\u2014A considerable village in the S\u00e1g\u00e1r district, on the Narsinghp\u00far and S\u00e1g\u00e1r road, about twelve miles to the south-east of S\u00e1g\u00e1r. There is here an encamping-ground for troops; and supplies and water are plentiful.\n\nSWETGANGA'\u2014A small village in the Bil\u00e1sp\u00far district, situated forty-five miles south-west of Bil\u00e1sp\u00far, on the road to Mandla. It is considered a sacred spot by the Hind\u00fas, and a natural spring, from which there is a constant supply of pure water, is believed to be an emanation from the Ganges. A masonry reservoir protects the spring, and a temple has been built near the spot.\n\nT\n\nTA'KALGHAT\u2014A village in the N\u00e1gpur district, prettily wooded, and situated on rising ground near the Krishn\u00e1\u2014a tributary of the Wan\u00e1\u2014twenty miles south of N\u00e1gpur and three miles west of Bor\u00ed. The population amounts to 1,851 souls, belonging almost entirely to the agricultural classes. The present village dates from about the year 1700; but from mounds around the village, and from the rough circles of stones on the hills about a mile distant, have been dug fragments of pottery, flint arrow-heads, and iron-ware, evidently of great antiquity.\n\nTAKHTPUR\u2014Situated about twenty miles west of Bil\u00e1sp\u00far, on the Mandla road. It is said to have been founded about 180 years ago by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Takht Singh of Ratanp\u00far, and the remains of a brick palace and a temple of Mah\u00e1deva, attributed to him, may still be seen. Takhtpur is now a flourishing town, with a population of 5,000 souls, including traders, artisans, and weavers, a well-attended weekly market, and a good school. There is a police post here.\nTALE'GA'ON\u2014A large village in the Wardh\u00e1 district, situated on the N\u00e1g-p\u00far and Amr\u00e1oti road, midway between A'rv\u00ed and A'sht\u00ed, and about forty-three miles north-west of Wardh\u00e1. It derives its name from its situation below the hills. This village was established about 125 years ago by Sankar Patel, who built the fort, the walls of which are still standing. It contains an old native sar\u00e1\u00ed, built for the convenience of travellers when the N\u00e1gp\u00far and Amr\u00e1oti highroad was of more importance than it is now. The population amounts to 1,389 souls, chiefly cultivators. A village school has been opened here.\n\nTALE'GA'ON\u2014A village in the Huz\u00far tahsil of the Wardh\u00e1 district, about eleven miles to the south of Wardh\u00e1. A market is held here every Monday, at which oil, salt, and country cloth are the principal articles brought for sale. The population amounts to 1,166 souls, chiefly cultivators of the Kunb\u00ed and Tel\u00ed castes. There is a village school here.\n\nTALODHI'\u2014A village situated twelve miles north of Sindew\u00e1h\u00ed, in the Garhbor\u00ed pargana of the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district. It contains 805 houses, and though now rather in a decaying state, still retains a certain amount of trade in cotton, cotton-fabrics, grain, and unrefined sugar. The population is chiefly Mar\u00e1th\u00e1, with a sprinkling of Telinga traders. There are here government schools for boys and girls, a district post-office, and a police station-house.\n\nTALODHI'\u2014A village in the Gh\u00e1tk\u00e1l pargana of the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, situated nine miles east-north-east of D\u00e1bh\u00e1. It contains 309 houses, with a population chiefly consisting of Telingas. There are the remains of an old fort here; and the town shows signs of having once been a place of importance.\n\nTA'LPE'R or TAL\u2014A river which rises in the Bel\u00e1 Dfl\u00e1 hills in the Bastar dependency, and after a course of seventy miles falls into the God\u00e1var\u00ed in the Charl\u00e1 t\u00e1luka. The bed is generally rocky.\n\nTAPT\u00cd'\u2014A river which rising a few miles from Mult\u00e1i in Bet\u00fal, traverses the southern part of that district, an open and partially cultivated tract. It then plunges into the gorge of the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1 hills formed on the one side by the Chikald\u00e1 hills of Ber\u00e1r, and on the other by the wild K\u00e1l\u00edbh\u00edt hills in Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d. In this valley are the G\u00e1ngr\u00e1 and Molgh\u00e1t tracts of Ber\u00e1r and Dh\u00e1r M\u00e1njrod of Nim\u00e1r. It enters the latter at a point about one hundred and twenty miles from its source, and for about thirty miles more is still confined on either side by the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1s in a comparatively narrow valley. A few miles above Burh\u00e1np\u00far, however, the valley begins to open out, and opposite that city has become a fine rich basin about twenty miles in width. Further on the river passes from Nim\u00e1r into the open plains of Kh\u00e1ndesh and Guj\u00e1r\u00e1t, reaching the sea a little south of Surat, after a course of about four hundred and sixty miles. Within the Nim\u00e1r district, and above, it is not navigable for craft of any size, its bed being very rocky, and from the rapid fall of level carrying off the drainage of a large tract of hilly country in sudden and tremendous floods, after which it soon subsides into a mere chain of pools. In the upper valley are several basins of exceedingly rich soil, but they are generally covered by a dense growth of tree-jungle, bamboos, and grass, in which swarm tigers, bears, bison, s\u00e1mbar, and spotted-deer. The climate is now deadly, though there is abundant evidence that these culturable basins were, during the Mohammadan period, seats of a thriving cultivation; M\u00e1njrod alone being recorded as containing eighty-two inhabited villages, yielding a revenue of Rs. 22,000. It now pays Rs. 250 only! It is inhabited by aboriginal Kurk\u00fas, who have learnt the use of the plough, and raise fine crops of wheat in a few places from the rich black soil of the valley.\nTA'ROBA' or TA'DA'LA'\u2014A lake in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, situated fourteen miles east of Seg\u00e1on, in a basin of the Chim\u00far hills, at a considerable height above the plain. It is far from any village, and though artificially embanked at one point, has all the appearance of a natural lake. Its depth is very great, and the water is believed to be of peculiar excellence. In the early ages\u2014so runs the legend\u2014a marriage procession of Gaulfs was passing through these hills from the west. Hot and thirsty, they sought for water and found none, when a strange-looking old man suggested that the bride and bridegroom should join in digging for a spring. Laughingly they consented, and with the removal of a few spadesful of earth a clear fountain leapt to the surface. While all were delightedly drinking, the freed waters rose and spread into a wide lake, overwhelming bride and bridegroom and procession; but fairy hands soon constructed a temple in the depths, where the spirits of the drowned are supposed to dwell. Afterwards on the lake-side a palm tree grew up, which only appeared during the day, sinking into the earth at twilight. One morning a rash pilgrim seated himself upon the tree-top, and was borne into the skies, where the flames of the sun consumed him. The palm then shrivelled into dust, and in its place appeared an image of the spirit of the lake, which is worshipped under the name of T\u00e1rob\u00e1'. Formerly, at the call of pilgrims, all necessary vessels rose from the lake, and after being used, were washed and returned to the waters. But at last one evil-minded man took those he had received to his home; they quickly vanished, and from that day the mystic provision wholly ceased. In quiet nights the country-folk still hear faint sounds of drum and trumpet passing round the lake; and old men say that in one dry year when the waters sank low, golden pinnacles of a fairy temple were seen glittering in the depths.\n\n\"On Lough Neagh's banks as the fisherman strays,\nOn a cold calm eve's declining,\nHe sees the round towers of other days,\nIn the waves beneath him shining.\"\u2014(Moore's Irish Melodies).\n\nThe lake is much visited, especially in the months of December and January; and the rites of the god are performed by a Gond. Wives seek its waters for their supposed virtue in causing fertility, and sick persons for health. Fish in the lake grow to a large size, the skeleton of one which was stranded some years ago measuring eight feet in length.\n\nTA'TOLI' HILL\u2014See \"Gunjew\u00e1h\u00ed.\"\n\nTAW\u00c1'\u2014A river which debouches from the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1 hills through a rather picturesque gorge, about sixteen miles south-east of the town of Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d. It drains a large area within the hills to the south; its tributaries among the hills reach many miles to the east and west; and its floods in the rainy season are sudden and violent. Its bed exposes many fine sections showing the geological structure of the hills through which it has forced its way. Trending rather westerly from the hills across the valley, it spreads out into a wide sandy channel, troublesome to pass in the dry season, and difficult during the rains, and it joins the Narb\u00e1da at a point some four miles above Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d. In the angle of the junction stands an old temple, and the place has a certain odour of sanctity, to which an annual religious gathering and fair of some local repute owe their origin.\n\nTEJGARH\u2014A village in the Damoh district, about twenty-four miles south of Damoh, in a wild, scantily-cultivated country. It was founded by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Tej\u00ed Singh, a Lodh\u00ed chief, whose descendants now hold the Hatr\u00ed t\u00e1luka, and was\nonce a place of some importance. The fort and walls have, however, been destroyed, and the population does not now exceed 1,300 souls. The inhabitants are chiefly Ahirs; and the place is well known for its breed of cattle.\n\nTEKRI\u2014A picturesque little village in the Chanda district, three miles north of Gunjewahi, having in the vicinity a very fine irrigation-reservoir.\n\nTEL\u2014A river which rises far down to the south in the hills about fourteen miles south-west of Junagarh in the Kelahandi state, and flows north-east till it joins the Mahanadi near Sonpur, after a course of about two hundred miles. For several months in the year it is quite navigable by country boats. Its bed is generally sandy, and though its waters decrease very much during the hot season, they do not entirely dry up. Its principal tributary is the \"Hathi,\" which rises about sixty miles south-west of Junagarh, and flowing north-east joins the Tel at Bandgaon, about seven miles north of Junagarh.\n\nTENDUKHERA\u2014A small town in the Narsinghpur district, lying twenty-two miles north-west of Narsinghpur. It has a population of 2,822 persons, and is only noticeable on account of its proximity to the iron mines, and of the forges which have consequently been established in it.\n\nTEPAGARH\u2014A hill range in the Murangon zamindari of the Chanda district. It forms the highest portion of a wild mountain region two thousand feet above the sea, on the summit of which, encircled by chain upon chain of hills, all covered with the densest forest, stands, far from human habitation, the old fortress of Tepagarh. Its massive ramparts of huge undressed stone, flanked by bastions, and entered through a winding gateway, are over two miles in circuit, and within is a tank of considerable size, with a stone embankment, and steps along its water-face. This reservoir never fails, and is supposed to be of fabulous depth, forming the source of the Tepagarh, which flows from its western bank, and is in the rains a roaring mountain-torrent. South of the tank on lofty ground, commanding the fortress and an immense expanse of country beyond, rises an inner fort or citadel, with lines of defence similar to those of the outer work, and having within it the remains of what was doubtless the dwelling of the chiefs of Tepagarh. According to tradition the greatest of these was a Gond prince, named Param Rajah, who had a bodyguard of two thousand fighting men, five elephants, and twenty-five horses, and held the whole Wairagarh country under his sway. The legend goes that he was invaded by a considerable force from Chattisgarh, which he repulsed after a long fight. A laggard from his ranks, however, picked up one of his slippers, dropped while he was in pursuit, and took it to his Rajah, who, accepting it as a sign of her husband's defeat, committed suicide, by driving her chariot down a steep slope into the Tepagarh lake. The Rajah returning after his victory found what had happened, and followed his wife's example. Since then Tepagarh has been desolate.\n\nTESUA\u2014A stream in the Bilaspur district, which, rising in the Pandaria chiefship, flows through the heart of the Mungeli pargana, and after a circuitous course of some sixty miles, falls into the Maniar near Sargao, sixteen miles south of Bilaspur.\n\nTEWAR\u2014A considerable village in the Jabalpur district, near the site of the more ancient town of the same name, about six miles from Jabalpur on the Narsinghpur road. Not far off are the well-known ruins of Karanbel. For the last century the stone of Karanbel has been used for the construction of\ngh\u00e1ts, temples, and houses, and recently the railway contractors have used it in making bridges and permanent-way. Still the supply is said not to fail. The Puranic name of Tewar is stated to be Tripura, and it was one of the principal places of the Haihaya kingdom of Chedi.*\n\nTHAKURTOLA'\u2014A chiefship lying to the north-west of the R\u00e1ip\u00far district on the borders of Bhand\u00e1ra. It originally had only twenty-four villages, but now contains seventy-seven; some villages above the gh\u00e1ts having been transferred from S\u00e1l\u00e9tekri at the time when the entire charge of the gh\u00e1ts was made over to Th\u00e1kurtol\u00e1. The chiefship now extends up to the Banjar\u2014a tributary of the Narbad\u00e1. Below the gh\u00e1ts the country is hilly, but above them it is flat and well watered. It has some fine forests of dhjes\u00e1l, hard\u00fa, \u00e1\u00edn, and dh\u00e1ur\u00e1, and a considerable area of well-cultivated land, bearing crops of cotton, kodo, and rice. The population below the gh\u00e1ts are chiefly Tel\u00eds and Kal\u00e1l\u00eds, while above they are almost all Gonds, to which caste the chief also belongs.\n\nTHANE'GA'ON\u2014A village in the \u00c1rv\u00ed tahsil of the Wardh\u00e1 district, about thirty-three miles north of Wardh\u00e1. There is here a police outpost; and the population numbers 995 souls, chiefly belonging to the agricultural classes.\n\nTHANWAR\u2014A river which rises in the Mandla district. It has a south-westerly course, and finally empties itself into the (Waingang\u00e1) B\u00e1ngang\u00e1, in the Seoni district. The junction of the two rivers is very picturesque. Its affluents are the Alon and the Pachmoni.\n\nTHIMURNI'\u2014A small town about seven miles east of Hard\u00e1, in the Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d district. It belongs to a Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 nobleman of the Bhusk\u00fat\u00e1 family. He does not ordinarily reside here, but has an agent in charge of the fort and estate. Vegetables and betel are grown in the neighbourhood for the Hard\u00e1 market. The population amounts to 4,400 souls according to the census of 1866.\n\nTIGORA'\u2014A small patch of forest, about two square miles in extent, in the S\u00e1g\u00e1r district. The general growth of timber is good, and most of the superior kinds of wood are to be found. Tend\u00fa or ebony (*di\u00f3sp\u00fdros melanozylon*) especially abounds.\n\nTILAKSENDU'R\u2014A village in the Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d district at the foot of the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1s, about twenty-five miles south-west of Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d. Probably the only thing in the Narbad\u00e1 valley which can boast of any real antiquity is the rock-cut temple at this place. It is a simple cave, not of very elegant construction compared with the plans given in \"Fergusson's Rock-cut Temples,\" and probably of later date. It now is sacred to Mah\u00e1deva, and a cave or fissure close by is said to communicate with the Jambudv\u00edp cave near Pachmarhi.\n\nTIRKH\u00c9RI' MALPURI\u2014An estate in the Bhand\u00e1ra district, comprising seven villages, with an area of fifteen square miles, of which about one-fourth is under cultivation. Of its component portions, Tirkheri is situated to the east of the K\u00e1mth\u00e1 pargana near the eastern boundary of the district, and Malpuri to the west of the K\u00e1mth\u00e1 pargana, at the point where the S\u00e1ngarh\u00ed and Tiror\u00e1 parganas meet it. There is a good deal of forest on this estate, but little good timber. The population, amounting to 1,950 souls, consists chiefly of Ponwars and Kunbis. The only large village is Tirkheri.\n\n* Journal of the American Oriental Society, vol. vi. p. 516.\nTOHGA'ON\u2014A town in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, situated twenty-eight miles south-south-east of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1, on the left bank of the Wardh\u00e1, and containing five hundred houses. The population is chiefly Mar\u00e1th\u00e1. There are here government schools for boys and girls, and a police outpost.\n\nTUMSAR\u2014A town in the Bhand\u00e1ra district, situated about twenty miles north-east of Bhand\u00e1ra, on a small affluent of the Waingang\u00e1. The fixed population amounts to 7,604 souls, but for eight months in the year, or during the grain traffic season, the number of residents rises to 10,000 or 12,000 souls. The chief trade of Tumsar is in grain, for it is a depot for all sorts of cereals from the Chhatt\u00edsgarh country. The grain is sold wholesale in the market, then stored, and afterwards exported towards the west. The trade is very extensive, and a large number of persons find employment during the season in ministering to the wants of those engaged in it. Besides the trade in grain, there is a small local manufacture of coarse cotton-cloth. The town contains a large and flourishing government school, a handsome corn exchange, a large commodious sar\u00e1\u00ed for travellers, and a police outpost. Around are numerous fine groves of mango trees, which add to the beauty of the landscape. The inhabitants are chiefly Tel\u00eds, Dhers, Gonds, and Go\u00e1r\u00e1s, with a very small proportion of Br\u00e1hmans, Mohammadans, and other castes. The watch and ward and conservancy are provided from the town duties; and the town is kept fairly clean and drained. It is built on red gravel soil, and is considered healthy. The well-water inside the town is in places brackish and unwholesome, but there are a number of wells of sweet water just outside, which, with several tanks, prevent any inconvenience to the inhabitants. During the grain-traffic season the watering of the numerous herds of cattle is apt to exhaust the supply of water; but the construction of a large reservoir, on the north-west of the town, undertaken through the liberality of one of the leading inhabitants, has removed this difficulty.\n\nTURMA'PURI\u2014An estate in the Bhand\u00e1ra district, situated about five miles north of S\u00e1k\u00f3l\u00ed, consisting of seven villages, with an area of 8,590 acres, about one-eighth of which is cultivated. The zam\u00edn-d\u00e1r is a Kunb\u00ed; but the cultivators are chiefly Gonds and Go\u00e1r\u00e1s. The forests on this estate contain a good deal of large timber of the unreserved kinds.\n\nU\n\nUMAR\u2014An affluent of the Sher, in the Narsinghp\u00far district.\n\nUMRER\u2014The south-eastern revenue subdivision or tahs\u00edl in the N\u00e1gp\u00far district, covering an area of 1,024 square miles, with 678 villages, and a population of 124,321 souls according to the census of 1866. The land revenue of the tahs\u00edl for 1869-70 is Rs. 1,79,438.\n\nUMRER\u2014A town in the N\u00e1gp\u00far district, situated twenty-eight miles south-east of N\u00e1gp\u00far. Here are the head-quarters of a tahs\u00edl or revenue subdivision, and a police circle. The population amounts to about 12,000 souls according to the census of 1866.\n\nThe town is built on light sandy soil, with a well-defined slope towards the river A'mb, which flows about three-quarters of a mile to the north, so that the natural drainage is good. In shape it is triangular, having the apex towards the south-east, and the base on the western side. A good deal has recently been done to improve its appearance. Three and a half miles of good\nroad have been constructed through it, and a commodious school-house and handsome dispensary building have been erected. The central market-place has an open space of about seventy yards square, well planted with young trees, and metalled throughout. Some improvements have also been effected in excavating large tanks, one on either side of the town. The smaller one has been completed. The second tank is a very fine one, and is now being completed in a way that will make it a real benefit, as well as an ornament to the place. It lies on the south of a large old fort, and part of its eastern bank flanks the principal road above described. Large excavations are now being made, and the earth thrown up is being disposed so as to form a boulevard, which will be planted with trees, and have a metalled walk in the centre. The tank receives the drainage from a very extensive gathering-ground. Hitherto the water has been suffered to go to waste in the rainy season by a long line of escape; this is being remedied, and it is hoped that a storage of water will be now secured sufficient to supply the wants of the people throughout the dry season, and still to leave a quantity of water to cover the whole area of the bed. The town possesses a nursery of young trees kept for planting out, and an attempt has lately been made to start a garden in the interior of the fort. A good number of old trees exist in and about the town. The mango-groves adjoining it on the east side are remarkably fine and extensive, but most of the country immediately around it is bare and uninteresting. Wells are numerous, and generally contain good and pure water, especially those situated near the two tanks mentioned above; but in some of those in the interior of the town at its highest parts the water is brackish. There are a number of bankers and mercantile firms here who do a brisk trade. The declared value of the imports into Umrer during the year 1868-69 amounted to Rs. 2,05,506, and of the exports to Rs. 3,68,520. The town is noted for its cloth manufacture. The best cloth is really superior, having a very considerable reputation in this part of India. It is sent to Puna, to N\u00e1sik, to Pandharp\u00far in the Deccan, and even to Bombay. The Kosht\u00eds, or weavers, are consequently an important class in the town. The celebrated Umrer \"dhot\u00eds\" consist of very fine cotton-cloth, with silk embroidery all round. The embroidered borders are designed in various ways, the pattern being according to the fancy of the weaver. The width of the border ranges from an inch to as much as a foot and a half. Some of the best specimens recently carried off medals at the late Exhibitions at Lucknow, \u00c1gra, N\u00e1gp\u00far, and Jabalp\u00far. The manufacture is supposed to have been first established here in consequence of some peculiar virtue in the water of some of the wells in fixing the different dyes on the silks; and certainly the dyes, especially the crimson, obtained here do seem to have a richer hue than those obtained elsewhere. There are now 1,150 looms at work, keeping about twice that number of men in full employment. The journeymen workmen amongst the weavers earn from ten to twenty-five rupees a month, according to their different degrees of skill. There are only a few master-weavers, and in their hands is the bulk of this trade.\n\nThe average health of the population is good. The state of education is like that of all other towns in the district\u2014originally backward, but progressing. The government school here is now prosperous. Instruction, until lately, has been limited to the Vernacular (Mar\u00e1th\u00ed), but recently a subscription has been raised for the establishment of an English class, and English is now taught. The dispensary, which is superintended by a good native doctor, is\nalready very successful. The average number of patients treated daily is now 112.\n\nThe town is a little less than two hundred years old. The site on which it is built was the centre of a jungle extending southwards nearly to Chim\u00fbr, in the present district of Ch\u00e2nd\u00e1. A large grant of land in this jungle was made towards the close of the seventeenth century by Bakht Buland to one Mun\u00e2j\u00ee Pandit from Chim\u00fbr, the ancestor of the present landholder, who still retains the old title of \"desp\u00e2ndy\u00e2,\" conferred on his ancestor by the Gond sovereign. Mun\u00e2j\u00ee Pandit brought cultivators from the Ch\u00e2nd\u00e1 district, and soon made an impression on the jungles. The town advanced gradually, but did not rise to anything like its present size until after the year A.D. 1775, when Mudhoj\u00ee Bhonsl\u00e2, who was then managing affairs at N\u00e2gp\u00fbr for his son, the second Raghoj\u00ee, made it his temporary residence. He built the large fort which, though utterly neglected for many years, is still in excellent preservation where its walls have not been destroyed by man. After Mudhoj\u00ee showed favour to the place, the cloth manufacture began to be established, and in a very short time the town rose to its present size. The fort is, however, the only architectural remnant worth mentioning. It was originally a narrow rectangular figure, three hundred yards long and eighty broad, with walls of massive brick-work with bastions. The walls are about thirty-five feet high, and about twelve feet thick at the base, lessening to two feet at the summit. Only two sides now remain. It has several wells inside, and must, in old days, have been very strong relatively to any artillery that could then have been brought to bear against it. It contains the remains of a remarkable old temple made of massive pillars roughly hewn, and covered over with large slabs of stone without mortar.\n\nUMRETH\u2014A large village in the Chhindw\u00e2r\u00e1 district, situated sixteen miles west of Chhindw\u00e2r\u00e1. It was formerly the capital of the pargana, and for a short time the head-quarters of the tahs\u00eel. The village lies in a secluded spot, and has several fine groves of mango trees on the western side. There are here a police station and a school. The population amounts to 1,545 souls.\n\nUMRI\u2014A small zam\u00eend\u00e2r\u00ee or chiefship in the Bhand\u00e2ra district, consisting of ten villages, with an area of nearly seventeen square miles, of which little more than one-eighth is under cultivation. It is situated about four miles to the west of the great Naweg\u00e2on lake. The grant was made, on a service-tenure, to the ancestor of the present chief, who is a Halb\u00e2 by caste.\n\nUPPER GOD\u00c2VARI*\u2014\n\nCONTENTS.\n\n| Page | Page |\n|------|------|\n| Boundaries and contour | 491 |\n| Subdivisions | 492 |\n| Physical features | 493 |\n| Geological formation | ib. |\n| Hills | 494 |\n| Tanks and wells | 495 |\n| Principal towns | ib. |\n| Climate | ib. |\n| Administration | 498 |\n\nThe Upper God\u00e2v\u00e2ri district became British territory on the 5th November 1860, the six talukas of which it is composed having been ceded by His Highness the Niz\u00e2m by\n\n* This article is almost entirely taken from the Report on the Land Revenue Settlement of the district, by Captain Glasfurd.\nthe treaty of that year. It lies between $17^\\circ 25'$ and $19^\\circ 5'$ of north latitude, and $78^\\circ 55'$ and $81^\\circ 45'$ of east longitude. It is situated obliquely between these parallels from north-west to south-east, and lies along the left or eastern bank of the Pranhita and Godavari rivers, its northern extremity extending for only thirty miles along the bank of the former beyond its confluence with the latter. Its length\u2014215 miles\u2014is quite out of proportion to its width, which nowhere exceeds twenty-five miles, and is in some parts as little as five miles. The lower portion of the district is less than one hundred feet, while the northern portion of it is over five hundred feet, above sea level. The superficial area is 1,926 square miles, and the population amounts to 54,680 souls. The boundaries are, to the north the Ahiri chiefship of the Chanda district; to the south the Godavari; to the east the Bastar dependency, the Jaipur state, and the Godavari district of the Madras presidency; and to the west the Godavari and Pranhita rivers. The general contour is long and straggling, and this latter defect is increased by a portion of the Bastar dependency abutting at one point on the Godavari, and disconnecting the Sironcha taluka from the rest of the district for a distance of about fifteen miles.\n\nThe district consists mainly of portions of two large chiefships, the bulk of which is situated in the Nizam's territories on the right bank of the Godavari. Commencing from the north-western extremity come the Sironcha, Nugur, Albek, and Charla talukas, belonging to what is sometimes called the Yelmah chiefship, from the name of the family which holds it. Lower down, and extending to the south-western extremity of the district, are the talukas of Bhadrachallam and Rakapalli, belonging to the Hasanabad Sankargiri, or what is commonly known as the Bhadrachallam chiefship, the largest portion of which lies also on the opposite or right bank of the Godavari. The area, population, and total revenue of these subdivisions are as follows:\n\n| Subdivisions | Total area in Square Miles | Population | Land Revenue |\n|--------------|---------------------------|------------|-------------|\n| Sironcha     | 465                       | 13,250     | Rs.         |\n| Nugur        | 296                       | 5,145      | 2,819       |\n| Albek        | 108                       | 811        | 882         |\n| Charla       | 184                       | 8,741      | 2,497       |\n| Bhadrachallam| 873                       | 22,837     | 5,684       |\n| Rakapalli    |                           | 8,896      | 3,626       |\n| **Total**    | **1,926**                 | **54,680** | **19,164**  |\n\nEach of these subdivisions is under the charge of a Naib or Deputy, subordinate to the proprietors, who collects the revenue, but has no powers either in the Civil, Criminal, or Revenue department. The first four subdivisions belong to\ndifferent owners, only one of whom has his residence in British territory. The R\u00e1ni (superior proprietor) of Bhadr\u00e1challam resides in British territory.\n\nIn general terms the whole district may be called a dense forest, with strips of rich cultivated land along the banks of the rivers, varying in width according to the character of the soil and the amount of the population in the vicinity. Thus where the alluvial deposits are plentiful, they extend inland from the rivers for a considerable distance, and up the valleys of the smaller streams that flow into it; while they are mere patches where the soil is poor, and give place to jungle and rocks where the banks are rugged and hilly. The richest lands lie along the banks of the God\u00e1v\u00e1ri or its affluents, and it is there that the best cultivation is found. Further in from the river the land is generally light and sandy, and though there are some tracts of rich black soil here and there, the population in them is generally sparse, and consists entirely of the aboriginal tribes. Owing to the dense and extensive forests which cover the greater portion of the country, it has been found impracticable to survey the waste land in detail. The principal rivers which flow either through or along the boundaries of the district are, the God\u00e1v\u00e1ri, Pranhit\u00e9, Indr\u00e1vati, T\u00e1lper, Sabari, and Selern. The smaller streams are, the Penjarw\u00e1g\u00fa and Pandirw\u00e1g\u00fa near Sironch\u00e1, the P\u00e1lem in Nug\u00far, the Pusw\u00e1g\u00fa in Alb\u00e1k\u00e1, and the Gubbalmangl, T\u00farw\u00e1g\u00fa, Konder, and S\u00e1ker in Bhadr\u00e1challam and R\u00e1k\u00e1palli. No use is made of any of these rivers or streams for purposes of irrigation, though several of them could be well utilised in this manner. No doubt the fact that none of the former Native dynasties had their capitals or chief towns in the immediate neighbourhood of the God\u00e1v\u00e1ri tended to prevent this; but at the same time it is strange that the kings of Telengana, who had their capital at Warangal, only ninety miles south of the God\u00e1v\u00e1ri, and who instituted a magnificent system of irrigation from tanks, did not attempt anything in the way of irrigation works on the river.\n\nThe following sketch of the geology of the district is chiefly derived from a report by Mr. Wall, who was employed by the Madras Government as a Mineral Viewer, and made a tour up the valley of the God\u00e1v\u00e1ri in 1857 to Kot\u00e1, about eight miles above Sironch\u00e1, to examine the site where the late Dr. Walker had reported, as far back as 1848, the existence of coal. Commencing with the t\u00e1luka of Sironch\u00e1, in the north-western extremity of the district, the hills, which generally run from north-west to south-east, parallel to the course of the river, are metamorphic, and consist chiefly of vitrified sandstone, which in some places has been only rendered partially crystalline by the action of volcanic heat, while in other places the same agency has caused them to lose all trace of their original character. In the Sironch\u00e1 t\u00e1luka a level, low tract of about ten miles in its widest part intervenes between this metamorphic range and the God\u00e1v\u00e1ri, with a small range of sandstone hills, the base of which is washed by the Pranhit\u00e9 about twelve or fifteen miles north of Sironch\u00e1. In these sandstone hills, close to the village of Tekr\u00e1, is an isolated cliff of sandstone about fifty feet in height and fifteen feet in width. It stands alone on the side of the hill, and is probably the remnant of a former line of cliff, the rest of which has been washed away by the action of water. In the tract between this sandstone range and the rivers there is evidence of its having probably once formed the bed of a shallow inland sea. Near the river at Sironch\u00e1 and other places beds of ferruginous sandstones, conglomerates, and mottled clays are found either\ncropping out on the surface, or forming the banks of the rivers. The sandstones and mottled clays are delicately stratified, and must have been deposited in very still waters; they are of different colours\u2014grey, pink, and violet,\u2014and from the ease with which they can be worked, and their variegated colours, are well adapted for building purposes. Specimens sent to the Nagpur Exhibition were much admired. East of Sironcha, about two miles, lies a bed of limestone which Mr. Wall pronounced argillaceous, and which he traced for about twenty miles north-west and forty-five miles south-east of Sironcha. In this limestone are found fossil fish and fish scales, the latter in considerable quantities. Proceeding further south-east we arrive at the head of the second Barrier, where the metamorphic hills come close to the Godavari, and for a short distance cross it near Enchampalli, the site of the navigation works at the second Barrier. Further down, the river recedes from the range, which increases in height, and extends a distance of about fifty miles, till close to the Talper river it ends in the Gadalgutta hill. The distinctive features of these metamorphic ranges are that they all run from north-west to south-east, and that their south-west sides consist of crag and tail, viz. a scarped precipice of a hundred or two hundred feet in height, with a steep slope at an angle of about 45\u00b0 from the foot of the scarp to the plain, while their north-east sides slope away at an angle of about 25\u00b0. There is little or no level ground on the summit of these ranges, and consequently no water, and they are barren, stony, and quite unculturable. According to Mr. Wall these metamorphic ranges do not appear to have been violently disturbed, except at certain points\u2014Bhadraclallam, Enchampalli, and Ahiri\u2014where they form the three obstructions to the navigability of the Godavari known as the first, second, and third Barriers. On the east bank of the Talper river there is a long, but not lofty, chain of hills of volcanic formation, running north into the Bastar dependency. From this to the south-east extremity of the district the formation is, with few exceptions, entirely volcanic. The country between the hills and the Godavari is generally level, and the soil becomes richer and more productive as the levels fall. At the village of Pinpalli, four miles below Bhadrachallam, there is a hot spring in the bed of the Godavari, which is not, however, in any repute for medicinal or curative properties.\n\nThe principal ranges of hills are the Eastern Ghats, which in the southeastern extremity of the district form the boundary between it and the Madras presidency. At one place in the Rakkapalli taluka they attain a height of 4,048 feet above the level of the sea, and are locally known as the Marmedhi hills. There is a considerable extent of level ground on the top, and water is procurable in several places in ravines about two hundred feet down the mountain side; but there is little or no soil on the summit, the whole being a mass of rock. Moreover, although the ascent is for the greater part easy, these hills are too remote to become ever a place of resort. Those going in search of health or pleasure would be able to reach the sea-coast with ease in the same time that would be required to reach the hills with difficulty, and once the coast is reached, Bangalore and the Nilgiris are within a few days' journey by steamer and railway. Next to the Eastern Ghats in size are the Gadalgutta hills, so named from a bold-scarped mountain forming the end of the range. This chain extends from the Indravati to the Talper\u2014a distance of about seventy miles,\u2014and forms a portion of the boundary of this district and the Bastar dependency. It presents a bold and striking appearance from the valley of the Godavari. In the rainy reason its beauty is increased by several fine waterfalls, which pour over\nits precipitous sides into dark and thickly-wooded ravines. The highest point of the G\u00e1dalgutta range is 3,285 feet above the level of the sea; but there is great difficulty about water, and it is too far from both Dumagudem and Sironch\u00e1 to be of much use. The only other hills of any size or importance are the Sironch\u00e1 hills near Sironch\u00e1, the highest of which is 1,822 feet above the level of the sea. It is only eighteen miles from Sironch\u00e1, and was used as a temporary sanitarium at one time with some success. The want of water on the hill was the greatest drawback to a residence there.\n\nThere are in the district altogether ninety tanks, large and small, which are in a tolerable state of repair, and which give irrigation to 2,651 acres of land. There are also thirty-seven tanks out of repair, and in the forests there are to be found the embankments of many old tanks now overgrown with jungle, the very recollection of which has passed away from the memory of the present generation, but which evidently in former times irrigated a considerable area. There are few wells in the district, and these are only to be found in the larger villages. \"Budkis,\" or temporary wells dug in the beds of watercourses, are more common, but owing to all the streams in which they are constructed, as well as the low lands in their vicinity being flooded by the God\u00e1var\u00ed, the labour of reconstructing them year after year has hitherto proved too great a task for the cultivators of this district, with whom vegetables are not a necessary of life, as they are to more civilised people.\n\nThere are no places deserving of being called towns. Dumagudem\u2014the head-quarters of the God\u00e1var\u00ed navigation works\u2014has a population of about 5,000, but it is a fluctuating one, being composed of labourers employed by the Public Works Department. It will probably much decrease in size on the completion of the works at the first Barrier. Sironch\u00e1\u2014the head-quarters station of the district\u2014comes next, with a population of about 3,500; but the greater portion of this is made up of government servants and establishments. In 1860, when Sironch\u00e1 was selected as the site of the head-quarters, it consisted of a few huts on the river bank, and the total population was under five hundred. Bhadr\u00e1challam is the only other place of note in the district. It has a population of 2,000, and is a tolerably well built village. The R\u00e1n\u00ed of Bhadr\u00e1challam resides here; and the place is famous for an old temple of R\u00e1mchandra, which is supported by an annual endowment of Rs. 13,000 from the Niz\u00e1m's government.\n\nThe climate on the whole is not salubrious. As might be expected in a country the greater portion of which is covered with forest, and with low lands subject to yearly inundations, fever and ague are very prevalent in the months succeeding the rainy season; but the type of fever most common in the district is not considered by the medical authorities as immediately dangerous to life. It is rather from the gradual weakening of the system under its repeated attacks, coupled with the danger of its producing other disorders, that it is regarded as serious. Nevertheless, judging from the healthy appearance of the people generally, and the wretched manner in which they house themselves, the climate may not be so much to blame as is commonly supposed. With proper precautions liability to contract fever becomes much lessened. Above all, no exposure should be undergone between the end of the rainy season and January;\nthis precaution, with a good house, warm clothing, and good food, will go far to ward off fever. As a rule no Europeans or government establishments should move into camp before the first of January; and the police or military should be as little exposed on duty between September and January as can possibly be managed. Dysentery and diarrhoea are common during the early part of the rainy season, and are attributed by the people living on the banks of the river to the impurity of the water at that time. Cholera during the last fifty years has made its appearance six times. Small-pox is one of the scourges of the country, and amongst the infant population its effects are very destructive. A good deal has been done within the past two years in the way of vaccination, and one great difficulty has been got over, viz. the dislike to it, as to any other innovation, by the mass of the people. The temperature is never very extreme, as the lowness of the latitude and the vicinity of the sea prevent excessive cold in the winter months; and the vast extent of forest, and in some degree perhaps the neighbourhood of large rivers, moderate the great heats of summer. In general terms the climate may be called mild and moist. The dews are heavy, and last till late in the season. The nights, even at the hottest time of the year, are cool and pleasant, and the sea-breeze is perceptible in the lower part of the district. The seasons are divided in the same manner as in the rest of Central India. The rainy season commences in June, having been preceded by thunder showers and storms in May. The heavy rains, however, do not set in generally till the early part of July, and last till the beginning of October. The climate from June till the end of September is very damp, close, and warm; the vegetation by August is luxuriant, even rank; and the entire absence of cool breezes renders this season to Europeans the most enervating period of the year. The temperature can only be compared to that of the hot houses for tropical plants in a horticultural garden. From the beginning of November till the middle of February the climate is all that could be wished for\u2014the days are pleasant, the nights not intensely cold, and the atmosphere clear. Occasionally about November or January there is a little rain. In February the sun becomes hot in the middle of the day, and the cool mornings and evenings become less frequent. In March the grass in the forests begins to burn, and the heat increases till what with it and the smoke of the jungle-fires the whole country becomes enveloped in a haze, and the view is restricted to a horizon of three or four miles. This continues till April, when thunder-storms, accompanied by violent winds, become frequent. Generally speaking high winds are uncommon, whatever may be the cause; but the storms in the end of April and May are sometimes such as to cause great damage.

An Extra-Assistant Commissioner is located at Dumagudem, 120 miles lower down the river, owing to the distance of that part of the district from head-quarters, and the presence of large bodies of workmen on the navigation works. There are no Tahsildars or Subordinate Magistrates, and but one of the Zamindars has powers as an Honorary Magistrate. There is also a District Superintendent of Police at head-quarters. The Police force consists of a District Superintendent, an Inspector, three Chief Constables, 13 Head Constables, 105 Constables, and 8 Mounted Constables. Besides this, Sironch\u00e1 is permanently garrisoned by two companies of Madras Native infantry. The postal communication with N\u00e0gp\u00far through Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 on the one hand, and with Madras through Dumagudem and Ellor on the other, is in the hands of the imperial postal department. There are post-offices at Sironch\u00e1 and Dumagudem, and a branch office at Enchampall\u00ed\u2014the site of the navigation works at the second Barrier.\n\nThe ancient history of the district, and indeed of the whole of the adjoining country, is wrapped in obscurity. No old places of note are situated within its limits; it has never been the theatre of war; there are no ruined cities or temples or mosques testifying to former Hind\u00fa or Mohammadan wealth and power, and there are no inscriptions to guide in the search for records of the past. But scattered here and there, in the forests and on the sides of hills, are found the remains of a race before whose antiquity even the ancient Hind\u00fa dynasties of the Peninsula of India must probably give way. These are the monolithic monuments of Indo-Scythic sepulture, consisting of cromlechs, kistvaens, and cairns, which have been found in four of the six talukas of this district. The study of these memorials would carry us so far back into the pre-historic period that it would be out of place here. The only popular tradition attaching to them is that they were the temples of the R\u00e1kshassas\u2014a mythical race, half human, half demon\u2014who are believed, according to the old Hind\u00fa legends, to have once inhabited these parts. The Telinga Br\u00e1hmans claim for this part of the country the honour of its having been visited by R\u00e1ma when wandering in the wilderness. Parnakuti, which is mentioned in the R\u00e1m\u00e1yana as one of his resting-places, is said to be the present Parnas\u00e1l\u00e1, and it was from this place they allege that S\u00edt\u00e1 was carried off by the R\u00e1kshasa R\u00e1wan. A hill on the south bank of the God\u00e1var\u00ed opposite Parnas\u00e1l\u00e1, the Ratabgutt\u00e1 or hill of the car, is so named because it is said the tracks made by the car in which S\u00edt\u00e1 was abducted are still to be seen on the rock on its summit. There is no mention of any ancient separate Gond kingdom in this part of the country, but it is probable that the district at one time or another was included in the territories under the Gond r\u00e1j\u00e1s of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1. Setting all tradition aside, however, it is pretty certain that it must at one time have formed a portion of the dominions of the A'ndhra kings of Telengana, who had their capital first near N\u00e1nder on the God\u00e1var\u00ed, and afterwards removed it to Anamakond\u00e1 and Warangal, both of which places are about ninety miles south of Sironch\u00e1. Farishta* mentions Warangal as having in A.D. 1303 successfully resisted a Mohammadan army sent to reduce it by Ak\u00e1-\n\n---\n\n* Brigge' Farishta (Edn. 1829), vol. i. pp. 353, 371.\nud-d\u00edn Khilj\u00ed, whose first invasion of the Deccan was made nine years before. The comparatively advanced state of civilisation of Warangal and its prosperity at the time of the Mohammadan invasion, which is indicated by the magnificent tanks in that part of the country existing to this day, would lead to the belief that the kingdom of Telengana must have been founded at a very early date; but its authentic history does not commence until the eleventh century, with the dynasty of the K\u00e1k\u00e1taya r\u00e1j\u00e1s of Warangal. Prat\u00e1pa Rudra Deva, the fourth prince of this dynasty, was subjugated by the Mohammadan power about A.D. 1323, and carried prisoner to Delhi. He is said to have recovered his liberty, and some accounts describe the accession of both his sons, but he was the last known r\u00e1j\u00e1 of his line, and shortly afterwards Warangal was occupied by the Kutab Sh\u00e1hi kings, and merged into the Mohammadan principality of Gowalkond\u00e1.* It is said that about the time of the invasion of Warangal the Hasan\u00e1b\u00e1d Sankargiri zam\u00ednd\u00e1ri\u2014of which Bhadr\u00e1challam and R\u00e1k\u00e1palli are portions\u2014was given by the representative of the Emperor of Delhi in free j\u00e1g\u00e9r to one An\u00e1p\u00e1 Aswa R\u00e1o, the founder of the family which now holds it. Unfortunately the copper plate on which the grant was inscribed, with the title-deeds and other ancient family papers of this old estate, were lost in A.D. 1769, when Zafar-ud-daula\u2014an officer of the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s government\u2014attacked one of the Aswa R\u00e1os and put him to death. From A.D. 1324 to 1698 there is a blank in the local history. The R\u00e1n\u00ed of Bhadr\u00e1challam can trace her ancestors up to An\u00e1p\u00e1 Aswa R\u00e1o, it is true, but there are no authentic records beyond those relating to the genealogy of the family. It is probable that during this time the district, with a considerable tract of country on the right bank, was held by petty chiefs who paid tribute to their Mohammadan rulers.\n\nThe more modern history has barely even a local interest. The district consisted, as has already been said, of the estates of two great families, whose members were continually quarrelling amongst each other, and who occasionally revolted against the government of the Niz\u00e1m. Except for the disturbances thus created, and one or two inroads of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s in the days when Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 was held by a younger branch of the Bhonsl\u00e1 rulers of N\u00e1gpur, there would be nothing to record but that the district continued to remain part of the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s territories until it was ceded to the British Government in 1860. Since then armed affrays, cattle-lifting forays, and petty revolts have ceased, and the presence of a strong local authority makes redress available where it was once sought for in vain. Formerly if any of the petty local chiefs plundered villages in Bastar, the aggrieved parties had to complain through their r\u00e1j\u00e1, who lived at Jagdalp\u00far, two hundred miles distant. He brought the circumstances to the notice of the Deputy Commissioner of R\u00e1jp\u00far, who reported it to the Commissioner of N\u00e1gpur, who again had to address the Resident at Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d. Orders would then be issued through the Minister to the local authorities calling for explanations, which they probably had much difficulty in obtaining, as the petty chiefs did not hesitate to defy both their feudal superiors and the officers of the government. Under these circumstances the injured villagers usually preferred taking the law into their own hands, and order was unknown. Although the population is not even yet very rich or flourishing, they are now free to divert their energies into profitable channels, and during the last eight years both trade and cultivation have increased.\n\n* Wilson\u2019s Mackenzie Collection, Introduction, pp. cxiii. ff.\nThe population of 54,680 souls, which is distributed equally over the total area of the district, gives an average of twenty-eight souls to the square mile, and not only is the rate low, but nearly half the population is composed of wild tribes. The exclusively agricultural classes number 30,367, and consist chiefly of the following castes:\u2014Yelm\u00e1s, Kamew\u00e1rs, Arew\u00e1rs, Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, Telingas, Kofs, and Got\u00e9s. Of these, the Yelm\u00e1s, though S\u00fadras, enjoy a good deal of consideration, as many of the chiefs\u2014among them the Sardesmukhs of the four upper talukas and the R\u00e1n\u00ed of Bhadr\u00e1chalam\u2014are of this caste. The Yelm\u00e1s veil their women, and do not permit them to appear in public; and the men in the lower part of the district carry their prejudices to such an extent, that even the poorer members of the caste will not put their hand to the plough. The inferior castes, all plying their respective professions, and many of them cultivating land as well, are\u2014\n\nWadd\u00eds.\nKumbh\u00e1rs, or potters.\nMeriw\u00e1rs, or tailors.\nBaljw\u00e1rs, or bangle-makers.\nTell\u00eds, or oil-pressers.\nRangrez, or dyers; also work as embroiderers.\nDendraw\u00e1r, or tasar silk-weavers.\nDhob\u00eds, or washermen. These are a very numerous class. Besides washing they perform many menial duties in the village\u2014attend on travellers, carry torches, fetch water, carry loads and palanquins, &c.\n\nJul\u00e1\u00eds, or weavers.\nKal\u00e1\u00eds, or distillers and spirit-dealers.\nDh\u00edmars or Bho\u00eds. These are fishermen by profession. They also carry palanquins, fetch water, and do other menial duties.\nHaj\u00e1ms, or barbers; also carry torches for travellers.\nMedariw\u00e1rs, or mat-makers.\nUppariw\u00e1rs, or tank-diggers and stonecutters. There are two different subdivisions of this class.\nWoddew\u00e1rs, or boatmen and fishermen.\n\nThe outcastes are Sunkariw\u00e1rs, Mannepuw\u00e1rs, and Netk\u00e1niw\u00e1rs. The latter weave a coarse cotton-cloth. Got\u00e9s and Kofs, or as they are commonly called Got\u00e9w\u00e1rs and Koiw\u00e1rs\u2014the termination \u201cw\u00e1r\u201d being a Telugu affix, signifying person or man\u2014are the aborigines of the country. Although almost identical in customs and in language, they do not eat together or intermarry, the Kofs claiming superiority over the Got\u00e9s. The proper name for the Kofs is \u201cKoitor,\u201d and this is what they call themselves.* By the Telingas they are called Koidhoras, the word \u201cdhora\u201d meaning gentleman or s\u00e1hib. This error has probably arisen from the last syllable of \u201cKoitor\u201d having been taken for \u201cdhora,\u201d owing to the similarity of sound. The Kofs, where they come into contact with the Telinga population, have adopted many of their customs, and have thereby to a certain extent lost their peculiarity of appearance and character. The Got\u00e9 keeps more aloof from civilisation; but if allowance be made for what the Kofs have learned by their intercourse with the Telingas, the customs of the two races are very similar, and both belong to the Gond family. They are subdivided into many sects according to the number of gods they worship, and they practise what seems to be the essential characteristic of all Gonds, viz. ancestor worship. Like most of these wild tribes, they are timid, inoffensive, and tolerably truthful. Their restless habits, however, do not admit of their settling down as good agriculturists, and generally speaking they move from one spot to another once in every three or four years; but on the banks of the Sabar\u00ed, and\n\n* Vide Hislop\u2019s \u201cAboriginal Tribes,\u201d part 1, p. 4.\nin the neighbourhood of Sironch\u00e1 and Dumagudem, there are numbers of them who have settled down, and have accumulated some wealth in flocks, in herds, and in money. It seems that where they can cultivate rice they will sometimes become attached to the soil, especially if a grove of palmyras be near, as, like all Gonds, they are fond of spirits, and the fermented juice of the palmyra (borassus flabelliformis) is a favourite beverage with them.\n\nThe language of the whole district is Telugu\u2014harsh and barbarous in the four northern talukas, softer and more like the Coast dialects in Bhadrachallam and R\u00e1k\u00e1pall\u00ed. In the northern parts of the Sironch\u00e1 taluka a little Mar\u00e1th\u00ed is spoken. The wild tribes have their own language and dialects.\n\nProducts and manufactures.

The cultivation of tobacco might be much increased, especially on the islands in the God\u00e1v\u00e1ri. The famous \"Lank\u00e1\" tobacco is grown on islands in the Delta of the God\u00e1v\u00e1ri. |\n| Papaver somniferum | Opium                                    | Nalla mandu | Do.                  | Scarce. |\n| Gossypium indicum | Cotton (2 varieties)                     | D\u00fadi       | Khar\u00edf and rabi, but chiefly the latter. | The khar\u00edf crop is only grown in plots around villages; no cotton is exported from the district. |\n| Hibiscus cannabinus | Hemp                                     | Gogu n\u00e1r\u00e1  | Rabi.                | Grows well. |\n| Crotalaria juncea | San                                      | Jampa n\u00e1ra | Khar\u00edf               | Do.     |\n| Ricinus communis | Castor-oil plant                         | Amid\u00e1l\u00fa    | Khar\u00edf and rabi.    | Do.     |\n| Sesamum indicum | Gingelly seed (3 varieties, white, red, and black.) | Nuwwulu   | Do.                  | Do.     |\n\n*N.B.\u2014The khar\u00edf or spring crops are generally sown early in July, and reaped in the end of November. The rabi or autumn crops are generally sown in September, and reaped in the end of February.*\n\nBesides the above cultivated vegetable products, there are pumpkins, cucumbers, bhendi, tur\u00e1i, and several other vegetables grown in the rainy season. But English vegetables do not thrive at that season. In the cold weather pumpkins, egg-plant, bhendi, tur\u00e1i, red pepper, radishes, sweet potatoes, onions, garlic, ginger, turmeric, ajaw\u00e1n (*ptychotis ajowan*), and dhaniy\u00e1 (*coriandrum sativum*), with most English vegetables, do well. The Telengas,\nhowever, do not cultivate vegetables so much as the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s or Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed\u015b, and it is only in the neighbourhood of the larger villages that vegetables are regularly to be had. Fruit trees, such as mango and plantain, are also scarce. The jack-fruit is indigenous in those parts of R\u00e1k\u00e1pall\u00ed bordering on the Eastern Gh\u00e1ts. The finer varieties of fruit, such as oranges, limes, guaves, &c., are only to be found at Sironch\u00e1 and Bhadr\u00e1challam. The Sangtara oranges of Sironch\u00e1, introduced from N\u00e1gpur, are very large and fine.\n\nThe following is a list of trees and forest produce:\n\n| Botanical name          | Common English or Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed\u015b designation | Telugu name | Remarks |\n|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------|---------|\n| Tectona grandis         | Teak                                     | Teku        | Teak grows well throughout the district. |\n| Terminalia tomentosa    | S\u00e9j                                      | Nalla maddi | Plentiful, and of large size, especially in Sironch\u00e1; good timber. |\n| Dalbergia latifolia     | Blackwood                                | Jitreg\u00ed     | Good timber; plentiful in all parts of the district. |\n| Diospyros melanoxylon   | Ebony                                    | Tunaki      | Do. do. |\n| Pentaptera arjuna       | Kaw\u00e1                                     | Yer maddi   | Do. do. |\n| Pterocarpus marsupium   | Bijes\u00e1l                                  | Peddegi     | Do. do. yields fine gum. |\n| Hardwickia binata       | Anjan                                    | Narwepa     | Do. bark yields a good fibre, which is in common use for ropes, &c. |\n| Chloroxylon swietenia   | Satinwood                                | Bilugu      | Good wood; yields a yellow dye. |\n| Acacia sundra           |                                          | Darisanch\u00e1i | Good wood; plentiful in all parts of the district. |\n| Do. arabica             | B\u00e1bul                                   | Tumma       | Scarce. |\n| Do. catechu             | Khair                                    |             | Plentiful. |\n| Soymida febrifuga       | Rohan                                    | S\u00e1mi        | Good timber, and plentiful in all parts of the district. |\n| Cordia angustifolia     | Gond\u00ed                                    | Chinna bateku | Timber useful. |\n| Do. myxa                |                                          | Pedda bateku | Do. |\n| Conocarpus latifolia    | Dh\u00e1ur\u00e1                                   | Tirman      | Tough wood; used for cart axles; plentiful. |\n| Nauclea cordifolia      | Kadam\u00ed                                   | Paspu kandi | Timber useful. |\n| Do. parviflora          | Do.                                      | Buta kandi  | Do. |\n| Guatteria cerasoides    | Do.                                      | Chilka d\u00f3di | Used for building. |\n| Cluytia collina         |                                          | Kors\u00e9       | Good timber; grows on Eastern Gh\u00e1ts, R\u00e1k\u00e1pall\u00ed t\u00e1luka. |\n| Artocarpus integrifolia | Jackwood                                 | Panas       | Plentiful in the upper t\u00e1lukas; timber good; flowers an article of food, and also used to distil spirits from; seeds yield a useful oil; export of seeds might be largely increased. |\n| Bassia latifolia        | Mhowa                                    | Ippa        | Good timber; scarce. |\n| Mangifera indica        | Mango                                    | M\u00e1miri      | Do. do. |\n| Syzygium jambolanum     | J\u00e1mbul                                   | Neradu      | Wood useless; yields a good gum. |\n| Sterculia urens         |                                          | Taus\u00ed       | Yields the resin olibanum; plentiful. |\n| Boswellia thurifera     |                                          | A'ndu       | |\n\nUP 503\n| Botanical name          | Common English or Hindustani designation | Telugu name | Remarks |\n|------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------|---------|\n| Butea frondosa         | P\u00e1l\u00e1s                                    | Motuku      | Plentiful; yields kino; the flowers make a yellow and orange dye. |\n| Do. superba            | Do.                                      | Do.         | Do. do. |\n| Terminalia bellerica   | Hard\u00e1                                    | Tann\u00ed       | Yields the Hard\u00e1s of commerce; also galls, from which dyes are made. |\n| Do. chebula            | Kusam                                    | Karakk\u00e1ya   |         |\n| Schleichera trijuga    | A'k                                      | Jilleru     | The charcoal of the wood used in making gunpowder; bark yields a fibre. |\n| Calotropis gigantea    | Buddadarmi                               |             | Bark made into slow-match.

In the vicinity of the rivers the \"andropogon muricatus,\" the roots of which are used to make \"khaskhas\" tattis, is a nuisance to the cultivators, as it grows on the richest soils, and is very difficult to eradicate. The \"k\u00e1ns\" (saccharum spontaneum) is not so abundant. The \"gulm\u00ed,\" or what is known as the \"kusa\" grass, grows in irrigated land, and is very troublesome in the rice-fields.\n\nAmong miscellaneous products may be mentioned honey, lac, silk, hides, and wild arrowroot. Five different sorts of honey are produced, viz.\u20141, kar\u00e1 tena; 2, musar tena; 3, tond\u00ed tena; 4, pitw\u00e1r tena; 5, k\u00e1n\u00e1gol tena (\"tena\" in Telugu means honey). Nos. 1 and 5 are the most delicate; the wax of both varieties is also good; the former is found in bushes and small trees, the latter in holes in the trunks of trees. The k\u00e1n\u00e1gol honey is scarce. The combs of both are removed by the hand; the bees do not sting. No. 2 is found in holes in trees; the wax is good. No. 3 is found in holes in the ground, white-ant hills, &c.; the wax is good. No. 4: this is the honey of the large bee; it is found suspended in large combs from lofty trees and rocks; the bee is dangerous if disturbed. Honey is not exported, but the wax is collected by Got\u00e9s and Ko\u00eds, and sold or bartered to traders, &c. Turmeric is sometimes used to give a yellow colour to the wax. Lac is produced in abundance in all parts of the district. It is gathered by the Got\u00e9s and Ko\u00eds and brought in for sale or barter to traders, &c. Lac is deposited on the *butea frondosa*, *butea superba*, *inga xylocarpa*, and *zizyphus jujuba*, but that on the first three kinds is considered the finest; it is deposited in September, and also in April and May. Most of it is exported to the Coast and to Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, but a small quantity is used in the district for dyeing tasar-silk and cotton-thread, and also to make into wax. Buffalo and cow horns and hides are not collected or exported in any quantity, owing, it is said, to there being no tanners in the district to prepare the skins. A few deer horns and skins are exported, and the skins of the common kingfisher (kilkili) are sometimes collected and sent to Burma. The collectors go as far as Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 for them. \"Taufir or Tkh\u00far\" is a description of arrowroot made from the bulb of the *curcuma angustifolia*, which grows abundantly in the district. It is collected by the Got\u00e9s and Ko\u00eds, and rubbed down on a stone, washed, and allowed to settle. It is then dried, and either sold or bartered by them to traders. The \"Taufir\" purchased in the b\u00e1z\u00e1r is impure and difficult to refine, as the bulb is not pared before it is grated down. If care be taken, the flour can be made as pure as that prepared from garden arrowroot. It is strange that this root is not made so much use of as it might be, either as an article of food, or even as starch for export. The culture of the common tasar silkworm is carried on by many classes of the people. The cocoons are gathered in the month of October, and sold to the weavers, &c. There is considerable risk attending the culture of the silkworm: a shower of rain will destroy the labour of two or three months; but in a good season one man can earn twenty rupees in this way.\n\nIron-ore of very fair quality and easily worked is found throughout the district in large quantities. It is rudely smelted by the Ko\u00eds; it requires, however, to be smelted over again and refined before it can be used. Titaniferous iron-ore is found in\nthe sands of most of the streams, and hematite is to be found in many parts. As far back as 1841 the late Dr. Walker reported on the existence of a coal measure at Kot\u00e1, about eight miles north of Sironch\u00e1 on the bank of the river Pranhita. Boring operations were undertaken by the same gentleman in 1848 in the river-bed at Kot\u00e1; but a depth of only thirty-five feet had been attained, when it was necessary to stop the work, owing to a sudden rise in the river. The result of the analysis of the specimens of coal then obtained was as under:\n\n- Volatile matter ........................................... 29 percent.\n- Ash .......................................................... 29 \"\n- Carbon ...................................................... 42 \"\n\nDr. Falconer, Superintendent of the Botanical Gardens, Calcutta, to whom the specimens were sent for examination, reported unfavourably on them, and subsequent accounts have not been more encouraging.\n\nGold is found in the bed of the God\u00e1var\u00ed nearly opposite the village of Marrigudem in the Nugur taluka. It is washed by Sonjharis\u2014a poor class of people who come periodically for the purpose. They commence washing in August and September, or whenever the river falls enough to expose certain gravel banks, in which the precious metal is found in very minute grains. The gold is said to be worth Rs. 16 the tol\u00e1; but the work is barely remunerative. A small stream falls into the God\u00e1var\u00ed here on the right or Niz\u00e1m's bank, and it is just at its mouth that the gravel beds alluded to are. Gold is also washed at the point where the Kinaras\u00e1ni n\u00e1l\u00e1 falls into the God\u00e1var\u00ed, a little below Bhadr\u00e1challam. Garnets are found near Bhadr\u00e1challam and in the river-bed, but they are poor and full of flaws. The best are found in considerable quantities on the right bank of the God\u00e1var\u00ed, and some distance in the interior in the Garibpeth hills near P\u00e1lonch\u00e1. They are exported in large quantities from that neighbourhood. They are first pounded up with an iron pestle, by which process the refuse is broken off, and the garnets are then selected and sent to Madras, where they are made into ornaments. The selling price at P\u00e1lonch\u00e1 is two seers per rupee (sixpence a pound). Sapphires and amethysts are also found in the neighbourhood. Rock-crystal is found very pure in the Bhadr\u00e1challam and R\u00e1k\u00e1pal\u00ed talukas. Variegated sandstones and clays exist in large quantities in the upper part of the district. There is also a yellow sandstone near Duma-gudem which has been used on the navigation works; and lastly \"kurand,\" a kind of whetstone, is found in many parts of the district, especially near Bhadr\u00e1challam. It is used by armourers for polishing and sharpening swords and daggers.\n\nThe breed of horses and ponies in the district and in the neighbouring country is exceedingly poor. None of the zam\u00edn-d\u00e1rs have good horses, nor do they attempt to improve the breed. The dense jungle with which the country is covered renders it difficult to use horses, and this is probably the reason why no interest is taken in the matter. The cattle are of a small breed; but as there is good grazing for them, they are generally plump and sleek. Endeavours have been made to improve the breed by importing bulls from the Nellore and Kishn\u00e1 districts of the Madras presidency. The total number of cattle in the district is computed at 10,262 buffaloes, and 38,281 bullocks and cows; and the chief wealth of many of the inhabitants consists in their herds. Male buffaloes are exported to the Coast districts, where they are used in ploughing the rice-fields. In 1865-67 Rs. 8,175 worth of cattle were so\nexported. The sheep of the district about Sironch\u00e1 and of the adjoining parts of the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s territories are considered to be of a superior breed. They are rather small in the lower part of the district. They are not as yet exported in the direction of either N\u00e1gpur or Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d. There are also some fine varieties of fowls, and game-fowls are reared with great care.\n\nTigers and panthers are by no means so numerous as would be supposed in a wild district like this. The fact is that the jungle is too extensive. The tiger prefers to lurk in patches of jungle, wooded ravines, and hill-sides in the neighbourhood of villages in more cultivated tracts, where he can prey on the village cattle. Bears are numerous in the three lower talukas, but wolves are scarce, if indeed there are any. Wild buffaloes are rare, being only found in the Sironch\u00e1 taluka, although they abound towards the north-east in the valley of the Indravat\u00ed. It is generally believed that they are not found south of the God\u00e1var\u00ed. The bulls frequently follow the herds of tame buffaloes, and there are instances known of their having bred with the domesticated cow-buffaloes. Bison are found in Sironch\u00e1, A\u2019lb\u00e1k\u00e1, Charl\u00e1, and R\u00e1k\u00e1pall\u00ed. S\u00e1mb\u00e1r, nilg\u00e1i, spotted-deer, and jungle-sheep are found in all parts of the district. Wild-duck and snipe are scarce; the s\u00e1ras is to be found about most of the tanks; and the kulang, flying in long columns from the north, pays its annual visit each December. Quail, partridge, pea-fowl, and jungle-fowl abound.\n\nThe rivers abound with fish of many varieties. The \u201cm\u00e1has\u00edr\u201d is said to frequent the Indravat\u00ed and Sabari, and the roh\u00fa is common. The largest fish are killed with the hook. The Dh\u00edmars in many villages have large drag-nets with which they catch quantities of fish; but the people in the neighbourhood of the river do not use fish as an article of food so much as they might do. Prawns are found in considerable numbers in the hot season. Alligators frequent all the large rivers, and also all tanks in the neighbourhood of the rivers. They are very troublesome, though they are not so dangerous as they might be if they were courageous. The tanks contain maral, eels, and other good eatable fish.\n\nThere are as yet no regular roads, but the cart-track from village to village along the left bank of the God\u00e1var\u00ed, between Sironch\u00e1 and Dumagudem, is kept clear. There is no traffic along this route however, except in the vicinity of the places above named, and it is only useful as the line of communication between the headquarters of the Deputy Commissioner and the lower part of the district, and for police, postal, and other purposes. The God\u00e1var\u00ed is the highway which will ultimately bring wealth and prosperity to the district when the works now in progress at the First and Second Barriers are completed. This river extends along the entire length of the district, except for about twenty-five miles, which is bounded by the Pranh\u00edt\u00e1. As, however, the navigation scheme leaves the God\u00e1var\u00ed at its confluence with the Pranh\u00edt\u00e1 and proceeds up the latter river, it follows that the district will have the navigable stream as its western boundary along its entire length of two hundred and fifteen miles. The south-eastern limit of the district\u2014where it borders on the Madras presidency at the gorge in the Eastern Gh\u00e1ts, through which the God\u00e1var\u00ed flows\u2014is only eighty miles from the sea. About seventy miles above this, and one hundred and forty-eight from the sea, is the First Barrier, the works at which are nearly completed. This difficulty surmounted, the navigation will be open from the sea to\nthe foot of the Second Barrier\u2014a distance of two hundred and twenty miles. The interruption to the water communication here extends for about fifteen miles, and at present is only got over by a land journey of the same length. The completion of the Second Barrier works will give a distance of ninety miles further, and a total waterway of three hundred miles from the Bay of Bengal into the heart of the country.\n\nCommunication from place to place in the upper part of the district is kept up by means of small carts of the N\u00e1gp\u00far pattern, and capable of carrying about twelve maunds. In the lower part of the district, especially in Bhadr\u00e1challam and R\u00e1k\u00e1palli, there are no carts at all, and everything is carried by \"k\u00e1wari.\"* The want of wheeled carriage must put the people to great inconvenience sometimes, but nevertheless endeavours made hitherto to induce them to construct carts have not been successful; and while in the upper talukas the poorest cultivator travels in his cart with his wife and children when going any distance, in Bhadr\u00e1challam and R\u00e1k\u00e1palli well-dressed and well-to-do men and women have to trudge on foot; and it is not an uncommon sight in that part of the country to meet the father of a family with his child slung at one end of the \"k\u00e1wari\" stick, balanced by a bag of rice at the other. As yet there is no traffic or regular communication on the river by boats or canoes, except below the First Barrier; and even between that and the Coast the greater portion of the traffic consists of boats employed in bringing up engineers' stores, grain, and other supplies for the Public Works Department at the First Barrier navigation works. At present the rates of water carriage are ten rupees for the khandi of 1,600 lbs. between Raj\u00e1mandr\u00ed and Bhadr\u00e1challam; and the largest boats are capable of carrying about ten khandis.\n\nThe trade of the district is as yet in its infancy. The same arrangements exist here as in other districts of these Provinces for the registry of all important exports, but owing to the long line of frontier towards the Niz\u00e1m's territories, it is not so easy to obtain accurate returns of all that passes to and fro in this direction. The trade with the Coast districts being partly by the river and partly by one line of road, is registered with accuracy. The value of the Import and Export trade for the year 1868-69, compared with that for 1863-64, is as follows:\n\n| Years | Imports | Exports |\n|-------|---------|---------|\n|       | Rs.     | Rs.     |\n| 1863-64 | 95,213 | 49,818 |\n| 1868-69 | 35,469 | 32,469 |\n\nThe falling off is due partly to the completion of the works at the First Barrier, and to the concentration of the workpeople further up the river at the Second Barrier, where supplies are brought from the Niz\u00e1m's country and Bastar, instead of, as before, from the districts of the Delta. That the district will ultimately benefit largely by being placed within easy communication with\n\n* Two baskets slung at the ends of a pole which is carried on the shoulder.\nthe Coast is a matter of certainty; but the valley of the God\u00e1var\u00ed is so sparsely populated, the people are so backward and indolent and have so few wants, that both the trade by the river, and the material prosperity of the population on its banks, will take somewhat longer to reach a very high point than is generally anticipated.\n\nUPRORA'\u2014A wild zamind\u00e1ri estate lying on the northern hills of the Bil\u00e1sp\u00far district. It covers an area of 431 square miles, and possesses thirty-nine villages. The cultivated area, which is entirely in the valleys, amounts to 7,233 acres, and the land capable of cultivation is about 60,000 acres. The total population is 2,589, giving a rate of only six persons to the square mile. Wild elephants are found here.\n\nUSKA'L\u2014A stream in the B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t district, which rises in the hills to the north of the Hatt\u00e1 pargana, flows north, and eventually falls into the N\u00e1hr\u00e1.\n\nUTTAL or BESI.\u2014An estate attached to the Sambalp\u00far district. It was originally a Gond chiefship, but about fifty years ago R\u00e1j\u00e1 Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j Sah\u00ed of Sambalp\u00far, with the consent of the British Government, conferred it on one Gop\u00ed Kolt\u00e1. It is situated about fifty miles south-south-west of the town of Sambalp\u00far, and consists of some twenty-eight villages. Its area may be about eighty square miles. All the culturable land has been brought under cultivation. The population is computed at 10,696 souls, chiefly belonging to the Kolt\u00e1, S\u00e1onr\u00e1, and Binjal (Binjw\u00e1r) castes. Rice, the pulses, sugarcane, cotton, and oil-seeds are the chief products. The principal town is Bij\u00e1pur, which has a population of 3,711. There is a remarkably fine tank there, also a good school-house, where about a hundred pupils are receiving instruction, and there are several other schools in the surrounding villages. The present chief, Mrityunjaya Garhoti\u00e1, is the fourth of his line; he is about twenty-five years of age, reads and writes Uriya, is intelligent and well-disposed, and has given great assistance in popularising education.\n\nV\n\nVAGARPETH\u2014A hill in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, situated nine miles north-east of Ner\u00ed. Good iron-ore is quarried from it.\n\nVA'GHNAKH\u2014A village in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, situated six miles north of M\u00e1ndher\u00ed. It is surrounded by fine groves, and possesses an ancient temple, now falling into ruin. During the ravages of the Pindh\u00e1r\u00eds the wife of one of these robbers was concealed for months in a chamber in the dome, and there gave birth to a child.\n\nVIJAPUR\u2014An estate in the Bastar dependency, with an area of 170 square miles and 250 villages. The chief village is Vij\u00e1pur. The central and western portions are pretty well populated by Ko\u00eds and Telingas.\n\nVINJHA'SANI' HILL\u2014See \"Bh\u00e1ndak.\"\n\nW\n\nWA'IGA'ON\u2014A town in the Huz\u00far tahsil of the Wardh\u00e1 district, eight miles south of Wardh\u00e1, on the Wardh\u00e1 valley road. It contains 2,257 inhabitants, principally cultivators of the Teli and Kunb\u00ed castes, with a few weavers.\nUnder the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 rule W\u00e1ig\u00e1on was the head-quarters of the Kam\u00e1visd\u00e1r in charge of the Andor\u00ed pargana. The town is built on the top of a stony slope, and in the hot season, when the three tanks in the outskirts dry up, the people are much straitened for water. A branch-road has been laid out from W\u00e1ig\u00e1on to connect the Wardh\u00e1 station and the Wardh\u00e1 valley road. An annual fair is held here during the Dasar\u00e1 holidays, in honour of the god B\u00e1l\u00e9j\u00ed, to whom there is an old temple of considerable local repute in the town. A good-sized sar\u00e1i has been erected here, and the village-school, recently opened, is getting on well.\n\nWAINGANG\u00c1\u2014A river which rises in the Seoni district a few miles to the east of the N\u00e1gp\u00far and Jabalp\u00far road, near the Kura\u00ed Gh\u00e1t. For a short distance it flows in a north-westerly direction; then, turning to the north, it skirts the west of the Seoni district, and not far to the west of Chhapar\u00e1, where it is crossed by a fine bridge with twelve arches of fifty feet span, it turns again and flows towards the east up to its junction with the Th\u00e1nwar. At this point it changes its course to the south, and after passing through a mountain gorge, enters the open country known as the Valley of the Waingang\u00e1. For about sixty miles it flows nearly due south, forming the boundary between the Seoni and B\u00e1lagh\u00e1t district; it is then joined by the B\u00e1gh, and flows in a south-westerly direction through the Bhand\u00e1ra district. A few miles to the south of the town from which the district takes its name, it is joined by its main tributary the Kanh\u00e1n; then turning again towards the south-east it traverses the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, until at a point about thirty miles to the south-east of the town of Ch\u00e1n-d\u00e1 it unites with the Wardh\u00e1, and forms the river known as the Pranh\u00edt\u00e1. At the junction of these two rivers (Waingang\u00e1 and Wardh\u00e1) commences that mass of rocks which is known as the Third Barrier of the God\u00e1var\u00ed. The Waingang\u00e1 is navigable during the rains for about one hundred miles above the junction with the Kanh\u00e1n. Its greatest breadth is about three hundred yards. Its length to its junction with the Wardh\u00e1 is about three hundred and fifty miles. Its principal affluents, besides those already mentioned, are the B\u00e1wanthar\u00ed, the B\u00e1gh, the Chulban, the G\u00e1r\u00fa, the Khobr\u00e1garh\u00ed, the K\u00e1men, the Potpur\u00ed, the Kur\u00far, the Botw\u00e1ri, and the Andh\u00e1ri.\n\nWATIPHAL\u2014A large agricultural village in the Wardh\u00e1 district, on the old N\u00e1gp\u00far and Bombay road, about twelve miles to the west of Wardh\u00e1. It contains the ruins of three forts, having passed, since its foundation two hundred years ago, through the hands of three different families, each of which erected its own stronghold. The population amounts to 1,464 souls. There is a school here.\n\nWAIR\u00c1GARH\u2014The eastern pargana of the Brahmapur\u00ed tahsil in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district. It is bounded on the north by the Bhand\u00e1ra and R\u00e1ip\u00far districts, on the east by the R\u00e1ip\u00far district and Bastar, on the south by the Ambgaon pargana and zamind\u00e1ris, and on the west by the Waingang\u00e1. It has an area of about 1,960 square miles; and contains 116 kh\u00e1lsa villages and 16 zamind\u00e1ris. The G\u00e1rhv\u00ed river joins the Waingang\u00e1 at its north-western corner, and the Khobr\u00e1garh\u00ed with its tributaries intersects it from east to west. The country is very hilly, especially in the east, and for the most part covered with dense forest. The soil is generally sandy or red, producing mostly rice. The chief agricultural classes are the Gonds and the Khair\u00e9 Kunbis; and the languages spoken are Mar\u00e1th\u00ed, Gond\u00ed, and Hind\u00ed. The most important towns are Armori and Wair\u00e1garh.\nThe pargana was formerly governed by a line of M\u00e1n\u00e1 chiefs, who subsequently were conquered by the Gonds, and a house of that race then held Wair\u00e1gahr, Garhbor\u00ed, and R\u00e1jgarh in subordination to the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 kings.\n\n**WAI\u2019RA\u2019GARH**\u2014A town in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, situated eighty miles north-east of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 at the confluence of the Khobr\u00e1garh\u00ed and Tep\u00e1garh\u00ed. It is a place of great antiquity, and according to tradition was founded in the Dv\u00e1p\u00e1r Yuga by a king of the family of the Moon, who called it Wair\u00e1gahr, after his own name Wairochan. On approaching historic times we find the city ruled by M\u00e1n\u00e1 chiefs, who about the ninth century fell before the Gonds, and a line of Gond princes then succeeded, holding, in subjection to the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 kings, the parganas of Garhbor\u00ed, R\u00e1jgarh, and Wair\u00e1gahr with its dependent chiefships. The present fort, which is a large stone building in good repair, was erected about the beginning of the seventeenth century. The town now contains 936 houses, and is enclosed by noble groves of ancient trees, while around sweeps the forest, and in the centre tower the walls and bastions of the lofty fortress, forming in all a most striking picture. Within the fort walls is the tomb of Durga Sh\u00e1h, a Gond prince; and not far distant sleeps an unknown English girl, the daughter, it is said, of the officer who commanded the garrison between 1818 and 1830 A.D.\n\nThe surrounding forest contains numerous foundations of former buildings; and in the vicinity of the town are several ancient temples, the most interesting of which are one dedicated to Mah\u00e1k\u00e1l\u00ed, and one sacred to Mah\u00e1deva. In front of the former flows a deep reach of the Khobr\u00e1garh\u00ed, and in this reach, buried in the sand, is supposed to stand an old-world temple.\n\nWair\u00e1gahr is very unhealthy during the autumn and early winter months, and its trade has consequently been almost wholly diverted to the neighbouring town of Arm\u00f3r\u00ed; but the zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs of the north and north-east still look upon it as their capital, and many of the surrounding landholders have residences here. Good sandstone and granite are obtained near the town; and mines of diamonds and rubies were formerly worked in the vicinity. The town contains government schools for boys and girls, a district post-office, a police station-house, and the office of a patrol of customs.\n\n**WA\u2019KORI**\u2014A small town in the N\u00e1gp\u00far district, situated on the Kanh\u00e1n, about eighteen miles north of N\u00e1gp\u00far. The population amounts to 2,759 souls. The place is said to be very old. A school-house has recently been erected here.\n\n**WANA\u2019**\u2014A tributary of the Wardh\u00e1. It has its sources some sixteen miles south of N\u00e1gp\u00far, and after flowing by Bor\u00ed, where it is spanned by a railway viaduct, receives the Bor and Dh\u00e1m, a little above the town of M\u00e1ndg\u00e1on in the Wardh\u00e1 district, and joins the Wardh\u00e1 near S\u00e1ong\u00ed at the southern extremity of the Wardh\u00e1 district.\n\n**WA\u2019RA\u2019-SEONI\u2019**\u2014A flourishing market village in the Seoni district, situated about forty miles to the south-east of Seoni. Native cloth is manufactured here in some quantity. There are here a police station and a village school. The population amounts to 731 souls.\n\n**WARDHA\u2019**\u2014A river which rises in the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1 hills between N\u00e1gp\u00far and Bet\u00fal, some seventy miles north-west of the former, and flows south-east, separating the N\u00e1gp\u00far, Wardh\u00e1, and Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 districts of the Central Provinces from\nthe Ber\u00e1rs and the Niz\u00e1m's dominions. Its first great affluent is the Paingang\u00e1, which it receives on the Niz\u00e1m's, or right bank, about one hundred and ninety miles from its source; sixty-four miles lower down (a little above Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1) it joins the Waingang\u00e1, and the united stream, thenceforward known as the Pranh\u00edt\u00e1, flows on in the same direction to join the God\u00e1var\u00ed at Sironch\u00e1. It is at the junction of the Wardh\u00e1 with the Waingang\u00e1 that the great obstacle to the God\u00e1var\u00ed navigation scheme, known as \"the Third Barrier,\" occurs. The bed of the Wardh\u00e1 is throughout rocky and deep. In the monsoon it becomes a furious torrent, and carries a considerable body of water. The railway bridge which crosses it at Pulg\u00e9on is of iron, and consists of fourteen sixty-foot girders, resting on masonry piers. In the hot months, however, the stream is everywhere fordable.\n\nThe valley of the Wardh\u00e1 is a rich tract of country, lying between the river and a range of hills, which, receding as the Wardh\u00e1 district is entered, leave a considerable open space, which widens gradually to the south. This tract of country contains many flourishing towns and villages, and is celebrated for its cotton. Coal has also lately been discovered at several points, especially at Ghug\u00fas, and both the quantity and quality of the mineral may be considered promising.\n\nThe banks of the river are in several places picturesquely crowned by small temples and tombs, and numerous ruined forts in the background recall the wild period through which the district has now fortunately passed. The sacred Kaundalp\u00far (Dewalw\u00e1r\u00e1) is the place of most interest on the river. It is believed to represent the site of a buried city, celebrated in the Bhagvat G\u00edt\u00e1 as the metropolis of the kingdom of Vidarbha (Ber\u00e1r). It is now the site of an annual fair, in which religion lends its aid to commerce, and collects in the bed of the then scanty river the cotton fabrics of the East country, the hardware of the West, and the miscellaneous productions and piece-goods of England. The length of the Wardh\u00e1 from its source to its junction with the Waingang\u00e1 is about 254 miles.\n\n**WARDH\u00c1'\u2014**\n\n| CONTENTS. |\n|-----------|\n| General description | 512 |\n| Appearance | 513 |\n| Geology | 514 |\n| Climate | 515 |\n| Domestic animals | ib. |\n| Wild animals | 516 |\n| Forest produce | 516 |\n| Agricultural produce | ib. |\n| Manufactures | 517 |\n| Trade | ib. |\n| Communications | ib. |\n| Administration | 518 |\n\nUntil seven years ago the tract of country now known as Wardh\u00e1 formed part of the N\u00e1gpur district, to which it is similar both in character of population and in geographical features. The two were divided on the 1st August 1862, chiefly on the grounds that N\u00e1gpur as it then stood was too large for a single administrative charge, and that the interests of the very valuable cotton country in this part of the Wardh\u00e1 valley needed special guardianship. As now constituted the district lies between 78\u00b0 and 79\u00b0 of east longitude, and between 20\u00b0 and 21\u00b0 of north latitude. Its form is almost triangular, the base having a direction from north-east to south-west, and the apex to the north lying among the spurs of the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1 range. The River Wardh\u00e1 forms the northern and western\nboundary, while to the east and south the district marches with the N\u00e1gp\u00far and Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 districts respectively. The extreme length is about eighty-eight miles, and the breadth at the base thirty-six miles. The whole area is about 2,379 square miles.\n\nWardh\u00e1 naturally divides itself into two parts\u2014the north being hilly, from an inlying spur of the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1 range; the south being an undulating plain, intersected by n\u00e1l\u00e1s, and broken here and there by isolated hills rising abruptly from its surface. The hill-ranges and intervening valleys run generally in a south-east direction, but towards the south, where the hills diminish in height and gradually merge into the plains, no definite direction is discernible. The central cluster of hills, which includes the survey stations of M\u00e1leg\u00f3n (1,726 feet above the sea), N\u00e1ndg\u00e1on (1,874 feet), and Garams\u00far (2,086 feet), forms the watershed of the district. From the north and west of this range numerous small mountain-streams make their way to the Wardh\u00e1, while on the south and south-east the Dh\u00e1m, the Bor, and the Asod\u00e1 n\u00e1l\u00e1 take their rise, and flow down the length of the district in a south-east direction. In the north a succession of gh\u00e1ts\u2014abrupt escarpments in the trap rock\u2014mark the steps by which the country rises and falls from the bed of the Wardh\u00e1 to the confines of N\u00e1gp\u00far. The gh\u00e1ts of Tal\u00e9g\u00e1on, Chicholl\u00ed, Dh\u00e1mkund, and Th\u00e1n\u00e9g\u00e1on are well known to travellers passing from Amr\u00e1t\u00ed to the N\u00e1gp\u00far district. The surface of the hills is in general rugged and stony. In summer a few shrubs and small trees alone appear on their sides, though after the rains they are covered with luxuriant grass\u2014the grazing ground of large herds of fine buffaloes and cattle. But in the A\u015bht\u00ed and Kondh\u00e1l\u00ed parganas in the north of the district many of the hills are clothed with young teak and other timber, and the valleys between the ranges are everywhere fertile and rich. Garams\u00far\u2014the highest hill in the district\u2014has an elevation of 2,086 feet, but the average height of the summits of the hill-ranges does not exceed 1,300 feet. The elevation of the head-quarters station of Wardh\u00e1 is about 925 feet. The principal rivers are the Wardh\u00e1 itself, with its affluents the Wan\u00e1, Asod\u00e1, and B\u00e9kl\u00ed.\n\nThe aspect of the plain portions of the district presents but few remarkable features. In general the country is well wooded, and in the eastern portion of the Hingangh\u00e1t subdivision the jungle predominates over the cleared and cultivated tracts. But on the other hand large portions of this tahsil are very deficient in trees, and the neighbourhood of Hingangh\u00e1t itself is singularly bare. The trees which most frequently meet the eye are the mango, tamarind, n\u00edm, ber, and p\u00edpal. The hollows of the lowlands are generally covered with clumps of date palm. Mud forts, of which almost every village has one, form a prominent object in a Wardh\u00e1 landscape. The population has always been peaceable and quiet, but in the earlier years of the present century they lay peculiarly exposed to the organised assaults of the marauding Pindh\u00e1r\u00eds. These well-known bands of freebooters had most of their head-quarter camps in the Narbad\u00e1 valley, whence they swept down on these rich plains, and no village was safe without some kind of fortified enclosure. The Pindh\u00e1r\u00eds were extinguished in the campaign which ended in 1818, but their memory is still fresh in the minds of the people. The appearance of the villages generally contrasts unfavourably with the substantial look of native habitations in some other parts of India. Masonry and double-storied houses are exceedingly rare. Tiled roofs are the exception, and even the dwellings of the better classes would in other parts be thought squalid and mean. Scarcity of building-timber is no doubt a principal cause\nof this architectural deficiency; but throughout the N\u00e1gp\u00far province there is a want of taste and appreciation for appearances. In the villages, the houses of which are almost all thatched, fires are both frequent and destructive. Efforts have of late been made to encourage tiled roofs, and to spread a taste for house-decoration.\n\nThe following paragraphs on the geology of the district are taken almost entirely from the article on the geology of the N\u00e1gp\u00far province, published in the collection of papers on the geology of Western India.* The sameness of formation makes the description there given applicable to every part of the district.\n\nThe great sheet of trap which covers the Ber\u00e1rs, and extends as far as the coast of the Arabian Sea, underlies the whole of the Wardh\u00e1 district. On the south the boundary of Wardh\u00e1 and Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 marks the termination of this formation, and on the east and north it extends beyond the limits of the district to Umr\u00e9r and N\u00e1gp\u00far. The stratification in Wardh\u00e1 is regular and continuous, and the angle of inclination is generally small. The effect of this regularity is seen in the flat tops of the hills, and in the horizontal terraces which their sides present. The strata in this part of India are said to succeed one another in the following order:\n\nI. Superficial formations\u2014Regar (black soil), or red soil, as the case may be.\nII. Brown clay.\nIII. Laterite.\nIV. Nodular trap.\nV. A fresh-water formation.\nVI. Underlying trap.\nVII. Sandstone.\nVIII. Plutonic and metamorphic rocks.\n\nBut in Wardh\u00e1 although rocks of all, or nearly all, of these formations are occasionally found, the red soil and laterite are generally wanting, and the sandstone and plutonic rocks, which no doubt underlie the trap, are very seldom exposed to view. The usual succession is black soil resting on nodular trap, and that again, with the fresh-water formation intervening, over the underlying trap. The thickness of the trap formation is, however, so great that little is known regarding the position of the underlying rocks.\n\nOwing to the sameness of the geological formation, variety of mineral products is wanting in Wardh\u00e1. No ores nor coal-seams are found, nor is there any probability of their discovery. The black basalt, however, supplies an excellent building-stone, and in a few localities quarries of flagstone have been opened. Limestone is not found as a rock, but nodules of kankar enter into the composition of the black soil, and the lime required for building purposes is made by collecting and burning the larger fragments which are exposed on the surface of the ground.\n\nThe plain of Hingangh\u00e1t and the plain and hill of Girar are spots of great geological interest. At the former place the fresh-water stratum may be traced,\n\n* Geological Papers on Western India, edited for the Government by H. J. Carter, Esq., Assistant Surgeon, Bombay, 1857, pp. 247 ff.\nand silicified wood picked up in abundance. At the latter the hill-side exposes the fresh-water stratum in all its varieties, while the plain is strewn with curious zeolitic concretions, resembling betelnuts or nutmegs, which have issued from the soft subjacent rock. Native superstition has accounted for these nodules by a legend that the stores of a travelling spice-merchant were turned to stone at the command of Shekh Farid\u2014a saint, whose anger the merchant had incurred, and whose name is still held in reverence by a colony of fakirs, who reside on the top of the Girar hill.\n\nAs might be expected from its distance from the sea and its physical conformation, the climate of Wardha is variable, and the extremes of temperature are pretty widely separated. The cold of winter is never severe, but the heat of midday in summer is little below that of the hottest parts of India. The variations of temperature in the same day are considerable at all times of the year, and the rapid change from the heat of the day to a cool night is especially remarkable in the summer months. It can scarcely be supposed that the influence of the sea-breeze extends so far inland; but the soil of Wardha, like the sand of the desert, probably radiates heat rapidly, and the surface of the ground cools quickly after the heat of the sun has ceased to act upon it. During the summer months a dry, and in the daytime a hot wind blows steadily and strongly from the north-west quarter. The monsoon generally opens with a hurricane; at other times of the year the wind is variable and generally light. The average rainfall is about thirty-two inches. The rains set in about the 15th of June and last till the end of September. Falls also occur at uncertain times about the middle of the cold season. The climate of the district is on the whole salubrious, and although Wardha cannot vie in healthiness with the districts of the Satpur\u00e1 plateau, it has a better name than the immediately adjoining country. It is well drained, and although the jungles to the north are feverish for a few months after the rains, it is generally free from malaria. Cholera is not uncommon, but it has generally been imported by pilgrims from the religious fairs at Jagann\u00e1th, Pachmarhi, and Pandharpur, and since sanitary restrictions have been placed on these gatherings, the periodical epidemics have been rarer and less destructive. Something too may be due to the opening of the railway. The eastern part of the Bombay and Nagpur road was at one time notorious for cholera, but now that the stream of traffic is diminished, and journeys can be accomplished with comparatively little fatigue and exposure, much less is heard of cholera in the Wardha district. There are no specific diseases which deserve notice. The people, though by no means strikingly robust, look generally vigorous and healthy.\n\nAmong domestic animals, the trotting bullocks, for which this part of the Central Provinces is famous, should be mentioned. The breeding of horned cattle generally is carried on on a large scale in the northern and hilly part of the district, which affords excellent pasture in the cold season, but in summer most of the herds are taken to the jungles of Mandla and Chand\u00e1. The breed of buffaloes too is very fine. Large flocks of sheep and goats are found in the plain tracts in the dry season, and in the hills in the rains, but the stock is not particularly good. Indeed under the system of breeding which is pursued it is scarcely possible that very good results should be attained.\nOf wild animals, the tiger, panther, hy\u00e6na, leopard, wolf, jackal, and wild hog abound. The spotted-deer, n\u00eelg\u00e1i, and wild goat also inhabit the hills, whilst the antelope may be seen all over the plains. Of game-birds too there is a very good sprinkling, among which may be named the bustard, the black and grey partridge, the grey and bush quail, and two descriptions of rock-pigeon or grouse, viz. the pintail and pointed. Of fish no great variety exists. Snakes of all kinds, and scorpions and centipedes of the largest, are disagreeably common.\n\nThe most valuable indigenous trees are the teak (tectona grandis), the t\u00e2ri (toddy) palm, the mhowa (bassia latifolia), the mango, the tamarind, the salai (boswellia thurifera), the anjan (hardwickia binata), the dh\u00e2ur\u00e2 (conocarpus latifolia), and the tend\u00fb (lagerstr\u00e6mia parviflora). Of medicinal plants there are the castor-oil plant, the hendismus or country sarsaparilla, the kat karanj fruit, the wild liquorice, n\u00eem (azadirachta indica), chirayita (chiretta), and dhat\u00fbr\u00e2.\n\nA little lac is gathered on the northern part of the district, and the red cochineal is occasionally found in the plains, though not in sufficient quantity to be of commercial value.\n\nGum is collected by Gonds, and wax and honey are found, but all these products are insignificant in amount. Mhowa trees are abundant, and mhowa flowers form the only valuable article of forest produce.\n\nGhee and butter, the former especially, are among the most important articles of trade of the district. The hills in the north are grazed over by fine herds of buffaloes and cows, and the ghee which they produce is a principal article of sale in the b\u00e2z\u00e2rs of A'rv\u00ee and Deoli.\n\nThe black soil, to which the district owes its great fertility, varies in depth from ten feet to a few inches, its average thickness being about two feet. In the dry weather its surface shows the cracks and fissures characteristic of the deposit, and it is generally found intermixed with nodular limestone. The chief agricultural staples are jaw\u00e2r\u00ee (holcus sorghum), cotton, wheat, and rice. The first two are very largely grown, the third and fourth less so. The Wardh\u00e2 turmeric too is of good quality, and excellent \"patsan\" and hemp are produced in small quantities. Cotton is the most valuable product of the district, and has become so more than ever during the last few years. The area under cotton cultivation last season was estimated at 176,303 acres. In the present season (1869-70) it is estimated that 225,332 acres are thus cultivated, and should the harvest prove favourable, the outturn will reach about 178,000 maunds (equal to about 36,600 bales of 400 lb. each). The staple of the local variety is so good, and it commands so high a price in the market, that cotton is brought here from Ber\u00e2r and elsewhere to be re-exported under the name of \"Hingangh\u00e2t.\"* The New Orleans variety has been recently introduced, but hitherto it has not turned out so well as the indigenous cotton, and it is believed that more may be done by careful selection and culture of the latter on the pedigree system than by acclimatisation of exotic seed.\n\n* The name of the chief cotton-market in Wardh\u00e2.\nCountry cloth is the only important local manufacture. The following table exhibits the number of people engaged in it, and the estimated value of the outturn of their labour:\n\n| No. of weavers | No. of looms | Outturn in pieces | Value of cloth |\n|---------------|-------------|------------------|---------------|\n| 4,220         | 4,220       | 263,928          | Rs. 8,63,306  |\n\nIt is estimated that two-thirds of the cloth woven in the district are exported to Ber\u00e1r and further west. Cotton-thread, blankets, gunny, and rope are also produced. Hardware is universally imported; and the Wardh\u00e1 pottery, owing to the admixture of limestone nodules in the soil, is very poor. In some localities the soil is so full of lime that there is difficulty in making even bricks and tiles. The energies of the people are, however, chiefly devoted to cultivation and trade, and it is no stretch of fancy to suppose that at present the Wardh\u00e1 farmer often wears the Manchester-woven produce of his own fields.\n\nThe trade of the Wardh\u00e1 district is only remarkable on account of the cotton exports. The excellent quality of the staple, known to the commercial world as \"Hingangh\u00e1ts,\" from the cotton mart of that name, has secured for it an almost unlimited demand, and a higher price in the English market than any other description of Indian cotton, except perhaps the acclimatised New Orleans of the Southern Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 Country. It seems also to have grown into favour on the Continent, where the looms have to some extent been adapted to work the short-staple Indian cotton. The commercial celebrity of the \"Hingangh\u00e1t\" brand has always drawn to that mart for foreign export quantities of cotton from Eastern Ber\u00e1r, N\u00e1gpur, Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1, and neighbouring districts; but deducting these, the exports from Wardh\u00e1 alone may be stated to average about 25,000 bales per annum, reckoning the bale at 400 lbs. A good deal has been done of late years by the Government Cotton Department, not only to improve the cultivation of cotton and its preparation for market, but also to facilitate traffic by providing suitable market-places and other advantages. The Wardh\u00e1 cotton trade will no doubt with this assistance attain the highest development which the limited area of the Wardh\u00e1 valley will allow. A considerable trade has also grown up, since the opening of the railway to Bombay, in butter, either fresh or clarified, which is largely produced in the \u00c1rv\u00ed tahsil, and regularly exported to the Bombay market. The cows in this part of the country are said to be of a good breed, and the abundance of good pasture, a steady foreign demand, and cheap transit by railway, have fostered a trade which in the year 1868-69 amounted to 22,000 maunds, valued at Rs. 4,43,000. There is a small exchange grain-trade between Wardh\u00e1 and Ber\u00e1r, the imports being jaw\u00e1ri (millet), and the exports wheat and d\u00e1l (pulse). The principal import is salt, to the extent of about 51,000 maunds, valued at Rs. 3,60,000, English piece-goods to the value of about two l\u00e1khs of rupees, with some hardware, spices, and other miscellaneous foreign products.\n\nThe district would be decidedly backward in its communications were it not for the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, which now traverses it. The black soil of the plains forms a most difficult and expensive foundation for road-making, and with the exception of one or two good roads, the whole traffic of the country has until lately been carried over country-tracks, which in the monsoon months are quite impassable. The made roads are (1) the southern road between N\u00e1gpur and Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, which enters the district a little to the east of Sindi, and traversing its south-east corner enters the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district at a point due south of Hingangh\u00e1t. This road is of imperial rather than local importance; but as a branch road runs\nto Hingangh\u00e1t from the village of J\u00e1m, it is much used by persons passing between Hingangh\u00e1t and N\u00e1gp\u00far, and should any part of the export trade of Hingangh\u00e1t gravitate to the Sind\u00ed station, it will become a local line of principal importance. (2) The Wardh\u00e1 valley road, which unites the railway station of Pulg\u00e1on with the towns of Deol\u00ed and Hingangh\u00e1t in the south, and those of \u00c1rv\u00ed and \u00c1sht\u00ed in the north. This is the principal line of communication in the district. It traverses the whole length of the valley of the Wardh\u00e1, and carries to the railway the cotton for which this part of the district is especially famous. The length of this road may be put down at seventy miles, and if to this be added eighteen miles of a second-class feeder road, laid out to connect Pohn\u00e1 and the south of Ber\u00e1r with Hingangh\u00e1t, the entire length is a little short of one hundred miles. But the road is not yet completed. Of country-tracks the chief is the old road between Bombay and N\u00e1gp\u00far. The importance of this line has been very much diminished by the railway, but it is still much used. It enters the district at the \u00c1pt\u00ed ferry on the Wardh\u00e1, and passing the villages of Kauth\u00e1, Kuljh\u00e1ri, Dah\u00edg\u00e1on, Ell Kelf, and Sel\u00fa, enters the N\u00e1gp\u00far district at the village of \u00c1s\u00f3la. Another principal line of traffic connects N\u00e1gp\u00far with Amr\u00e1ot\u00ed, and runs through the north of the \u00c1rv\u00ed tahsil. This line crosses the Wardh\u00e1 at Bisn\u00far, and after passing over the Tal\u00e9g\u00e1on Gh\u00e1truns to N\u00e1gp\u00far via K\u00e1rinj\u00e1 and Kondh\u00e1li. It will be easily imagined that in a district so scantily provided with roads the conveyances must be of a peculiar kind adapted for the work they have to do. Instead of the large heavy hackery of the North-Western Provinces, the carts of the district (kh\u00e1char or kh\u00e1nchar) are small, low, and narrow-wheeled. Their lightness and the smallness of their loads enable bullocks to draw them up the steep inclines; they are too low to upset, and their narrow wheels, on which mud has little hold, are well fitted for the kind of country through which they have to travel. The \u201crengh\u201d is a lighter cart, of similar construction, and is not intended to carry merchandise. It bears the same relation to the kh\u00e1nchar that a phaeton does to a cart. The \u201cchhakr\u00e1\u201d is a still lighter conveyance, and, like all the above, is drawn by small well-bred trotting bullocks, for which Wardh\u00e1 is famous. The possession of a cart or rengh and pair is by no means confined to the wealthier inhabitants, but is common to all the well-to-do classes of the district. There is no part of India where the people use conveyances so much and walk so little, and the speed with which they get over the ground is remarkable. Fast bullocks fetch fancy prices, and are eagerly bought by wealthy landholders, who like to rival each other in the completeness of their turn-out.\n\nThe administration of the district is conducted by the usual civil staff, consisting ordinarily of a Deputy Commissioner, an Assistant Commissioner, a Civil Medical Officer, and a District Superintendent of Police at head-quarters, an Assistant Commissioner at the important cotton mart of Hingangh\u00e1t, and Tahsild\u00e1rs at \u00c1rv\u00ed, Wardh\u00e1, and Hingangh\u00e1t. The police force has a strength of 391 of all ranks, and has station-houses at Hingangh\u00e1t, \u00c1rv\u00ed, Kh\u00e1ng\u00e1on, Sind\u00ed, Girar, \u00c1sht\u00ed, and Pulg\u00e1on, besides nineteen outposts. The imperial revenues are\u2014\n\n| Land | Rs. 5,10,182 |\n| Assessed taxes | Rs. 28,196 |\n| Stamps | Rs. 50,969 |\n| Excise | Rs. 79,017 |\n| Forests | Rs. 8,552 |\n| Customs | Rs. 6,88,365 |\n\nTotal\u2026..Rs. 13,65,281\nThe Great Indian Peninsula Railway crosses the centre of the district, within which it has three stations\u2014Pulg\u00e1on, on the banks of the Wardh\u00e1; Wardh\u00e1, the central station, twenty miles east of Pulg\u00e1on; and Sind\u00ed, near the borders of N\u00e1gp\u00far. To these stations the whole trade of the district converges.\n\nWARDHA'\u2014The central tahs\u00edl or revenue subdivision of the district of the same name, having an area of 801 square miles, with 468 villages, and a population of 139,210 souls according to the census of 1866. The land revenue for 1869-70 is Rs. 2,08,119.\n\nWARDHA'\u2014The head-quarters town of the district of the same name. Here is a station of the Great India Peninsula Railway, distant forty-nine miles from N\u00e1gp\u00far. The town is quite new, dating from the 21st May 1866. The old village of P\u00e1lakw\u00e1ri was levelled to make room for Wardh\u00e1, and the new town is built in wide and regular streets, carefully laid out so as to admit of expansion as population increases. The jail, police lines, public garden, court-houses, and civil station generally are on a gentle slope to the east of the town. The site is naturally well drained, and promises to be healthy. The absence of trees is the main defect at present, and causes the station to have a bare and bleak appearance, especially in the hot weather; but several miles of avenues in and about the town have been laid out, and are progressing well. By November 1866, when the general census was taken, Wardh\u00e1 had already attained a population of 2,734, and it is steadily increasing. At first the inhabitants ran up grass sheds and other similar temporary residences, but these are fast being replaced by more substantial buildings. It is anticipated that the railway station will in time attract to Wardh\u00e1 a large share of the cotton trade of this district; but trade is slow to leave its old channels, and Hingangh\u00e1t, Deol\u00ed, and other marts of the railway line still retain their ascendancy. However, cotton trade has made a fair start at Wardh\u00e1; and presses and a metalled storage and weighing-yard have been provided from local funds. A vernacular town-school has also been opened at Wardh\u00e1. The weekly market held on Fridays is large, and well attended by traders and holders of agricultural produce from the villages round.\n\nWARHA'\u2014A village in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, situated on the left bank of the Wardh\u00e1, ten miles west-south-west of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1, and facing the mouth of the Paingang\u00e1, which here falls into the Wardh\u00e1. On the river's bank is an old temple, with a broad flight of steps leading to the water's edge. It was at this village that the van of B\u00e1j\u00ed R\u00e1o's army was met and driven back by Lieutenant Colonel Hopeton Scott in April A.D. 1818. A fair assembles here during the cold weather.\n\nWARHONA'\u2014A village in the \u00c1rv\u00ed tahs\u00edl of the Wardh\u00e1 district, situated on the Dh\u00e1m, some six miles from its source, and distant about twenty-seven miles from Wardh\u00e1. It contains a mixed population of 1,535 Tel\u00eds, Kunbis, Mohammadans, &c., most of whom are cultivators. A small weekly market is held here on Sundays.\n\nWARNERA'\u2014A town in the Hingangh\u00e1t tahs\u00edl of the Wardh\u00e1 district, twenty-five miles south of Wardh\u00e1. It belongs to an influential landholding family, who have a fine house in the fort. It contains 2,467 inhabitants, chiefly cultivators and weavers. The municipality have built a village school-house, and opened up a market-place under the walls of the fort; they also maintain\ntheir own town police and conservancy establishments. A branch distillery has recently been opened, and a small weekly market is held here on Wednesdays.\n\nWARORA'\u2014The north-western tahsil or revenue subdivision of the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district, having an area of 1,248 square miles, with 406 villages, and a population of 120,191 souls according to the census of 1866. The land revenue of the tahsil for 1869-70 is Rs. 84,006.\n\nWARORA'\u2014The western pargana of the tahsil of the same name in the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district. It is bounded on the north by the Wardh\u00e1 and N\u00e1gp\u00far districts, on the east by the Chim\u00far and Bh\u00e1ndak parganas, on the south by the Wardh\u00e1, and on the west by the Wardh\u00e1 and Wan\u00e1. It has an area of about 415 square miles, and contains 148 villages. The S\u00edr traverses a large portion of the pargana from north to south, and the Vir\u00e1 flows along the north-eastern corner. The country generally is a rolling plain of black loam, dotted with a few isolated hills of sandstone. Excellent cotton, wheat, jaw\u00e1ri, oil-seeds, gram, and rice are grown here. The chief towns are Waror\u00e1, M\u00e1ndher\u00ed, and Seg\u00e1on. The population is principally Mar\u00e1th\u00e1, and the Dhan\u00e1j\u00ed Kunbis form the largest agricultural class.\n\nWARORA'\u2014The head-quarters of the tahsil of the same name, and the second commercial town of the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 district. It is situated thirty-two miles north-west of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1, twenty-six miles south-east of Hingangh\u00e1t, and twelve miles north of W\u00fan. It contains 975 houses; the population being Mar\u00e1th\u00e1, with a sprinkling of M\u00e1rw\u00e1ris. A large weekly market is held here, and a considerable trade is carried on in cotton, grain, groceries, country cloths, and salt. The town has a tahsil, a town school for boys, a girls' school, an imperial post-office, a police station-house, a sar\u00e1\u00ed, a travellers' bungalow, a handsome place, a large tank, an encamping-ground, a tahsil nursery for young trees, and a Public Works bungalow. An Assistant Patrol of Customs is stationed here.\n\nWELTU'R\u2014A small straggling town in the N\u00e1gp\u00far district, about forty miles south-east of N\u00e1gp\u00far, and near the picturesque hill of Ambh\u00f3r\u00e1, which overlooks the Waingang\u00e1. It has a population of 2,112 persons. There are some fine groves and tanks around it; and the town has its new school and police buildings and market-place. Some cloth is manufactured here, most of which is exported.\n\nZ\n\nZAINA'BA'D\u2014A village in the Nim\u00e1r district, only divided from Burh\u00e1n-p\u00far, of which it once formed a part; by the Tapt\u00ed. It now contains about 1,200 inhabitants, but has greatly fallen off from its former condition, signs of which remain in numerous ruins of mosques, tombs, and sar\u00e1\u00eds. The paper made here had once a high repute, but the manufacture has greatly declined.\nAPPENDIX No. 1.\nSTATISTICAL TABLES.\n### NATIVE STATES\n\n#### STATISTICAL TABLES\n\n| Name of State | In subaidi-Tribute in Any Alliance or Feudal-tory. | Supposed Men or Population. | Gross Revenue. | Military force. | Duties or Indicating Manufactures and Mines. | Principal articles of production. |\n|---------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------|----------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| 1.
