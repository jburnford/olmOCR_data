Anent this note I have now received from the learned gentleman a letter, the following extract from which will, I think, interest our members:\n\n\u201cOxford, 26th October, 1886.\n\n\u201cMy dear Sir,\n\n\u201cI read with much interest your remarks on my paper on *Ekotibh\u00e1va*. Of course, I fully agree with all you say about *Ekotibh\u00e1va*, with dental *t*. That can be derived from *eka* and *\u00fati*. But I had\nmet with *Ekotibh\u00e1va*, with lingual *t*, and it was the word which I called possibly a Bh\u00e1sh\u00e1 word, of which afterwards a learned etymology was attempted.\n\n\"The question of real interest is, do we find in Sanskrit analogies to the contraction *eka koti* into *ekoti*. They are frequent in other Aryan languages, in order to avoid the repetition of the same sound in two successive syllables. So we have in English *mineralogy* instead of *mineralology*, wholly for *wholly*. In Latin *nutrix* for *nutritrix*, *veneficus* for *venenificus*, *viper* for *vivipara*, *stipendium* for *stipipendium*, perhaps *fastidium* for *fastitidium*, etc.\n\n\"In Sanskrit my memory would not supply me with any really analogous cases. The contracted perfect *lebhe* for *laldbhe* is not quite analogous, but I should be glad to know whether you have come across any words in Sanskrit or Prakrit where, for the sake of euphony, one of two syllables beginning with the same consonant is dropt.\n\n\"You may print this note in the Proceedings of the Asiatic Society.\"\n\nThe question put to me is too general and comprehensive to admit of a categorical reply. Of all ancient languages the Sanskrit is, perhaps, the most complicated in its etymological and euphonic rules. Acutely sensitive to cacophony the Indo-Aryans devised a complicated and very elaborate system of combinations by lengthening, shortening, softening and synizesis, so as to wear, abrade, clip, and elide all asperities, and reduce the elements of their words into what struck their ears as the most harmonious forms. And Sanskrit grammarians revel in framing rules to explain the *rationale* of the changes adopted. Their ingenuity, however, did not suffice to cover the whole ground. Many words were found in the language which would not yield to any general principle, and these had to be classed as irregular. Now the general principles do not apply to the case under notice, and I have no hesitation in saying with the fullest confidence that the changes by which *eka kotibh\u00e1va* can be reduced to *ekotibh\u00e1va*, cannot be accounted for by any rule, general or special, in the Sanskrit grammar. Of the irregular words which have been classed by P\u00e1nini in the group *Prishodara* &c. the only explanation given is that \"the forms in which they have been pronounced by the learned should be accepted as correct\" (*sish\u1e6dair yathochch\u00e1rit\u00e1ni tathaiva s\u00e1dh\u00fani syuh*). The group is said to belong to the class *\u0101k\u1e5btigani*, i.e., not only the words included in the group, but others of the same form come under it. *Ekotibh\u00e1va*, however, does not in form correspond with any of the words given in the *ga\u1e47ap\u00e1tha*; and it is hopeless to find its analogue. Apart from grammar I have ransacked the wide field of Sanskrit vocables, but with no better result. I have not found a single word which is strictly\nanalogous. At first sight the word bhaum\u0101v\u0101sy\u0101* struck me as closely similar to the English mineralogy. It is an obscure word, not given in our lexicons, but it is sometimes used by Kaula T\u0101ntrics who indulge extensively in obscure, enigmatic and mystified technical terms, often amputating words and syllables to raise them above the comprehension of the common people. At first sight it seems to be a compound of bhauma and am\u0101v\u0101sy\u0101; but the two elements compounded according to the ordinary rules of Sanskrit grammar would yield bhaum\u0101v\u0101sy\u0101, and not bhaum\u0101v\u0101sy\u0101, and the inference is that one of the two m\u0101's has been elided for the sake of euphony. If so, it would certainly be the same as mineralogy, a compound of mineral and the Greek logos, which should have in ordinary course produced mineralology and not mineralogy. But all T\u0101ntrics do not accept the derivation above given. While some refer the etymologist to the rule about irregulars (Preshodara &c.) to account for the irregularity,+ others hold that bhauma is a derivative form, and v\u0101sy\u0101 is the same word which we have in am\u0101v\u0101sy\u0101 with the intensive particle a, meaning 'to abide by,' or 'to exist conjointly with,' the meaning of the compound term being 'that which exists conjointly with bhauma' or Tuesday. And if this be the right etymology, and there is no fair reason to reject it, the parallelism is entirely destroyed. It is true that an am\u0101v\u0101sy\u0101, or new moon on a Tuesday, is what is meant by the term, that conjunction being held to be the most auspicious for the performance of certain Kaula rites, but it may be as well indicated by a derivative as by a substantive word, and it would be futile to build any theory on such dubious evidence.\n\nThe following papers were read\u2014\n\n1. Note on the rice-juice sapper of Madras.\u2014By E. T. Atkinson, Esq., President.\n\nMr. J. Lee Warner, of Tinnevelly, sent me some specimens in spirits of an insect that attacks rice in the Tinnevelly district, and which, like the green Homopterous insect that came in such numbers in Calcutta in October-November 1886, also appeared in excessive numbers in the Madras Presidency about the same time during that year. I identify this insect with Leptocoris acuta, Thunberg, a wide-spreading species found all over the East on rice. In Assam, it is known as the gandi\n\n* The word occurs in the following extract from the 7th book of the Mah\u0101-nirv\u0101na Tantra. \u2014\n\u092d\u094b\u091c\u093e\u0938\u094d\u0935\u093e\u092e\u093f\u092f\u093e\u0903 \u0938\u092e\u094d\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0926\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0903\u0964 \u092a\u0942\u091c\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0903 \u092e\u0939\u093e\u0915\u093e\u0932\u0940\u092f\u093e\u0903 \u0935\u093f\u0936\u094d\u0935\u0928\u0947\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093f\u0903\u0964\n\u092a\u0935\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0903 \u0935\u0930\u0923\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0925\u093e\u0903 \u0935\u093e\u091a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0903 \u091c\u0940\u0935\u0928\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0925\u093e\u0903\u0964 \u092c\u093e\u0932\u093e\u0903 \u0935\u093f\u0926\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0928\u094d \u0924\u0925\u093e \u0935\u093f\u0926\u0941\u0937\u094b\u093d\u0938\u094d\u092e\u093f \u0915\u093f\u091e\u094d\u091a\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0964\n\u2020 \u0935\u0948\u0926\u094d\u092f\u0915\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0903 \u0935\u0948\u0926\u094d\u092f\u0915\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0903 \u0935\u0948\u0926\u094d\u092f\u0915\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0903\u0964\nor bug that attacks the ahu rice, and in Tinnevelly it is called the munju vandu, or rice-juice sucker or sapper. There is every reason to believe that the numerous references which I give below all belong to one and the same species or its local varieties. This species is represented in South America by the closely allied *Leptocoris filiformis*, Fabr.; in Central and North America, by *L. tipuloides*, De Geer; in Africa by *L. apicalis*, Westw.; and in Australia by *Mutusca brevicornis*, Dallas. The general colour of the Indian species varies from virescent (which in old specimens, fades to sordid yellow) to testaceous and even brownish-testaceous: the rings, at the base of 2-4 joints of the antennae, vary in the space occupied by them; and in colour, from white to fulvous and testaceous, and are sometimes very faint; the first joint of the antennae is sometimes entirely testaceous: abdomen above reddish orange, beneath entirely flavescient or with a row of four brown spots on each side. Those without spots beneath are smaller, and in my collection are from Assam and Sikkim; the spotted forms are from Calcutta, Behar, Tinnevelly and Ceylon but, in some of these latter specimens, the spots are so nearly obsolete as to be barely traceable.\n\n**Leptocoris acuta**, Thunberg.\n\n*Cimex acutus*, Thunberg, Nov.

Agric. Un. States, p. 205, 1880). It remains for observers in this country to ascertain whether the Indian form of this cosmopolitan insect damages the rice-crop and what is its life-history.\n\n2. On the ancient remains at Nagari, a village in Meywar, with copies of three inscriptions.\u2014By KAVIRAJ SHYAMAL DAS.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThis paper contains an interesting account of the ancient town of Nagari, which seems to have been the capital of Meywar before Chitor was built.\n\nThe author describes a curious stone enclosure called Hathion-ka-Bara, or the elephant enclosure, and also the stone pyramid known by the name of Akbar's lamp, and which is described by Tod, I, 325, and II, 756.\n\nHe also gives two early inscriptions in Sanscrit, and one composed in 1499 and set up in 1504.\n\nThe paper will be published in the Journal Part I, for 1887.\n\n3. A Brief account of Tibet from \"Dsam Ling Gyeshe,\" the well-known geographical work of Lama Tsanpo Nomankhan of Amdo.\u2014By BABU SARAT CHANDRA DAS, C. I. E.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThis paper gives a number of geographical details about Tibet and describes the chief places of pilgrimage and monasteries, and also contains an interesting description of the city of Lhasa. The following passage is very curious, if the Chitor referred to be the old capital of Meywar:\u2014\"When the Turushka armies under king Boramjee (or Noramjee) captured Chittore, the king and his brother carrying with them the images of Chanrassig Wangchhyug and his wife, retired to Kang Tesi...........................................\n\nThe royal brothers at the end of their pilgrimage in Tibet returned to Nep\u00e1l, carrying with them the image of Dol-Ma. There, the elder brother happened to obtain the principality of J\u00famlang, and the younger brother, more fortunate, the kingdom of Nep\u00e1l. The latter, after reigning several years, abdicated the throne and went to Southern India, where he obtained the chieftainship of a large principality.\"\n\nThe paper will be published in the Journal, Part I for 1887.\nThe President said:\u2014In the paper by Babu Sarat Chandra D\u00e1s that has just been read there is much of interest to those engaged in investigating the history and geography of Tibet, so much indeed that I should not care to detain you even with a part of all that it suggests. With the assistance of the paper, and the notes of General Cunningham, Lieut. J. D. Cunningham, Lieut. H. Strachey, the surveyors of the Great Trigonometrical Survey, Father Desgodins, Captain Giles, and some collected in Kumaon, on the borders of Nari-Khorsum, the Stod Mngah-ri skor-gsum of the paper, we might now be able to give a reasonable account of Tibetan geography did time and opportunity permit. The country to which the name Tibet is now applied appears in the Chinese annals of the Yang dynasty in the seventh century as T'ufan which should be read Tu-po; the character for 'fan' being phonetic with the two sounds 'fan' and 'po.' In the records of the eleventh century, it is known as T'u-pot'\u00ea, in which the latter syllable represents 'Po' or 'Bod,' and hence the Indian Bhot. The European name is derived from the Mongol in the form Tbt, or Tibt (Tibet), which occurs in the travels of the merchant Sulaiman so early as 851 A.D., and is evidently derived from the Chinese T'u-pot'\u00ea. During the Ming dynasty, the name was changed to Wuss\u00fc-tsang, from the two principal divisions dVus and gTsang, hence the modern name Weitsang by which it is known to the Chinese. The word hsi or 'western' is also applied to the country; hence hSi-tsang and tSi-fan, and the people are called Tupote and Tangkute.\n\nThe countries bordering on Tibet are rGya-nak, or 'great black' (China), that in which the people are usually clothed in black (nak): rGya-gar or India, where white (gar) is the usual clothing: rGya-ser, the great yellow (ser) or Russia: hJang or north-western Tibet: Mon,* the entire Indian Him\u00e1laya, and the remainder as in the paper. Amongst the lakes mentioned Maphamgyu-mtsho is the M\u00e1\u00f1asarovara lake so well-known in Sanskrit literature, and which lies to the north of Kumaon: it is called also mTsho ma-dros-pa in the Tibetan books. Tibet has three divisions:\u2014(a)-sTod-mngah-ri skhor-gsum or Little Tibet, the N\u00e1ri-khorsum of our maps: (b)-dVus and gTsang or Tibet proper, the U-tsong of our maps: and (c)-mDo, Khams and sGang or Khamyul, Great Tibet on the east. Nari-khorsum is divided into three Provinces, sTag-mo Ladvags to the west; Guge-buhrang (Purang) in the middle and Mang-yul along the Nep\u00e1l frontier. According to Strachey, 'nari' signifies 'clear' or 'pure,' an appellation probably due to the fine air and water of the country, and 'khorsum' signifies the three countries or tracts into which the province is divided. sTag-mo Ladvags was for-\n\n* A male native of Kumaon is called Mon-pa by the H\u00faniyas, and a female Mon-mo.\nmerly known as Maryul, and includes Lad\u00e1k and Balti, in which are sLes-mkhar, the fort (khar) of Le, and the forts of sBe-thub and Khri-se (in Purik), besides others. In Guge-Purang, is the great mountain Kang Tesi, the Kail\u00e1s of the Indians, and the sacred lake M\u00e1anasarovara. Hence also arise the four great rivers so frequently mentioned in Sanskrit and Chinese literature. In the great Chinese map, prepared by order of Khian-loung, the four corners or gates of the M\u00e1na lake are called the lion, elephant, horse and ox gates: Toui-gochal on the east; Ghiou-ourgou on the south; Arabko on the west and Dadza-loung on the north. The Pandit explorers give the names Singh-gi-chu or Singh-gi-khamba or Singh-gi-kha to the Indus, the Senge khabab of this paper: Langjan-khamba to the Satlaj: Tamjan-khamba to the Brahmaputra, the Tsang-po of this paper: and Mabja-khamba to the montane waters of the Karn\u00e1li or Gh\u00e1gra, the Mab-chya khabab of this paper. Gerard calls the Satlaj, the Lang-zhing-choo and J. Cunningham gives the name Langchin kabab. 'Sing' is lion, 'lang' is bull (not elephant which in Tibetan is called 'great bull'), 'mam' is peacock and 'ta' is horse: 'ka' means mouth, and 'bab' means 'issuing from' so that the names agree with the legend describing these rivers as issuing from the mouths of a lion, bull, peacock, and horse.\n\nThe traditional report as to the great size of mTaho Mapham in former times is probably due to the legend that its area formerly included the neighbouring lake mTsho Lagan (or Lagran m-tsho as it is called in this paper), the R\u00e1khas T\u00e1l of Sanskrit literature. Amongst the affluents of mTsho Lagan is the river La mtsho, the Lja-chhu of the paper, which rises from the south face of Kail\u00e1s (Kang Tesi) close above G\u00e1ngri and soon develops into a considerable stream. The pool on the pilgrim track around M\u00e1anasarovara, called Gauri-kund by the Indians, is probably the same as the Tibetan hTh\u00fang-grol, the fountain that gives salvation to all who drink thereof. Both the lake and the mountain and their vicinity are sacred to both Buddhists and Hindus. The circuit of the mountain takes a couple of days to perform, and there are four monasteries on the way:\u2014Nindi the residence of the Lhoba Lama, Didiphu, Jungdulphu, and Gyanktang in G\u00e1ngri. The parikrama, or circumambulation, of the lake takes from 4 to 5 days, and is marked by eight monasteries:\u2014Tokar, Gusur, Ju, Jakyal, Langbuna, Bundi, S\u00e1r\u00e1lung and Nunnukhar. As observed in the paper, the Hindus worship the places and marks of the presence of a deity as representing Mah\u00e1doo, in his various forms, whilst the Buddhists refer these places to their Bodhisattwas.\n\nGuge-Purang is governed by the two Garpuns of upper and lower Gar. These act jointly together and form a board for the administration\nof civil affairs called 'Lankya.' The senior is called Urku-gang, abbreviated usually to U-gang, and the junior is styled Urku-wah or U-wuh. Both reside at Gar-toh or Gar-tod (upper Gar), also called Gar-y\u00e1rsa, or the summer abode (yar, 'heat' or 'summer') to distinguish it from Gar-gunsa, the winter abode (gun, 'cold' or 'winter'). The first is situate on the left bank of the southern branch of the Indus, and the second two or three days' journey down the river further north-west. In Gar-y\u00e1rsa the whole population live in tents and in winter migrate to Gar-gunsa, where there are but three large and eight small houses. Under the Garpuns are the Jangpuns or governors of districts, and the Makhpuns or headmen of circles or groups of villages. In Guge-Purang, or as it is more generally called Nari, there are four Jangpuns:\u2014(1), at Ruduk in charge of the communications with Lad\u00e1k; (2), at Ts\u00e1parang in Guge, in charge of the communications and trade with Bis\u00e1hr, Nilang and M\u00e1na; (3), at D\u00e1ba in Guge, in charge of those with N\u00edti and Juh\u00e1r, and (4), at Taklakhar in Purang, in charge of those with D\u00e1rma and By\u00e1ns, and with Humla in Nep\u00e1l. The four districts are:\u2014(1) Ruduk, comprising Ruduk proper on the Lad\u00e1k frontier; No, to the north of Ruduk, and the salt mines in part; (2), the divisions of Gar, and upper and lower Seng, about the upper waters of the Satlaj, Gar-namru, and Tashikang; (3), Guge has D\u00e1ba, Ts\u00e1parang, Rong-chung and Chumurti; and (4), Purang has Bongba, Hor-ba, Kangri and Purang. Both Garpuns and Jungpuns are appointed from Lh\u00e1s\u00e1, and have a tenure of office for three years, after which they are relieved and return to give an account of their stewardship. Besides them, there is a commissioner of revenue in charge of the tea-monopoly called Lung-chung-pun, whose duty it is to assess the amount of tea to be taken by each district at a fixed price; and a contractor for the gold mines called Sarpun who manages those mines. There are also territorial divisions under native chiefs (Pun) called Pun-k\u00e1gos of which Strachey gives a list.\n\nIn Nari there are four chief monasteries presided over by abbots of the Gelukpa sect,\u2014in Ruduk, Rabgyaling, Tholing or Thoding of the paper, and Shebiling. The king Srong-tsan Gampo of the paper is also an historical personage who reigned in 630-50 A.D., and was a great conqueror, a religious reformer, and the pioneer of civilisation in Tibet. He is one with the Chitlungstan of the Chinese annals who removed his seat of government to Lh\u00e1s\u00e1 and married a daughter of the Emperor of China. In the same annals we find an interesting account of the early history of Tibet. Hutipusiyeh was chief of the Fa-chiang, to whose family belonged Fanni or Supnyeh who was a boy in 414 A.D., and succeeded in establishing the nucleus of a State in 425 A.D. Amongst his successors was Chitsunglungtsan or Chitlungstan, also called Chisa-\nmung and styled Favehshin. He was a minor when he ascended the throne in 630 and died in 650 A.D. I have said enough to show you that the paper is deserving of consideration as its statements are supported by independent testimony, so far as I have been able to examine them, and I only wish that I had time to continue the investigation which I commend to others more qualified for the task, promising that some labour and care will be amply rewarded.\n\n4. On some new species of Ficus from New Guinea.\u2014By George King, M.B., LL.D., Superintendent Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThe first portion of this paper is occupied by an outline of a rearrangement of the species of the large genus Ficus. The sections into which it is proposed to arrange the Indo-Malayan species are seven in number, the characters of these sections being founded on the structure and arrangement of the flowers. Two of the sections are proposed for the first time, the characters of the other five sections which are not new are modified so as to fit into the new arrangement. The remaining part of the paper is occupied by descriptions of sixteen new species of Ficus collected during recent explorations in New Guinea by Signor Beccari and Mr. H.O. Forbes.\n\n5.

T. ATKINSON, Esq., C.S., President, in the Chair.\n\nAccording to the Bye-Laws of the Society the President ordered the voting papers to be distributed for the election of Officers and Members of Council for 1887; and appointed Messrs. Gay and Wood-Mason, Scrutineers.\n\nThe PRESIDENT then called upon the Secretary to read the Annual Report.\n\nANNUAL REPORT FOR 1886.\n\nThe Council of the Asiatic Society of Bengal have the honour to submit the following Report on the state and progress of the Society's affairs during the past year.\n\nMember List.\n\nDuring the year under review 24 gentlemen were elected Ordinary Members of the Society, 17 Members withdrew, 5 died, 10 were removed from the List in accordance with Rule 38, 1 in accordance with Rule 9, and the names of two gentlemen who had ceased to be Members in 1884, but whose names had been continued on the List for 1885, were also removed. The total number of Members, therefore, at the close of 1886 was 319, against 328 at the end of the preceding year. Of these 93 were Resident, 142 Non-Resident, 18 Foreign, 16 Life, 48 Absent from India, and 2 Special Non-Subscribing Members, as will be seen from the following table, which also shows the fluctuations in the number of Ordinary Members for the past 6 years:\u2014\nThe 5 Ordinary Members who died during the year were Mr. H. L. St. Barbe, the Hon'ble J. Gibbs, Mr. J. Holdsworth Fisher, Babu R\u00e1j Krishna Mukherji, and Dr. J. E. N. Wise. The 2 Special Non-Subscribing Members are Mr. V. Ball and Lieut.-Col. H. H. Godwin-Austen, in accordance with recommendation of Council, confirmed by the General Meeting.\n\nAmong the Honorary Members there were two deaths, namely, of Mr. Edward Thomas, F. R. S., and of Mr. A. Grote. Their number now stands at 27. Notices of the life and labours of Mr. Thomas by the President and by Dr. Mitra were published in the Proceedings for April.\n\nAmong the Corresponding Members, intimation of the death of Mr. R. von Schlagintweit of Giessen was received. Their number now stands at 13.\n\nAmong the Associate Members there were two deaths,\u2014those of Mr. J. Schaumbergh and of the Rev. C. H. Dall. There was one election\u2014that of Babu Sarat Chandra D\u00e1s, C. I. E., in recognition of his attainments as a Tibetan scholar. Their number now stands at 8.\n\nIndian Museum.\n\nTwo Copper Sheets received from the Deputy Commissioner of Buld\u00e1n\u00e1 were transferred to the Indian Museum.\n\nTwo vacancies in the office of Trustee having occurred owing to the resignations of Mr. F. E. Pargiter and of the Hon'ble H. J. Reynolds, Dr. R. Mitra and Mr. E. Gay were appointed to replace them as Trustees on behalf of the Society.\n\nFinance.\n\nThe Accounts of the Asiatic Society are shown in the Appendix under the usual heads.\nStatement No. 8 contains the Balance Sheet of the Asiatic Society, and of the different Funds administered through it.\n\nThe Budget for the year under review was estimated at the following figures:\u2014Receipts Rs. 15,900; Expenditure Rs. 15,575. The Actuals were found to be:\u2014Receipts, Rs. 15,133-11-8; Expenditure, Rs. 17,974-7-7.\n\nThe Receipts thus show a decrease of Rs. 766-4-4, and the Expenditure an increase of Rs. 2,399-7-7, on the Budget Estimate.\n\nThe falling off in the Receipts is due mainly to the Subscriptions, the amounts realized under that head falling short of the estimate by nearly Rs. 700. This is accounted for partly by the large number of Members absent from India, and paying no subscriptions during absence\u2014the number being 48 against 34 in the preceding year; and partly by the large number of withdrawals of Members that took place in the first quarter of the year,\u2014the number being 8 out of a total of 17 withdrawals during the whole year.\n\nThe increase in the Expenditure is entirely due to Extraordinary payments not provided for in the Estimate. These fall under two heads: first, a payment of Rs. 2,293-0-3 made for the publication of Moore's Catalogue of Atkinson's Lepidoptera, Part III, towards meeting which Government Securities to the amount of Rs. 1,500 were sold out; and secondly, the amount of Rs. 403-11-0 classed under the head of \"Extraordinary Miscellaneous,\" consisting of Rs. 150 paid for auditing the Society's Accounts, and of Rs. 253-11-0 written off the accounts of the late Assistant Secretary at his death.\n\nThe Actual Ordinary Expenditure has been Rs. 15,277-12-4, showing a saving on the estimated expenditure of about Rs. 300, which sum has gone towards meeting a portion of the extraordinary charges above enumerated. The amount of Ordinary Expenditure above stated also covers a sum of Rs. 393 under the heading \"Building\" for which the Budget Estimate had provided only Rs. 50. It also covers an excess of actual over estimated expenditure under the heading \"Books,\" amounting to Rs. 682. The estimate under that heading for the ensuing year, has not, however, been increased, owing to a reduction having been effected in the number of publications subscribed for.\n\nThe Budget Estimate for 1887 shows few changes. On the Receipts side:\u2014the estimate under the heading \"Subscriptions\" is based upon the actuals of the last year; the amount under the heading \"Interest on Investments\" has been reduced by Rs. 200, owing to the sale of Government Securities noticed above; and the amount under the heading \"Sale of Periodicals\" is set down at half that estimated in the last Budget, as the latter had to take into account the sales effected through\nMessrs. Tr\u00fcbner and Co. during two years (1884-85). On the Expenditure side:\u2014the amount under the heading \"Books\" is also set down at half that estimated in the preceding year, for the same reason, with regard to purchases of books effected through the same agency. The adjustment of these Accounts was completed in September last, thus leaving only one year's Accounts to be provided for in the present Budget; also, the actual expenditure on the Journal, Part I having been Rs. 1,075-9-0 and on Journal, Part II, Rs. 2,761-10-4, and the experience of the last four years showing that it was difficult to estimate the division of the expenditure on the two Parts, the present estimate provides for both under the same heading, the total of the two amounts remaining unaltered.\n\nThe Budget Estimate for 1887 is as follows:\n\n**Receipts**\n\n| Description               | Amount |\n|---------------------------|--------|\n| Subscriptions             | Rs. 7,000 0 0 |\n| Sale of Periodicals       | Rs. 1,000 0 0 |\n| Interest on Investments   | Rs. 6,000 0 0 |\n| Miscellaneous             | Rs. 200 0 0 |\n| **Total**                 | Rs. 14,200 0 0 |\n\n**Expenditure**\n\n| Description               | Amount |\n|---------------------------|--------|\n| Salaries                  | Rs. 4,000 0 0 |\n| Commission                | Rs. 400 0 0 |\n| Stationery                | Rs. 150 0 0 |\n| Lighting                  | Rs. 80 0 0 |\n| Building                  | Rs. 50 0 0 |\n| Taxes                     | Rs. 816 0 0 |\n| Postage                   | Rs. 600 0 0 |\n| Freight                   | Rs. 20 0 0 |\n| Meeting                   | Rs. 90 0 0 |\n| Contingencies             | Rs. 150 0 0 |\n| Books                     | Rs. 1,500 0 0 |\n| Local Periodicals         | Rs. 50 0 0 |\n| Binding                   | Rs. 500 0 0 |\n| Coins                     | Rs. 10 0 0 |\n| Journal, Part I           | Rs. 4,200 0 0 |\n| \" Part II                 | Rs. 1,100 0 0 |\n| Proceedings               | Rs. 100 0 0 |\n| Printing Circulars        | Rs. 13,816 0 0 |\nLondon Agency.\n\nThe statement furnished by Messrs. Tr\u00fcbner and Co. of their account with the Society for 1885, showed a debit Balance of \u00a3107-8-8\u00bd; towards meeting which a remittance of \u00a3100 was made in September last. This unusually large and unfavourable balance was chiefly due to payments made by Messrs. Tr\u00fcbner for Plates for the Journal, Part II, amounting to \u00a391-12-0.\n\nThe sales of the Society's Publications effected by them during 1885 amounted to \u00a349-5-9; and of the Bibliotheca Indica to \u00a359-9-3.\n\nThe numbers of copies of parts of the Journal, of the Proceedings, and of the Bibliotheca Indica sent to Messrs. Tr\u00fcbner and Co. during 1886 for sale were 481, 300, and 1,659 respectively.\n\nEleven Invoices of Books purchased and of Publications of various Societies sent in exchange were received during 1886. The value of the Books purchased amounted to \u00a3106-19-3.\n\nLibrary.\n\nThe total number of printed volumes or parts of volumes added to the Library, during the year was 2,281, of which 895 were purchased and 1,386 were presented.\n\nA manuscript of the T\u00e1rikh-i-Firoz Sh\u00e1hi was presented to the Society by the Royal Asiatic Society of London on behalf of the late Mr. Edward Thomas.\n\nFour Catalogues of the Sanskrit, the Arabic and Persian, the Tibetan, and the Burmese Manuscripts are in progress.\n\nPublications.\n\nThere were published during the year ten Numbers of the Proceedings containing 181 pages of letter-press; three Numbers of the Journal, Part I, containing 203 pages of letter-press and 9 Plates; and three Numbers of the Journal, Part II, containing 298 pages of letter-press and 11 Plates; and a fourth, bringing up the number of pages of matter and of plates for the year to a total of 412 and 19 respectively, is in type and will be issued shortly.\n\nStock was taken towards the end of the year of the Publications for sale in the Store Room consisting of the Society's Publications and the Bibliotheca Indica.\n\nBuilding.\n\nThe expenditure on the building during the year was Rs. 393; of which Rs. 378 was for renewing beams and burgahs in the roof over the staircase, and Rs. 15 for refixing a lightning conductor.\nDuring the year under review, 129 Coins were added to the Cabinet, of which all, with the exception of 2 copper coins presented by R\u00e1\u00ed Shy\u00e1m Bah\u00e1dur of Chapra, were acquired under the Treasure Trove Act. Of these 117 were from the Bengal Presidency, and 10 from the Bombay Presidency. No coins were received from Madras, and there were no purchases. Of the 117 coins acquired in the Bengal Presidency, 3 were of gold, 95 of silver, and 19 of copper; detailed descriptions of which are given in the Society's Proceedings for January, February, April, June, July, November and December.\n\nThe 10 coins presented by the Government of Bombay consist of 1 gold coin of Aurangzib, 2 gold H\u00fan coins of Bij\u00e1pur, and of 2 coins of Aurungzib, 2 of Sh\u00e1h Jeh\u00e1n, 1 of Alamgir, 1 of Muhammad Sh\u00e1h and 1 of Farrokh S\u00edr, all of silver.\n\nOffice of the Secretaries.\n\nMr. J. Wood-Mason continued as Natural History Secretary throughout the year.\n\nDr. A. F. R. Hoernle left India on leave in June, when the duties of Philological Secretary were divided amongst three gentlemen, Mr. J. Beames, Mr. A. Hogg, and Pandit Harapras\u00e1d S\u00e1stri, who took charge of the Journal, Part I, the Coins, and the Bibliotheca Indica respectively. Mr. Beames resigned in August when Mr. H. Beveridge took his place, and has since continued in charge of the Journal, Part I.\n\nMr. F. E. Pargiter resigned the General Secretaryship in February, and Mr. H. M. Percival was appointed to succeed him.\n\nMr. F. W. Peterson continued as Treasurer till March, when, on his leaving India, his duties were taken up by the General Secretary.\n\nMr. J. F.

They belong to nineteen different works, of which four are in the\nArabic-Persian, and fifteen in the Sanskrit Series. There were no new publications in the former Series, whilst in the latter there were two, viz., \u0100\u015bvavaidyaka and V\u1e5bhi\u1e47n\u0101r\u0101diya Pur\u0101\u1e47a.\n\nIn the annual report of the preceding year (p. 16) it had been estimated that 48 fasciculi would be published in the course of the ensuing year, at a probable cost of Rs. 20,736. The actual out-turn has been 38 fasciculi. The expenditure out of the Oriental Publication Fund during the year (exclusive of a payment of Rs. 1,963-6-1 for Racks) amounted to Rs. 15,870-4-4, which sum includes Printing charges for 43 fasciculi and Editing charges for 34 fasciculi, and gives an average cost of Rs. 401 per fasciculus. For the year 1887 the out-turn may be reckoned at 45 fasciculi. These at the above average rate will cost Rs. 18,045. The average income calculated on the receipts of the last six years is Rs. 13,068, which gives an excess of estimated expenditure over income of Rs. 4,977, towards meeting which there is a Balance of Rs. 16,943.\n\nThe Editorship of the T\u0101rikh-i-Bud\u0101uni has been transferred from Maulavi Abul Khair Mahomed Siddik to Syed Shamsul Hud\u00e1, Professor, Calcutta Madrasa.\n\nDr. R.

Karan, Government Pleader, Monghyr, forwarding a facsimile copy of an inscription found on a small rock at the Kashtarun ghat, which he thought if deciphered would throw some light on the history of Monghyr, it was ordered that a facsimile impression be asked for.\n\nOn the recommendation of the Philological Committee, Pandit V\u00e1man S\u00e1stri Isl\u00e1mpurkar of Odeypore, was appointed to edit the Advaita Brahma Siddhi by Sad\u00e1nand Y\u00e1ti of Kashmir.\n\nAn offer from Pandit Harin\u00e1th Dvivedi to edit either the Ved\u00e1nta Kalpataru (with a Commentary, the Ved\u00e1nta Kalpataru Parim\u00e1l\u00e1) or the Sanskhepa Shariraka, was declined.\n\nAn estimate of Rs. 461-8-0 by Messrs. Mackintosh, Burn and Co. for putting new beams over the staircase, was referred to Mr. Medlicott.\n\nOctober 28th, Ordinary Meeting.\n\nWith reference to a letter from the Government of Bombay applying for the loan of twelve specified Sanskrit MSS. on behalf of Lt.-Col. G. A. Jacob, who was engaged in preparing a concordance to the Upani-shads, it was ordered that the MSS. be sent on loan to be renewed after twelve months.\n\nAn exchange of publications with the Anthropological Society of Bombay was sanctioned.\n\nMr. Medlicott, with reference to Messrs. Mackintosh, Burn & Co.'s estimate, reported that he had arranged through Mr. W. Girling, for the execution of the repairs at a cost of Rs. 360.\n\nA further examination of the roof of the building was ordered.\n\nNovember 25th, Ordinary Meeting.\n\nAn application from the Kambuli\u00e1tola Boy's Reading Club to be presented with the Society's Publications, was declined.\n\nThe Government, North West Provinces and Oudh, was informed that, according to an estimate furnished from the Surveyor General's office, the total cost of printing the Photographs, Maps and Plans of Mr. Hoey's report at that office would be Rs. 3,264, for 650 copies.\n\nA paper by Pandit M. V. Pandia, Meyw\u00e1r, containing a critical examination of the views of Kavir\u00e1j Shy\u00e1mal D\u00e1s on the antiquity, authenticity and genuineness of the epic Prithir\u00e1j Rasau commonly ascribed to Chand Bardai, which had been referred to the Philological Committee, was returned to the author.\nOn the resignation of the Hon. H. J. Reynolds, Mr. D. Waldie was appointed Vice-President, and Mr. E. Gay nominated to a Trusteeship of the Indian Museum, in his place.\n\nOn the recommendation of the Finance Committee, a second class passage to China, at a cost not exceeding Rs. 100 was procured for the Lama who had completed the Catalogue of Tibetan MSS., it being contrary to the Lama's principles to accept money payment for the same.\n\nThe printing of the Catalogue of Tibetan MSS, and of the Catalogue of Burmese MSS. with romanized titles, was ordered.\n\nThe Office-Bearers and other Members of Council for the next year were proposed.\n\nDecember 30th, Ordinary Meeting.\n\nAt the request of the Government of India, the name of Professor J. Darmesteter, Coll\u00e8ge de France, Paris, was added to the list of persons in Europe to whom Catalogues of Sanskrit MSS. are sent.\n\nRead a letter from the Government, North West Provinces and Oudh, offering to subscribe Rs. 1,000 towards the publication of Mr. Hoey's Report, on condition of receiving 150 copies of the work. The proposal was referred for further report to Col. Waterhouse.\n\nOn the recommendation of the Philological Committee, Dr. Garbe was appointed to edit Aniruddha's Commentary with extracts from the glosses of Ved\u0101nta Mah\u0101deva.\n\nThe Report having been read the President invited the Meeting to put any questions or offer any remarks which any member might think necessary in connection therewith.\n\nNo remarks having been offered the President moved the adoption of the Report. The motion was unanimously carried.\n\nThe President then addressed the Meeting as follows:\n\nAddress.\n\nThe Society.\u2014In the report of our General Secretary will be found all the information necessary regarding the Society's affairs, and it is not my intention now to review them again. I would merely note that our income about equals our ordinary expenditure, that we have Rs. 142,000 invested, of which Rs. 120,000 forms a close reserve fund, and the balance is available for extraordinary expenditure. From this source, your Council have voted a special grant of Rs. 1,000 for binding books and\nhave under consideration a proposal for a new manuscript room. These are the two next most pressing needs, a large outlay on iron-racks for storage purposes having been met during 1886. We have also at considerable trouble verified our stock of publications, and our accounts are now audited by professional accountants, as it was found that the time and labour demanded were such as could not reasonably be required from any private member. Before reviewing the work done during the year, I must tender my grateful acknowledgments for the services rendered by the office-bearers of the Society during my tenure of office:\u2014to Mr. H. M. Percival who has carried on the duties of General Secretary and Treasurer during the greater part of the year; to Mr. Wood-Mason for his services as Natural History Secretary, and to Dr. Hoernle, Mr. Beames, Mr. Beveridge, Pandit Hara Pras\u00e1da S\u00e1stri, and Mr. Hogg, who have at different times aided in the discharge of the various duties appertaining to the office of Philological Secretary. I would therefore call upon you for a vote of thanks to those gentlemen for their voluntary services, afforded in addition to arduous official duties, and without which we could not have succeeded in carrying on the work of the Society. (Carried unanimously.)\n\nObituary.\u2014It has ever been the painful duty of your President to bring more prominently before you on these occasions the names of those whom death has removed from us, and who have done good work through, or for, our Society. I have not been spared in this respect, and it is now my duty to announce the deaths of three distinguished members of our Society during the year, Mr. Edward Thomas, Mr. James Gibbs, and Mr. Arthur Grote. Mr. Thomas was a member of the Bengal Covenanted Civil Service, and some account of his life and writings was given at a previous meeting by the President and by Dr. Mitra, and will be found recorded in the Proceedings of the Society. From 1848 to 1884, he contributed numerous papers, on Indian, Indo-Baktrian, Indo-Sassanian, Iranian, and Armenian archaeology and numismatics, to the pages of the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society and of this Society, and to the Numismatic Chronicle, the Journal of the Numismatic Society of London, and the Journal Asiatique of Paris. He also edited Prinsep's papers on 'Indian Antiquities,' and took a principal part in the international edition of 'Marsden's Numismata Orientalia,' besides giving us, in his 'Revenues of the Moghul Empire in India' and 'Chronicles of the Path\u00e1n kings of Delhi,' records which must ever remain standard works of reference for Indian history. Mr. James Gibbs was a member of the Bombay Covenanted Civil Service, and was an active resident member up to a short time ago. It was only late in 1885 that he published a pamphlet 'On some\nrare and unpublished coins of the Path\u00e1n and Moghul dynasties of Dehli.' Though his contributions to our Proceedings are neither so numerous nor so important as those of Mr. Thomas, Mr. Gibbs's knowledge of the coins of Western India deservedly acquired for him a high reputation as a numismatist, and to this was added a ready disposition to aid others in his favourite pursuit such as is rarely to be met with.\n\nMr. A. Grote was a member of the Bengal Covenanted Civil Service. Born in 1814, he came to India in 1833 and filled successively the offices of Collector of Midnapur, Secretary of the Board of Revenue, Commissioner of the Nadiya Division, and Member of the Board of Revenue in Calcutta. From the year 1852, to 1855, he was Secretary of this Society, from 1856 to 1858, Vice-President, and from 1859 to 1862, President. Those amongst you who had the privilege of his acquaintance will remember the friendly help that he was ever ready to extend to all who needed counsel or encouragement. Mr. Grote retired in 1868, but did not on that account withdraw his interest from our Society and its affairs; for up to a very recent date he was in constant communication with several of our members, and on various occasions showed that in him we had in England a faithful counsellor and warm friend, ever ready when called upon to represent and protect our interests. Nor must I omit to mention the name of the late Babu R\u00e1jkrishna Mukharji though but for a short time connected with this Society. He was favourably known as a Beng\u00e1li writer, and in his collection of essays, historical and antiquarian, published under the name N\u00e1n\u00e1 prabandha, showed considerable learning and industry.\n\nPublications:\u2014Journal.\u2014The publications of the Society, as you are aware, are four in number, the Journal Part I representing philology and literature; the Journal Part II representing science; then come the Proceedings, containing records of our meetings and many minor papers; and the Bibliotheca Indica devoted to the publication of important unpublished Oriental texts and translations thereof. In the first Part of the Journal for 1886 are papers 'On some copper coins of Akbar found in the Kangra district' by Mr. Oliver, on a collection of South Indian coins by Captain Tunnell, on some symbols on the coins of Kunanda by Mr. Theobald, and a fourth list of coins supplementary to those given in Mr. Thomas' Chronicles of the Path\u00e1n kings of Dehli by our Associate member, Mr. C. J. Rodgers; all of which show that materials for original research still exist in this well-cultivated field. Kavir\u00e1j Shy\u00e1mal D\u00e1s of Mew\u00e1r has given us notes on the Prithir\u00e1j-r\u00e1sau commonly ascribed to Chand Bard\u00e1i, on the actual birth-day of the Emperor Akbar, and on the M\u00edn\u00e1 tribe of J\u00e1ipur in Mew\u00e1r. The migrations of these M\u00edn\u00e1s or\nMeos eastward to the Du\u00e1b and sub-Him\u00e1layan districts of the N.-W. Provinces should, when fully examined, throw much light on the early medi\u00e6val history of Upper India. In Mr. R. S. Whiteway's place-names in Merw\u00e1ra we have a useful contribution to local topography, and in Mr. Pargiter's notes on the dialect of the Chittagong district, an excellent contribution to the survey of the Indian dialects which we hope soon to see placed on a better and more comprehensive footing. Mr. Oliver's paper on the decline of the S\u00e1m\u00e1nis and the rise of the Ghaznav\u00eds in M\u00e1war\u00e1-un-Nahr and part of Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n is illustrated by some hitherto unpublished coins which enable us to fill up some gaps in the scanty records of the past of those regions. Babu Sarat Chandra D\u00e1s has also contributed a paper on the Buddhist and other legends about Khoten, the Li-yul of the Tibetans, and the Chandana of the early Indian writers.\n\nIn Part II of the Journal, we have contributions by Dr. Barclay on the species of uredine affecting the Him\u00e1layan spruce-fir (Abies smi-thiana) and the deod\u00e1r (Cedrus deodara), also descriptions of three new Him\u00e1layan primulae and two species of ilex by G. King, M. B., Superintendent of the Royal Botanical Gardens. A very interesting paper by the latter gentleman on some species of Ficus from New Guinea gives a new arrangement of the genus and descriptions of seventeen new species. In the domain of Zoology, the invertebrates are, at last, taking the place to which their scientific and economical importance entitle them. We have published during the year, papers on the Rhopalocerous Lepidoptera (butterflies) of Kumaon by an American entomologist, Mr. W. Doherty, and additional notes on new or rare Indian butterflies by the same writer, whilst Mr. de Nic\u00e9ville also describes and illustrates nine new Indian butterflies chiefly from Sikkim, and, with Mr. Wood-Mason, gives a list of the butterflies of Cachar. Mr. Elwes and Mr. de Nic\u00e9ville together publish a list of the butterflies of Tavoy, and the latter writer further adds to our knowledge of this popular order of insects by notes on the life-history of some Calcutta species of Satyrinae, in which he explains and proves the occurrence of seasonal dimorphism amongst them. Some species are furnished on the underside of the wings, in the broods that are on the wing during the rainy season, with strongly marked and conspicuous ocellated spots, whilst, in the same species, or other species that take their place, during the cold and dry seasons, those markings are obsolete or entirely wanting, and the general tone of coloration is much paler and more leaf-like. No sufficient explanation of this phenomenon has as yet been arrived at, but the fact has been distinctly proved by actual breeding, with the result that several species hitherto considered distinct must be held to be one and the same. Mr. Moore's paper on the Heterocerous Lepidoptera (moths) of Tavoy and\nSiam takes up this neglected, because more difficult, section of the order; and I am glad to be able to state that the third part of the descriptions of 'New Indian Lepidoptera from the collection of the late Mr. W. S. Atkinson' by the same writer is ready for publication.\n\nFor the Hymenoptera, we have the second part of a valuable paper by Professor Forel of Zurich on the Indian ants preserved in the Indian Museum, and a paper on the hive-bees indigenous to India and the introduction of the Italian bee by Mr. J. C. Douglas, whose efforts in this direction have been crowned with success. Mr. E T. Atkinson has completed his descriptive catalogue of the Homopterous section of the Indian Rhynchota with an index to the six parts, which for the first time collects in one place, with some additions and omissions, the original descriptions of all the insects of this section hitherto recorded from India; he also describes some new species. In his paper on the family Coccidae, the same writer calls attention to a section of the Rhynchota of much economical and commercial value. To it belong the pests of the coffee, tea, and chinchona and the lac-insect that affords the lac-dye and shell-lac of commerce. But little, however, can be accomplished in this direction until we have the services of an expert to devote himself exclusively to the investigation of the life-history of the local insects and the publication of the results, as is done in America by the entomological section of the Department of Agriculture. Mr. Wood-Mason gives us a paper on the Stomatopod crustaceans preserved in the Indian Museum; Dr. O. von Mollendorff, German Consul at Manilla, one on the land shells of Perak, and Mr. Hill, of the Muir College, a contribution of considerable value on solar observations at Allahabad.\n\nProceedings.\u2014In our Proceedings, we publish the notices of all acquisitions to our coin cabinet and in addition papers of minor importance. Amongst these, is a learned note by Dr. Mitra on the term 'Ekotibhava' in which he criticises some statements of Professor F. Max M\u00fcller. It should be some satisfaction to the learned doctor that Professor M\u00fcller has since acknowledged the value of these criticisms by accepting them. We have also a contribution to meteorological literature in the shape of a notice of snow-measurements taken at Kailung in Lahoul, communicated by Mr. H. F. Blanford. Also the substance of a lecture by Mr. C. Stevens of Brisbane on the Veddahs of Ceylon which gives us much information regarding this little known, and, from an Anthropological point of view, highly interesting people. I understand that we may soon expect a complete account of the Veddahs from a forthcoming work by Mr. C. W. Rosset, who has spent eighteen months amongst them. I would submit that this very brief survey of work done by the Society shows\nthat in its old age it has lost little of the vigour of its youth, and I congratulate you on the result.\n\n*Bibliotheca Indica.*\u2014The fourth issue of our Society is the 'Bibliotheca Indica' in which are published texts or translations of hitherto unpublished or untranslated works. The scheme was formulated and accepted many years ago chiefly through the exertions of our late member, Mr. J. W. Laidlay, and we have abundant testimony to the fact that it has well subserved the advancement of Oriental learning throughout the world. Its parts, as published, are sent free not only to nearly all the Oriental Societies and principal Universities in the world, but to many distinguished scholars, who would not otherwise, perhaps, be able to obtain them. Thirty-eight numbers were issued during the year, of which 11 belong to the Persian-Arabic series, and 27 to the Sanskrit series, bringing the total issues to nearly 600. All the parts of the Persian series are continuations of works previously sanctioned, and include Mr. Lowe's welcome translation of Bad\u00e1oni. The parts of the Sanskrit series are also chiefly continuations, and for them we have, in addition to our able local staff, secured the services of several well-known European scholars, such as Professor Jacobi of Kiel, Professor Julius Jolly of W\u00fcrzburg, and Professor A. Hillebrandt of Breslau.\n\nIn connection with the Bibliotheca Indica, I may here mention that amongst the matters that engaged the attention of your Council during the year was the furtherance of a scheme for furnishing aids to the study of Tibetan. The very valuable collection of Tibetan MSS. presented to the Society by Mr. B. H. Hodgson has been rearranged, and the contents collated, by a Buddhist Lama from the Tibetan district of Hor-tol: the catalogue formed is in the press and will be printed under the supervision of Babu Prat\u00e1pa Chandra Ghosha. Steps have also been taken to publish without, at present, any attempt at editing, selections from these manuscripts and thus open this long-neglected source of knowledge to European students. There are few in Europe and fewer still in India who make Tibetan a special study, and the principal reason is, I believe, the absence of texts. The first difficulty was the want of a good fount of type, for that used by Csoma de K\u00f6r\u00f6s for his dictionary and grammar, the only one at present in India, is in some respects defective. Mr. Thomas, our printer, has liberally come forward and relieved us from this difficulty by ordering a special fount from Europe, which is expected to arrive at an early date. Many of these Tibetan texts were translated from the original Sanskrit by Indian pandits in the tenth to the twelfth centuries, and, I am told, appear to possess a purer and more correct version in some cases than can now be found in India, whilst, for others, the Sanskrit original is still unknown.\nBabu Sarat Chandra D\u00e1s, who has lately been elected an Associate member of this Society on account of his contributions from Tibetan literature, has in hand a list of the philosophical and other technical terms in Tibetan and their equivalents in Sanskrit and in English. For this purpose he has been allowed to make use of the very valuable manuscript* of Csoma de K\u00f6r\u00f6s in the possession of the Society, and which contains the Tibetan terms with Sanskrit and English equivalents of a very large vocabulary of such words, all of which is in Csoma's own handwriting. He has also had at his disposal a rare Burmese manuscript on the same subject from our library. The work is a much needed one, for these terms have hitherto proved more or less of a stumbling-block to Tibetan students and a collection like that proposed should be of much service to them.\n\nThe Burmese and Siamese manuscripts in the possession of the Society have also been examined, and the former have been catalogued, by a Burmese monk from Upper Burma. The list formed is in the press and will be brought out under the supervision of Moung Hla Oung. Our new Pandit is engaged on the completion of the catalogue of our Sanskrit manuscripts, and a Maulvie from the Madrassah has similarly been employed on the list of our Arabic and Persian manuscripts under an arrangement made by Dr. Hoernle. I had hoped that the same gentleman would have given us his long promised 'Catalogue raisonn\u00e9' of the coins in our cabinet, but his absence from India has postponed the completion of this very necessary work for the present.\n\nNotices of Sanskrit MSS.\u2014I have to refer to another publication which may be regarded as a fifth part of our issues, and that is the 'Catalogue of Sanskrit manuscripts' in private libraries in Bengal, prepared by Dr. Mitra and published by the Society on behalf of Government. Similar lists have been compiled in almost every Province in India during the last eighteen years, and the time has now come when they should be collated and consolidated. Our local list was commenced in 1870, and, since then, 22 parts have been published, containing 2,975 pages and notices of 2,963 manuscripts, mostly illustrated by extracts from the originals. During 1886, some 74 pages containing 73 notices have been issued.\n\nWork outside the Society.\u2014It would be impossible for me to attempt an adequate description of the progress made outside our Society in the subjects to which the attention of its members is directed. These subjects embrace a wide, and as knowledge progresses, an\n\n* This manuscript is described at some length by Dr. Mitra in the Appendix, p. 207, of Duka's life of Csoma de K\u00f6r\u00f6s, which also contains much information regarding that distinguished Tibetan scholar's connection with this Society.\never increasing field, as the Society still holds to the rule laid down by its founder that \"the bounds of its investigation will be the geographical limits of Asia; and, within these limits, its inquiries will be extended to whatever is performed by man or produced by nature.\" It is also to be remembered that in most cases we have only received the European publications for the first half of the past year, and that the time chosen for the annual address is also the busiest one for almost all of us in our public and private avocations. Personally, I much regret that you have not before you to-day one who could satisfactorily carry out the programme, but, gentlemen, I was elected to the post that I have the honour to hold by your suffrages, and therefore the fault of having such an imperfect representative rests with you. I can only say that, craving your indulgence for its many imperfections and omissions, I will, with the assistance of the many* who have come forward to aid me, endeavour to give you some account of some portions of the work done outside the Society during a part of 1886.\n\nSurvey of India.\u2014We can always turn to the records of the Survey of India with the assurance that we shall find there something of novelty and interest. The great feature of the year has been the completion of the work undertaken by the Afghan Frontier-delimitation Commission on which three officers and several native surveyors have been so long employed. It will be some time before the results can be made ready for publication, and we are glad to learn that it is the intention of Government to collect and publish the whole of the reports as a separate volume. We, however, know that an independent traverse without a break was taken from Quettah to Kush\u00e1n, a distance of 767 miles. Between Nushki and Khw\u00e1jah Ali the country was triangulated, and a topographical survey was carried on along two separate routes, embracing an area of about 6000 square miles. The Helmand valley was mapped up to the Hamun, and the total area plane-tabled along the route amounted to 15,000 square miles. We have not yet details from which we can apportion to 1886 the work done in that year, but we know that the survey was continued and carried on to K\u00e1b\u00fal itself on the return journey, and that Captain Gore proceeded from Khami\u00e1b through Her\u00e1t to Kirm\u00e1n and thence to Bandar Abb\u00e1s on the Persian Gulf. The Survey of India was also represented on Colonel Lockhart's Gilgit mission, which traversed much new ground, including parts of Chitr\u00e1l, Yassin, and the borders of K\u00e1f\u00edrist\u00e1n, and should be able to fill up many blank spaces on our maps. In connection with this elevated region reference may\n\n* I would particularly record my obligations to Mr. H. B. Medlicott, Dr. G. King, Dr. D. D. Cunningham, Dr. Burgess, Mr. H. Blanford, Mr. G. A. Grierson, and Mr. H. Risley.\nbe made to a journey made in K\u00e1rateghin and D\u00e1rw\u00e1z, in 1882, by the Russian traveller Kosiakof, an account of which appears in the Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society for January 1886.\n\nIn the Trigonometrical branch of the Survey, there were two parties engaged on electro-telegraphic longitude operations; several arcs were measured between Trigonometrical stations, and a party was employed in fixing by triangulation the positions of prominent land-marks and in erecting beacons along the east coast of Madras for the purposes of the marine survey. The tidal and levelling party continued its usual work of tide-registering and spirit-levelling. The operations of the Topographical branch of the Survey were carried on in the Andaman Islands, Lower Burma, Mysore, Kachh, Gujar\u00e1t, the Konkan, and the Dekkan in the Bombay Presidency, also in R\u00e1jput\u00e1na, the Mirz\u00e1pur district of the N.-W. Provinces, and in Baluch\u00edst\u00e1n, in continuation of the work of former years. The surveys of the Andaman Islands, Mysore, and Kachh were completed during the year. The Hill survey party was transferred from the Sikkim station to K\u00e1ngra and the Hill States around Simla, there to serve as a school for military officers to fit them for reconnaissance in the field. Cadastral surveys for the purposes of the settlement of the land-revenue were carried on in the Bil\u00e1spur district of the Central Provinces, the Gorakhpur and Basti districts of the N.-W. Provinces, the Kamr\u00fap district in Assam, and the Aky\u00e1b district in Burma; the similar survey undertaken in the Muzaffarpur district of Bengal, for the purpose of forming a basis for a record of rights, has been stopped by orders of the Secretary of State.\n\nGeography.\u2014We have some papers bearing on the geography of Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n in the contributions to the Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society. That by Sir Peter Lumsden properly belongs to the history of 1885, as also does that by Major Holdich, R. E., on the measures taken to fix the geographical position of Mashad in north-eastern Persia. Col. C. E. Stewart's paper on 'The Her\u00e1t valley and the Persian border from the Hari-rud to Seist\u00e1n' gives an account of an interesting reconnaissance made by him, from Kh\u00e1f as a centre, to Mashad on the north, Karez on the east, Gazdun and Duruh on the south, and Kundar on the west, through a little-known country. He also discusses the physical and political possibilities of a railway from Quettah to Her\u00e1t. More connected with purely Indian geography is the discussion, in the same Proceedings, between Mr. Freshfield and a well-known and distinguished member of our Society, General Walker, on the actual position of Mount Everest. We have also a paper 'On the River systems of Southern India' by General Rundall, in which is advocated the formation of storage works for economising the water-supply and the perfecting of\ncanal and river-navigation in the peninsula as the best means for ameliorating the results of seasons of drought.\n\nMuch had been expected from the well-equipped Mission to Tibet under Mr. C. P. Macaulay, and we can only regret that, where all the conditions deserving of success were present, the Mission was not allowed to proceed to Lh\u00e1s\u00e1. In the fourth and last journey of the distinguished Russian traveller, General Prejevalsky, we have, however, added considerably to our knowledge of Tibetan geography. He examined the northern border of the great Tibetan plateau, hitherto absolutely unknown, except from the vaguest tradition. In a letter, translated in the Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society, General Prejevalsky describes the northern boundary as formed on the east by a range of mountains, named by him the Kerian (Keriiski), extending for 107 miles, east to west, between the rivers Keria and Yuran-kash, the latter dividing it from the mountains which continue the chain westward to the K\u00e1ra-korum. The Kerian range appears as a high, steep, disrupted, wall of mountains, surpassing the snow-line throughout its extent, and in places rising in groups to a height of over 20,000 feet. During the whole time of the stay of the traveller in this lofty belt, rain continued to fall, brought there probably by the Indian monsoon and continuing during the three summer months, being heaviest in July. These rains are said to account for the profusion of glaciers and the existence of pasturage between 9000 and 12,000 feet, on which feed numerous flocks of fine-woolled sheep.\n\nMr. H. E. M. James of the Bombay Covenanted Civil Service, accompanied by Mr. F. E. Younghusband and Mr. H. Fulford, has recently made a journey through the Chang-pei-shan mountains of Manchuria, and has visited the sources of the river Sungari, reaching a part not hitherto visited by Europeans. The party leaving Monkden, the capital of southern Manchuria, reached the Pei-shan, or white mountain, the highest of the group, and found it to consist of a recently extinct volcano, with a lovely blue pellucid lake filling the bottom of the crater, and surmounted by a serrated circle of peaks rising far above the surface of the water. This lake is about $1\\frac{1}{2}$ miles across and from six to seven miles in circumference. From its northern end issues a small stream forming the eastern branch of the Sungari, whilst the western branch owes its origin to several streams rising on the south-east face of the Pei-shan. The party returned by another route to Kirin, the capital of central Manchuria, and have proceeded thence to northern Manchuria. Mr. Needham's very interesting account of his journey from Sadiya on the Brahmaputra in Upper Assam to Rima on the Zayal-chu, published in the same Proceedings, seems to establish,\non a firm basis, the identity of the Dihong river of Assam with the Sanpo of Tibet, as held by the majority of Indian geographers.\n\nFrom the same source, we have a paper 'On the exploration survey for a Railway connection between India, Siam and China' by Mr. Holt S. Hallett which gives an interesting account of the country lying between the Lower Ir\u00e1wadi, Northern Siam, and the Chinese frontier. The line proposed by him would extend from Maulmain to Raheng; the main line passing through 481 towns and villages, with one terminus at the sea-port of Bangkok and another at Kiang Hseu, only 190 miles from China, and situated in a vast, fertile plain now being repopled by the Sh\u00e1ns of Upper Burma and Siam. We have also an account of a 'journey in South-western China from Ss\u00fc-chian to Western Yunnan' by Mr. A. Hosie, and by Mr. J. G. Scott a paper 'on the hill-slopes of Tong-king,' both of which add considerably to our knowledge of those little-known regions. In 'Burma, the country and people' by Mr. J. Annan Bryce, we possess an admirable summary of general information founded on many years' residence and personal exploration; a great part of the basin of the Kyendwin described by him had never been previously noticed, and his paper is full of facts of considerable value for ethnological and geographical purposes. Nor must I omit to mention the issue of the second edition of the Imperial Gazetteer of India by the Hon'ble W. W. Hunter, giving the results of the latest census and correcting the few errors which in a work of the kind must occur.\n\nArchaeological Survey.\u2014On the retirement of that distinguished and old member of our Society, General Cunningham, from the Archaeological Survey, the organization of the Survey in Upper India was remodelled on a plan prepared by the retiring Director-General, and, from October 1885, the provinces previously under his supervision were divided into three circles:\u2014(a.) Bengal with Assam and the S. E. districts; (b.) N. W. Provinces and Oudh with Central India and the Central Provinces; and (c.) the Panj\u00e1b and R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. Each circle was to have a Surveyor and an assistant and a head-draftsman; and Dr. Burgess was appointed head of the surveys and adviser to Government, and subsequently was made Director-General with extended powers and the control of all conservation works. It was also arranged that an allotment should be made for the translation of inscriptions by competent Oriental scholars in this country or in Europe.\n\nPanj\u00e1b.\u2014During 1883, the Surveyor in the Panj\u00e1b, Mr. Rodgers, who is also an Associate Member of our Society and a frequent contributor to its Journal, made a tour to the places of interest in the districts of Gurd\u00e1sipur and Kangra, and has prepared a number of drawings of in-\nteresting old buildings. He has also collected a large number of old coins of various dynasties, which will be described in his Report. It is understood that all coins, sculptures, and other antiquarian objects collected by the staff shall be strictly considered as State property and shall belong to the principal museum of the circle, but arrangements may be made for certain exceptions (including duplicates) in favour of the Imperial and other Museums and also for exchanges and casts. I can only hope that these arrangements may have a liberal tendency in so far as they affect the Indian Museum, which is to all intents and purposes the Museum of our Society and contains the nucleus of a fairly representative study-collection from various parts of India.\n\nN.-W. Provinces.\u2014In the North-Western Provinces and Oudh circle, under Dr. A. F\u00fchrer, who is an Associate Member of our Society, and Mr. E. Smith, some 64 inscriptions in Arabic, Persian, and Sanskrit were collected and translated, of which 30 were new and some were of considerable historical importance. In Jaunpur, the capital of the local Sharki dynasty in the fifteenth century, careful architectural drawings were made of the J\u00e1ma, At\u00e1la, and Jhinjari Masjids, chiefly built from materials derived from older Hindu temples, and themselves illustrating a peculiar style of architecture. The Report will also deal with the ancient remains at Zafar\u00e1b\u00e1d, Ayodhy\u00e1, Sahet-Mahet, and Bhuila-T\u00e1l. This last place was identified by Mr. Carllyle (Arch. Rep. xii, p. 182) with Kapilavastu, but Dr. F\u00fchrer dissents from this.\n\nBengal.\u2014In Bengal, the Surveyor, Mr. J. D. Beglar, and his assistant, Mr. Garrick, have examined more or less completely the remains of interest in the Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d, Gay\u00e1, Patna, Munger, Bh\u00e1galpur, H\u00fagli, and Nadiy\u00e1 districts and the Santh\u00e1l Parganahs. The fortress of Shergarh has been visited and sections and detailed plans and drawings of the great tombs of Sher Sh\u00e1h and his father at S\u00e1sser\u00e1m have been prepared. In Gay\u00e1, under the guidance and direction of General Cunningham, Mr. Beglar opened trial trenches in a place to the north of the temple within the old 'garh' or fort, with the result that the remains of a building were discovered that may reasonably be identified with one of the great monasteries mentioned by Fah Hian, the Chinese traveller, in the fifth century. In Patna, an examination of the river-wall of the fort has led Mr. Beglar to the belief that its foundations contain remains of the landward walls of the fortress that existed there in Asoka's time, in the third century before Christ. Sections and plans have also been prepared of the Adina mosque, in the Malda district, the most ancient and the most important of the Muhammadan buildings in Bengal. Steps have been already taken to conserve in a measure the buildings around the site of the famous bo-tree at Gay\u00e1, and selections from the scattered remains\nfound there will find a home in the Indian Museum. The suggestion of Mr. E. Arnold that the present occupant of the Hindu temple at Gay\u00e1 should be induced to give up his acquired right of occupancy, and that the place so sacred in the annals of Buddhism should be handed over to the care of Ceylon Buddhists, will doubtless receive consideration, but we should not forget in this connection that we have in Burma even a greater number of Buddhist fellow-subjects who desire and deserve consideration.\n\nBombay.\u2014In Western India, H. H. the Gaikw\u00e1r procured a survey to be made by the Archaeological Department of the ancient fort of Dubhoi, the results of which will, it is believed, be published. The early mosque at Bharoch, with its richly carved ceilings, torn from Jaina temples, was also surveyed, and the latter half of the last season was devoted to a careful delineation of the early Chalukyan temples in the Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r district and on the borders of Mysore. These temples appear to represent a distinctly marked architectural style, and in their chronological sequence can be clearly traced the development of that style from the slightly modified Dravidian temples of the seventh and eighth centuries to the fully developed and richly carved Chalukyan works of four centuries later. The drawings prepared by the Survey will illustrate the richness of Hindu art in medieval times in a manner that has never before been attempted. Numerous old inscriptions in the K\u00e1narese character were also collected and submitted for decipherment. H. H. the Gaikw\u00e1r has asked for a party to examine the remains of the celebrated city of Anhillawada-Patjan, once the capital of the Solankhis, and also the remains at Sidhapura and Mudhera. The same survey party will visit other remains in Gujar\u00e1t and the east of K\u00e1thi\u00e1war, including the Jaina shrine of Satrunjaya.\n\nMadras.\u2014In Southern India, the Survey, during last season, traversed the country lying along the north-east frontier of Mysore from Pennakonda to the Tungabhadra, delineating numerous remains both of the Chalukyan and Vijayanagar dynasties, and collecting facsimiles of stone and copper-plate inscriptions. A copper-plate grant in old Pr\u00e1krit, belonging to the Pallava dynasty, and of the fourth or fifth century A.D. was procured in the Bel\u00e1ri district, and another very important inscription of the Pallavas found on a large marble pillar at Amar\u00e1vati has been read by Dr. Hultzsch. During the present season, after completing the examination of Mah\u00e1vallipuram, the staff will take up the antiquarian remains at Vell\u00far and other places in the North Arcot district and the vicinity. In March last, Dr. Burgess made a personal visit to the remote shrine of Sri S\u00e1lam in the Nallamallas, or Black mountains, and sees reason to think that it is one with the Po-lo-mo-lo-ki-li rock or\nmountain, mentioned by Hinen-Tsiang, the Chinese traveller. It was here that a king in Southern Kosala built for the Bodhisattva N\u00e1g\u00e1rjuna, a sangh\u00e1r\u00e1ma, and here was passed a great portion of the saint's life. Dr. Burgess has in the press a monograph on the Amar\u00e1vati st\u00fapa, illustrated by about 70 plates, mostly autotypes. It will include new versions of the Asoka edicts at Jaugada and Dhanli by Dr. G. B\u00fchler from fresh impressions taken by Dr. Burgess himself.\n\nAn effort which cannot fail to obtain the approval of this Society is now being made to secure complete lists and impressions of all old inscriptions arranged by districts. This is a work in which every member of this Society can, with very little trouble to himself, considerably aid the objects of the Survey, by sending transcripts or impressions of inscriptions to the local Surveyor or lists of places where they are to be found. Attention is also being directed to the more careful preservation of all ancient remains, including the dolmens and stone circles of the south of India and the old village sites and ruined st\u00fapas in the Panj\u00e1b and R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. Nor should it be omitted to state that the Maharaja of Jaipur is giving generous encouragement to Colonel S. Jacob to complete and publish his collection of examples of architectural ornament formed from specimens at Amber and other towns within the Maharaja's territories.\n\nIndian Antiquary.\u2014In philology, arch\u00e6ology, and literature relating to India, the Indian Antiquary continues to hold its high place, and, to judge from the quantity and variety of its contents, to meet with the liberal support that it certainly deserves. Your attention may be called to the continuation of the Sanskrit and old K\u00e1narese inscriptions by Mr. Fleet, of which eight are given (Nos. 160\u2014167), and Dr. B\u00fchler's Vallabhi inscriptions, of which the eighteenth number appears. Mr. Fleet also has a paper on the Gupta era in which he follows Al Bir\u00fani's statement that the Gupta era began within a year or two on either side of A.D. 319-20, but denies that this was also the date of the extermination of the Guptas, and not of their rise to power. Mr. Fleet also gives grounds for believing that this Gupta era was used in Nep\u00e1l by the Lichchhavis, whilst at the same time the Sr\u00edharsha era, established by Harshavardhana of Kanauj, was used by Ansuvarman and his successors. The same writer also gives a paper on the history and date (515 A.D.) of Mihirakula son of Toram\u00e1na known from the boar inscription at Eran in the Central Provinces which was originally edited by Dr. Mitra and published in our Journal.* Dr. Kielhorn contributes a paper on the S\u00e1sbahu inscription of Mahip\u00e1la on the Vaishnava temple at Gwalior, correcting a former reading pub-\n\n* See Journal XXX, p. 267; XXXIV, p. 115: Arch. Rep. IV, 96.\nlished in our Journal,* and also on two copper-plate grants of Jayachandra of Kanauj, the translation of one of which was previously published in Colebrooke's Essays,\u2020 and of the other in our Journal;\u2021 Dr. E. Hultzsch, now attached to the Archaeological Survey of India, revises the transcript and translation of an inscription found in the fort of Gwalior and originally published in our Journal.\u00a7 The same writer retranscribes and edits the Bhagalpur plate of Narayanapala which is preserved in our library and has also been published in our Journal.|| If to these be added the paper by the Rev. S. Beal on the age and writings of the great Bodhisattwa Nagarjuna, the record of work done similar to that undertaken by this Society is highly to be commended. I would add that the papers quoted as correcting articles that have appeared in our Journal, exhibit a judicial, scholarly tone, fully appreciative of the work done by members of this Society, and giving the result of later and more perfect investigation.\n\nOther Journals.\u2014Subsidiary to the Indian Antiquary and subserving a distinct purpose is the Indian Notes and Queries intended to conserve such waifs and strays of philology, archeology, and folk-lore as might not be considered of sufficient importance for the other Journals. With this may be mentioned Captain Temple's 'Panjab Legends,' a serial work sufficiently described in its title. The last number of the Journal of the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society contained a number of papers read during the years 1883-4-5, and since then no others have appeared. The Ceylon branch of the same Society appears not to have issued a number during 1886, but, in the Journal of the North China Branch, we have a paper by Mr. G. Phillips on the seaports of India and Ceylon, and, in connection therewith, I would mention one, in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of London, by the Rev. J. Edkins, on ancient navigation in the Indian ocean, which, however, appears to be only introductory to the subject, as it is chiefly taken up with a critical examination of the early Chinese writers. Other papers of interest to us in the same Journal are one by Sir Monier Monier-Williams, one of our centenary members, giving an account of Buddhism in its relation to Brahmanism and one by Mr. R. Sewell, of the Madras Covenanted Civil Service, on Buddhist symbolism, a subject apparently attracting some attention at present, as the papers by Mr. H. Murray-Aynsley in the Indian Antiquary show. Mr. G. A. Grierson also gives specimens of Bhojpuri\n\n* Journal XXXI, p. 411: Arch. Rep. II, 357.\n\u2020 Ess. II, p. 286.\n\u2021 Journal X (i), p. 98.\n\u00a7 Journal XXXI, p. 418: Arch. Rep. II, 354.\n|| Journal, XLVII, (i), p. 384.\nfolk-songs with a translation and index, and Mr. F. Pincott, the results of a laborious examination of the arrangement of the hymns of the Adigranth of the Sikhs. Captain Talbot furnishes an account of the rock-cut caves and statues at Bami\u00e1n, illustrated with notes by Mr. W. Simpson and Captain Maitland, and by plans and drawings of these remarkable Buddhist remains.\n\nForeign Journals.\u2014Turning now to foreign Oriental Societies, I would call attention to the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Paris (Journal Asiatique), which contains M. Senart's continuation of his papers on the language of the edicts of Piyadasi (Asoka) and M. H. Sanvaire's continuation of his contributions to our knowledge of Musalm\u00e1n numismatics and metrology, also M. S. Levi's paper on the Brihatkath\u00e1manjari of Kshemendra. The Journal of the German Oriental Society (Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenl\u00e4ndischen Gesellschaft), published in Leipzig, has several papers of interest:\u2014one by Dr. E. Hultzsch, on a 'Collection of Indian manuscripts and inscriptions,' in which an account is given of a journey made through upper India, with a list of some 483 manuscripts collected by the author, of which 115 are Jaina works; the list gives bare titles without detailed comment or explanation. Dr. Hultzsch also notices and translates inscriptions from the temple of V\u00e1llabha\u1e6d\u1e6dasv\u00e1min in the fort of Gwalior, one of which was previously published in our Journal.* He then describes and translates an inscription on stone at Dholpur dealing with Chandamah\u00e1sena: five copper-plates from Tezpur in Assam of a Raja Vallabhadeva; two fragments of inscriptions of the Bundelkhand Chandels preserved at Allahabad and others from Benares, and gives us an index to the words of the Bharhat inscription. Professor Jacobi continues his Jaina studies in the same Journal, and contributes a paper supplementary to his treatise on the origin of the Svet\u00e1mbara and Digambara sects. His conclusion is that the origin of the Bodhiya sect is much later than that of the Digambaras, and that the separation of the latter from the Svet\u00e1maras was a gradual process commencing in the time of Bhadrab\u00e1hu and continued through the next generation. He also has a note on the nirosthyavarna, or absence of labial letters in a portion of the Dasakum\u00e1ra charitra; and on the play of words called yamaka (in which the word at the end of each line commences the next line) that occurs in the S\u00fatrakrit\u00e1nga. Professor Pischel, in his Vedica, furnishes notes on various words and phrases taken from the Rig-Veda. I would also mention Professor B\u00fchl\u00e9r's continuation of his notes on the Asoka inscriptions, in which he more particularly compares the second half of the thirteenth edict from the Girn\u00e1r and Khalsi inscriptions, and a note by the veteran O. B\u00f6htlingk on a previous paper of Dr. B\u00fchl\u00e9r. H. H.\n\n* Journal XXXI, p. 407.\nDhruva continues his notices of Sanskrit grants and inscriptions of Gujrat kings; H. Jacobi devotes a paper to our knowledge of Arya; and there is another by Dr. E. Hultzsch on inscriptions from Amaravati. In the same Journal is a valuable contribution from P. von Bradke on Asura and Marut, in which he endeavours to show the true signification of those terms. In the Nachrichten von der K\u00f6niglichen Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften, Dr. Hultzsch has a paper on Mataraja's drama T\u0101pasavatardja, in which this work is ascribed to the second half of the ninth century, and the author is shown to be indebted to Buddhist sources for much of his plot.\n\nIn L'\u00e9pigraphie et l'histoire linguistique de l'Inde by another of our centenary members, M. Senart, that distinguished scholar treats of the linguistic history of India from the stand-point of epigraphy and arrives at several novel conclusions, deserving of great consideration. From the inscriptions of Piyadasi, it is evident that the Vaidik and religious languages attained to considerable culture at about the beginning of the third century before Christ. As regards classical Sanskrit, its elaboration should be placed between the same date and the first century A.D. and its general use in literary and official documents at the end of the first or beginning of the second century A.D. With reference to the mixed Sanskrit, called the dialect of the g\u0101th\u0101s, it is only a form of writing Prakrit, which was popularised, especially by the Buddhist Raja Karushka, and became a literary dialect in certain schools of Buddhism. As regards the Prakrits, the earlier establishment of Sanskrit determines their grammatical form, which was fixed in the third or fourth century, so that none of the works in these dialects can be considered as existing in their present form before that time. In the Journal of the American Oriental Society, we have papers on Vaidik subjects by Mr. M. Bloomfield; on the Dravidians by T. S. Chandler; on negative clauses in the Rig-veda by Miss E. Channing; Hindu Eschatology and the Katha Upanishad by Professor Whitney, whose severe criticisms of Professor Max M\u00fcller's work must be known to you all; and on the warrior caste in India and lexicographical notes on the Mahabharata by E. W. Hopkins, who also undertook the completion of Mann's Institutes on the death of Dr. A. C. Burnell. I would indicate the Athen\u00e6um, and Academy, amongst English papers, and the Oriental Journal to be published in Vienna, as a continuation of the Oesterreichische Monatschrift f\u00fcr den Orient and the German Literary Gazette (Deutsche Litteraturzeitung) founded by Dr. Max R\u00f6diger in Berlin, amongst foreign papers, other than the Journals of Societies, in which those engaged in Oriental studies will always find matters of interest, especially in the short notices of what has been done, or is being done, and has not yet been published.\nOther Works.\u2014In the invaluable series entitled 'Sacred Books of the East,' translated by various Oriental scholars and edited by Professor F. Max M\u00fcller, we have, almost at first hand, ample materials for an accurate estimation of the religions of Asia, from Japan in the extreme east to Arabia in the west. Twenty-four volumes of the first series have been published, and a second series of twenty-four volumes has been commenced, of which the Satapatha-Brahmana, part II, by Professor Eggeling, and the Li-ki, or 'Collection of treatises on the rules of propriety or ceremonial usages,' forming parts II and III of the 'Texts of Confucianism,' by the veteran Sinologist, Dr. James Legge, have reached us during the year. The following works are under publication:\u2014Manu by Dr. G. B\u00fchler; the Grihya-s\u00fbtras or rules of Vedic domestic ceremonies by Professor H. Oldenberg; the Yajna, Visparad, Afrig\u00e2n, and G\u00e2ds of the Zend-Avesta by the Rev. L. H. Mills; Vedic Hymns by Professor F. Max M\u00fcller; N\u00e2rada and some minor Law-books by Professor J. Jolly; and the Ved\u00e2nta-s\u00fbtras with Sankara's commentary by Dr. G. Thibaut. In the Aryan section of the Anecdota series, also published at the Clarendon Press in Oxford, are several of the Buddhist texts of Japan and China, of which the last received is the Dharma-samgraha, a collection of Buddhist technical terms. In the Divy\u00e2d\u00e2na, a collection of early Buddhist legends, edited by Professor Cowell and Mr. R. A. Neil, we have an addition of some value to our extensive Buddhistic literature. Dr. G. B\u00fchler too, has done good service by his translation of Pandit Bhagw\u00e1n L\u00e2l's work on Nep\u00e2lese inscriptions, which, taken with Mr. Bendall's 'Journey of literary and arch\u00e6ological research in Nep\u00e1l and Northern India' and Dr. Wright's Nep\u00e1l, has considerably advanced our knowledge of the early history of that country.\n\nDuring the year, one volume of the history of the 'Local Muhammadan dynasties of Gujar\u00e2t' by our late member Sir E. Clive Bayley has been published. It is partly based on work left unfinished at his death by Professor Dowson, and contains extracts relating to Gujar\u00e2t from the Mir\u00e2t-i-Ahmadi, Mir\u00e2t-i-Sikandari, Tabak\u00e2t-i-Akbari, and other works. It is intended, so far as they can be recovered, that extracts from other works on Gujar\u00e2t history only shall be presented in a second volume. The same volume contains an appreciative notice by Colonel H. Yule of the life of Sir E. Clive Bayley and his work in India, much of which was performed through or for this Society. The year, too, has seen the publication of that very interesting work by Colonel H. Yule and the late A. C. Burnell, bearing the quaint title of 'Hobson-Jobson' and being a glossary of Anglo-Indian colloquial words and phrases, and of kindred terms, etymological, historical, geographical, and discursive. It fully bears out the promise of its somewhat compre-\nhensive title, and brings together and learnedly digests scraps of inform-\nation on the subjects discussed from almost all possible sources. Nor\nmust I omit to mention the new edition of Manu's Institutes and the\nprincipal commentary thereon brought out by our member, the Honora-\nble Rao Sahib V. N. Mandlik. Also the Subhashitavali of Vallabha-\ndeva of Kashmir, containing extracts from the works of nearly 350\ndifferent poets of Kashmir and upper India, and edited by Professor\nPeterson and Pandit Durga Prasad. The notes are especially valuable\nas affording much information regarding the lives of the authors and\nthe places in which they wrote. Editions of the Yajur Veda in\nVaidik, Sanskrit, and Hindi have appeared at Agra by Bhargava Jvala\nParshada, and at Allahabad by Dayanand Sarasvati, the latter of whom\nis also bringing out a similar edition of the Rigveda.\n\nLexicography.\u2014In lexicography and in the preparation of lists and\ngrammars of dialects considerable advance has been made. Dr. B\u00f6h-\nlingk is bringing to completion the abbreviated edition of his great\nSanskrit dictionary; and we look forward with interest to the appear-\nance of Mr. Anandaram Borooah's edition of the Amarakosha, of which\nalso reprints have issued in Bombay and Calcutta during the year. In\nthe Revue de linguistique et de Philologie compar\u00e9e, M. R. de la Grasserie\nhas a paper, comparing the words relating to number in all languages,\nand in which he advances several novel ideas as to the abstract and\nconcrete conception of number in the various families of speech.\n\nAssam.\u2014Due in a great measure to the encouragement offered by Mr.\nC. A. Elliott, when chief Commissioner of Assam, considerable activity\nhas been shown of late in the preparation of lists and grammars of the\nlanguages of Assam. Amongst those of recent issue are the 'Outline\ngrammar of the Kachari language' by the Rev. S. Endle; 'Short account\nof the Kachari Nagas tribe with an outline grammar, vocabulary and\nillustrative sentences' by Mr. C. A. Soppitt; and by the same writer a\n'Historical and Descriptive account of the Kachari tribes in the north\nKachari Hills with specimens of tales and folk-lore.' Professor Avery,\nin the pages of the Journal of the American Oriental Society, has given\nus papers on the Garo language, that of the Lepchas of Sikkim, and that\nof the Ao-Nagas, inhabiting the hills forming the southern border of the\nSibsagar district; they call themselves Ao but are more commonly\nknown by their Assamese names, Hatigonias, Dupdorias, Assiringias, &c.\nA dictionary of the Garo language is under preparation by the American\nMissionaries at Tura. Major Macgregor's Singpho grammar and 'Rough\nnotes on the Singphos and Khamptis,' printed at Dibrugarh, are both of\npractical philological and ethnographical value. To these we may add Mr.\nNeedham's Abor grammar, Mr. MacCabe's Angami-Naga grammar, and the\nprojected grammar of the Kuki by Mr. C. A. Soppitt, of the Bhutia Changlo by Mr. E. Stack, and of the Garo and Miri, besides a Tipura vocabulary. There does not appear to be any sign of growth in the published indigenous Assamese literature, which seems to be confined chiefly to translations from the Bengali, and has not given us a single original work of importance during the year.\n\nBurma.\u2014From Burma we have Mr. James Gray\u2019s educational works in Pali, his translation of \u2018Ancient proverbs and maxims from Burmese sources,\u2019 and a Burmese primer, besides Meng Po Hla\u2019s notes on Burmese and Pali grammar, and a collection of Anglo-Burmese stories. Judson\u2019s Anglo-Burmese dictionary, Cushing\u2019s Shan dictionary, and Forbes\u2019 \u2018Comparative grammar of the languages of Further India\u2019 appear to hold their old position and have not been superseded.\n\nSemitic.\u2014The issues in Arabic chiefly comprise extracts from the Koran, grammars, and vocabularies, and another volume of Mr. M. S. Howell\u2019s \u2018Grammar of classical Arabic\u2019 in English.\n\nIranian Aryan.\u2014The Parsis of Gujar\u00e1t have reprinted the Vendidad and other portions of the Zend scriptures with notes in Gujarati. Throughout upper India, Persian literature receives much attention and is considered a necessary study both for the man of the world and the man of business. Reprints, with some original works, have appeared of poetical, historical, and especially of devotional treatises. Pushto has but a few works chiefly of a religious tendency.\n\nIndian Aryan.\u2014Urdu is the popular literary language of the Musalm\u00e1n population throughout upper India, and is cultivated also in Bombay and Madras. In number, its publications exceed those in any other language, and we have to record some progress in grammars and dictionaries from a purely native point of view. Hindi literature was enriched by a new edition of Tulsi Das\u2019s Ramayana, and, in the first and second books of extracts from Hindi, possesses an excellent chrestomathy. I would also mention the translation of some of Shakspeare\u2019s plays by Kasinath Khatri and many original dramatic compositions. In Gujarati, besides a new English-Gujarati dictionary, there are reprints of old poems by M. Mehta, translations of the Yasna and Visparad with critical notes, and of the Ramayana, and also a collection of Jaina prayers in Magadhi and Gujarati. The Sindhi Vyutpatti-kosha contains a vocabulary of Sindhi words derived from Sanskrit roots. In Marathi, there are few original works of importance, but there are several translations showing a high degree of cultivation. In Bihari, the \u2018Comparative Dictionary of the Bihari language\u2019 by Dr. Hoernle and Mr. G. A. Grierson is making good progress. The second part is now all in type and the third is well advanced in manuscript, and will fully come up to the great expectations formed of this,\nthe principal contribution to the lexicography of the Indian dialects that has appeared of late years. Mr. Grierson has published the sixth part of his \"Seven grammars of the dialects and sub-dialects of the Bihari language.\" Those which have appeared comprise: 1. Introductory with maps: 2. Bhojpuri dialect of Shahabad, Saran, Champaran, North Muzaffarpur and the eastern districts of the N.W. Provinces; 3. Magadh\u00ed dialect of South Patna and Gay\u00e1; 4. Maithil Bhojpuri of Central and South Muzaffarpur; 5. South Maithili dialect of south Darbhanga, north Munger and the Madhepura subdivision of Bhagalpur; 6. south Maithil-Magadh\u00ed dialect of south Munger and the Barh subdivision of Patna. There remain only the two last parts, treating of the border dialects between Bengali and Bihari, and containing many forms of special interest. These are in the press and will shortly be published.\n\nDravidian.\u2014Amongst the Dravidian languages of southern India, the Tamil appears to hold the first place as well for the quality as for the quantity of the work produced. S.M. Natasa Sastri has published a translation of the Sanskrit play Mudrarakshasa, and, in the Revue de Linguistique, Mr. Gerard Dev\u00e8ze has a translation into French of the Tamil edition of Sakuntala, of which another version has been published by A.S. Venkatachari. Several translations from the Mahabharata and Ramayana and some excellent anthologies have appeared, of which I would notice the collection for the matriculation examination and that for the First Arts containing parts of the Tamil Naladiyar and Viliputtur Bharatam. In grammars, we have reprints of Pope's excellent catechisms, Mahalingaiyar's grammar, the Nannul of Pavanandi in Tamil and English, and a new edition of the Nannul Kandigai Urai, besides a work on Tamil prosody. In Telugu, we must notice the Sabdaratnakaram, a new dictionary based on Johnson's and illustrating each word by extracts from authors considered classical; and, though a school-book, T. Anjaneya Sastri's elementary grammar. The textbooks for the University examinations contain excellent selections, and to these I would add K. Viresalingam's translations of some of Shakespeare's plays and of some of Kalidasa's dramas and Sitarama Sastri's Mudrarakshasa. The Rev. E. Droese of Bhagalpur has brought to our notice, in his 'Introduction to the Malto language and vocabulary' and in two small tracts, a dialect spoken by the hill-men of the Santhi country of which very little was previously known. It appears to be an offshoot of the great Dravidian family of speech, which here reaches its extreme north-eastern limit. The new text-book for the matriculation examination in Malayalam contains the Chanakya Sutram and part of the Patumala Vrittam; the Basel Mission sends out the Gospels\nin Tulu and school-books in K\u00e1narese and Malay\u00e1l\u00edm, and S\u00e9shagiri S\u00e1stri has commenced a series of notes on Aryan and Dravidian philology. In K\u00e1narese, besides school-books, is the Venisanh\u00e1dr, adapted from Bhatta N\u00e1r\u00e1yana and founded on one of the popular stories regarding the five P\u00e1ndavas.\n\nVernacular literature.\u2014Even in a brief survey like the present one, I cannot omit to notice the progress made in literature in general, as shown by the records of the Library Department of Government. Under Act XXV of 1867, for the regulation of printing-presses and newspapers, and for the preservation of copies and registration of books printed in British India, a book is kept in every Province called a 'Catalogue of books printed in British India.' In this book is entered particulars of every publication showing title, language, author, subject, place and date of printing, and price, so that in this way we have a complete record of the indigenous literature of the country. Every quarter, these lists are published in English in the local Gazettes, with, in some cases, explanatory notices of the contents. When it is remembered that the annual issues comprise over 8000 separate publications, it will be understood that it would be impossible now to attempt any detailed review of the immense mass of literature thus brought to our notice, but it is possible to give you some idea of the work done in the principal Provinces, and thus indicate from the best of evidence what are the subjects that attract most attention and whither the increased literary activity that characterises the present decade tends.\n\nNow, gentlemen, there is nothing in the dictum of our founder already mentioned to you, that prohibits us from attending to these matters. We are not a purely arch\u00e6ological Society, and, though, perhaps, discussions on social and political questions are wisely excluded from our meetings and our publications, the scientific aspects of these questions still remain with us. To the students of the many languages and more numerous dialects of India, the translations into them and the original works produced form valuable material for purely philological purposes, even the veriest school-book affording some aid. If to these be added the numerous anthologies of both prose and poetry selected and annotated by educated natives to whom the language is a living one, the large number of dramas, poems, novels, essays, and short stories, most with some literary merit, I may safely say that the time has come when more attention may well be paid, by those amongst us who are qualified for the task, to the study and review of this great evidence of literary effort. India has its poets and its playwrights in every Province, and if we may judge from the number and frequency of each issue, and the translations into almost every language of the more popu-\nher authors, India also has an audience capable of enjoying poetry, the drama, and fiction, to an extent not generally accepted. I would therefore commend these apparently dry lists to your notice in the belief that they are capable of affording much of practical interest and value in connection with almost all the linguistic, historical, religious, social, and political questions of the day.\n\nBengal.\u2014Taking up the Bengal register, I find that in the years 1865-66 there are 2,372 entries, of which 712 refer to educational works and 1,660 to non-educational works. During the first quarter of the year 1866, there were 523 entries, of which quite sixty per cent. were partly or wholly in Bengali, the other principal languages being English, Sanskrit, Urdu, and Hindi. Amongst them were 83 issues of periodicals and 145 publications devoted to educational purposes, which include school-books, anthologies for the local vernacular examinations, and treatises on law and medicine. In Bengal, as indeed in all India, literary effort, apart from educational work, is more occupied with religion than with any other subject. This tendency is clearly exhibited in the record before us, not only in a sustained attempt at a revival of Hinduism itself, but in a strong reaction against the rationalistic spirit and European influence observable in the vernacular literature of late years.\n\nThough many of these works comprise merely reprints of stories from the Mahabharata, or the Ramayana, which, quaintly enough, the recorder remarks are intended for the 'ill-educated or orthodox,' others are original works of value, amongst which mention may be made of the Krishna Charitra of Bankim Chandra Chatterji, in which the Krishna myths are criticised. In the part just published, the author shows that the conception of Krishna in the Mahabharata is that of the perfect man, of the ideal humanity in its widest sense. R. C. Datta, in his 'Sansir,' gives us a faithful picture of middle-class Bengali life, and Sasadhar Tarkachuraman, in his 'Dharma Vyakhya,' an attempt at a scientific exposition of the rites and doctrines of Hinduism. Rajanikanta Gupta has issued part of his history of the Sepoy War; T. N. Mukharji, part of his encyclopedia; Shyam Lal Goswami, a mythological dictionary; and Rama Narayana Vidyaratna, the continuations of several Sanskrit works with Bengali translations, chiefly relating to Vaishnava literature. In Hindi, Dhanodar Sastri has given an account of his travels in southern India, and, in Urdu, Fakir Mohan Senapati, the well-known poet, continues his versified translation of the Mahabharata. Fiction, poetry, the drama, and essays, social and political, form an important section and represent all schools of thought, conservative, progressive, liberal, radical, and almost revolutionary. There is hardly a\n\n* From July 1885, to the end of June 1886 is usually intended.\nmovement of interest that is not reflected in these lists, and they indicate more clearly than anything else the influences and aspirations at work, at least amongst the educated; so that their record may, perhaps, be taken as the measure of the mental activity in any given direction.\n\nMadras.\u2014In Madras, the yearly issues average about 1000 chiefly in Tamil, Telugu, and Malay\u00e1lim. During the first quarter of 1886, there were 249 publications, of which 16 were English; 41 Tamil; 21 Telugu; 18 Malay\u00e1lim; 2 K\u00e1narese; and 8 Hindustani, besides others in Sanskrit, Arabic, Konkani, Badagu, Kurgi, and Tulu, and periodicals in several languages. In Tamil, besides grammars and anthologies, we have numerous religious works in praise of Vin\u00e1yaka, Subramaniya, P\u00e1rvati, and other Saiva deities, also translations into Tamil from Sanskrit. The Telugu series comprise reprints of the Telugu Bh\u00e1gavat, educational works, and, notably, translations from Kalid\u00e1sa's works. There are also some essays on social subjects and novels, one of which is designed to urge the necessity of female education. The publications in Malay\u00e1lim are almost entirely sectarian and in the Mopla dialect and Arabic character. They are chiefly devoted to the praise of the great saints and Gh\u00e1z\u00eds who are held in estimation by the Musalm\u00e1n Moplas in Madras. The Tamil and Telugu publications show that considerable impetus has been given to literary pursuits of late years, and that much progress has been made in adapting those languages to the necessities of the higher objects now aimed at.\n\nBombay.\u2014The average annual issues in the Bombay Presidency may be set down at about 2000, of which about 400 represent periodical literature. In the first quarter of 1886, there were 497 entries, of which 69 only were periodicals, and of the remainder only 80 educational. The languages were English (14), Mar\u00e1thi (115), Gujar\u00e1ti (111), Sanskrit (45), besides Arabic, Arabic-Sindhi, Persian, Urdu, K\u00e1narese, Hindi, Brij, M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri, and bilingual and others (79). Amongst the Mar\u00e1thi publications, we may notice translations from Sanskrit and a number of original dramas, besides poetry, essays, and novels. The poets Tukar\u00e1m and R\u00e1md\u00e1s appear to hold a high place in popular estimation, and we have from native sources some account of their life and works. Amongst social subjects, widow-remarriage, infant-marriages, forest-conservancy, and the burlesque of Western habits exhibited by some zealous reformers are prominent: whilst there is a journal devoted entirely to tales original and translated, and Durg\u00e1 Pras\u00e1da's valuable K\u00e1yam\u00e1la. In Gujar\u00e1ti, besides translations of P\u00e1rsi religious works and Jaina treatises, we have a translation of Don Quixote, which has been favourably reviewed by the vernacular press. I may mention here that the notes of the Bombay recorder are more descriptive than those of any other Province.\nPanj\u00e1b.\u2014The issues registered in the Panj\u00e1b average about 1800 per annum chiefly in Urdu, Panj\u00e1bi, Hindi, Persian, and Arabic. In the first quarter of 1886, there were 645 entries, of which 97 represented periodicals. Of the remainder, 116 were educational works, and 433 non-educational, comprising 7 English works, 43 Arabic, 31 Persian, 206 Urdu, 141 Panj\u00e1bi, 65 Hindi, 2 Pashto, 9 Sanskrit, 1 Sindhi, and 42 bi- and trilingual works. The Arabic issues were chiefly confined to parts of the Kor\u00e1n and the Persian to reprints and religious works. The large Urdu series contains in addition much purely literary work, such as dramas, histories, poetry, essays, and novels, besides papers on medicine, the arts, and on social subjects. The Hindi issues comprise religious works, dramas, stories, poetry, and essays on philological and social subjects. The Panj\u00e1bi publications appear in the Gurumukhi, N\u00e1gari, Arabic, and Persian characters, and include a large proportion of works on the Sikh religion, and on the exploits of Musalm\u00e1n saints, besides stories, poetry, reprints of S\u00fafi works, and practical treatises on medicine, cattle-disease, law, and agriculture. Taken as a whole, the record indicates a healthy tone in the Province, and, though there are not many original works of importance, the presence of such a large proportion of lighter literature shows a capacity to receive and enjoy it for which one was not prepared.\n\nN.-W. P. and Oudh.\u2014The yearly issues in the N.-W. Provinces and Oudh average about 1,450, chiefly in Urdu, Hindi, Persian, and Sanskrit, of which about 100 represent periodicals and about one-fifth of the whole is devoted to educational purposes. During the first quarter of 1886, the entries show: 3 English; 78 Urdu; 120 Hindi; 9 Sanskrit; 3 Arabic; 15 Persian, and 50 polyglot publications besides periodicals. The Urdu series comprises original works in biography, the drama, fiction, history, poetry, law, medicine, and philology, besides translations from English, Persian, and Arabic. The Hindi publications are remarkable for their collections of popular poetry and songs of the people, and, with the aid of the numerous commentators on the first and second books of selections from the Hindi, afford valuable material for a critical examination of the literary language. The b\u00e1rah-m\u00e1s\u00ed, or songs of the twelve months, are particularly curious and occur in several recensions and apparently by different authors. The drama not only finds subjects from those inexhaustible repertoires, the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata and R\u00e1m\u00e1yana, but are the vehicle also for criticising many social foibles, and generally exhibit a healthy tone. There is not much to record from the Central Provinces, Assam, or Burma, and, in the two last, the major portion of what exists is entirely due to foreign aid.\nThe Oriental Congress.\u2014The Oriental Congress, held at Vienna from the 27th September to the 2nd October last, is one of the events to which this Society looks forward with particular interest and we were fortunate to have as delegate Dr. Hoernle, our Philological Secretary, whilst he and Mr. G. A. Grierson were present as delegates from the Government of India and Dr. Bhandark\u00e1r from the Chiefs of K\u00e1thiaw\u00e1r. Amongst the papers of interest to Indian students read at the Congress, mention may be made of Mr. C. Bendall's paper on a manuscript procured by him in Nep\u00e1l, which appears to be a fragment of a rare work on grammar used by the Buddhists in Nep\u00e1l, and in a hitherto apparently unknown character. He also noticed an inscription in the Indian Museum in an unknown character, probably one of those alluded to in Buddhist works. Professor Jolly, known to you as Tagore Law lecturer, read a short note on his forthcoming edition of Manu's Institutes, of which so many reprints have appeared of late. I have no doubt that the learned Professor will make his issue an editio princeps, so far as careful editing and annotation is concerned. Dr. Hoernle, too, gave an account of an old manuscript found in the Panj\u00e1b, which he shows to be a work on arithmetic in the so-called G\u00e1th\u00e1 dialect. Mr. G. A. Grierson read a paper on the medi\u00e6val vernacular literature of upper India with special reference to Tulsi D\u00e1s, the translator into Hindi of the R\u00e1m\u00e1yana. Captain Temple, who is known to us for his labours in connection with Indian arch\u00e6ology and folk-lore, read a paper on the Panj\u00e1bi epic H\u00edra r\u00e1njha by W\u00e1ris Sh\u00e1h, and urged the publication of a correct text. I trust that on your behalf I may be able to say that we should gladly publish a classical work of the nature if we could find a competent editor. Captain Temple also brought to notice that the Government of India had abolished the appointment held by Mr. Fleet as official epigraphist. In the discussion which followed it was agreed that this action of the Indian Government was a real loss to science.\n\nNext followed a lecture by Dr. Stein on the Paropamisus or Hindu Kush in ancient records. Guided by the oldest Greek form of the name Parnasos, as given by Aristotle, he was enabled to identify it with the mountain Upairagaena of the Zend Avesta. The meaning of this latter name is 'higher than the flight of an eagle,' and, curious to say, in a story given by Hiuen Tsiang, the mountain is said to be too high for birds to fly over so that they have to cross it on foot. A similar legend is recorded by Marco Polo, the Emperor Baber, and, in our times, by Burnes. Dr. Stein considers that much information on the ancient geography of Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n may be gleaned from the Zend writings. Dr. Kuhn also gave a note on the dialects of the Hindu Kush from\nmaterials furnished to him by Captain Tanner of the Survey Department during the Afgh\u00e1n war. He was of opinion that these dialects, together with the Kashmir\u00ed, and the Romani of the gypsies, formed a special group among the languages of the Indian branch of the Aryan family. This opinion was not generally accepted; and, in the discussion that followed, Mr. Leland, the greatest living authority on the Romani language, suggested that there was a race at the present day in the Panj\u00e1b that called themselves 'Rom' and spoke Romani. This statement was not supported by those present acquainted with the dialects of the Panj\u00e1b, but I may mention that, in the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata, a tribe of Romanas is mentioned who inhabited a country to the north-west of the Panj\u00e1b and are possibly one with the Rums of W\u00e1mast\u00e1n. Mr. Macauliffe then gave an account of the discovery of a manuscript giving interesting details of the life of B\u00e1ba N\u00e1nak, founder of the Sikh religion.\n\nLinguistic Survey.\u2014Mr. Grierson brought to the notice of the Congress the necessity for a scientific survey of the Indian dialects, a project in which I heartily concur. I entirely agree with him that the literary or government language of any tract is widely different from the language actually spoken by the people, and that the polite language learned by Europeans, and by natives who desire to converse with Europeans, is totally distinct from that used by the same natives in their homes. I have had frequently practical experience of this difference, and it was only after some years of isolated residence in an out-of-the-way district and continued converse with the people themselves that I was able to get rid of the bad start with the bungalow ke zab\u00e1n and the kachahr\u00ed ke zab\u00e1n and make myself understood by them. Except for philological purposes, I am heretic enough, however, to be glad to see some approach to unity, through this 'bungalow cum court' language, though sorry to feel that this unity is reached on such a mongrel and entirely unsatisfactory basis. I trust that I may safely say that the project of an accurate survey of Indian dialects put forth by Mr Grierson and supported by the distinguished members of the Oriental Congress will have the warm and hearty support of this Society also.\n\nAnthropological Survey.\u2014And now I must refer to the survey of the people themselves as to their physical characteristics, institutions, laws, and social rules that is actually in progress under Mr. H. Risley's guidance. The scheme has been framed from the first so as to serve two distinct purposes, the one in the main administrative, the other principally scientific, and I understand that this distinction will be maintained in publishing the results. For administrative uses, it is proposed to embody, in the form of an ethnographic glossary, a descriptive record of all that is known, or can by systematic inquiry be ascertained within a\nreasonable time, regarding the tribes, castes, sects, and occupations of the people of Bengal. The inquiry is being conducted, on lines which have received the approval of European ethnologists, by a large body of official and non-official observers in every district in this Province; and the attempt has been made to distribute the work of collecting facts in such a manner as to secure that the statements of each observer shall be checked and verified by those of others.\n\nStarting from this body of recorded facts, it is proposed to endeavour to classify the people of Bengal according to their ethnic affinities, and to separate and distinguish the various race elements which have combined to form the population as we now find it. It is hoped that some light may be thrown upon this obscure subject by the series of anthropological measurements now being collected in Bengal, the N.-W. Provinces, and the Central Provinces under a scheme recently sanctioned by the Government of Bengal. Special interest attaches to these experiments as being the first attempt on a large scale to apply the anthropometric system elaborated by the French school of anthropologists to the elucidation of the ethnological problems so prominent in India. There are, indeed, some reasons for expecting that India, and especially Bengal, may prove to be an exceptionally favourable field for anthropometric research. Many races meet in these provinces, and the effect of the caste system has been on the whole to keep them apart, and to preserve the characteristic physical type of each from being obscured or obliterated by the promiscuous crossing which has thrown difficulties in the way of anthropological work in Europe.\n\nBiology.\u2014The domain of Biology is so extensive and the works and papers dealing with it, even in matters that should prove of interest to us in India, are so numerous and scattered, that I can only barely attempt to notice a few of the subjects. It is also to be remembered that, here too, the publications for the first half of 1886 only have reached India in the great majority of cases, and that we can only deal with a portion of the year. It may not be known to many of you that owing to the enlightened advocacy of the project by Surgeon-General Simpson, the Government of India has, during the course of the year, liberally provided for the publication of a new periodical devoted specially to scientific work of a biological character. It is entitled 'Scientific Memoirs by Medical Officers of the Army in India,' and the first number has appeared containing two papers by a member of our Society Dr. D. D. Cunningham, one 'On the relation of Cholera to the Schizomycete organisms,' and the other 'On the presence of peculiar parasitic organisms in the tissue of a specimen of Dehli boil.' A publication of this character should fulfil a very useful end, in encouraging medical men in this country to devote their leisure to science.\nBiological Laboratory.\u2014The operations of the Biological Laboratory have been continued during the year, and the most interesting results obtained, in so far as work specially relating to cholera is concerned, were those in a series of experiments on the effect of subcutaneous inoculation of the so-called choleraic comma-bacilli into the bodies of guinea-pigs. These in the first place clearly showed that any such inoculations are not unattended by serious risks, as, where a sufficient quantity of the bacilli were introduced, death with very well defined lesions occurred in a large proportion of cases. Great multiplication of the bacilli within the system was found to have occurred, especially along the lymphatic channels, with extensive softening of tissue and sanguineous effusion. The spread of the bacilli was not limited to the subcutaneous lymphatic spaces, but also involved the peritoneal cavity, which is, of course, merely a huge lymphatic space. From this they extended into the interior of the intestinal canal, where they had multiplied in excess, extensive softening and desquamation of the epithelial layer having occurred, sometimes to the extent of complete denudation of the entire mucous surface. The bacilli could not be detected in the substance of the solid organs, but cultivations showed that they were present in limited numbers in the blood. It could not be definitely shown that the morbid condition in the animals was of a truly choleraic nature, and the principal importance of the results lies in the fact that they clearly show that, whether the comma bacilli be or be not the cause of cholera, the mere presence of excessive numbers of them within the intestinal tract in any animal is no proof that this was necessarily the site of primary invasion of the system.\n\nThe late Dr. Stoliczka.\u2014As a fasciculus of the memoirs published in the series known as the 'Scientific results of the second Yarkand mission,' we have a paper on the life and work of the late F. Stoliczka, the well-known palaeontologist of the Geological Survey, and for years a distinguished member and office-holder of this Society. The paper has been written by Prof. V. Ball, also a member of this Society, and contains much of interest to all engaged in biological work. I may be allowed to quote from one of Stoliczka's papers as bearing on one of the reasons why such attention is paid to the preparation of accurate lists of species occurring in each region. He writes:\u2014\"the study of local faunas must, for some time at least, continue one of the most important means of leading to a full understanding of Indian Zoology. India combines such an enormous variety of physical conditions, namely, differences of level, climate, and vegetation, all of which have to be studied in connection with the animal life, that one is almost lost in the chaos of information required, and is very apt to overlook conditions...\"\nwhich may be essential for the explanation, not only of peculiarities as regards distinction of species, but also of those relating to geographical distribution.\" In the observation of phenomena bearing on geographical distribution, we have, perhaps, one of the most fascinating studies connected with biology. Give an expert, say a butterfly, and he should be able to state within a degree or two its range, and with it the flora of the region that the insect inhabits; and even the religion of the people of the country, for all alike are affected more or less by climatic zones: puritanism does not flourish in the tropics nor does lotus-eating find a permanent home in northern climes.\n\nIndian Museum.\u2014Students of biology have in the Zoological Gardens and in the collections lodged in the Indian Museum ample materials for the study of our Indian fauna. The gardens are, in addition, a recognised recreative resort of the Calcutta public, and the Museum is even more attractive, for, during the last year for which a report has been made, it had 380,297 visitors, of whom 3,987 were European males and 1,008 European females, and 297,942 were native males and 77,360 native females, giving a daily average of 1,584 persons. In a certain way both these Institutions must be considered as important factors in the education of the masses, and in a quiet way do much to spread abroad some idea of Natural Science, for which no other means exist. The Indian Museum is practically the Museum of this Society, having been based on our collections, and, though it has now far outgrown any limits that it could possibly have reached if it had remained with us, we have more than a common interest in its progress. Over 10,000 specimens were added to the collections during the year, of which the great majority were invertebrates. Attention may be called to the North American vertebrates, the Eastern Crustacea, corals, sponges, and the huge crab from Japan, the Mergui moths, Indian ants, and the European Diptera and Hymenoptera; besides coins, fragments of sculpture from Y\u00faszafz\u00e1i, and an inscription from Buddh\u00e1 Gay\u00e1.\n\nThe Trustees permitted Dr. Anderson to take the zoological collection, made by him on their behalf in the Mergui archipelago off the coast of Tenasserim, to England for identification and publication of the results. These have now commenced to appear in the form of a special volume of the Journal of the Linnean Society (vol. XXI). The part received contains the Madreporaria by Prof. P. Martin Duncan, the Holothurians by Prof. F. Jeffrey Bell, and the Lepidoptera by Mr. F. Moore. The other parts will contain eighteen papers by distinguished naturalists on different branches of science. Mr. W. L. Distant has undertaken to write for the Trustees, a 'Monograph of the Eastern Cicadidae,' a most difficult group, and Colonel Swinhoe of the Bombay\nStaff Corps and Mr. E. Cotes will bring out a list of the Indian moths. Mr. Wood-Mason has been engaged in investigating the disease called p\u00e9brine, which affects both the cultivated and wild silkworm, and was so particularly virulent during the last season as to amount to an epidemic. In many cases, whole batches of worms died without spinning any silk, the glandular tissue of the silk-glands and all the other tissues of the body being full of the spore-like bodies that cause the disease and to which the name Nosema bombycis has been given. The Trustees have fitted up a biological laboratory for the prosecution of such studies, and I trust that ere long this essential part of the functions of a State Museum may be established on a firm basis.\n\nBombay Societies.\u2014We have to welcome, as fellow-workers in the field of biology, the Bombay Natural History Society and the Bombay Anthropological Society, and trust that they may have a long and useful career before them. But I may be permitted to suggest that they should amalgamate with the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society and employ the Journal of that Society for biological as well as for philological and archeological purposes as we do ours.\n\nVertebrata.\u2014In the Proceedings of the Zoological Society, Mr. W. T. Blanford gives us a complete systematic account of the genus Paradoxurus and describes an apparently new species, P. jerdoni. He reduces the 49 specific names in existence, to 11 species, of which he figures two, P. aureus and P. jerdoni, from the Palni Hills of the Madras Presidency. The same writer has in preparation a work on Indian Mammals which, from his well-known qualifications for the task, will be eagerly looked for by Indian naturalists. In the same Journal, Mr. Oldfield Thomas has a paper on the Mammalia\u2014numbering some 400 specimens\u2014presented to the British Museum by our member Mr. A. O. Hume. The collection consisted of a few specimens from Simla, Dehli, the Nilgiris, and the Andaman and Nicobar islands, but the great mass of it came from Sambhar, Manipur, Tenasserim, and the Malay peninsula, whence two new species and one new variety are described and figured. The zoology of the Maldive islands is the subject of a brief note by Mr. C. W. Rosset, and Dr. Selater presents a notice 'Of the species of wild goats,' including the ibex of the Western Him\u00e1laya.\n\nIn the same Journal, Mr. F. H. H. Guillemand has six papers on the birds of the Eastern Archipelago, collected during the voyage of the yacht 'Marchesa,' in which many new species are described. Mr. T. Bowdler Sharpe, too, has commenced his notes on the magnificent series of Indian birds presented to the British Museum by Mr. A. O. Hume, and also gives a notice of some birds from Per\u00e1k. In the Ibis, M. Menzbier has a list of the birds of the Upper Tarim, Kashgaria; Major\nYerbury contributes another of the birds of Aden and its neighbourhood; Dr. T. von Madar\u00e1sz describes two new birds from Tibet; and Mr. Sharpe has a notice on a collection of birds from Muscat and others from Fao and Bushire in the Persian Gulf. Mr. Murray of the Karachi Museum has issued a prospectus for a new edition of Jerdon's 'Birds of India,' rendered necessary by the large additions to the number of species and the modifications of system introduced since the first edition was published. The number of Indian birds now known may be estimated to be nearly 1,700, whilst Jerdon has given only 1,008, and many of these being imperfectly or inaccurately described are scarcely identifiable. In this connection, mention must be made of Dr. Stejneger's scheme of classification in Mr. T. S. Kingsley's fourth volume of the 'Standard Natural History,' published in Boston. It appears to be almost entirely new, that is, as regards the larger divisions of the Class Aves, and especially in relation to its fossil forms, and is spoken of by Mr. Evans in the Zoological Record as the most remarkable ornithological work of the year. In 'Ornis,' a new periodical for ornithology, issued at Vienna by Drs. R. Blasius and G. v. Hayek, we have a paper by Dr. Blasius on the birds of Celebes, and Mr. H. O. Forbes, in 'A Naturalist's Wanderings in the Eastern Archipelago,' gives notes on the Avian Fauna of the Keeling Islands, Sumatra, Timor-laut, and Buru.\n\nAn account of the earth-snakes of the peninsula of India and of Ceylon by Colonel R. H. Beddome appears in the Annals and Magazine of Natural History. In the Proceedings of the Zoological Society, Mr. G. A. Boulenger gives a list of the species of Batrachians added to the British Museum since 1882, which includes several Indian species and a new one from Per\u00e1k. Those interested in these studies will find a discussion on the classification adopted by Mr. Boulenger in the Bulletin de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Zoologique de France. In the American Naturalist, Mr. A. W. Butler has notes on the hibernation of Tortoises and Batrachians, and M. G. Tirant has published in Saigon 'Notes sur les Reptiles et les Batraciens de la Cochinchine et du Cambodge,' whilst A. A. W. Hubrecht, in 'Midden Sumatra,' gives a list of the same animals from that island. This fauna has been examined for south-east Borneo by T. G. Fischer (Arch. f\u00fcr Nat. li); for Mindanao in the Philippines by the same writer (T. B. Hamb. ii), and for China by O. Boettger (Verh. xxiv, xxv); who describe many new species and offer much of interest to Indian herpetologists.\n\nInvertebrata.\u2014In Conchology, we have to record the continuation of Sowerby's 'Thesaurus Conchyliorum,' and of the 'Land and Freshwater Mollusca of India' by an old member of our Society, Colonel Godwin-Austen; of the latter the fifth part has been received. The\nMammal of Conchology issued by the Philadelphia Society continues to uphold its high reputation, due in a great measure to its being founded on perhaps the finest collection in the world.\n\nAmongst the invertebrates of India, butterflies and moths find most favour with entomologists. The recently issued second volume of Mr. de Nic\u00e9ville's 'Butterflies of India, Burma and Ceylon' fully keeps up the reputation achieved by the first volume. Mr. W. L. Distant has given us the final instalment of his 'Rhopalocera Malayana,' and Mr. F. Moore one of his 'Lepidoptera of Ceylon.' In Mr. A. G. Butler's 'Illustrations of typical specimens of Lepidoptera Heterocera in the British Museum' will be found many Indian species, and Mr. G. Semper at Wiesbaden has published a work on the 'Butterflies of the Philippines and the Indo-Malayan Lepidopterous fauna.' In the Proceedings of the Zoological Society are papers on the Lepidoptera collected by Commander Carpenter in upper Burma during 1885-86 by Mr. Butler; an important revision of the butterflies of the genus Parnassius by Mr. Elwes; on Lepidoptera collected by Major Yerbury in the N. W. Panjab by Mr. Butler; and a notice of a small collection of dragon-flies from Murree in the Panjab by Mr. W. F. Kirby, almost the only special notice of this family in India of recent years. In the Annals and Magazine of Natural History are papers 'on the genus Terias' by Mr. A. G. Butler; on four new species of butterflies from Burma by Mr. H. Grose Smith; and the continuation of his contributions to our knowledge of Malayan entomology by Mr. W. L. Distant. The same writer has a paper on butterflies from Perak in the Entomologist; and, in the Transactions of the Entomological Society, the Rev. W. Fowler has one on a small collection of the coleopterous family Languridae from Assam. In the Bulletin de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Zoologique de France there is an important and instructive paper by M. R. Dubois on the production of light in certain species of the coleopterous family Elateridae, which deals with the phenomenon from a physiological point of view, and should be of great service in similar investigations in India, where there are so many of these light-bearing species. In the Berlin Entomologische Zeitschrift is a learned paper by Canus on the honey-bee in ancient India which will form the literary complement to Mr. Douglas' paper on Indian bees. Though not strictly within the scope of this notice, I cannot omit to mention the continuation of the great series of works connected with the 'Voyage of the Challenger' and those belonging to the 'Biologia Centrali-Americans' edited and published by Messrs. Godman and Salvin.\n\nBotany.\u2014As regards botanical exploration, the past year has been one of considerable activity. Dr. Aitchison, the indefatigable traveller and botanist, who is also a member of our Society, was attached to the\nAfghan Frontier-delimitation Commission, and has returned to England with a large collection of dried plants, of which the main portion consisted of about 800 species in 10,000 specimens. These are now being arranged under his own supervision at Kew, and a conspectus of the Flora of the region traversed by the Commission is under preparation by Dr. Aitchison and Mr. W. B. Hemley, of the Kew Herbarium. This will contain* descriptions of about one hundred new species, besides adding to our knowledge of many obscure plants of considerable economic importance. Foremost among these are those belonging to the Umbelliferae, of which several yield valuable gum-resins, known in commerce as gum-ammoniacum, gum-galbanum, assafotida, &c. On the North-eastern frontier, Mr. C. B. Clarke has very considerably extended our hitherto scanty knowledge of the Flora of the Naga Hills by his herborizations near Kohima and in Manipur; while he has added not a few species to the already extensive Flora of the Khasia Hills. Mr. Clarke proceeded to England in November, taking his collections with him; and before long we may expect to have something concerning them from his prolific pen. While exploration has been thus vigorously carried on, herbarium work has by no means been neglected. Dr. King, of the Royal Botanic Garden, has, during the year, brought to a conclusion his monograph on the large and difficult genus Ficus on which he has been engaged for some time. Dr. King's observations on the structure of the flowers of the genus have brought to light some hitherto unsuspected sexual arrangements, and, on the basis of these, he has founded a sub-division of the genus into seven sub-genera. A short account of this new classification is contained in a paper read at a recent meeting of this Society. Mr. Duthie, of the Botanical Garden at Saharanpur, a member of our Society, has published during the year, an excellent account of the 'Fodder grasses of Northern India.' Mr. Duthie's book affords an admirable illustration of the kind of accurate help which science may be made to give in the ordinary affairs of domestic life. For the book puts us in the way of learning how to feed our cattle and our cavalry and troop horses on the grasses that grow naturally in the neighbourhood of every cantonment in Upper India, without going to the expense of cultivating exotic plants for fodder. The book which thus helps to deliver us from the tender mercies of the voracious Commissariat contractor is withal fair to look on; for it is profusely supplied with nature-printed illustrations of all the chief grasses of Hindustan proper and of the Panjab.\n\n* For a fuller description of Dr. Aitchison's work see the issue of Nature for the 23rd of December 1886, and a paper read by him before the Pharmaceutical Society on the 8th December.\nThe Dictionary of Indian Economic products which, it is understood, our fellow-member, Dr. George Watt, has for some time been engaged upon has, I believe, advanced in progress during the year. By the addition to the Empire of the province of Upper Burma, a most important botanic region was rescued from the dominion of misrule; let us hope that it may before long be also wrested from the realms of ignorance. In Upper Burma, the Indo-Malayan and Chinese Floras are known to interosculate, and a rich botanic harvest awaits the explorer of those regions when order shall have been sufficiently restored to make the pursuit of knowledge moderately safe. I trust it may be the pleasant duty of a very early successor to me in this chair to chronicle to you the return of a scientific explorer from the hitherto unknown China-Burmese frontier.\n\nGeological Survey.\u2014In reviewing the progress for the year in Geological work in India, we may give the first place to economic results; and these unfortunately do not fulfil expectations. Coal is about the only mineral that need be mentioned, for, besides it (with the exception of iron), India has not proved rich in metals. The explorations in the R\u00e1mpur coal-field in Chhatisgarh have proved disappointing, notwithstanding the abundance of carbonaceous outcrops, nor has the Umariya coal-field in the Rewa basin been a complete success. In the S\u00e1t-pura basin, the Mohp\u00e1ni field on the north seems, for the present, to have failed; the thick seam in which mining has been carried on for years has stopped out on all sides, and has not yet been recovered. On the south side of the same basin, the Chhindw\u00e1ra coal-fields have been surveyed this year, and, though there is a fair show of out-crops of coal, it would be premature to express an opinion as to its resources, until trial borings have been made. There remains the hope that the Singareni coal-fields, to which the Nizam's State railway is expected to be open about the middle of this year, will remove the impression that there is no good coal in India outside of Bengal, for, though the tertiary coal of the Salt Range in the Panj\u00e1b has been opened out this year, the coal can only be used where no better is procurable.\n\nMr. Oldham holds out the hope that in R\u00e9jput\u00e1na, perhaps, a better coal may be discovered. For many years, the rocks about Jaisalmer have been known to be of jurassic age, and therefore the marine equivalents of some of the Gondw\u00e1na series of the Peninsula. From observations made early in 1886, Mr. Oldham concluded that the glacial boulder conglomerate at Pokaran, some fifty miles east of Jaisalmer, represents the Talchhir boulder bed at the base of the Gondw\u00e1na system and almost always found below the coal measures, and he suggested that these might also be represented in R\u00e9jput\u00e1na in the covered ground\nbetween the marine limestones and the Pokaran boulder bed. Explorations are now being made to test this conjecture. In this connection, as fuel, mention may also be made of successful borings for petroleum lately carried out by Mr. R. A. Townsend in the hills east of Sibi. The oil occurs, as in the Panjab, in lower tertiary strata.\n\nFor many years past, we have known of one occurrence of Gondwana coal-measures outside the Peninsula, in the carboniferous beds that seem to underlie the schists and gneiss at the base of the Sikkim Himalaya. Uppermost Gondwana rocks have also been long since identified as occurring at the top of the marine jurassic series in Kachh; and now the typical bottom Gondwana group has been found in western Rajputana at the base of another section, high up in which these same jurassic strata occur. Another similar discovery has been made in the past year by Dr. Warth, who, when examining the coal-measures of the Salt Range, found on the top of a boulder bed some fossils which have been pronounced by Dr. Waagen to be of distinct palaeozoic types, some of them identifiable with carboniferous marine fossils in Australia. This at once suggested to Dr. Waagen that this glacial boulder bed of the Salt Range probably represented the well-known Talchhir rock at the base of the Gondwana system: for Indian geologists had from the beginning contended that the lower Gondwana deposits were palaeozoic, because of the association of Gondwana plants with marine carboniferous fossils in Australia. We have therefore nearly arrived at the conclusion of a discussion that has lasted for nearly thirty years, as to the homotaxis of the Gondwana system and its place in the universal scale of formations. The contention on the other side was based on the undoubted fact that the Gondwana flora is distinctly of mesozoic type, and every conjecture was hazarded to throw doubt on the association of Gondwana plants with palaeozoic fossils. Further evidence is due to a visit paid to Australia by Mr. Oldham, where he confirmed the fact of interstratification of the two kinds of fossils and brought more prominently to notice a glacial boulder deposit there, associated with these beds. Perhaps the most important result of this discovery is the refutation of the commonly received dogma that fossils of such diverse types could not have co-existed. The actual demonstration has now for the first time been made, on an adequate scale from the geology of India, that a triassic flora has been contemporaneous with a carboniferous marine fauna, and, as the comparative scale of formations has to be based upon the most wide-spread class of organisms, the marine, it can now be taken as settled that the period represented by the Gondwana system of rocks extended from middle carboniferous to top jurassic.\nThe other great formation, the Vindhyan, is still unexplained, no trace of a fossil having, as yet, been found in it. There is a mighty gap between it and the next succeeding Gondwana deposits, and every step taken by geologists seems to make it more difficult to draw any marked general stratigraphical separation between it and the old transition rocks. In one place, it may show apparent sequence or slight unconformability with strata that elsewhere are completely discordant beneath it. Whoever discovers a fossil in the Vindhyan system will assuredly rank as a discoverer who has done good service to Indian Geology.\n\nWe may now proceed to notice the recent work of Indian geologists, mostly members of our Society, beyond the frontiers of India. Mr. Griesbach has recently returned after his two years' travel with the Afghan-delimitation Commission. From Quettah to the Siy\u00e1h Koh, Dosh\u00e1kh range, south of Herat, he only found cretaceous (Hippurite limestone) and tertiary rocks, with local profuse intrusions of syenitic granite and basic trap, the same as he had previously described east and west of Kandahar. In the Dosh\u00e1kh range, he came upon a core of carboniferous productus-limestone, and, flanking it on the north, a great plant-bearing series with fossils of Gondwana types, passing up into marine jurassic strata, succeeded by a great thickness of cretaceous and tertiary deposits. The Paropamisan range to the north of Herat is mostly composed of these permo-trias and jurassic formations, with intrusions of igneous, rock, granite, and melaphyres, the same stretching north-westwards into the mountains of Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n between Nish\u00e1pur and Mashad. The famous turquoise mines of Mad\u00e1n are in a trappean contact-rock with upper jurassic strata.\n\nProceeding to the north-east, Mr. Griesbach found the Tir-band-i-Turkist\u00e1n, which is the principal north-western range of the Afgh\u00e1n mountains, to be mainly formed of upper cretaceous limestones, resting unconformably upon the trias-jura rocks, which are found locally exposed along the denuded anticlinal axes of flexure. The flanking ranges exhibit massive tertiary strata, dipping steeply under the recent deposits, forming the plains of Turkist\u00e1n. In the K\u00e1ra-koh region, south-east of Balkh, extensive coal-beds are found in the plant-bearing series, and here the basal members are distinctly associated with carboniferous strata, a fact giving further confirmation of the Gondwana affinities already explained. Mr. Griesbach crossed the Hindu-Kush by the Chah\u00e1rdar pass, nearly due north of K\u00e1b\u00fal. In this section, he found only the rocks already noticed, but, again, with profuse intrusions of syenitic granite whereby the adjacent strata are extensively metamorphosed into crystalline schists and limestones, the\nlines of disturbance being still principally east and west. The same rocks occupy the ground between Kabul and Peshawar. A remarkable feature of this traverse between the Oxus and India is that no rocks were taken to be older than carboniferous: even the crystalline schists being taken to be rocks of that period or newer.\n\nAnother labourer in the field has been Dr. Giles, who was attached as naturalist to Colonel Lockhart's mission. He passed through Yassin, Chitral, and the border of Kafiristan, and, though not a professed geologist, has made interesting notes upon the physical features and rocks, specimens of which he brought back for inspection. Mr. Lyddeker had previously examined the ground traversed by the mission as far as Gilgit and described it as an almost unbroken geological waste of gneiss and schistose rocks, taken to be partly altered palaeozoic, but largely also arch\u00e6an, as the continuation of the schists and gneiss underlying the silurian and cambrian slates in the Himalayan sections to the southwest. From Dr. Giles' specimens and notes it would be inferred that the whole of the ground traversed by him westward of Gilgit was of the same description. There was no vestige of a fossil and all the rocks were more or less metamorphic, the more crystalline varieties predominating. By itself this could not be remarkable, but, compared with the concluding section of Mr. Griesbach's tour, it is rather perplexing in the greatness of the contrast. There remains about 100 miles of Kafiristan separating the two sections; and it is to be feared that some time will elapse before materials for solving the problem thus presented to us will be available.\n\nThe publications of the Geological Survey comprise the 'Records,' 'Memoirs,' and the 'Paleontologia Indica.' Of the Records, the volume for 1826, contains twenty-five papers of varied interest by members of the staff and others. The Paleontologia continues its useful work and gives us contributions by Mr. R. Lydekker on the Reptilia and Amphibia of the Maleri and Denwa groups of the Indian pre-tertiary vertebrata and a supplement to his Siwalik mammalia of the tertiary and post-tertiary series, and by Messrs. P. Martin Duncan and W. Percy Sladen on the Gaj (miocene) series, the Makran (pliocene) series, and the fossil Echinoidea of Kachh and Kathiawar belonging to the tertiary and upper cretaceous fauna of Western India. Also on the Coleoptera of the productus-limestone of the Salt-range by Dr. Waagen, and a concluding part of the Gondwana Flora series by Dr. Feistmantel.\n\nMeteorology.\u2014And now I come to what may without disparagement be called the youngest of all sciences, for, notwithstanding the attention given to it of late years, meteorology is still only in the first stages of generalisation and presents us with a mass of observational detail, out\nof all proportion to its generalised truths. It has been remarked by more than one recognised authority that perhaps no science has such a tale of work to show that is virtually wasted labour: long registers of observations recorded at great expense and at the cost of no small devotion and self-denial, but which have remained infructuous, owing to the want of that familiarity with physical laws that is requisite to give them validity or to turn them to useful account. But it is encouraging to note that, of late years, this reproach has lost much of its force and generality. Although the fundamental laws of thermotics and pneumatics are still, to a large extent, unknown to many of those engaged in collecting observations, yet, owing to the action of meteorological societies and institutions, this work has become systematised and rendered at least capable of bearing fruit. If we have still to admit that weather prognosis, which is the ultimate aim, is, in its methods, mainly empirical, we have but to turn to such periodicals as the Journals of the Austrian and German meteorological societies, not to mention such separate publications as those of Ferrel, Mohn, and Guldberry, and to Hann's 'Climatology' to see that the alliance of meteorology with its sister science, physics, is being knit year by year in closer bonds.\n\nThe greater advances achieved of recent years have been made by inductive methods, of the application of which the laws of storms afford, perhaps, the most striking example. The activity in this field of inquiry is great and increasing; and the last two years have furnished some valuable additions to our knowledge, of which I may notice one or two. In America, the veteran professor, Elias Loomis, has crowned the labours of half a century by the publication of a revised edition of his 'Contributions to Meteorology.' This work, the first part of which only has reached India, is perhaps the most comprehensive summary of the tracks and other general features of cyclonic storms ever yet compiled. It deals most fully with the storms of North America, for which ample details have been furnished to him by the elaborate system of weather telegraphy for which the United States stand pre-eminent amongst nations. But it also describes and discusses the more important features of storm motion in other parts of the northern hemisphere, and brings together, in a moderate compass, the results of the older, as well as of the recent, workers in this field of research.\n\nNearer home, important work on the cognate subject of the typhoons of the Chinese seas has been done by M. Dechevrens, the eminent director of the Zi-ka-wei observatory at Shanghai, and also by Dr. Doberek. In India, Mr. J. Eliot has given us a memoir on the Akyab cyclone of 1884, and Mr. Pedler one on the disastrous storm of 1885 which swept away the settlement at Hookeytolla in Orissa and caused such loss of\nhuman life. This storm is remarkable as having furnished a lower reading of the barometer than has been recorded previously in any part of the world at the sea-level. An important contribution to the meteorology of the Indian seas has recently issued, in the shape of a set of monthly weather charts of the Bay of Bengal, drawn up by Mr. Dallas from the data furnished by the London Meteorological Office. These charts represent the wind directions and force prevailing on the Bay of Bengal and the equatorial sea, also the average readings of the barometer, the frequency of gales and the recorded marine currents, and will, it is believed, be of much use to ship commanders, more especially of sailing vessels, in shaping their course between Bengal and the equator. Similar charts are under preparation for the Arabian sea.\n\nIn connection with these seas and their navigation, I would say a word or two on a matter of much practical importance in regard to the useful application of the knowledge that we possess. As your representative I am far too deeply impressed with the great merits of our former member Mr. Piddington, distinguished not only as a botanist, but more especially as a worker in this field, to appear to say anything that might seem to depreciate his work. Its value and merit have gained universal recognition, and in its main features it is unassailable. But science is progressive, and it would be very strange did the work of a generation of labourers add nothing to our knowledge. It was the idea of Mr. Piddington that the movement of the wind in storms is in circles or locally and apparently tangential to a circle, and on this idea was based his practical rules for the guidance of shipmasters. This idea is now shown by universal experience to be incorrect, and to be at least only a rough approximation to the fact. The wind it is now amply proved always moves in spirals. But Piddington's rules are still the accepted guides of seamen and are still taught authoritatively notwithstanding that, as Mr. Meldrum has shewn, their observance not infrequently leads to disaster. It is much to be desired that steps should be taken by some recognized authority to prepare a simple and popular manual on the subject, based on the sounder knowledge which modern science has acquired. And, indeed, such a work is also needed for the meteorology of the land to enable the lay public to understand and intelligently appreciate the mass of meteorological literature which the Government Gazettes and the entire press, weekly or daily, so lavishly place before us. We want something more popular than the very valuable 'Vademecum' of Mr. Blanford, not a scientific investigation of principles, but a brief, clear, and comprehensive explanation of the observations ordinarily made, their objects, uses, and mode of application.\nOur Meetings.\u2014It has been sometimes urged that we should make our meetings more interesting to the general public, and to those amongst our members who do not occupy themselves with cultivating any particular branch of knowledge. I can only say that the remedy is in the hands of the members themselves. The office-holders of the Society do not differ from the members, except that they have, in addition to their duties as members, undertaken the task of administering its affairs and of conducting through the press the numerous publications of the Society; they are not men of leisure, but like yourselves have full occupation in their public and private avocations. The means are at hand and have received the sanction of your Council. On notice given to our Secretaries, they will place on the agenda paper for the evening any one of the numerous subjects within the scope of our Society that any member may wish to bring forward for discussion, and this shall be the subject of conversation for the meeting, to be entered on after the formal business of the evening has been concluded, and not to form any portion of the records thereof. Thus there will be ample opportunity for any member in an informal way to bring forward any matter on which he desires such information as the members present can afford, or to communicate to us information that appears to him to be of interest. I trust that our after-business conversations may in future form a marked and useful feature of interest in our meetings. I believe that there are none amongst us who cannot add something of novelty and interest to some of the subjects that will arise for discussion and certainly none who are so wise as not to be benefited thereby. Looking back on the history of our Society and analysing the existing list of members, one fact is evident throughout, that we are essentially a Society of amateurs with a few professional men to weld our efforts together, and it is, in a great part, the labours of these amateurs that have built up this Society and made it what it is. We have a past that we may feel proud of, and, though the Societies which have arisen to achieve the objects that we have had before us are both numerous and strong, yet I think that the survey of work done that I have given you this evening may justly make you feel that the parent of all Oriental Societies is neither moribund nor languishing, and that it rests with us individually that this reproach may not fall in our time.\n\nSurvey of the Invertebrata.\u2014In conclusion, I may be permitted to call the attention of all, whether members of this Society or not, to a subject in which I take a deep interest. In doing so I would quote the words of Mr. W. T. Blanford in his address to this Society in 1879:\u2014\"But much as hand-books of Indian Vertebra are wanted, there is a far greater need of similar aids to\nthe study of the *Invertebrata*. The number of students would be greatly increased were the means of identifying animals greater, and even from a practical point of view, the only view in which, I regret to say, the majority of the world is capable of sympathising, much good can be done. For instance, the injury done yearly by insects to the crops of India is something enormous, without considering the mischief inflicted by our various six-footed rivals and enemies in other ways. Yet we scarcely know which kinds of insects are to be guarded against, nor what are their natural enemies, and any one desirous of ascertaining the species, and of learning what is known about their habits, must search through an extensive library in order to gain the information required.\"\n\nSince these lines were written, Col. Marshall and Mr. de Nic\u00e9ville have taken up the Rhopalocerous section of the Lepidoptera or butterflies, Colonel Swinhoe and Mr. Cotes are about to give us a list of the Heterocerous section or moths, and Mr. E. T. Atkinson has completed the Homopterous section, and commenced the descriptions of the Heteropterous section of the Rhynchota. Still very much remains to be done, and I believe there are amongst us men to whom the work would be congenial, and who would spare no pains to make it good. I would now call on such, whether members of our Society or not, to take up even a section of the orders untouched, and to aid us by preparing lists, collecting specimens and noting the habits and life-history of the species. I should be glad to see our Native Members take more interest in Natural Science, and thus wipe away the reproach that, perhaps, with the exception of the late Babu Harimohun Mukharji and one gentleman in Bombay, there is not a single native of India, known outside its limits, for proficiency in either Botany or Zoology.\n\nA vote of thanks to the President proposed by Mr. Westland was carried by acclamation.\n\nThe President announced that the Scrutineers reported the result of the election of Office-bearers and Members of Council to be as follows:\u2014\n\n*President.*\n\nE.

On the observed changes in the density of the surface Sea water, coincident with, and due to, aerial disturbances, and consequent alterations of baric pressure over adjacent sea areas.\u2014By S. R. Elson, Bengal Pilot Service.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nIn this paper the author shows, by means of tabulated serial observations since taken, that a statement he wrote in his Sandheads Sailing Directory some years back, that 'the waters at the Hooghly Pilot Station contained, in the dry season of the year, more salt at low water than at high water,' requires some modification of the seeming paradox, on account of some rather novel facts, which he has brought to light by means of a common soda-water bottle hydrometer, which is capable of easily testing the fluid specific gravity to the sixteenth of a thousandth:\u2014that, when a baric depression over the sea to the south, induces, as it always does, an accelerated flow, or set of the sweet waters flowing out of the great eastern mouths of the Ganges, over the tails of the outlying sandy reefs, the specific gravity of the water at the Hooghly Pilot Station being thereby consequently lessened, there is a greater comparative difference at such times between the specific gravity of the waters outside of, and on the tails of the reefs, and that of the inshore waters of the litoral:\u2014a difference sometimes amounting to as much as is 1:020 to 1:024. This difference the author attributes to the shelter, from the above-mentioned induced accelerated incursion of the sweeter eastern waters, afforded by Saugor Island and its outlying partially dry sand; and from the fact, as stated in a companion paper to the present one by the author, read before this Society and published in its Proceedings in November 1885, that but very little of the Hooghly River water finds its way to those more sheltered positions, to interfere with the copious evaporation, which must be ever active on those warmer inshore and muddy waters.\n\nThe author also shows by means of tabulated two-hourly serial observations made in November last whilst on his trip to and from Rangoon, during an interval of only eight days, the very marked effect which different states of weather in the Bay have on the surface temperature and density curves at, and off the Pilot station, also for some distance out into the blue water of the Bay, and the general usefulness to mariners and others, which would be the outcome, if a more exact measurement of the sea-surface specific gravity were taken and published, than is now generally observed by those willing observers who keep such registers; more especially near coasts, and off the mouths\nof rivers, such as the Hooghly. A full description of the construction of the bottle hydrometer, and the author's simple plan for making the counterbalancing wire weights, are given in the paper.\n\nThe paper will be published in the Journal, Part II for 1887.\n\n2. On the influence of Indian Forests on the Rainfall.\u2014By H. F. Blanford, F. R. S., Meteorological Reporter to the Government of India.\n\nThe President made the following remarks on the above paper:\u2014\n\nWhatever doubt there may be as to the direct influence of forests in the production of rain, there can be none in regard to their effect upon the distribution of the rain-fall by means of springs and streams. This is clearly shown in the recent report of the 'Division of Forestry' attached to the United States Department of Agriculture. It is there shown that the removal of forests from the neighbourhood of streams not only lessens the whole amount of water flowing in their channels, but renders its flow much more irregular than before. In the case of the smaller streams, where the forests adjacent to them or in which they have their head springs have been cut off, the streams have been often so reduced as, at certain seasons of the year, almost to disappear. And, in the case of streams, whether large or small, the result has been to produce floods when the snows melt in spring-time, or after heavy rains, to be followed by a greatly diminished flow of water afterwards, especially in those seasons of the year when rains are least frequent and copious. These effects of the denudation of forest areas occur not only in the Eastern States of the United States but along the Danube, Elbe, Oder and Vistula; but it has also been shown that the reafforestation of denuded tracts restores the even flow of water at all times and mitigates the excessive flow in times of floods.\n\nThe American Forest Department consider that nothing has been better settled than that the forests are the great regulators of the distribution of the water precipitated from the clouds, and consequently of the flow of streams. By their shade, and by the obstruction which they offer to sweeping winds, they lessen the evaporation which would otherwise speedily carry off from the ground much of the rainfall, while the loose spongy soil, formed by the accumulation of their fallen leaves, absorbs the water precipitated from the sky or produced by the melting of the winter's snow, and causes it to flow off gradually into the channels of the streams, instead of flooding them at once.' As to the direct influence of forests in producing rain or increasing its amount in their immediate vicinity and their consequent favourable effect upon agriculture and the supply of water for springs and streams, Mr. Blanford's\npaper will help to resolve the doubt that still exists on this subject. The Report referred to states, that although the preponderance of evidence at present seems to favour the conclusion that forests have an influence in increasing the amount of rain-fall in their immediate vicinity, further experiments are necessary before this can be considered conclusively settled. It is precisely in this direction that the observations recorded by Mr. Blanford are of great value, and we can only hope that they will be continued until this important question is set at rest.\n\nThe paper will be published in the Journal, Part II for 1887.\n\n---\n\nLIBRARY.\n\nThe following additions have been made to the Library since the meeting held in January last.\n\nTRANSACTIONS, PROCEEDINGS AND JOURNALS,\n\npresented by the respective Societies and Editors.\n\nAmsterdam.

This activity is the offspring of Western culture. It was the pride and is the honour of the founders of our Society to have transplanted the spirit of research to this Eastern land; but it is more particularly during Her Majesty's long and peaceful reign that that spirit has spread abroad and fructified.\n\nAs a condensed record of the part borne by our Society in the advancement of Indian science, during the first century of its existence, a century, nearly one half of which has been passed under the auspices of Her Majesty's beneficent rule, we respectfully beg Her Majesty's gracious acceptance of the Centenary Memorial Volume of the Asiatic Society of Bengal.\n\n57 Park Street,\nThe 16th February, 1887.\n\nThe Address, which was handsomely engrossed on parchment, was signed by the President, Vice-Presidents, Secretaries, Treasurer, and the Members of Council, and was presented to His Excellency the Vice-\nroy and Governor General of India by a deputation consisting of the President, the Vice-Presidents and the senior Secretary; together with a copy of the Centenary Review of the Asiatic Society, bound in vellum and enclosed in a kincoo case.\n\nThe Secretary read the names of the following gentlemen who had been appointed by the Council to serve on the several Committees during the current year.\n\n**Finance Committee.**\n\nH.

Temple.\n\nLieut.-Colonel Waterhouse exhibited some photographs taken on the occasion of the Jubilee Fireworks and Illuminations and made the following remarks:\n\nThese photographs are not very much in themselves but are interesting as being an application of the principle of what is known as orthochromatic photography, i.e., they are taken on gelatine dry plates specially prepared so as to be more sensitive to yellow light than the ordinary dry plates, and, in fact, by suitable arrangements, plates may be made as sensitive to yellow as ordinary plates are to blue. Such plates are of the greatest use in copying paintings and other coloured objects with a truer rendering of the light and shade as seen by the eye than is possible by the ordinary plates. Being so sensitive to yellow light photographs can be taken with them by petroleum or gas light and, in some instances, with very great advantage.\nIn order to produce this sensitiveness to yellow the photographic film of bromide of silver is stained with certain dyes, which increase the sensitiveness of the film for the less refrangible rays of the spectrum. Among them chlorophyll, cyanin blue, eosin and its derivatives, especially those with a bluish tint, such as erythrosin, an alkaline salt of tetraiod-fluorescein.\n\nAt the meeting of the Society in January 1876 I read a short paper, published in the Proceedings, on the influence of Eosin on the photographic action of the Solar Spectrum upon bromide and bromoiodide of silver, and showed its peculiar action in extending the sensitiveness of the bromide of silver to the yellow rays and, in fact, changing the maximum of photographic action from the indigo and violet, as in ordinary plates, to the green and yellow. As stated at the time, my efforts to apply this principle to copying coloured maps, yellow manuscripts, landscapes &c., on wet and dry collodion plates were not successful and I had not leisure to pursue the enquiry further. Others, however, I am glad to say, have been more successful. Ducos du Hauron found that in order to get the full benefit of the dye on collodion plates it was necessary to expose the plate through a coloured medium such as yellow glass, and by this means he worked very successfully with eosin. Abney, Vogel and Amory also experimented with the dye, and the latter, discovered an important property it has of forming an insoluble compound with nitrate of silver. However, no very practical steps seem to have been taken to utilise this dye for gelatine dry plates till Messrs. Attout, Taillefer and Clayton took out a patent for orthochromatic plates early in 1883, their plates being prepared either with eosin and ammonia, added to the gelatino-bromide of silver emulsion at the time of making, or by bathing the gelatine dry plates in a bath of eosin, ammonia and alcohol. Since then other modifications of the same principle have been adopted. Plates have also been prepared by Dr. H. W. Vogel, whose original researches in this direction have really been the foundation of orthochromatic photography, with a violet dye, called azalin, which is said to be a mixture of chinolin red and cyanine blue.\n\nThe illuminations and fireworks on the occasion of the Jubilee seemed to offer a good opportunity of testing the sensitiveness of these orthochromatic plates to the yellow light given off by the myriads of little chiraghs used in this country for illuminating.\n\nSome of the plates I used were Taillefer's and the fact that from my house, near the Cathedral, I was able to obtain a fairly clear impression on the negative of the illuminations about Govt. House and the Post Office, nearly two miles away, with 5 minutes' exposure and a not very rapid lens, will shew how sensitive these plates are to faint yellow light.\nOther plates I prepared myself by dipping ordinary gelatine dry plates into a bath of erythrosin with ammonia, also in a bath of erythrosin-silver and ammonia prepared as recommended by Mallmann and Scolik. I had tried Dr. Vogel's azalin dye but did not find it so good as the erythrosin.\n\nSome of my plates were exceedingly sensitive, and pictures of the illuminations taken on them shew a considerable amount of faint detail, particularly one of the Town Hall which shows the windows and a good many architectural details, with 3 minutes' exposure. Unfortunately these plates shew a tendency to fog and will not bear intensifying sufficiently to bring out these details in a print.\n\nThe picture of the Financial Office, which was one of the best, though it does not show architectural details, was taken on one of the French Taillefer plates with $2\\frac{1}{2}$ minutes' exposure. In this, as in some of the others, the oil lamps have come out very well but not so strongly as the gas. Some plates prepared with a mixture of cyanin blue and erythrosin, which I had expected would be specially sensitive to the yellow light, were found to be much less so than plates prepared with erythrosin alone.\n\nThe photographs of the fireworks were taken mostly on the French plates, but some of the plates I prepared myself gave very fair results. The picture of the rockets, taken by my assistant Mr. Pope on one of the French plates, is exceedingly curious; the very irregular paths taken by the rockets being quite clearly shown though the exposure must have been very short indeed.\n\nSome photographs taken in the Eden gardens, about 7 p.m., on similar plates, may also be interesting. One of them, taken on a plate stained with erythrosin-silver, with an exposure of only 70 seconds, full aperture of an 8-in. focus rapid symmetrical lens, shows a great many distant details that one would scarcely have expected. The possibility of taking photographs at night of objects illuminated by the electric light may be of importance in naval and military operations.\n\nAs an illustration of the peculiar action of these orthochromatic plates in photographing coloured objects I have brought two photographs of a highly coloured chromo-lithograph. Both have been taken on the Taillefer plates, but one with and the other without a yellow screen. In the one case, although the plate shows a great deal more sensitiveness to yellow than an ordinary dry plate does, the girl's yellow dress has come out black, and the yellow spots of shading and tinting in various parts of the picture, almost imperceptible on the original, have all reproduced black and alter the whole appearance of the picture. In the photograph taken with the yellow screen the yellow dress is quite light, the objectionable spots have disappeared, and the resulting photograph is a very fair representation of the original chromo-lithograph.\nI may also mention that these plates have been found very valuable in photomicrographical researches for photographing stained preparations, and will be useful for many other purposes where a better representation of the so-called non-actinic colours is required than can be obtained on ordinary plates.\n\nLieut.-Colonel Waterhouse exhibited some specimens of heliogravure lately produced in the Survey of India offices and made the following remarks:\n\nThe two plates of archaeological subjects and a quarter sheet of the Atlas of India, I have brought to show you this evening, have all been reproduced by the photo-electrotype process from manuscript drawings. The two first are from the beautiful collection of drawings of Archaeological Remains in the Bombay Presidency executed under the superintendence of Dr. Burgess and were especially selected by Sir E. Buck to test the capabilities of the process. The map was drawn in the Survey of India office with particular care that it might reproduce the effect of an engraved Atlas sheet when slightly reduced.\n\nThe way of obtaining these plates has already been described in the Society's Journal, Part II, No. 2. 1878, p. 100, but we now use an improved gelatine tissue, specially manufactured by the Autotype Company, containing plumbago and other substances which give a certain roughness or 'grain' to the gelatine image and at the same time render it conductive of electricity so that when the print has been developed on the silvered copper plate and dried it is ready to go into the electrotyping battery.\n\nWe have also improved the electrotyping arrangements, and now use a form of battery I first saw in use at Vienna, consisting of two troughs; an outer one, containing solution of sulphate of copper, and an inner one having a leather bottom and containing dilute sulphuric acid. An iron plate is placed in the inner trough and coupled to the silvered copper plate bearing the gelatine matrix, placed below it on a suitable support in the lower trough. Electrical action is set up so that copper is deposited on the matrix and in the course of 3 to 4 weeks a plate is produced of sufficient thickness to stand printing from. The deposited plate is then separated from the matrix and after a little cleaning is ready for printing in the copper plate press.\n\nThe process is not an expensive one and is exceedingly cheap when compared with hand-engraving. A plate of most close and elaborate design that would take months or even a year or two to engrave by hand can in this way be reproduced in a month or six weeks. In the case of\nthe map before you, the drawing took about 6 months and the reproduction has taken about 5 weeks. Had the map been engraved the drawing would not have taken so long but the engraving would probably have taken a year to complete.\n\nDr. Burgess' two drawings were crucial tests of the process. They were very finely drawn and reduced very considerably. The delicacy and perfection of the results leave very little to be desired, as you will see from the prints, and no other photographic process I am acquainted with would have rendered such close fine work so perfectly.\n\nAnother process of heliogravure\u2014known as photo-etching\u2014employed in the office, is even quicker and more economical than the photo-electrotype but not quite so certain. Some specimens of it are on the table. This process is the exact opposite of the former, a direct negative is used, but a transparency has to be taken from it: this we prefer to do by the autotype process, intensifying the gelatine image with permanganate of potash. From this transparency a negative autotype print is made and developed upon a highly polished copper plate prepared for engraving. Before the copper plate receives the gelatine image a resinous grain of powdered bitumen is applied to it, which not only gives a firm hold to the gelatine film during the biting, but breaks up the image into a series of fine points which preserve the proper gradation of the half tints and enable the different parts of the engraved image to hold the ink in proper proportion. The resinous grain is fixed to the plate by subjecting it for a few seconds or a minute to the fumes of benzole.\n\nThe margins and back of the plate being protected with varnish, the copper plate with the negative gelatine image is immersed in an almost saturated solution of perchloride of iron which hardens the gelatine, though slowly permeating it, and attacks the copper, so that first the bare parts in the deep shadows of the picture, where there is little or no gelatine, are bitten; then the next darker tints, and so on until the high lights are just on the point of being attacked. With some subjects a single bath of perchloride is sufficient\u2014with others it is advisable to begin with a very strong solution of the perchloride and pass the plate through a series of baths of decreasing strength. It is marvellous with what delicacy and perfection the most delicate gradations of half tint, even in the lightest shades, are reproduced on these plates. The biting takes only a few minutes and the whole operation of preparing a plate can be finished in a day. It is therefore exceedingly quick and the cost of materials is very small. The method is suitable either for line or half-tone subjects, but is perhaps most successful with the latter.\nDr. R\u00e1jendral\u00e1l\u00e1 Mitra made the following remarks on the death of Mr. Arthur Grote, an Honorary Member of the Society.\n\nGentlemen, at the last annual meeting the President announced the death, on December 4th, of Mr. Arthur Grote; but it was not convenient at the time to give, as usual, a brief account of the life of that gentleman. He served the Society long and faithfully, and rescued it from more than one critical situation. It is meet, therefore, that we should, on the present occasion, place on record a brief obituary note to express our sense of the loss we have sustained, and as I had the privilege of his friendship for well-nigh forty years, and have a vivid personal knowledge of his career in this country, I request your permission to make a few remarks in memoriam.\n\nAnglo-Indian society is so transitory that ten years suffice to replace one generation by another; and as Mr. Grote retired from India eighteen years ago, I am afraid very few of you, gentlemen, remember him. The Society, however, recognised his services by electing him an Honorary Member; and his portrait on the wall before me shows the estimation in which he was held by his colleagues during his sojourn amongst us.\n\nArthur Grote was born at Beckenham in Kent, on the 29th of November, 1814. His father was the leading member of a large and flourishing banking-house, and his eldest brother, George Grote, immortalized his name by writing the best philosophical history of Greece that we have in the English language. I have no information about the early life of Arthur Grote beyond the fact that he was for some time at Harrow, where he was noted for his proficiency in Latin and Greek. As a younger son, a writership in the Indian Civil Service was deemed the most appropriate profession for him, and he entered Haileybury College early in 1832. His career in that institution was a highly distinguished one, and he passed out with several prizes in Arabic, Persian, Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed, and Bengali. Arriving at Calcutta in June, 1823, he had to go through the usual course of training in the then College of Fort William, where he carried away a prize for Sanskrit, and excellent certificates for general proficiency. He commenced official life as an Assistant to the Magistrate of Jessore in 1834, and, after passing through subordinate posts in Bauleah, and Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d, attained the rank of a Magistrate at Hughli in 1836. This rise, even in those days of early promotion, was held to be remarkable, and it established Mr. Grote's reputation as an able and energetic officer. From Hughli he was transferred to Midnapur, where he served as a Magistrate for over five years (1838 to '43). In March, 1843, his health broke down under the arduous labours he had to get through in carrying on the Revenue settlement\nof that district, and he had to proceed to the Cape of Good Hope for a change. His two years' sojourn at the Cape did not, however, do him much good, and, after a few months' service in East Burdwan, he had to proceed to England on September 10, 1845. On his return to India, in November, 1848, he was put in charge of the Calcutta Collectorate and of the office of the Superintendent of Stationery and Stamps\u2014acting also for a short time as special Deputy Collector in connexion with the Revenue survey of Midnapur. He entered the Board of Revenue as officiating Junior Secretary in July, 1852, and soon after became the Senior Secretary; which office he held till March, 1856, when he was appointed Commissioner of the Nuddea Division. The last office he held till July, 1859, when he became a member of the Board of Revenue, whence he retired on July 5, 1868. His official life was one of unbroken success, characterised as much by consummate tact and ability, as by the most kindly and considerate feeling for the well-being of the millions who, from time to time, were placed under his control. There are still living many friends and subordinates who cherish a lively remembrance of the kindly actions which proceeded from his generous and affectionate nature. It was during his administration as Commissioner of the Nuddea Division that the Indigo disputes between Indigo planters and ryots came to a head, and it must be said to his honour that he never for a moment forsook the side of the weak and the helpless.\n\nMr. Grote's connexion with this Society dates from 1849, when he was elected an Ordinary Member. In the following year he was elected a member of the Council, and early in 1852, Joint Secretary. For some time he was the sole Secretary, and it was a time when the financial affairs of the Society were very much involved. His diligence, earnest attention to the affairs of the Society, and great social influence with his friends enabled him, however, soon to surmount all difficulties, and to restore the Society to a healthy position. I advert to his social influence particularly, as therein lay much of the secret of his success as a Secretary. Extensive private correspondence among a wide circle of friends, inviting recruits, encouraging the lukewarm, and urging the old members to forward notes and papers, often suggesting subjects, and offering co-operation or literary help, form no part of the official duty of a Secretary, and yet those are just the duties which are the most conducive to the advancement of public institutions, and in which Mr. Grote distinguished himself most. He was elected a Vice-President of the Society on six different occasions, (1856, '57, '58, '63, '67, and '68) and held the office of President for five years (1859 to 62 and 1865). He took an active part in the negotiations which culminated in the transfer of the Society's natural history museum to Government, and in the course of it\nhe often reminded me of a remark of Mr. John Colvin, for some time Lieutenant-Governor of the North Western Provinces, who, on a similar occasion, once publicly said:\u2014\"When I am in the rooms of this Society I am not a servant of Government.\" It has often been a matter of regret to me that this is a principle which is not often acted upon by officers of Government.\n\nMr. Grote was very much opposed to the Presidency of the Society being held for a long time by any one individual, and it was through his earnest exertion, and against the wish of his colleagues, that the old practice was set aside, and frequent changes in the personnel of the office rendered imperative. His profound erudition, vast experience, high official rank, and prominent social position gave him a commanding voice in the affairs of the Society, but no one ever enjoyed such advantages in a more mild, modest, genial, conciliatory, and winning way than he did; he never made an enemy.\n\nTaking a deep interest in Natural History, he was early selected as the best qualified person for the Presidency of the Agri-horticultural Society of India. He held the office for ten years, and, on his retirement, the Society elected him an Honorary Member, and voted a portrait for its meeting room.\n\nThe kindliness of his nature and sympathy for living beings recommended Mr. Grote to the Presidency of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and he did much to promote the usefulness of that body. He was also for a time the leading member of the late Vernacular Literature Society, which benefitted largely by his advice and cooperation.\n\nHe was a man of remarkable width and grasp of mind, and few subjects came before him in which he was not able to take the part of a master. Besides his vernacular, he knew French, German, Latin, Greek, Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch and Italian, in the first three of which he wrote with ease and elegance. Of Indian languages he had mastered Arabic, Persian, Hindustani, Hindi, Sanskrit, Bengali and Uriya, making in all sixteen languages. In Bengali he was for some time a regular reader of our leading newspapers, and he often startled me by giving information which he had picked up from some of our then most recent books. But he was particularly attached to Greek, and never missed an opportunity of cultivating the literature of that language. By way of illustration of this remark I may mention that on the day before his departure from India, when most people are busy about packing and other domestic details, I found him when I called to bid him good-bye, sitting with a copy of the Aves of Aristophanes in his hands.\n\nLiterature, however, did not hold entire monopoly of his versatile\nmind. He cultivated natural science with no less ardour, and in two branches of it\u2014Entomology and Gramineae\u2014he had acquired commendable proficiency. His collection of butterflies and moths was the largest in India in his time, and for years he employed several artists to draw from nature the fourfold changes which these animals undergo in the course of their ephemeral lives. His knowledge of Botany was recognised by Government, which appointed him Superintendent of the Hon\u2019ble Company\u2019s Botanical Gardens at Sibpur for a time. He occasionally contributed short notes on these subjects to the transactions of the Zoological and the Linnean Societies of London, of both of which he was a member.\n\nOn his retirement from India he joined the Council of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, and took a prominent part in the management of the affairs of that Society. Though averse to authorship, he was a charming literary correspondent. I always felt deeply grateful to him for most interesting notes of the progress of Oriental Literature in Europe, which he regularly sent to me. Nor did he forget our Society. He watched its progress with deep interest, and frequently corresponded with our Secretaries and leading members. Latterly he was occupied in superintending the publication of a Memoir, by Mr. Moore, of the rarer specimens of Lepidoptera in the late Mr. W. S. Atkinson\u2019s collection, and contributed a biographical notice of Mr. Atkinson by way of introduction to the first volume of that work. I am glad to be able to announce that your Council have made arrangements for bringing out the third volume of the work under the superintendence of our late President, Mr. W. T. Blanford. We have lost in Mr. Grote a collaborateur and friend the equal of whom it will be hard to obtain. As a personal friend I deeply mourn his loss.\n\nThe following papers were read\u2014\n\n1. *Natural History notes from H.

Sita's Window, or Buddha's Shadow Cave, near Prabh\u00e1sa, with an eye copy of an ancient inscription in the Asoka characters.\u2014By J. Cockburn.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThis is a short paper in which the writer briefly explains the circumstances that led to the discovery of the inscription, and the steps he took to get an eye-copy of it; which he eventually succeeded in making with the aid of an astronomical telescope. The inscription consists of seven lines in the Asoka character, carved on a sunken and once polished surface which is a part of the natural rock, and resembles a tablet let into the rock; the position of the tablet is above the left top corner of the main entrance window of the cave, and the letters, which are cut in the rock to the depth of three-sixteenth's of an inch, are in a surprisingly perfect state of preservation, considering their great age. Sita's window is described as being an ancient Buddhist hermit's cave cut into the vertical face of a precipice 50 feet high, which forms the scarp of the classic hill of Prabh\u00e1sa in the Allahabad district. The cave is situated 150 feet to the N. E. corner of the Jain Temple of Parishn\u00e1th, which is built on a platform immediately below the scarp; and is now known to the people as \"Chet\u00e1 M\u00e1t\u00e1-ka Roseiy\u00e1.\" Mr. Cockburn identifies the cave with the lofty stone cavern of a venomous dragon, in which Buddha was supposed to have left his shadow, but owing to its inaccessible position, and the presence of numerous swarms of wild bees, he was unable to enter the cave: it has a small entrance and two apertures about 8\" square to admit light, the irregular form of which he considers as the best proof that it is the cave in which Buddha left his shadow, as they might well be constructed to throw a shadow within, having the human outline.\n\nDr. Hoernle remarked:\u2014the copy of the inscription is not quite as legible as one could wish. This is the more to be regretted as there is just a possibility of its containing a chronological date in the last line in the older style of numerals. The copy does not profess to be more than an eye-copy, taken by means of a large telescope. As such it is probably as good as it could be; but mere eye-copies are never quite satisfactory. Mr. Cockburn is fully entitled to the honour of the first discovery of the inscription; at the same time it is satisfactory to know, that\u2014as I have\nbeen told by Dr. Burgess\u2014Dr. F\u00fchrer of the Archaeological Survey has independently discovered the inscription and is taking steps to obtain a more exact copy by means of an impression taken from the rock. At present the inscription cannot be fully read. Some of the letters are either not accurately copied, or they are not sufficiently well preserved on the rock. The inscription is written in the so-called A\u015boka characters, of a somewhat later type, and to judge from that fact, it should belong to about the beginning of the Christian era. A peculiarity of it is that it writes the conjunct r, after as well as before the consonant to which it is joined. Thus in the 4th line we have praput\u0101nam \u201cof the descendants,\u201d where the r in pra is indicated by a wavy line under pa, exactly as in the Girn\u0101r Inscription of A\u015boka. Again in lines 3 and 4 we have nirv\u0101pita (nirv\u0101pid\u0101) \u201cdeceased.\u201d Here the change of t to d is another peculiarity. The r, however, is as often assimilated in the usual fashion, as in mitasa (mittassa, Skr. mitrasya) in the 2nd line. Another peculiarity is the frequent use of what Dr. B\u00fchler calls the serif, i.e., a small stroke to define the ends of the horizontal or vertical strokes which form the body of the letter.\n\nThe inscription, so far as I am able to make it out, reads as follows. The dots indicate letters which are said to be lost on the rock. The \u2018dashes\u2019 indicate illegible letters.\n\n\u2014 \u2014 Gop\u0101 \u0101putrasa \u2022\nbapasa trimitasa \u2022 \u2022\nm\u0101tam lena Gopali ni\nrvapida-praput\u0101nam \u2022 \u2022\n\u0101 \u2014 gha\u1e6denena len\u0101\nk\u0101rita pu \u2014 \u2014 dasa \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nmasatachha \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 10 + 5 (= 15)\n\nThe paper will be published in Part I of the Journal for 1887.\nLIBRARY.\n\nThe following additions have been made to the Library since the meeting held in February last.\n\nTRANSACTIONS, PROCEEDINGS AND JOURNALS,\n\npresented by the respective Societies and Editors.\n\nAmsterdam.

Any member of the Society not permanently resident in India, as defined in Rule 32, may, after he shall have paid his entrance fee, compound for the payment of all future subscriptions as a Foreign member by the payment of a single sum of Rs. 200.\"\n\nThe opinion was expressed that the amount should be altered to \"\u00a320 sterling, payable to the London Agents of the Society.\"\n\nThe Chairman reported that the following Circular had been received from the Secretary, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Mass., U. S. A. regarding the Elizabeth Thompson Science Fund, with the request that it might be made known at the next meeting of the Society:\u2014\nELIZABETH THOMPSON SCIENCE FUND.\n\nThis fund which has been established by Mrs. Elizabeth Thompson of Stamford, Connecticut, \"for the advancement and prosecution of scientific research in its broadest sense,\" now amounts to $25,000. As accumulated income is again available, the trustees desire to receive applications for appropriations in aid of scientific work. This endowment is not for the benefit of any one department of science, but it is the intention of the trustees to give the preference to those investigations which cannot otherwise be provided for, which have for their object the advancement of human knowledge or the benefit of mankind in general, rather than to researches directed to the solution of questions of merely local importance.\n\nApplications for assistance from this fund should be accompanied by a full statement of the nature of the investigation, of the conditions under which it is to be prosecuted, and of the manner in which the appropriation asked for is to be expended. The applications should be forwarded to the Secretary of the Board of Trustees, Dr. C. T. Minot, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Mass., U. S. A.\n\nDr. R\u00e1jendral\u00e1la Mitra in bringing to the notice of the meeting the new edition of Manu with seven Commentaries,* recently published by the Hon. Rao Sahib Visvan\u00e1th N\u00e1r\u00e1yana Mandlik, C. S. I. made the following remarks: Among the presentations lately received there is an edition of the Institutes of Manu, which is worthy of special notice. The text of the Manu-sa\u00f1hita has been already printed some twenty times or more in India, and some of the editions contain also the commentary of Kulluka Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da; a new edition therefore may not appear anything out of the common. The new one, however, comes with a special recommendation; it includes seven different commentaries, six of which are rare and have now been printed for the first time. The editor is well-known for his literary labours, his high scholarship, and his profound knowledge of Hindu law, and he has taken great pains to make his edition in every way worthy of his reputation. Of the text he has had access to a large number of MSS. from almost every part of India where Sanskrit is largely cultivated, and has made excellent use of them to secure a complete critical apparatus for the study of the work. Of most of the commentaries, MSS. are exceedingly rare,\n\n* M\u00e1nava-Dharm\u00e1 S\u00e1stra, with the Commentaries of Medh\u00e1tithi, Sarvaj\u00f1a n\u00e1r\u00e1yana, Kulluka, R\u00e1ghav\u00e1nanda, Nandana, R\u00e1machandra, and Govindar\u00e1ja. Edited with notes by the Hon. Rao Sahab Vishvan\u00e1th N\u00e1r\u00e1yan Mandlik, C. S. I.; M. R. A. S.; F. R. G. S.; F. S. S. (Lond.) Additional Member of Council of the Governor-General of India, &c. &c. &c.\nand the editor had to content himself with only a few; but none has been printed from a single MS. The variae lectiones supplied leave no room for doubt that we have got the works intact, and to philologists and historians, as well as to practical lawyers, they will not fail to be of immense value.\n\nI am aware that some leading European orientalists attach little importance to Indian commentaries; a few go the length of saying that it would have been better had no commentaries existed of the Vedas and other very ancient texts, since they warp our judgment, and often mislead us in our search for the original meaning of our ancient records. They hold concordance, analogy, philological arguments to be better proofs, and insist that we should always abide by them to the exclusion of the commentaries. As a matter of course, orthodox Hindus look upon this course with great repugnance, and their arguments per contra are not by any means weak. A reductio ad absurdum argument they sometimes use is amusingly effective. There is a precept in Sanskrit which is daily recited by a large number of Indians, and it runs thus:\n\nSukl\u0101mbaradharam devam \u015ba\u015bivarpam chaturbhujam prasannavada-nam dhy\u0101yet.\n\nIt means 'let the devotee meditate on the divinity as dressed in white garments, resplendent, of the colour of the moon, four-handed, and of benign countenance.' Now, an advocate of the concordance school intervenes, and says that cannot be. The first term is a compound of three words, of which the first sukla means 'white;' the second ambara, 'cloth;' and the third dhara 'to bear' or 'carry,' the whole meaning 'that which carries white cloth,' i.e. a washerman's donkey, which carries home white clothes from the bleaching field. It is called deva or 'bright,' or light coloured, and no one has yet seen a jet black donkey. Any possible doubt in the case is removed by the epithet, \u015ba\u015bivarna, moon-coloured, which can only mean ash-grey. The epithet 'four-handed' (chaturbhuja) is a very becoming euphemism for four-footed, and the 'benign countenance' (prasanna-vadana) is obviously indicative of the natural non-expressiveness of the countenance of a donkey. The different meanings of the words may be supported by hundreds of concordant passages, and the conclusion follows that the Hindu S'\u0101stras require a Vaishnava devotee, for his salvation, to meditate on the image of a washerman's donkey loaded with recently bleached cloth.\n\nGrammatical ingenuity is, however, not satisfied with this exposition. The philologist comes forward, and argues from his own peculiar standpoint. He holds, and with perfect grammatical and lexi-\ncographical accuracy, that s'ukl\u0101 \"white\" also, means 'fair,' and, since\nthe next member of the compound is amb\u0101 a \"mother,\" the meaning\nfair is the most appropriate here, and the two words together mean,\n'he whose mother is a fair lady', i.e., Gane\u015ba, the elephantcephalic god\nwhose mother is pre-eminently called Gaur\u012b, the 'fair one.' The next\nelement of the compound is ra which means 'to take or take about,\ni.e., to serve as a vehicle or V\u0101hana.' This makes the word to\nmean 'he who carries Gane\u015ba,' i.e., a mouse who is well-known\nto be the vehicle of the god named. The last member of the\ncompound, dhara, means 'to seize' or 'catch,' as well as to carry, and\nthe whole compound must mean, 'he who has caught the vehicle of him\nwho has a fair lady for his mother,' in other words, a cat holding\na mouse. The qualifying epithets apply to this cat just as well as to the\ndonkey, especially the 'benign countenance,' for a cat holding so\ndelectable a morsel in his mouth as a plump mouse cannot but look\nparticularly pleased. The conclusion according to this interpretation is\nthat the devotee should meditate, for the salvation of his soul, on the\nimage of a cat holding a mouse in his mouth. Seeing that the Hindus\ndo worship monkeys, bulls, Br\u0101hma\u1e47i kites, and other animals, the\naddition of the donkey and the cat to the list need not be looked upon\nas improbable, and anthropologists may well look upon these animals\nas totems. To the Hindus, however, the absurdity is patent, and no\nfurther argument is needed to prove the extremely misleading character\nof exegesis by grammar and concordance.\n\nDoubtless much may be said per contra, but I need not dwell\nupon the theme. Suffice it to say that, whatever its merits in expounding\nthe Vedas in regard to which imaginative scholars like to have ample\nelbow room, the plan of concordance is totally unsuited for the exposi-\ntion of law. The danger is imminent, and much mischief has already been\ndone by the misinterpretation of our law-books by English Judges, work-\ning under the light of imperfect translations. A notable instance of this\nmay be found in the judge-made law about adoptions by women and S\u016bdras.\nA medi\u00e6val quasi-religious maxim says, 'Women and S\u016bdras\nshould not repeat mantras,' (Str\u012b-s'\u016bdra'mantrakah,) and, with that\nverse before them, our English Judges, not excepting their Lordships\nof the Privy Council, have decided that S\u016bdras may adopt, i.e., accept\na dattaka son without any form of religious ceremony, forgetting that\nthe word mantra in the verse simply means a verse of the Rig Veda\nS\u0101hitas, whereas in ordinary parlance it means all Sanskrit words\nused in religious service, including the declaration of giving and re-\nceiving a child, as in the Dattaka ceremony, or of a bride in a mar-\nriage.\nThe most rigid attention to commentaries is necessary to avoid such absurdities. In these alone we can have the traditional meaning, the meaning which the people have hitherto assigned to their texts, and every departure from them is an outrage on the law of the land, which the Government is pledged to uphold. And as the text of Manu is cited in every judicial proceeding concerning Hindu Law, Mr. Mandalik has done valuable service to legal practitioners, by placing the commentaries before them in so acceptable a form.\n\nThe necessity for a careful comparison of the different commentaries was felt a long time ago. The late lamented scholar, Mr. Burnell, took in hand a translation of the text of Manu with voluminous notes, showing the differences of the different commentaries. Our Society also wished to do something in the same way, and very readily accepted a proposition of Dr. J. Jolly to print, in the \"Bibliotheca Indica,\" extracts from all the commentaries then accessible to him, except that of Kuluka Bhatta. Two fasciculi of this work have already been published under the title of 'Manu-tik\u00e1-sangraha.' Owing to other engagements the learned editor of the work has not been able to push on this undertaking as fast as could be wished. The published portion comes up to only about one-ninth of the total, and now that all the commentaries have been published in their entirety, it will be for your Council to consider whether your undertaking should not be dropped. Disjointed extracts, without even the texts to which they refer, cannot be of any value, or at all worth having, when the entire works are at hand in so convenient a form.\n\nMr. H. F. Blanford read the following remarks on some recent evidence on the subject of the variation of the rainfall of the Carnatic and N. W. Himalayas with the sun-spot period.\n\nThe supposed variation of the rainfall of the globe in response to those changes in the sun's condition which we know best by the variation in the magnitude and frequency of the spots on his surface has been tolerably familiar to all who busy themselves with meteorological enquiries, ever since in 1872 Mr. Charles Meldrum communicated to the British Association his discovery that the cyclones of the South Indian Ocean were subject to such a cyclical variation. In 1872, Mr. Norman Lockyer drew public attention to the fact that the rainfall of Madras (that is, that recorded at the Madras Observatory) appeared to vary in like manner, inasmuch as the average rainfall in years when sunspots were at or near their maximum frequency, very appreciably exceeded that of years when they were at or near their minimum. Subsequently other writers took up the subject: among others, one of the\nbest known is Dr. now Sir, W. W. Hunter who in a pamphlet written in his well known brilliant style of exposition, set forth these new familiar facts of the rainfall, basing them, however, on the much more extensive data of sixty-four years' registers, together with the further important observation, which I believe originated with Mr. Pogson, viz., that the famines of Southern India recurred at intervals of about 11 years, coinciding with the recurrence of the sun-spot minimum. It fell to me, as an official duty, to review the evidence adduced in Dr. Hunter's pamphlet and other writing, on the subject, the economic bearings of which were obviously of the highest importance, and I had to point out that while the rainfall registers of the Madras Observatory, undeniably showed a certain amount of fluctuation of the kind pointed out by Mr. Norman Lockyer and Dr. W. W. Hunter, any other stations in Southern India, the rainfall registers of which were among the oldest extant, to wit Bangalore and Mysore and other stations in the peninsula and other parts of India, viz., Bombay, Calcutta, Nagpur and Jubbulpore, with a partial and doubtful exception in the case of Nagpur, failed to show any trace of such a cyclical variation. But it was notorious that the famines the periodicity of which was considered corroborative of the rainfall oscillation had sometimes affected the Carnatic, sometimes Mysore and Bellary, sometimes Hyderabad and the Deccan, and sometimes the Northern Circars and Orissa; so that the two classes of facts must be regarded as to a great extent independent of each other.\n\nIn a lecture delivered on the 18th May 1877 at the Royal Institution in Albemarle Street, General R. Strachey also pointed out the insufficiency of the evidence adduced to bear out the conclusions drawn from them. His criticism is so much to the point, and the objection raised, notwithstanding its obvious validity, is so frequently disregarded by persons who enter on enquiries of this kind, that it is worth quoting in its original form of expression. Speaking of Dr. Hunter's results he says, \"He has inferred from what must be held to be altogether insufficient numerical data that sure indications of periodicity exist. He arrives by an arithmetical process at certain figures, which he regards as the probable mean amount of rainfall in the successive years of the 11 year's cycle, and finding a maximum and minimum among them, he infers that this is a proof of a true periodical variation. But such a result alone proves nothing. To test its value, it is necessary to compare the calculated quantities of rain for the several years with the quantities actually observed, and then to consider whether the differences are of a character to justify the belief that the calculated quantities afford a reliable approximation to the truth and what sort of approximation * * * The only conclusion that seems possible from such\nan examination of the figures as I have described, is the negative one, that they cannot be accepted as supplying any evidence in support of the views put forward by Dr. Hunter.\"\n\nIn 1877, another key-note was struck simultaneously or nearly so by Mr. Douglas Archibald and Mr. S. A. Hill. The former in a letter to the *Englishman*, which was afterwards noticed in *Nature*, pointed out that the winter rainfall of Calcutta is marked by a distinct periodicity, and of the opposite character to that supposed to be shewn by the Madras rainfall registers; the maximum rainfall occurring during the years of minimum sun-spots and the minimum rainfall during the years of maximum sun-spots. The latter in a report on the rainfall of the N. W. Provinces addressed to the Government of the N. W. Provinces, noticed that the registers seemed to lend some support to the theory that underlying very great irregular and non-periodic variations, there is a fluctuation of the total annual rainfall coinciding approximately with that of sun-spot frequency, and further that the winter rains of Northern India are generally heavier when the total fall of the year is below the mean than when the summer rains are excessive. These three ideas were further brought to the test and worked out with a more definite result, in a paper published by Mr. Hill in 1879 in the Indian Meteorological Memoir. The final conclusions were that \"The winter rains are heaviest when the summer rains are defective, and vice versa.\" That \"the maximum of winter rainfall appeared to be reached rather more than a year before the minimum of sun-spots and the minimum rainfall to coincide with or follow the maximum of sun-spots, at about an equal interval.\"\n\nWith regard to the rainfall Mr. Hill concluded that there is an eleven-year cycle but of a different character, the maximum being reached about 4 years after the sun-spot maximum and the minimum three years later. His figures shew, however, that this minimum is followed by a rise and then by another minimum as great as the first or nearly so, the intervening year corresponding to that of minimum sun-spots.\n\nNearly eight years have elapsed since the latest of these notices was published, and meanwhile further data have been steadily accumulating. Recently in the course of a searching enquiry into all the facts of the distribution of the Indian rainfall and its vicissitudes, I have had occasion to go again over all the ground surveyed in the writings I have referred to, and very much more in addition, I have done so with due regard to the cautionary monitions of General Strachey, and with results so distinct as to leave but little doubt on my mind that we have really to do with a cyclical variation very distinct in character and of such mag-\nnitude as to be of considerable economic importance, but differing in different parts of India.\n\nI will first take the facts relating to Southern India. Instead of dealing with the rainfall registers of one station only, a very feeble and unsatisfactory basis for testing any question of the kind, I have taken the rainfall registers of all the sudder and some sub-divisional stations in the Carnatic, including under this designation the plain below the eastern ghats extending from Tinnevelly to the mouth of the Kistna. There are 38 stations representing 72,000 square miles, and the registers extend over 22 years, two complete sun-spot cycles, viz., from 1864 to 1885. On simply tabulating the average of each year it was obvious that during the first 13 years with very slight irregularities the rainfall varied very nearly with the sun-spots. Being already below the average in 1864 it fell to a minimum in 1867, when it was 9\u00b74 inches below the average of 34\u00b76 inches, these increased steadily year by year up to 1872 when it was at a maximum, being 11\u00b75 inches above the average. With a sudden fall to an average amount in 1873 and a recovery in the following year to 7\u00b73 inches above the average, it declined steadily for 3 more years to another minimum in 1876, when it was 13\u00b72 inches below the average. After this it became more irregular, but with sundry oscillations it rose again to 11\u00b76 inches above the average in 1884. The years of minimum sun-spots were 1867 and 1878. The years of maximum sun-spots 1870 and 1883 or the beginning of 1884. Thus the first minimum year of rainfall was a year of minimum sun-spots, the second preceded the latter minimum by 2 years. The first maximum of rainfall was 3 years after the sun-spot maximum, the second coincided with it or followed it by a few months only. These facts taken in conjunction with the amplitude of the oscillation amounting to considerably more than half the average rainfall of the province are striking enough.\n\nBut it remained to ascertain how far this is a real cyclical oscillation, to compute the amount for each year as it would be determined by such a cycle, and to compare this year by year with the amount actually recorded. Only in this way, as General Strachey pointed out, could we ascertain how much of the result is due to the operation of a law and how much due to other and non-compatible agencies.\n\nBy the application of Bessel's well known harmonic formula it is quite feasible to ascertain from any given series of figures what, according to the theory of errors, is the most probable value of any cyclical oscillation underlying them, when the length of the cycle is approximately known. This is so in the present case. The cycle of the sun-spots has been determined by Wolf to be 11\u00b71 years. For convenience, as I have only two cycles to deal with, I have taken it at exactly\neleven years, and computing out the hypothetical rainfall of each year of the cycle, on this assumption, I find that the periodical variation so determined is at the time of the minimum 6\u00b77 inches below the average of 34\u00b73 inches, and at the time of maximum 7\u00b73 inches above it, the total mean oscillation being 14 inches, or more than two-fifths of the whole. The recorded rainfall of any single year deviates on an average from the hypothetical value by only 3\u00b76 inches. The result is far greater and more striking than I, or I believe any one else, would have ventured to anticipate.\n\nBut now comes a curious point. No other province of Southern India, as far as I have yet ascertained, exhibits anything approaching to such regularity. The rainfall of Mysore and Bellary, a region more subject to famine than Madras itself, shows scarcely an appreciable oscillation coinciding with the sun-spot cycle, except that it exhibits a very distinct minimum in 1876. The province of Malabar has indeed two very distinct minima in 1866-67 and 1875-76, but there was another greater than either in 1881 and the maxima were very irregular, occurring in 1871, 1874, 1878 and 1882, and the Deccan and Hyderabad are not more concordant. At present therefore only the Carnatic can be said to have its rainfall varying in an eleven-year cycle, but in this case the coincidence is very marked indeed.\n\nOn the question of the periodical recurrence of famines, I have nothing to add to the facts detailed in the Report of the Famine Commissioners.\n\nThe conclusions drawn by Mr. Hill that the winter rainfall and summer rainfall of the N.-W. Provinces both show a periodical variation, but of a different character in the two cases, and that the summer rainfall tends to vary in the opposite direction to the winter rainfall have also been critically examined.\n\nTaking the rainfall of the N.W. Himalayan stations alone, from November to May inclusive, and tabulating it year by year for about 26 stations, I find that it shows amid some irregularities a very much more distinct cyclical variation than that obtained by Mr. Hill from the registers of twenty stations, half on the hills and half on the plains. It seems to have been at a maximum in the winter and spring of 1864-1865, to have decreased with some irregular variations, but on the whole pretty steadily, till 1872-73, to have again increased in like manner till 1877-78, after which it became more irregular, dropping to a minimum in 1878-79, then increasing again till 1880-81 and decreasing to 1883-84. Notwithstanding these irregularities, when the probable oscillation in the eleven-year cycle is computed out it is found to be not less striking than that of the Carnatic rainfall. It amounts when at its\nmaximum to 33 per cent. in excess of the average, when at its minimum to nearly 18 per cent. below it. The first almost exactly coincides with the minimum of the sun-spots, the second follows the sun-spot maximum by 2 or 3 years. The cyclical variation therefore on the experience of two cycles amounts to more than 50 per cent. of the average, but it does not seem to vary concurrently with the quantity of the spots, in other words, with the activity of the movements in the solar photosphere, but rather to consist of a sudden intensification of the winter and spring precipitation on the mountains about the time when the sun-spots are at their minimum.\n\nThe variation of the summer rainfall of the plains I have tested by comparing the rainfall of the months June to September of the whole of North-Western India east of the Ravi, viz., the Eastern Punjab, Rajputana, the N.-W. Provinces and Ondh and the Central India States, Saugor and Nerbudda, and comprising about 100 registering stations. The most noticeable feature is that in those years when the winter and spring rainfall is very excessive on the hills, and the snowfall remarkably thick and copious there is a great deficiency of rain on the plains in the following summer. Especially was this the case in 1868 and 1877, and to a certain degree in 1865. In general in 14 years out of 22 the variations of the summer rainfall on the plains vary in the opposite direction to the winter rainfall on the hills, but it is only in years of extraordinary precipitation on the hills that this opposition is very strongly manifested.\n\nThis conclusion, as I need hardly point out, is strongly confirmatory of the view I put forward originally in 1877 and which has been made the basis of forecasts of the monsoon rainfall, viz., that the snowfall has a direct and prejudicial influence on the summer rainfall.\n\nNor is this influence restricted to Northern India. There is much community between the phenomenon of dry winds and droughts in Northern India, and in Western and even Southern India, but the discussion of this point would lead me far afield beyond the subject of my present notice, the purport of which is that I consider it no longer doubtful that a cyclical variation of a very marked kind regulates the rainfall of the Carnatic on the one hand, and the winter rainfall of the North-Western Himalaya on the other, and that in some degree similar or opposite oscillations are traceable in the rainfall of other provinces. But I have been quite unable to detect such an oscillation in the rainfall of India as a whole.\n\nThe Philological Secretary read a report by V. A. Smith, F.R.S., of Basti, N.-W. P. of a find of old coins in Pargana Bansi, east Basti district.\nSome Cham\u00e1rs in October 1886 when ploughing at Masn\u00e1 near Kakrah\u00ed Gh\u00e1t in Tappa Nandip\u00e1r, Parg\u00e1n\u00e1 B\u00e1nsi, east of the Bast\u00ed District, N. W. P., found a metal pot containing coins. The pot is said to have contained 54 coins, but only 38 have been recovered, viz.,\n\nGhiy\u00e1s-ud-d\u00edn Balban. 25 (Thomas, Pathan Kings, page 134, No. 112, Plate II, 42).\n\nMuizz-ud-d\u00edn Kaikob\u00e1d. 12 (ibid., page 141, No. 116, Plate II, 46).\n\n'Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn Mu\u1e25ammad Sh\u00e1h (ibid., p. 171, No. 132 or 133, Pl. III, 57).\n\nThe village where the find occurred is on the road between B\u00e1nsi and Nep\u00e1l.\n\nThe coins of 'Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn are very common. Those of Balban appear to be less common, and those of Muizz-ud-d\u00edn Kaikob\u00e1d scarce. Two coins of this last named prince were found last year in the south of the Bast\u00ed District (Proceedings, A. S. B, April 1886, p. 68).\n\nAction has been taken under the provisions of the Treasure Trove Act, and as many of the coins as Government may desire to take can be acquired.\n\nThe Philological Secretary read an extract from a letter from C. J. Rodgers, Esq., of the Archaeological Survey Department, regarding coins that he had collected during his recent tour.\n\n\"I am just finishing my tour. During it I have collected upwards of 300 coins of different kinds for Government. These include a Sikandar S\u00far\u00ed and an Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm S\u00far\u00ed, coins of the greatest rarity. I have also found a char t\u00e1nke of Akbar's. This I take to be the four t\u00e1nke-piece. Several n\u00edm t\u0101nkahs have also turned up, and a quantity of ful\u00fas of various mints. In one place in the hills here I obtained seven Il\u00e1h\u00ed months of one mint,\u2014Dihli. Yesterday I secured here three months of another mint, Gobindp\u00far.\n\n\"But the most puzzling thing I have found is a series of coins struck at D\u00e1r ul Khil\u00e1fat and D\u00e1r al Isl\u00e1m Dog\u00e1m (\u0645\u06a9\u0648). They are simply more abundant than any other mint, and yet I can find no clue as to what it was or where.\n\n\"I think I have found remains of the temple destroyed by Mahm\u00fad of Ghazn\u00ed in K\u00e1ngr\u00e1. But of this I am not quite certain.\"\n\nThe Philological Secretary read the following extract from a letter from A. M. Markham, Esq., Bijnaur, forwarding two terra-cotta Buddhist medals (see Plate I).\n\n* [See a mention of these coins in Mr. Oliver's paper in the Journal, A. S. B. Vol. LV, for 1886.]\n\"I have sent you by parcel post a box containing (1) the pieces of a terra-cotta circular medal, so to speak, bearing a beautiful impression of a seated Buddha under a chaitya, with an armed (?) attendant standing on either side, and with small flying figures playing round the apex of the 'ktee' of the chaitya. Underneath is a tolerably plain inscription, and below the inscription a strange little figure in an attitude of servility (or worship ?) before an object which I cannot make out. On the reverse is what I take to be meant for the Bo tree.\n\n\"May I beg of you to be so good as to decipher the inscription for me, and tell me the probable, or perhaps exact, age of the medal. I would put it in about the 8th or 9th century A.D.\n\n\"I also put in the box (2) a perfect specimen of a smaller and less beautiful medal, also with an inscription. May I request you to favour me with a reading of it also. These, with many hundreds of small terra-cotta moulded plaques of Buddha seated, measuring 3 inches by 1\u00bd in., all identical, were found by me recently in a mound. On receiving translations from you, I shall send you a paper on the mound and its opening and hope to be permitted by Government to send for the Society's Museum specimens of the articles found in it. I am under an obligation to send them to the N.-W. P. and Oudh Museum at Lucknow; but have no doubt that, as they are so numerous, I shall obtain permission to send some to your Society.\"\n\nDr. Hoernle remarked: The medals are correctly described in Mr. Markham's note. Representations similar to that on the larger medal may be seen on the Barhut stones in the Indian Museum (see General Cunningham's Stupa of Bharut, Pl. XIII, XXXI et passim). The flying figures are human, and bear garlands. The attendants carry chauris in their right hands. The objects in their left hands are not distinct; that in the hand of the right-hand figure seems to be a long bow. The left-hand figure wears a necklet. Both are clothed in dhotis only. Their head-dresses slightly differ. Their heads appear to be encircled by a halo. Buddha, on the chaitya, is represented seated, in the attitude of meditation. The figure below the inscription would seem to be a woman, to judge from the head dress. The object before which she kneels is perhaps a pan on a woodfire, which she is represented as blowing. The inscription is merely the well-known Buddhist creed, which runs as follows:\n\n\u0935\u0947 \u092d\u094c\u092e\u093e \u092c\u0947\u0926\u0941\u092a\u092d\u0935\u093e \u092c\u0947\u0926\u0941\u0928\u094b\u092a\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0938\u093e\u0924\u0940 \u091a\u093e\u0935\u0926-\n\u0938\u0947\u092a\u094d\u092a (\u091a \u092f\u094b \u0928\u093f\u0930\u093e\u092e \u090f) \u092c\u0947\u0926\u093e\u0926\u093f \u092e\u0939\u093e\u0938\u092e\u094d\u092d\u0935 [1]\n\ni.e., 'All things that proceed from a cause, their cause the Tath\u0101gata has declared as well as what is their destruction. Such is the di\nA new gold Gupta coin forwarded by Mr. H. Rivett-Carnac. [April,\n\nturn of the great Sramana.\u2019 (See the Proceedings for June 1881, p. 113.) The words enclosed in brackets are broken away on the medal.\n\nThe inscription on the smaller medal is the same Buddhist creed, but it is nearly illegible. This medal shows a panel, containing Buddha seated in the attitude of meditation, with two attendants standing on each side. The panel is surmounted by a large stupa with one small one on either side. The whole, panel and stupas, are encircled by a garland of small bells. The inscription is below the panel.\n\nThe Philological Secretary exhibited a new gold Gupta coin forwarded by Mr. H. Rivett-Carnac. The following is the description of the coin supplied to him by Mr. V. Smith:\n\nObv. Bull to right. Above Sri Vira \u00d7, below between legs, two characters.\n\nRev. Lakshmi as usual; legend on right edge, kramaditya.\n\nDiameter about 7/16 of an inch.\n\nDr. Hoernle remarked, that the letters were so badly preserved, that he would not venture to say what the legend was. The only distinct letter was m\u0101 on the reverse. He would also take this opportunity of exhibiting three other coins. One was a small copper coin from Kashmir sent to him by Mr. L. W. King. It showed on the obverse a humped bull to the left, with very indistinct traces of one or two letters; on the reverse a standing figure with outstretched arms; legend sahijav\u0101. The other coin was a silver forgery of a gold Gupta coin, received from Mr. W. Crooke, C. S., Etah. The type was that of the \u2018Rider, and peacock-feeding female.\u2019 (See Journal, A. S. B., Vol. LIII, plate III, fig. 13.) It appeared to have come from Kanauj, where it is known that forgeries of this kind are carried on. The third was a copper coin, also received from Mr. Crooke. It belonged to the well-known type of R\u0101madatta. But it was peculiar on account of its being a beautiful specimen of a double-struck coin. The legend read R\u0101j\u00f1o R\u0101madattasa (see Plate I).\n\nThe Philological Secretary exhibited a MS. in two volumes called \u201cV\u012bsuddhi M\u0101rga,\u201d by Buddha Ghosha, lent by the Archbishop of Siam.\n\nDr. Hoernle reported his attendance at the Seventh International Congress of Orientalists, Vienna, on behalf of the Society, and submitted a copy of the report drawn up by himself and his colleague, Mr. G. A. Grierson, for the Government of India by whom they had been sent to Vienna as joint-delegates. The following is the substance of the report:\n\n\u201cWe arrived in Vienna on September 26th, and after inscribing our names at the Kanzlei of the University received an invitation for a\nBUDDHIST CLAY MEDALS.\n\nAncient Gold and Copper Coins.\nsocial gathering the same evening. At this gathering the members of the Congress met for the first time, and made each other's acquaintance.\n\n\"Next morning (27th September) the first formal general meeting took place at 10-30 A.M. in the Fest-Saal of the University. His Imperial and Royal Highness the Archduke Rainer presided, and on his declaring the Congress open, the delegates and members were welcomed by His Excellency Dr. P. Gautsch von Frankenthurn, Austrian Minister of Public Instruction, in the name of the Government. The President, Baron von Kremer, next thanked the Archduke for undertaking the protectorate, and the Government for its support, and read his inaugural lecture on the connections between Europe and the East. We were then welcomed by the B\u00fcrgermeister in the name of the City of Vienna, and after a few addresses by various delegates and presenters of books, the President requested the members to constitute themselves into sections.\n\n\"The following sections were then constituted:\n\n(1) Arabic.\n(2) Semitic (omitting Arabic).\n(3) Aryan.\n(4) African and Egyptian.\n(5) Chinese and Polynesian.\n\n\"We enrolled ourselves as members of the Aryan Section, and shall confine our remarks to it. We were, of course, unable to attend the meetings of the other sections.\n\n\"At the first sitting of the section, officers were appointed, viz.:\n\nProfessor R. von Roth\u2014President.\nProfessor A. Weber and Professor C. Lignana\u2014Vice-Presidents.\nProfessor Ch. Michel and Dr. J. Hanusz\u2014Secretaries.\n\n\"The Session then adjourned till 2 p.m., when business was regularly begun. The first person called upon to read his communication was Mr. Grierson. He had two papers to read, one a short note suggesting a systematic survey of Indian vernaculars, and the other a historical sketch of medieval Hindi poetry. He requested to be allowed to postpone reading the latter for a day or two as it was not quite ready, and, in connexion with the note, laid on the table a set of the grammars of the Bih\u00e1r dialects, and a copy of Bih\u00e1r Peasant Life, as specimens of what the Government of Bengal was doing in the way of surveying the vernaculars in its territories. Dr. Hoernle and Professor B\u00fchler spoke in support of his proposal, and it was finally agreed to postpone any formal resolution, till his paper on Hindi poets, which was fixed for the following Wednesday, should have been read.\"\n\"Mr. Cecil Bendall, of the British Museum, then read a paper on a manuscript and an inscription discovered by him during his late tour in India, in a character not hitherto noticed. The manuscript was a fragment of a rare work on grammar used by the Buddhists, and was bought in Nepal. The inscription was in the Calcutta Museum. Nothing was known about the character, and the alphabet was possibly one of those alluded to in works of the Buddhists. In the discussion which followed, Professor R. von Roth and Professor E. Kuhn took part.\n\n\"Dr. Pollak next announced the preparation of a German-Persian Dictionary.\n\n\"Professor B\u00fchler laid on the table the following works:\n\n(1) A specimen of the Atharvav\u00e9dabh\u00e1shya by S. P. Pandit.\n(2) The Ling\u00e1nu\u015b\u00e1sana of V\u00e1man\u00e1ch\u00e1rya by Dr. P. Peterson.\n(3) A paper by Dr. Bhagvanl\u00e1l Indr\u00e1j\u00ed on two Chalukya inscriptions.\n\n\"The thanks of the section were voted to the three authors.\n\n\"Professor J. Jolly, the well known Tagore Law Lecturer, and now Professor of Sanskrit at W\u00fcrzburg, read a short note on the new edition of the M\u00e1nava Dharm\u00e1\u015b\u0101stra, usually known as the laws of Manu, which he is preparing. It is to be regretted that this valuable work could not be printed in time for the Congress. It will be the first critical edition of this important law-book, and will well deserve the attention both of Indian students and of Indian lawyers.\n\n\"Dr. R. G. Bhandarkar read portions of a long and interesting paper which he had prepared on the result of his search for Sanskrit manuscripts. At its conclusion the thanks of the section were voted to the Chiefs of Kathiawar, and to the Bombay Government, for deputing Dr. Bhandarkar.\n\n\"Professor A. Weber drew the attention of the members to an Indian edition of the famous controversial work entitled Khalavaktrachapetik\u00e1 or 'a slap in the face of the wicked.'\n\n\"The first meeting of the section fitly terminated with an interesting ceremony. Professor E. Windisch, of Leipzig, the Secretary of the German Oriental Society, reminded the section that yesterday was the hundredth anniversary of the birth of Horace Hayman Wilson. All the members present then stood up in reverence of his memory.\n\n\"In the evening we attended a reception at the official residence of the Minister of Public Instruction.\n\n\"On Tuesday, the 28th, the session opened with an important paper by Dr. Hoernle on an ancient book lately found in the Panj\u00e1b, known as the 'Bakhsh\u00e1l\u00ed Manuscript,' which he was the first to decipher. The contents of the paper were too technical for a detailed account to be\ngiven here. It will suffice to state that Dr. Hoernle showed that the manuscript, written on birch-bark, probably dates from the 8th or 9th century A.D., and therefore is one of the oldest Indian manuscripts known to exist. It contains a work on arithmetic, written in the so-called G\u00e1th\u00e1 dialect, the literary form of the ancient North-Western Pr\u00e1krit, exhibiting a strange mixture of Sanskrit and Pr\u00e1krit forms. The work itself is much older than the manuscript in which it has been preserved. On various grounds it appears probable that it is the product of a member of the Buddhist or Jain community, dating from before the 4th century of our era. It is, therefore, the earliest known Indian work on arithmetic. It will shortly be published, partly at the expense of the Panj\u00e1b Government.\n\n\"Dr. Hoernle was followed by Professor O.G. Lignana on the Navagv\u00e1h and the Da\u015bagv\u00e1h of the Rigveda, and by Professor Hunfalvy of Budapest, who dealt with the origin of the Rumanian language.\n\n\"Attention was next drawn by Captain R.C. Temple to Dr. Fallon's Dictionary of Hind\u00fast\u00e1n\u00ed proverbs, and the sitting concluded with a paper by Dr. K. Glaser on ancient Indian descriptions of precious stones.\n\n\"On Wednesday, the 29th September, Professor R. von Roth drew attention to Professor B\u00fchler's new translation of Manu, and Professor B\u00fchler to Dr. Dillon's new work entitled 'the Fatherland and age of the \u00c1vesta.'\n\n\"Professor Leumann, of Strasbourg, read a note on a Jaina text entitled Angavijj\u00e1 lent to him by Dr. Bhandarkar. He was followed by Professor Jacobi who read a most interesting paper on Jainism and the worship of Kri\u1e63\u1e47a. In the discussion which ensued, Mr. Grierson took part, and pointed out some Jain folk-customs in India which were apparently not known in Europe.\n\n\"Next followed Mr. Grierson's paper on Hind\u00ed poetry. Its full title is 'The Medi\u00e6val Vernacular Literature of Hind\u00fast\u00e1n with special reference to Tul'isi D\u00e1s.'\n\n\"At the conclusion of the paper his note regarding a survey of the Vernaculars of India was again brought forward, and an animated discussion arose as to the best means of forwarding the suggestions contained in it. One of the speakers, we may mention, was Mr. C. Leland (Hans Breitmann), the eminent Romani scholar. He drew attention to the fact that the American Government was now holding a very similar survey of the dialects of the North American Indians. Nearly every scholar in Europe, who was unable to attend the Congress, and who was interested in the subject, had written a short note warmly supporting the proposal. Finally, Professor B\u00fchler made a formal proposition on the subject, which was seconded by Professor Weber of Berlin and carried\nby acclamation. We trust that when the formal proposal reaches the Government of India in due course from the authorities of the Congress, it may be deemed worthy of consideration.\n\n\"The session for this day concluded with the reading of a French poem by M. Bellin, in honour of the Congress, and with a paper by Herr L. de Millou\u00e9 on the Vri\u015babha-Myth.\n\n\"In the afternoon the members of the Congress were received at the Rathhaus by the City of Vienna, and were shown over the magnificent building, with its unique collection of arms. In the evening we attended a reception held by their Imperial and Royal Highnesses the Archduke (the Protector of the Congress) and Archduchess Rainer. We had the honour of being presented to both as delegates of the Government of India.\n\n\"On Thursday, the 30th September, a great deal of solid work was got through.\n\n\"The session opened with a communication from Captain Temple regarding the value of the well-known Panjabi epic by W\u0101ris Sh\u0101h entitled Hir\u0101 R\u0101njh\u0101. No Panjabi is considered to know his own language till he has read this work. A correct printed text is urgently required, and the speaker could lay his hands upon some very old manuscripts of the poem.\n\n\"He was followed by M. J. M. Grandjean on the origin of the toneless explosive sounds in the Indo-Germanic speeches.\n\n\"Professor R. von Roth, our President, spoke with all the weight of his great authority on the exegesis of the Veda, and the effect of euphony on certain case inflexions. In the discussion which followed, the speakers were Professors G. B\u00fchler, A. Weber, and A. Ludwig.\n\n\"Professor H. Schuchardt then handed in a new work by Professor Ascoli of Milan, entitled 'Due recenti lettere glottologiche e una poscritta nuova.' At the same time he communicated Professor Ascoli's regret that he had been unable to complete the commission made to him and Professor Joh. Schmidt, by the Berlin Congress of 1880 on the subject of a system of transcription.\n\n\"Professor B\u00fchler then presented to the section some photographs forwarded from India by Dr. Leitner, and a specimen from Mr. Fleet's third volume of the 'Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum,' and this led on to the next subject, broached by Captain Temple, who brought to the notice of the section that the Government of India had abolished the post of Epigraphist to the Government of India. A keen discussion followed in which Professors Weber, B\u00fchler, Kielhorn and Bendall took the principal part, and in which it was agreed that this action of the Indian Government was a real loss to science, and that it was most\ndesirable to make a representation to the Government of India as to the propriety of reviving the post. Mr. Fleet had rendered great services, and there were few, if any, scholars so well qualified for the duty.\n\n\"Next followed an interesting lecture in English by Dr. Stein, of Budapesth, on the Paropamisus, or Hind\u00fa Kush, in ancient Geography. Guided by the oldest Greek form of the name, Parnasos, as given by Aristotle, he was enabled to identify it with the mountain Upairigaena of the Zend Avesta. The meaning of this last name is 'higher than the flight of an eagle,' and a curious legend concerning the Hind\u00fa Kush is recorded by the Chinese traveller Hiuen Tsiang (A.D. 600) that it is too high for birds to fly over it, but that they have to cross it on foot. This legend is also mentioned by Marco Polo, by the Emperor Baber in his memoirs, and in modern times by the traveller Burnes. Dr. Stein considered that much correct information as to the geography of Afghanistan could be found in Avestic texts.\n\n\"He was followed by Professor E. Kuhn, of Munich, who read an important paper on the dialects of the Hind\u00fa Kush, founded on materials furnished by Captain Tanner, of the Survey Department, which were collected during the last Afghan war. Professor Kuhn was of opinion that these dialects, together with Kashmiri and the Romani of the Gypsies, formed a special group among the languages of the Indic branch of the Aryan family. A lively discussion followed, in which, amongst others, Mr. Leland, Professor Hunfalvy, Dr. Burkhard, and Mr. Grierson took part. The point which excited most criticism was the theory that Romani belonged to this family of languages. To this we, as well as some others, were unable to agree.\n\n\"The question of the Gypsies was next handled by Mr. G. Leland, the well known 'Hans Breitmann,' and probably the greatest master of the Romani language and lore in the world. His paper dealt with the origin of the Gypsies. He concluded a most interesting paper with the statement that he had found that there actually existed in the Panjab a wandering race, who called themselves Rom and spoke Romani. Mr. Leland does not profess to be well acquainted with the Indian Vernaculars, and this final statement immediately gave rise to the most lively criticism on the part of the Indian scholars then present. Dr. R. Cust, Mr. Macauliffe, Captain Temple, and both of us, all united in being unable to confirm his opinion. That there are in India argots, or slangs, or thieves' languages, or artificial trade languages, there can be no doubt, but no proof could be asserted of the existence of a so-called Romani language in that country. Mr. Grierson, who had studied Romani both in Europe and in India, was disposed to believe that Mr. Leland's former identification of Rom, 'a Gypsy,' with the Doms of\nIndia was the only tenable one, and that, so far as his researches had gone, without at present speaking positively, Romani was most closely connected with the languages of Eastern Hindust\u00e1n. The points urged were too technical to repeat here.\n\n\"In the evening we were invited to a great dinner party given by the Organization Committee to the members of the Congress.\n\n\"On Friday, Dr. Rost, of the India Office Library, handed in the two first sheets of the classified catalogue of Sanskrit manuscripts in that collection.\n\n\"He was followed by Dr. W. Cartellieri, who read a paper on S\u00fabandhu and B\u00e1na, and by Professor F. M\u00fcller, who discussed various passages in the Avesta.\n\n\"Mr. Macauliffe, of the Panj\u00e1b Civil Service, then gave some interesting details concerning the recent discovery of a manuscript which contains an account of B\u00e1b\u00e1 N\u00e1nak, founder of the Sikh Religion.\n\n\"Dr. Hanusz read an interesting paper on the Polish Armenian dialect of Kuty in Galicia, and dealt specially with its sound laws. He then, in the author's absence, laid before the session Dr. J. Thumajan's paper on 'the History of the classical Armenian literary language.'\n\n\"In the afternoon we all went for an excursion to the heights of the Kahlenberg, overlooking the City of Vienna, and commanding a magnificent prospect.\n\n\"On Saturday morning, the 2nd October, was held the final sitting of the section. The papers read were\u2014\n\nOn the Turkish element in Rumania, by Professor C. P. Hasdeu, of Bucharest:\n\nOn the Sraddhas, and the worship of the dead amongst the Indo-Germans, by Dr. M. Winternitz:\n\nOn the origin of the Philosophic idea amongst the Indians and Chinese, by Professor M. Straszewski of Cracow; and\n\nOn the Kutzovalachians of Epirus and Thessaly, and their languages, by Professor S. Papageorgios of Korfu.\n\n\"After a rather hurried sitting there was held a meeting of the delegates and principal officers of the Congress at which it was resolved to accept the gracious invitation of His Majesty the King of Sweden, and to hold the next Congress at Stockholm in two or three years' time, the exact date to be fixed by His Majesty.\n\n\"There was then held a final general meeting of the Congress at 1 p.m., under the presidency of His Imperial and Royal Highness the Protector, and after a number of valedictory speeches in various languages the Oriental Congress of 1886 was declared closed.\n\n\"We may mention here, amongst other objects of interest visited by\nus in Vienna, the collection of papyri found at El Fayum in Egypt, and the property of the Archduke Rainer. These are being gradually deciphered by Professor J. Karabacek. They form, apparently, a portion of the contents of an ancient office for registration of deeds. Some of these papers are as old as the 7th century A.D., and, judging from the style of the Arabic writing and from the phrases used, might have been written in an Indian Cutcherry yesterday. We refrain from writing more about this collection as it would require a whole treatise to itself.\n\nAnother object of great interest to us was the Gewerbe Museum. This is a Museum of Arts and Industries, closely corresponding to one branch of the Calcutta Economic Museum. One department of it struck us as being specially worthy of imitation in every large town in India. In a conveniently arranged room all the principal Vienna houses exhibit specimens of their manufacture. On each specimen the price is written in plain figures. The whole collection is under the care of a Curator, whose business it is to take visitors round and to show them the various articles exposed. If any one takes a fancy to anything exhibited, he can pay the Curator the price marked upon it, and walk away with it. In this way every one is benefitted. The local manufacturers acquire an unequalled opportunity for exhibiting their wares, being subjected at the same time to a healthy competition, the merchant seeking for articles to export to a foreign country finds all the best articles of local manufacture conveniently grouped together, and the casual visitor on the look-out for curiosities can go there and buy the best, with the assurance that his ignorance will not be imposed upon, and that he will only pay the fair market price for his work. A somewhat similar institution, on a very small scale, we have noticed in Jaipur in the 'School of Arts.' But we think that this kind of Museum could well be imitated in Calcutta and perhaps in one or two other large towns in the Provinces and other Presidencies. It would doubtless tend to stimulate trade, and would be a great blessing to the numerous travellers who now visit India for enjoyment, and who too often pay ten times the proper amount for what they buy.\n\nIn conclusion we would wish to put on record the great kindness which was shown to us foreigners by the many savants we met at Vienna. For our own part we can only say that nothing could exceed the hospitality and courtesy shown to us as delegates of the Indian Government. We owe that Government a debt of gratitude for having placed us in so pleasant a position, in which we were enabled to make many new, and we hope lasting, friendships amongst gentlemen whose pursuits and tastes were similar to ours. We are sure that we were justified in promising them that, if circumstances ever took them to India, they might count\nDr. Hoernle on the 7th International Congress of Orientalists. [APRIL,\n\non receiving the same consideration in Calcutta, Madras, or Bombay,\nwhich they had extended to the Indian delegates at Vienna.\n\nThe following is Mr. Grierson's note, referred to in the above report.\n\n\"In laying on the table a copy of 'Bihar Peasant Life,' and a com-\nplete set of the 'Grammars of the dialects and sub-dialects of the\nProvince of Bihar,' I would ask to be excused for drawing attention to\nthe fact that they are a first attempt at a systematic survey of the lan-\nguage actually spoken in a given tract of British India.\n\n\"A glance at any one of these books will show how radically the real\nlanguage,\u2014the mother-tongue of all classes, rich and poor, educated and\nuneducated alike\u2014in Bihar, differs from the so-called Hindi and Hind\u00fa\nst\u00e1n\u00ed languages which have hitherto been the only languages of Northern\nIndia known to students.\n\n\"I would now urge the necessity there is of making a systematic\nattempt at finding out what are the actual languages spoken at the\npresent day throughout India, and what relics there are of their past\nhistory.\n\n\"Firstly, the actual state of affairs at the present day. We have the\nNeo-Aryan languages of India at present roughly classified into Mar\u00e1thi,\nGujar\u00e1t\u00ed, Punj\u00e1b\u00ed, Sindh\u00ed, Hind\u00ed, Beng\u00e1l\u00ed, As\u00e1mi, Oriy\u00e1, Kashmir\u00ed and\nSinghal\u00ed, to which by a process of fission Bih\u00e1r\u00ed has lately been added\nas a younger sister. As having, in a manner, attended at the birth of the\nlast named, I naturally take an interest in her condition, but that does\nnot prevent my seeing that what is the case with her is in great measure\nthe case throughout all India, and specially in Hind\u00fast\u00e1n. That is, that\nthe literary or Government language of any tract is widely different from\nthe language actually spoken by the people. In some cases this is only\na question of dialect, but in others the polite language learned by Euro-\npeans, and by natives who wish to converse with Europeans, is totally\ndistinct both in origin and in construction from that used by the same\nnatives in their homes. In the course of future years, no doubt, through\nthe agency of railways and the printing press, the literary language will\nin many cases become the norm of home-conversation, but at present\nthat is not the case. The fact is, and it is one that should be faced, that\nnowhere in Hind\u00fast\u00e1n is the language of the village the same as the\nlanguage of the court and of the school. This is true to a certain extent\nall over the world, but in India the difference between the two languages\nis peculiarly great. Before a poor man can sue his neighbour in the\ncourt he has to learn a foreign language, or to trust to interpreters, who\nfleece him at every-step; and before a boy can learn the rule of three he\nhas to learn the foreign language in which it is taught. In some parts\nof Hind\u00fast\u00e1n this difficulty exists in greater degrees than in others, but\nit is always more or less present.\"\n\"As the tracts ruled by each Government are very large, a multiplicity of court languages would be a manifest inconvenience, but that is no reason why the European official should not learn the vernacular patois or language (I care not what it is called) of the district committed to his care. This has hitherto been a practical impossibility to the average official for whose aid no grammars or dictionaries existed, and for this purpose, I undertook the preparation of the Bih\u00e1ri grammars, which have, I believe, been found useful. The Magistrate need no longer have recourse to an interpreter, and can now, after a minimum expenditure of labour, converse with a witness in the latter's mother tongue.\n\n\"So much for the practical side of the question. I believe that similar vocabularies and sets of grammars for the whole of India would be not only equally practically useful, but would also be of assistance to students of philology in Europe, and to missionaries. The Hind\u00fast\u00e1n\u00ed* hitherto studied, though a useful lingua franca, is but a camp jargon, and Urd\u00fa and Hind\u00ed, which are founded on it, are mere inventions of the closet, and nowhere vernaculars. They are hence nothing but misleading to the European student.\n\n\"Secondly, the relics there are of the past history of the languages of India.\n\n\"Here I must confine myself to Hind\u00fast\u00e1n, for I do not pretend to have any acquaintance with the older literatures of other Indian languages. In my paper on the medieval literature of Hind\u00fast\u00e1n which I propose to read at this Congress, I hope to be able to show that, from the 13th century down to the present day, there is a rich mine of literature awaiting the labour of the student. This literature is of every variety, commentaries on Sanskrit works, histories, (with dates), epic poems, collections of sonnets, huge anthologies, treatises on medicine, mathematics and grammar, in short, every subject with which we are\n\n*I use these terms here in the sense in which natives use them in the part of India where my lot has been cast. By Hind\u00fast\u00e1n\u00ed, I mean that useful lingua franca, understood by everyone all over Northern India, borrowing something from each of many languages, but nowhere a vernacular. By Urd\u00fa, I mean that form of Hind\u00fast\u00e1n\u00ed which has been elaborated by Musalman pedants in their books, which is overloaded with Arabic and Persian words, and understood only by learned Muhammadans. Similarly, by Hind\u00ed, I mean the Pandit-ridden form of Hind\u00fast\u00e1n\u00ed which is overloaded with Sanskrit words, and understood only by learned Hind\u00fas. Urd\u00fa differs from Hindi not only in its vocabulary, but in its idioms, and, above all in the collocation of its words. This last, and not the vocabulary, is considered by Hind\u00fa scholars the true discriminating test. This Hind\u00ed is often called Jab\u00e1n\u00ed by natives. In talking to Europeans, natives will sometimes use Hindi for the language of S\u00far D\u00e1s, and Tul\u00e1i D\u00e1s, but they rarely do so amongst themselves, preferring the terms Braj, Baisw\u00e1ri, and so on.\nfamiliar in Sanskrit, and others besides. These books were all written in the vernacular, and their authors meant them to be understood by the unlearned, and thus they reflect the progress of the languages of India from the era of the Pr\u0101k\u1e5bit writings down to this century. What a mass of ore awaiting the furnace of European science!\n\n\"I believe, therefore, that the time is ripe for commencing a deliberate systematic survey of the languages of India, nearer and further, not only as they exist at the present moment, but as far back as MSS. can take us.\n\n\"Such a task is beyond the power of private enterprise; but I am persuaded that the Government which has carried out the statistical survey of India, and which has such literary powers at its command as those which conceived the idea of and carried out the great Gazetteer of India would not shrink from such a survey as I now refer to, if it were proposed with all the weight of authority which belongs to this Congress.\"\n\nThe note was supported by the following scholars: A.

Note on a passage in the Mrichchhaka\u1e6dik\u0101.\u2014By Asutosh Mukhop\u0101dhy\u0101ya, M. A., F. R. A. S., F. R. S. E.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nIn this paper the writer takes up the question as to the author of the celebrated Sanskrit drama Mrichchhaka\u1e6dik\u0101, reputed to be the production of King Sudraka. He first states that it could not have been the production of Sudraka, because in the introduction very near the beginning of the play, a stanza occurs, the last line of which may be rendered thus: \"Sudraka having attained the age of a hundred years and ten days entered the fire.\" On the supposition, that Sudraka himself was the author of the play, it is not possible to explain how he could foresee the date and manner of his death. Rejecting the various hypotheses that have been put forward to explain away the difficulty, the writer is of opinion that the drama was not the production of Sudraka, but was composed under his patronage, or possibly under the patronage of his son, who is mentioned in the stanza as having succeeded him on the throne. The stanza being placed in the midst of a lengthy laudatory panegyric on Sudraka it is hardly possible to believe that it could have been written by himself in self-praise, if he was really so very distinguished in arms and letters as he is represented to have been; whilst if it is admitted that the drama was composed only under royal patronage, every difficulty vanishes, and such a supposition is in perfect accordance with what is known of other reputed productions of royal authors.\n\nDr. Hoernle remarked: The theory of the authorship of the Mrichchhaka\u1e6dik\u0101, put forward by B\u00e1b\u00fa A. Mukherjea, and the argument in support of it drawn from the fact that king Sudraka's death is mentioned in a passage of the introduction to the drama, are by no means new. They are already mentioned in Professor Weber's History of Indian Literature, p. 205. But I am glad of this opportunity to bring to the notice of those who take interest in such questions, a new theory lately advanced by Professor Pischel which, to my mind at least, has a very great air of probability. It carries the enquiry a little further, as it attempts to identify both the real author as well as the patron of that play. It will be found fully detailed in the Introduction to Professor Pischel's edition of Rudrata's \u010cring\u0101ratilaka and Rayyaka's Sahridayalil\u00e1 (Kiel, C. F. Haeseler, 1886). According to it, the real author of the famous drama is no other than the well-known poet D\u0101\u1e47\u1e0din. He is now generally believed to have lived in the 6th or 7th century A.D. Besides many other works, tradition ascribes to him three great works \"famous in the three worlds.\" Two of these are the famous Kavy\u0101dar\u015ba\nand the *Dasakum\u0101racharitra*. As to the third there is a dispute. But none of those hitherto named are famous enough to be linked with the two others just mentioned. On the other hand, the *Mrichchhaka\u1e6dik\u0101* is a very famous work, and its author is unknown. Professor Pischel's contention is that this is the third of the three world-wide famous works of Da\u1e47\u1e0din. The proof is this. In the *K\u0101vy\u0101dar\u015ba*, Da\u1e47\u1e0din twice quotes a verse to illustrate a rhetorical rule of his (*K.* 2, 362): \n\nThis verse also occurs in the *Mrichchhaka\u1e6dik\u0101* (Act I, p. 14, ed. Stenzler). Now it is well-known that Da\u1e47\u1e0din uses no other illustrations in the *K\u0101vy\u0101dar\u015ba* but such as are composed by himself. It follows therefore that he quotes a verse of his own, and that therefore he was the real author of the *Mrichchhaka\u1e6dik\u0101*. Da\u1e47\u1e0din accordingly must have been a proteg\u00e9e of king Sudraka to whom, being his patron, the work is usually ascribed. That poet, in all probability, was a native of the Dakhan. Curiously enough in a gloss on V\u0101mana's *K\u0101vy\u0101lank\u0101ra V\u1e5bitti*, on the name *Sudraka*, it is said that this king was 'Komati.' Now Komati is a South Indian name. Moreover the state of life as described in the *Mrichchhaka\u1e6dik\u0101* is precisely the same as that in the *Dasakum\u0101ra Charitra*, which is a well-known work of Da\u1e47\u1e0din. Finally it is now generally admitted, that the *Mrichchhaka\u1e6dik\u0101* is not so old as it was at first believed to be, but belongs to about the 6th or 7th century A.D. Thus everything seems to agree in confirming the authorship of Da\u1e47\u1e0din.\n\nThe subject of conversation by the Philological Secretary \"The International Congress of Orientalists at Vienna, held in 1886,\" was postponed.\n\n---\n\n**Library.**\n\nThe following additions have been made to the Library since the Meeting held in March last.\n\n**Transactions, Proceedings and Journals,** presented by the respective Societies and Editors.\n\nAmsterdam.

Dutt.\n\nThe Philological Secretary exhibited some ancient copper coins from Nep\u00e1l, forwarded by Mr. V. Smith, C. S. with the following note on the same:\n\"I am indebted to the kindness of Dr. Gimlette, Residency Surgeon at Khatmandu, for a batch of ancient copper coins recently found in Nep\u00e1l, which appear deserving of notice.\n\n\"The find comprised 40 coins, but a few were worn beyond all possibility of recognition. I describe below all the specimens on which anything can be made out.\n\nI. One coin. (Plate II, fig. 1.)\n\nObv. Central boss, encircled by legend 'Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1dh\u00edr\u00e1sya.'\n\nRev. Horned animal, perhaps a goat, to l., standing.\n\nAbove, a short legend of two or three characters, of which the first is a conjunct character seemingly beginning with \u0915, and the second looks like \u0917\u093e or \u0917\u093e.\n\nDiameter 1 inch.\nWeight, nearly \u00bd ounce.\n\nII. 5 coins. (Plate II, fig. 2a and 2b.)\n\nObv. Winged lion (?), standing to l.\n\nLegend above, following margin, '\u015ar\u012b S\u00e1dh\u00edpa,' \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940 \u0938\u093e\u0927\u093f\u092a\u093e (?)\n\nRev. Cow standing to l.\n\nLegend in horizontal line above, 'Kamadeha' or 'K\u00e1madeha,\n\n\u0915\u092e\u0926\u0947\u0939 or \u0915\u093e\u092e\u0926\u0947\u0939.\n\nDiameter 1 inch.\nWeight as above.\n\nIII. 11 coins. (Plate II, fig. 3 a, 3 b, 3 c.)\n\nObv. Figure seated cross-legged, facing front, r. arm raised, l. on hip.\n\nLegend on r. margin, \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940 \u092d\u094b\u0917\u093f\u0928\u0940, '\u015ar\u012b Bhogin\u012b.' The first letter of the name may possibly be \u0917\u094b 'go.'\n\nRev. Lion standing to l.\n\nLegend on r. margin, \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940 \u092a\u093e\u0923\u0915\u093e, '\u015ar\u012b P\u00e1nanka.' There is no doubt about the concluding character being 'nka,' and the others are tolerably certain.\n\nIn one coin there is a sort of standard in front of the lion. In another the object in front of the lion is clearly a flower, probable intended for a lotus.\n\nIV. 7 coins. (Plate II, fig. 4 a and 4 b.)\n\nObv. Lion standing to l.\n\nLegend above '\u015ar\u012b\u2014vam\u00e1, or possibly\u2014vap\u00e1.'\n\nRev. Lion standing to l. No legend.\n\nDiameter 1 inch.\nWeight as above.\n\nThe characters on these coins have a general resemblance to those used on the Gupta coins, and I should be inclined to think that the coins are not of later date than, say, 300 A.D.\"\nBoth obverses and reverses of all the coins are surrounded by circles of dots.\"\n\nDr. Hoernle remarked: the coins forwarded by Mr. V. Smith are of great interest. They appear to be of a type hitherto quite unknown. I have myself never seen them before. Mr. Smith readings are on the whole correct. But the letters on the reverse of the first coin (Plate II, fig. 1) are \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940\u0917\u094b \u015br\u012b-go. The first character is undoubtedly \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940 \u015br\u012b; the second looks to me like \u092e\u094b go, though it might be \u0917\u0947 ge, but not \u0917\u093e g\u0101 or \u0936\u093e \u015b\u0101. The animal is clearly the same as that on the obverse of the coins No. IV (see Plate II, fig. 4, a and 4, b). I take it to be a winged lion with a crest on the head. The obverse of the coins No. II shows the same animal, a winged lion; the legend above is \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940\u0938\u0941\u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e\u0947 \u015br\u012b-sudharma (or perhaps \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940\u0938\u0941\u0935\u0930\u094d\u092e\u0947 \u015br\u012b-suvarma). The letter \u0930 is marked on the top of the left hand vertical stroke of the final \u0928, by a small upright stroke with a long horizontal one, at right angles, and extending over the whole of the \u0928 (see Plate II, fig. 2b). The animal on the reverse is a cow with a sucking calf below her; the latter is distinctly recognizable in both fig. 2a and 2b. The legend above is \u0915\u093e\u092e\u0926\u0947\u0935 k\u0101mad\u0113v; the final \u0935 is distinctly marked by a crescent (opening to the right) placed at the top of the left-hand vertical stroke of \u0935; it is clearly seen in fig. 2a; but in fig. 2b, unfortunately, it has not come out well in the photograph. The obverse side of the coins No. III must be that with the lion, as it is on all the other coins of this collection; the reverse being that with the seated female figure. The latter device very closely resembles one found on many reverses of gold Gupta coins, and probably represents Lakshm\u012b seated on the lotus. That flower and its stalk are well seen on fig. 3a and 3c. The legend on the obverse is \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940\u092a\u093e\u0923\u0915\u0947 \u015br\u012b-p\u0101nanka; the second character might also be \u092e\u093e m\u0101. The legend on the reverse is certainly \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940\u092d\u0942\u0917\u093f\u0928\u0940 \u015br\u012bbh\u016bgini. The lion on the obverse of these coins is not winged, but on some of the coins (fig. 3a and 3c) there is a flower in front of it, in others (fig. 3b) the flower is absent; I have not noticed any standard. The lion on the obverse of the coins No. IV is again a winged one; and the same animal but without wings is shown on the reverses. The latter also have the crescent moon above the lion. The reverse bears no legend; but that on the obverse is \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940\u0938\u0941\u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e\u0947 \u015br\u012b-sudharma (or perhaps \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940\u0938\u0941\u0935\u0930\u094d\u092e\u0947 \u015br\u012b-suvarma). These coins would seem to belong to three kings, Go\u2014, styled Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101dhir\u0101ja, Sudharma, and P\u0101nanka. Coins No. I belong to the Go\u2014; coins Nos. II and IV to Sudharma, and coins No. III to P\u0101nanka. Nothing beyond their names appears to be known. The type of the Gupta letters does not appear to me to be quite so old as Mr. V. Smith thinks.\nANCIENT COPPER COINS FROM NEPAL.\n\nPhoto-Collotype, Survey of India Offices, Calcutta, June 1887.\nSo far as they are concerned, I think, the coins need not be older than the 10th century.\n\nThe following papers were read\u2014\n\n1. *A collection of Kashmiri Riddles.*\u2014By the Rev.

E. S.\n\n**Zophoessa Ramadeva**, n. sp.\n\n**Habitat:** Sikkim.\n\n**Expanse:** \\( \\sigma \\), 2'4 inches.\n\n**Description:** \\( \\sigma \\). Allied to *Z. baladeva*, Moore, from Sikkim and to *Z. andersoni*, Atkinson, from Upper Burma. From the former it differs on the underside of the forewing in the absence of the short yellow streaks at the base and apex of the discoidal cell, the streak across the middle of the cell and the discal streak are broader and of a deeper shade of yellow; on the hindwing it differs in the absence of the subbasal streak from the costal to the median nervure, the streak along the submedian nervure and the narrow discal line beyond the cell: in all these characters it agrees with the latter species, but differs therefrom in the colour of the ground of the underside, which instead of being \"bright ferruginous\" is of a greenish-brown, and instead of having all the bands pure silvery the third band from the base in the forewing, the discal band on the hindwing as far as the median nervure, and the band placed inwardly against the series of submarginal ocelli are alone silvery. Differs also from *Z. andersoni* but agrees with *Z. baladeva* in having on the underside of the forewing a submarginal series of six small perfect ocelli: the series of ocelli on the hindwing also are larger and better formed than in *Z andersoni*.\n\nA single specimen is in my collection taken by Mr. Otto Moller's native collectors in August in Sikkim, probably in native territory. *Z. baladeva* is a very constant species, of which I possess many specimens, some taken in Sikkim in September, so *Z. ramadeva* can hardly be a seasonal form of that species.\n5. On Pandyan Coins.\u2014By the Rev. James E. Tracy, M. A., with a plate and exhibit of Coins.\n\n6. Notes on the Coinage and Currency of Siam.\u2014By Babu Sarat Chandra Das, C. I. E., with an exhibit of Coins.\n\nPrevious to, and during, the reign of H. M. Somdetch Pra Nang Klow, (1824 A.D.) the lowest currency of Siam consisted of a species of sea-shell or cowrie called bi-ah in the Siamese language. The amount of 1,500 bi-ah was usually accepted as equivalent to the smallest silver coin called the fu-ang. Latterly when the shell became scarce in the market, probably from the destruction of the species from some unknown natural causes, the Government fixed the value of the fu-ang at 800 bi-ah. The currency of the bi-ah is now-a-days discouraged by Government, yet they make their appearance in the remote and obscure markets of Bang-kok and in the interior of Siam. In the same manner the cowrie, the primitive currency of India, still continues to be the currency of modern India though it is not recognized by Government. The place of the bi-ah was first taken by lead coins and then by copper coins, according to the Rev. S. Smith, during the reign of H. M. Somdetch Pra Charem Klow. When lead was introduced in the currency, Government attached too much value to the new coins on the idea that the Government seals impressed on them raised their value. This encouraged counterfeits, a circumstance which forced the people to refuse altogether the valueless metal, lead, as an article of currency. During this reign the silver, copper and lead coins of the country continued to be of the peculiar bullet shape, but slightly different from what prevailed during the preceding reign. Some people in Siam say that during the latter part of King Chuam Klow\u2019s reign the flat silver and copper pieces stamped with the sacred Buddhist symbols were tried as a medium of currency.\n\nHis Majesty the present King of Siam on the occasion of opening the Bangkok Exhibition of 1882 said that His Majesty was pleased to see \u201cthe large collection of very old and curious lead coins that was exhibited on that auspicious day.\u201d From this it appears that lead coins existed in Siam from the earliest time when the Indian islands and the countries of Further India were under the sway of the Siam-Cambodian monarch of Unkor who built the great monastery of Nakhon-mal\u2014the grandest of the Buddhist ruins of Asia.\n\nIt is the general belief of the Europeans residing at Bangkok that the Siamese heretofore have not known that silver mines existed in their country, and it is but lately that they have learnt to work the mines. The people who had commercial intercourse with the Chinese\nand the Japanese in the Middle Ages could not in my opinion have failed to see the mineral resources of their own country. The Chinese have, since time immemorial, been the developers of the industry and resources of Siam. Their eyes could not have long remained shut to the silver mines which existed in Siam. There is no doubt of the fact that the Siamese did not know the art of mining as it prevails in Europe, and that few mines were worked, and these too very rudely. It is for this reason that the Siamese have ever been dependent on foreign monies, such as the horse-shoe shaped silver pieces of China and the silver currency of India, which they used to re-melt to manufacture ticals, salungs, fu-angs &c. the prevailing silver coins of Siam. In former times when the importation of foreign coins was not inconsiderable, the Siamese used to make their ticals of an alloy of lead and silver, sometimes of iron and nickel.\n\nThere are several gold mines in Siam. The mines at Bang Tapahn are said to contain the purest gold in the country. The Siamese gold is mostly used in manufacturing vases, water goblets, teapots, betel boxes, and other fancy articles, generally used for presentation on festive occasions.\n\nLeaf-gold is imported in large quantities from China for manufacturing jewellery and coins. The latter is not an article of currency in the country. On State occasions and ceremonies such as the royal coronation, marriage, cremation, &c. the King and the distinguished members of the royal family make presents of gold coins to their friends and servants. These coins are therefore kept as objects of curiosity or honour, and are valued at six times the price of their weight of silver. In shape they resemble the ordinary ticals, salungs and fu-angs and are called by the same designations, such as gold ticals, gold salungs and gold fu-angs.\n\nThe Rev. Samuel Smith of Bangkok gives the following account of the modern currency and its market value:\u2014\"The export trade of the country (Siam) is greatly in excess of the import trade. The foreign merchant must import foreign coin to effect his purchasers. The people, however, will not take foreign coin in exchange for their commodities. The importer must apply to the Government for native coins. The Siamese officers in connection with the Mint, burn the foreign coin, place before them a pair of scales, then 80 ticals of a given weight are placed on one scale of the balance, and enough of the burnt dollars are put on the other to balance. For this sum of burnt dollars, the importer was charged at $4\\frac{1}{2}$ ticals for manufacturing that amount of dollars into Siamese money. When the Siamese Mint people remelted these dollars they added lead enough to make up for any loss that might result from remelting.\nThis was the usual method of exchanging dollars for ticals, till the reign of H. M. Somdetch Pra Charun Klow, the late king. This sovereign established the law making 5 ticals equivalent to 3 Mexican dollars. Since the passage of that law, importers exchange their Mexican dollars very readily. The Mint officers burn the dollars, and if they are all found to be genuine, five silver ticals are given for every three dollars without any further loss of time. This law makes the par value of the Siamese tical 60 cents of a dollar, the salung 15, and the fu-ang 7\u00bd cents, the tam-lang $2.40 and the chahug $48.00. The hahp $2,400.00 and the p\u00e2hr\u00e2h $240,000.00.\"\n\nTable of Money and of Weights.\n\n| Copper. | Silver. |\n|---------|---------|\n| 50 Bi-ah | make 1 Solot. |\n| 2 Solots | ,, 1 Att. |\n| 2 Atts | ,, 1 See-o (Indian pie.) |\n| 2 See-o | ,, 1 Seek (two pies.) |\n| 2 Seek | ,, 1 Fu-ang. |\n| 2 Fu-ang | ,, 1 Salung. |\n| 4 Salung | ,, 1 Baht (generally called tical) |\n| 4 Baht | ,, 1 Tumlang. |\n\nWeight just like ounce, pound &c.\n\n| 20 Tumlang | ,, 1 Chang = 22\u00bd lbs. pounds English. |\n| 50 Chang | ,, 1 Hahp. |\n| 100 Hahp | ,, 1 P\u00e2hr\u00e2h. |\n\nThe impressions on the bullet shaped coins are the Buddhist symbols: the Swastika, the Srivatsa, the elephant, the umbrella, the Dhuaja (sacred flag), the twin fish, the gem and the water pot (jar of life or immortality).

On the Differential Equation of a Trajectory.\u2014By Asutosh Mukhop\u00e1dhy\u00e1ya, M. A., F. R. S., F. R. S. E.\u2014Communicated by the Hon. Dr. Mahendral\u00e1l Sark\u00e1r, C. I. E.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThis paper is devoted to a consideration of Mainardi\u2019s problem of determining the oblique trajectory of a system of confocal ellipses. Mainardi\u2019s result, which is reproduced by Boole in his Differential Equations, pp. 248\u2014251, comes out in a very complex form; it is, however, shewn in the present paper that the co-ordinates of any point on the trajectory may be represented by the remarkably simple pair of equations\n\n\\[ x = a \\cos \\phi \\cos h n (\\lambda \\times \\phi) \\]\n\\[ y = b \\sin \\phi \\sin h n (\\lambda \\times \\phi) \\]\n\nwhere \\(a, b\\) are the semi-axes of the ellipse, \\(n\\) the tangent of the angle of intersection, \\(\\lambda\\) an arbitrary constant, and \\(\\phi\\) a variable parameter; an elegant geometrical interpretation of these equations, by means of a hyperbola, is added.\n\nThe paper will be printed in the Journal, Part II, for 1887.\n\nThe subject of conversation by the Philological Secretary\u2014\u201cThe International Congress of Orientalists at Vienna, held in 1886,\u201d\u2014was postponed.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nLibrary.\n\nThe following additions have been made to the Library since the meeting held in April last.\n\nTransactions, Proceedings and Journals,\n\npresented by the respective Societies and Editors.\n\nBaltimore.

Heteroptera, No. 2.\u2014By E. T. Atkinson, Esq., C. S., President.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nMr. E. T. Atkinson contributes a second paper on the Rhynchoota. Heteroptera, in which he gives descriptions of the species included in the sub-family Scutellerina of which the following genera are recorded from India:\u2014Oxyprymna, 1: Solenostethium, 1: Hyperoncus, 1: Cantao, 1: Poecilocoris, 12: Tetrarthia, 2: Scutellera, 2: Brachyaulax, 1: Calliphara, 2: Chrysocoris, 16: Lamprocoris, 4: Hotea, 3: Alphocoris, 1: Eurygaster, 1: Arctocoris, 1, and uncertain, 7.\n\nThis paper will be published in the Journal, Part II.\n\n3. On the Mammals and Birds collected by Captain C. E. Yate, C. S. I. of the Afghan Boundary Commission.\u2014By Dr. J. Scully.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nIn this paper an account is given of a collection made by Captain Yate in Afghan Turkestan which comprises thirteen species of mammals and one hundred and ten species of birds. Among the mammals are two rodents, apparently new to science, which are described under the names of Spermophilus bactrianus and Ellobius intermedius.\n\nThis paper will be published in the Journal, Part II.\n\n4. On three grants of Govinda Chandra Deva of Kanauj, in the 12th Century.\u2014By Dr. Fuhrer.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nAll the three plates are written in the Devanagari characters, with the texts in Sanskrit. Each plate had a ring and a seal attached. These still remain only in the case of the first plate. The first plate, Samvat 1180, was found in April 1885 at Raiwan in the Sitapur district, and is now in the Provincial Museum, Lucknow. It measures 1' 2\" by 9\", and is inscribed, as also are the other two plates, on one side only. The text contains essentially the same historical information as that derived from the four grants of the same sovereign already known; but it further states that Govinda Chandra Deva acquired sovereignty\nover Kany\u00e1kubja, and that his kingdom included Benares, Ayodhy\u00e1 and ancient Delhi.\n\nThe other two plates are now in the possession of Dr. G. C. Hall in Allahabad, who obtained them from their owner, S\u00edt\u00e1r\u00e1m Agarwall\u00e1 in Benares. There is no information forthcoming as to where they were originally found. They were both granted by the king when he was at Benares. Of these the second plate, Samvat 1181, measures 1' 4\" by 1' 1\". The text is dated \"Thursday, the 8th lunar day of the bright half of the month Bh\u00e1drapada.\" The grant was that of a village, Tribh\u00e1ndi in the Avajrala district, to a Br\u00e1hman, P\u00e1ndita Bh\u00fapat\u00ed\u015barm\u00e1 of the Manneya Gotra. The third plate, Samvat 1185, measures 1' 6\" by 1' 4\". The text is dated \"Friday, the 15th lunar day of the bright half of Chaitra.\" The grant was that of a village Java in the Puroha district to the same donee as above. The historical value of this grant lies in the fact that it proves Govinda Chandra Deva to have been still reigning at the date mentioned, corresponding to 1128 A. D. The texts and translations of the three grants are given in full.\n\nThis paper will be published in the Journal, Part I.\n\n5. Some observations on Major Raverty's notes in his translation of the Tabaq\u00e1t-i N\u00e1siri on the coinage of the Kings of Ghazni.\u2014By C. J. Rodgers, Esq.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nIn this paper Mr. Rodgers calls in question the genuineness of the source\u2014an unnamed writer\u2014from which Major Raverty derives certain information regarding the dates of the last two kings of the house of Sabuk-Tig\u00edn\u2014Khusrau Sh\u00e1h and Khusrau Malik. Extracts given by Major Raverty from this writer fix A. H. 552 and A. H. 555 as the first years of the reigns of these two kings, respectively, these dates being mentioned as such on the reverse of coins said to have been struck at Lahore. In his notes, Major Raverty further states that Mr. Thomas, in his Paper on the Ghazn\u00ed coins, takes no notice of these two kings.\n\nIn reply Mr. Rodgers points out, first, that in the paper referred to, Mr. Thomas does give notices of two silver coins of Khusrau Sh\u00e1h, and of five coins of Khusrau Malik; secondly, that in the case of coins struck by the Ghazn\u00ed kings the year of the Hijr\u00e1 is always given on the margin, and that the year of the reign is never given; and thirdly, that coins of the type mentioned by Major Raverty,\u2014i.e., coins with the Hijra year on the reverse, and with the year of the reign specified\u2014are of the time of Aurangz\u00e9b or later. On these grounds, and from the fact that no cabinet possesses a single specimen of a Ghazn\u00ed\ncoin of the type mentioned by the anonymous author, Mr. Rodgers comes to the conclusion that the work on which Major Raverty relies is a forgery by a man unacquainted with the character of the coinage of the later Ghazn\u00ed kings and the earlier Path\u00e1n Sult\u00e1ns of Delhi, who bases his formula for the pretended coins in question, upon that of the rupees of Aurangz\u00e9b and his successors.\n\nThis paper will be published in the Journal, Part I.\n\nThe subject of conversation by Mr. Beveridge was \"The image of Ban Asur at Arrah.\"\n\n---\n\n**Library.**\n\nThe following additions have been made to the Library since the meeting of May last.\n\n**Transactions, Proceedings and Journals,**\n\n*presented by the respective Societies and Editors.*\n\nAmsterdam.

Distant, and an appeal is now made for local aid from Naturalists towards making the proposed Monograph of the family Cicadidae of the Rhynchota as complete as possible. Cicad\u00e6 are easily killed in the ordinary cyanide bottle, and can be sent in camphorated clean sawdust, moss, or paper in an ordinary tin or wooden box by parcel post, either direct to Mr. Distant or to Mr. J. Wood-Mason, Superintendent of the Indian Museum, Calcutta, who will forward them. Mr. E. T. Atkinson, who is engaged on the Rhynchota of India, will be glad of any specimens of other families of the Rhynchota that can be procured; these also should be sent to the Indian Museum, or to Mr. Atkinson, 15, London Street, Calcutta. As collected they could be kept in spirit until a sufficient quantity is procured for transmission.\n\nCircular.\n\nRussell Hill Road,\nPurley,\nSurrey.\n\nDear Sir,\n\n\"As I am preparing a Monograph of the Cicadidae of the Indian and Indo-Malayan Regions, under the auspices of the Indian Museum, Calcutta, I am anxious to make the work as complete and exhaustive as possible, and for that purpose am desirous of receiving specimens\nbelonging to this family of Insects. Every species will be figured, and every acknowledgment made to the donors, in the work. The family is little worked, and so it is safe to rely upon new species being easily collected.\n\n\"For those who are non-conversant with the Cicadidae the figure here given will prove a guide.\n\nI am &c.,\nW. L. Distant.\"\n\nThe Philological Secretary read the following extract from a letter of Mr. Rodgers.\n\n\"By the way in my late tour I purchased for Government nearly 400 coins of kinds. Amongst them are 4 of Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm S\u00far\u00ed in copper and two of Sikandar S\u00far\u00ed. There are also several new things belonging to Akbar, conspicuous amongst which are a Kalimah Fult\u00fas, a Chau Tanke and a Chau T\u00e1nke piece. There is also a dam of Sher Sh\u00e1h with the Kalimah on it. The list will I expect be published although the list for last year is still unpublished.\n\n\"I have made no discoveries this year like the exhumed temple at N\u00e1rp\u00e1r. But still I think I have discovered the remains of the temple at K\u00e1ngr\u00e1 destroyed by Mahm\u00fad of Ghazn\u00ed. And I have discovered a group of temples cut out of the solid rock at a place called Masr\u00far near K\u00e1ngr\u00e1 and yet never previously visited by an Englishman.\"\n\nDr. R\u00e1jendral\u00e1la Mitra made the following remarks on a note by Mr. F. S. Growse on the derivation of the Buddhist term Ekotibh\u00e1va.\n\nIn the 'Academy' for May last there is a letter from Professor Max M\u00fcller in which he has given publication to an extract from a letter by Mr. Growse on the derivation of the Buddhist term Ekotibh\u00e1va. I think it desirable to make a few remarks on the same.\n\nMr. Growse is not satisfied with the derivation suggested by me in a note which I submitted to this Society about a year ago. He says my\nproposal seems to him to be 'quite untenable.' He does not, however, condescend to give any reason for this demurrer. In my note I showed that the two words *eka* and *uti* were as old as the Sa\u00f1hit\u00e1 of the Rig Veda; that they had been frequently used in Sanskrit literature; that their union was in perfect accord with the rules of Sanskrit Grammar; and that the meaning they produced by the union was exactly what the Ceylonese Buddhists assigned to the compound term, and what was most consonant with the requirements of the passage in the Lallita Vistara in which the word was first met with. It has since been met with in other Sanskrit Buddhist works. It may be that I am totally wrong, and my arguments are of no value; but in the face of my remarks a simple denial without a single reason appears to me inconsonant with the practice usually followed in the republic of letters\u2014not to say uncourteous. It comes to me and to the public generally as an *ex cathedra* assertion. It reminds me of the advice which a learned judge is said to have given to his son\u2014'pass your sentence, but give no reason.' Under these circumstances I am not now in a position to say anything about it.\n\nI find myself in a better situation as regards the constructive part of Mr. Growse's letter. Writing to Professor Max M\u00fcller Mr. Growse says, 'I entirely agree with your view that it is a contraction of *eka-lo\u1e6di*; though when you are content to characterize it as an irregularity I am bold enough to maintain that it is quite in accordance with rule. The elision of the syllable *ka* in *eka* would no doubt be an anomaly, though the analogies you adduce might sufficiently defend it on the score of euphony. I think, however, that it is not the *ka* in *eka* that is elided, but the *k* in *lo\u1e6di*, by Vararuchi's well-known rule that *k* (as in *\u015b\u016br* for *\u015bikara*), *g* and other consonants, when simple and non-initial, are generally elided, the first letter of the latter member of a compound being regarded as non-initial.'\n\nThere is an omission in these remarks\u2014quite an accidental one, I presume\u2014which is calculated to mislead the great bulk of English readers for whom the 'Academy' is published. In a discussion on the derivation of a Sanskrit word most people would naturally think that the rule cited by Mr. Growse with the predicate 'well-known' was a rule of Sanskrit orthography; but in the present instance such an inference, however legitimate, would be a mistaken one. Vararuchi is not the author of any known Sanskrit Grammar, and the rule cited occurs in his Grammar of the Pr\u00e1krit language. Had Mr. Growse put in the word 'Pr\u00e1krit' before 'rule' the case would have been clear enough. Supplying the omission, the first question that suggests itself to me is\u2014Are the rules of Pr\u00e1krit orthography applicable to Sans-\nkritic orthography? This is *mutatis mutandis* the same question as that which would ask, are the rules of Italian orthography\u2014of the language of Dante and Petrarch\u2014applicable to the elucidation of the Latin of Virgil, Horace, Cicero, or C\u00e6sar? And put in this form I have no doubt the reply would be an emphatic negative. The Italian of Dante is the result of a process of decay, regeneration and hybridism, of the Latin of Virgil, and the course which this process followed is exactly the same which we meet with in the transition of the Sanskrit into Pr\u00e1krit. In either case the change took place slowly, gradually, but steadily, and the principles which regulated it were the same, the ends sought being simplification, softening and economy. Both in Italy and India, the change began with the lower orders, and was looked upon by the higher classes with contempt. In Italy the changing language was indicated by the opprobrious names of *lingua romana rustica*, *lingua vulgaris*, or *lingua plebeia* in contradistinction to the *lingua aulica* of the patricians. During its earlier growth it was not thought fit for literary composition, and so we have not any connected chain of proofs to show the different stages in its growth for several centuries from the time of Virgil. The poetry of the Troubadours is the earliest written proof we have, but the literary Italian of Dante suggests a long anterior history, which we cannot now follow with precision. The same is the case with the other Romance languages. In connexion with French we have the language of the Troubadours, the Proven\u00e7al, the Langue d\u2019Oc, and the Langue d\u2019Oil, leading to the modern language of France. In none of these can the forms of the later stages be appealed to for what occur in previous ages. And the history of the transition of the Sanskrit into Pr\u00e1krit is a repetition of that of the Latin into the Romance languages. We have in it two well-marked stages, the G\u00e1th\u00e1 and the P\u00e1li. Of the former I shall say nothing here, as some people fancy that it is not the outcome of a process of natural growth, but the result of ignorance. The latter is now, I believe, universally admitted by European Orientalists and philologists to be an issue of the Sanskrit, produced by the same process of change, which at a subsequent stage gave birth to the Pr\u00e1krit; and we may safely accept it as a guide in the enquiry we have now in hand. It does not, however, afford us any help. It contains not a single instance to show that the change to which Mr. Growse refers had made even a beginning in the age of the P\u00e1li. I have gone through Mr. Childers\u2019 P\u00e1li Dictionary with some care, but have failed to find any indication of it. Simple non-initial *k*, *g*, &c., in P\u00e1li always retain their places, and are never elided. To give a few examples. We have\nIt is obvious hence that the system of eliding simple non-initial consonants had not come into operation at the time when the P\u0101li language was current, and with this fact before us, can we with any propriety accept the rule as a guide for the elucidation of Sanskrit philology of a time when Pr\u0101krit grammar had not yet been in existence? It would be, in my opinion, as reasonable to do so, as to cite a rule of modern Italian orthography to account for the spelling of a word in Virgil. In Sanskrit grammar when two S\u016btras or aphorisms on kindred topics (adhi\u015b\u0101ra) are interrupted by an extraneous rule, it is usual to defend the break by what is called 'the principle of the frog's jump' (ma\u1e47\u1e0duka-pluti-ny\u0101ya\u1e25). In the present instance the little rule of Vararuchi must make a tremendous jump to get over the barrier of the two dialects of G\u0101th\u0101 and P\u0101li, and span a period of six centuries or more.\n\nIt should be mentioned here that the Pr\u0101krit grammars now extant are not grammars in the same sense in which we accept grammars of the Latin, French, German or English language. They are sequels of Sanskrit grammar, and devoted to the description of the changes which Sanskrit idioms, words, inflections, syllables and letters undergo when converted into Pr\u0101krit. The Sanskrit is always taken as the type, and the Pr\u0101krit as the issue thereof, and we cannot reverse the order without casting overboard all ancient landmarks.\n\nIt might be said that as the system of elision must have come into currency very slowly and gradually it may have commenced from before the time when the Lalita Vistara was composed, and ekotibh\u0101va may be the earliest instance we have of the operation of that tendency of the organs of speech which brought on the change. This would,\nhowever, amount to a mere begging of the question. It cannot serve the purposes of a major term\u2014a universally accepted premiss\u2014to sustain the position taken up by Mr. Growse.\n\nAssuming, however, for the sake of argument that the rule may be, somehow or other, made to bear on ancient Sanskrit, I think it necessary to enquire, what is its exact nature, and how far is it applicable to the word under consideration? It occurs in all the Pr\u00e1krit grammars that have come under my observation. As given in Cowell's translation of Vararuchi, it runs thus: 'These nine consonants, k, g, ch, j, t, d, p, y, v, or b, when single and non-initial, are generally elided.' (Kagachajatadapayav\u00e1m pr\u00e1yo topah, II, 2).\n\nIt is always understood that when a letter is elided under this rule the vowel with which it happens to be associated is left behind, and when so left it is not subject to any rule regarding coalescence or sandhi. This is well illustrated by the example cited by Mr. Growse. The original word being \u015b\u00fakara, the 'bristled one', the elision of the k leaves its vocalic associate a behind, which retains its place and makes su\u00e1ra, and Mr. Growse accepts it in that form. Had sandhi been permissible the \u00fa of s\u00fa and the a of ka would have coalesced and produced su\u00e1ra. The prohibition of sandhi is necessary to preserve the skeleton of the words: without it there would be no limit to the process of metamorphosis.\n\nThe qualifying term pr\u00e1yak, 'generally', in the rule shows clearly that the rule was not universal, and the commentator restricts it by saying that \"where euphony is not disturbed there should be no elision\" (prayograh\u0101nti yatra \u015brutisukhamasti tatra na bhavati). No rule is anywhere given to define what euphony is, nor is such a definition practicable. As a matter of course it is dependent upon taste, and must differ greatly in different cases. Practically, the qualifying term with its commentary made the rule quite optional in its operation. There is another rule which says that a simple non-initial first letter of each class in Sanskrit may, at option, be replaced by the third letter of its class in Pr\u00e1krit. Thus k may be changed to g, ch to j, t to d, t to d, and p to b.\n\nNow, according to a well understood law of grammatical interpretation two options always imply three forms: 1st, the original form; 2nd, the modified form produced by the first optional rule; and 3rd, that which is the result of the second optional rule. Usage, without actually prohibiting the first form, is not much in favour of it. Instances, however, are numerous of it, and the commentator cites several. (Cowell P. P., p. 116). Generally speaking words are most frequently met with in the second and the third forms: in some cases, only one form is met with.\nThere is no positive rule for the treatment of two or more simple non-initial letters in the same word, but according to usage the two letters are sometimes subjected to the two optional rules successively, and sometimes to the same rule. Accordingly the Sanskrit word Upadesa, is in some places written as Ubadesa, at others Uadeea or Uaeesa. It is obvious that a rule acknowledged to be optional and governed by so many conditions cannot be accepted as proof in any particular case without an amount of information which it is hopeless to expect in regard to so obscure a term as the hypothetical eka-uti. There is nothing to show that Mr. Growse is in possession of such information.\n\nBut to proceed a step further, and bring the rule with its governing conditions to bear upon the term. Mr. Growse holds that 'the elision of the syllable ka (he means the letter k) would no doubt be an anomaly,' but I see no reason why such should be the case. That k is 'simple and non-initial,' and legitimately comes under the purview of the rule, and Prakrit writers have always acted upon this belief. Vararuchi, in his grammar has cited eam as the equivalent for the Sanskrit ekam, and in the 'Venisanhara' I find eai for ekaki. In 'Sakuntala' we have eaini for ekakini. In the 'Prakrita-Prakasa' earahana stands for ekadasa. In other works egarahana is also met with, shewing that the second rule is that which is in operation. When neither of the optional rules is accepted the eka remains unchanged; and we find ekadara for ekatara in the 'Malavik\u00e1-agnimitra.' And with such evidence before me I fail to perceive why it would be 'an anomaly' to slide the k of eka.\n\nMaking the elision, the first form of the hypothetical word would be ed-koti. Applying the first rule to the second k also we get ea-ofi. If the rule be limited to the second member of the compound, the result becomes eka-ofi. The second rule would give us egakoti, ega-ofi, eka-gofi or eigofti. There is no rule in any Prakrit or Sanskrit grammar under which the k of koti can be elided and its associate vowel o carried over to the syllable ka of eka and produce ekoti, sandhi being, as already stated, absolutely prohibited. Were it otherwise, the union of o with the a of eka would make ekaufti and not ekoti. Thus under no circumstance can the rule appealed to, produce ekoti. The rule in fact is quite fatal to the validity of the conjecture set forth.\n\nIn the above remarks I have confined myself to the effect of the rule cited by Mr. Growse. I should add here that that gentleman has quoted no rules to show how the cerebral t of koti is metamorphosed into the dental letter. As far as I am aware of, there is no rule in any Sanskrit or Prakrit grammar to provide for the change. Under these cir-\ncumstances, I am obliged, with much reluctance, to say that Mr. Growse has been very hasty in saying 'I am bold enough to maintain that it (the derivation of ekoti) is quite in accordance with rule.' He has obviously nothing at hand to maintain the assertion.\n\nThe following papers were read\u2014\n\n1. On the Etymology and Meaning of the Buddhist term, Ekotibh\u00e1va.\u2014By Babu Sarat Chandra Das, C. I. E.\n\nIn his address the President of the Asiatic Society of Bengal made mention of the work I have in hand, i.e., the compilation of a list of Buddhist philosophical and technical terms in Sanskrit, and their equivalents in Tibetan and English. When I commenced this work in October last I had doubts as to its usefulness, but the importance attached to one such term as \"Ekotibh\u00e1va\" by the attempts of Max M\u00fcller, Morris, Schiefner and Dr. Mitra to explain it, in \"The Academy\" and elsewhere, has encouraged me to push on my work with some vigour. I have, therefore, ventured to write a short note on the etymology and meaning of the term \"Ekotibh\u00e1va,\" with a view to explain an important fact connected with the doctrine of incarnation which prevails in Tibet and Mongolia.\n\nI have brought with me from Lhasa some very old Sanskrit and Tibetan Dictionaries; one of them, called \"Mah\u00e1vyutpati\" [in Tibetan Lopon ma\u00f1po s-m dsod pa hi bye\u2014bragtu r togs byad chhen mo, i.e., \"the great critical work prepared by many Pandits and Lochavas\", (Tibetan Interpreters)] is a manuscript written in the Devan\u00e1gari characters of the 8th or 9th century A.D. and the rest are in Tibetan. The term* \"Ekotibh\u00e1va\" occurs in all of them written with dental t and a long i, in consequence of which its etymology becomes very simple. It is derived from eka + uta + bh\u00e1va. Uta comes from ve (\u0935\u0947) and the affix kta (\u0915\u094d\u0924). The verb ve (\u0935\u0947) means \"to sew\" or \"unite.\" Hence the compound means \"something sewn or united together.\" The Tibetan version of this term is \u2020Rgyud + gchig-tu + gyur-pa, i.e., Rgyud gchigtu gyur-pa.\" \"Rgyud gyur-pa\" = strung or united together, gchig = one and \"t\u00fa\" means \"into.\" The compound word therefore means formed into one string or line. In Csoma's translation of a\n\n* The term Ekotibh\u00e1va with long i incidentally also occurs in Prof. M\u00fcller's note published in The Academy, April 3, 1886. Vide the footnote.\n\n\u2020 Rgyud, means string, extraction, connection nature formed, become, changed, &c.\nSanskrit Tibetan vocabulary \"Ekotibh\u00e1va\" or Rgyud gchig-tu gyur-pa\" is rendered as union (with the Supreme Spirit).\n\nEkotibh\u00e1va with short i, i.e., \"Ekotibh\u00e1va*\" does not seem to me quite correct. In the first place it does not directly give the meaning of the term in accordance with the rules of Sanskrit grammar, and does not tally with the explanation given by the Indian savants who translated the Buddhist sacred books into Tibetan under the auspices of Kings Thirong, Ralpachen &c. In the second place it does not occur in any of the books I have consulted.\n\nIt is more natural that after \"uta\" the suffix \"chvi\" should be inserted implying the occurrence of something not existing before (abh\u00fata tad bh\u00e1va) rather than that the last component part should be joined with \"uti\" meaning an act of sewing or uniting. But in order that the compound word may give the intended signification in consonance with the rules of grammar the components should be \"eka + uta + bh\u00e1va.\" A learned Lama of Tibet has kindly sent me a note on this term the purport of which I give below:\n\n\"Rgyud gchig-tu gyur-pa (Ekotibh\u00e1va) means the continued connection of \"one with another without break or division. A soul (vij\u00f1\u00e1na or Rnam S'es) existing from eternity has undergone numberless transmigrations. In all its births it has run through an unbroken line of existence until it is cut short by Nirv\u00e1na.\"\n\nAll living beings have this kind of continuous existence. A soul undergoing transmigrations may be compared to a string or wreath of flowers, its different embodiments being the individual flowers which drop off one by one after each death. Bodhisatvas and saints alone can know the circumstances of their former births which ordinary mortals cannot. Some of the grand Lamas of Tibet are the acknowledged incarnations of Bodhisatvas. When the fresh embodiment of a Bodhisatva is announced a Committee of the living Bodhisatvas (grand Lamas) is formed to identify his spirit with that of the Lama whose incarnation he professes to be. At the time of the identification the claimant (generally a child of 3 or 4) is required to prove by signs that his spirit is one and the same with the spirit of the Lama whose incarnation he declares himself to be. This identity of the claimant with the spirit of a Lama is called Ekotibh\u00e1va and it forms one of the cardinal doctrines of Tibetan Buddhism. I here annex the Sanskrit\n\n* The word with short i, i.e., Eka + uti + bh\u00e1va when compounded together must according to the Rules of Sanskrit Grammar be \"Ekotibh\u00e1va.\" I quote the rules.\n\n(1) Abh\u00fata tad bh\u00e1ve chv\u00edh Kri\u015bubasti\u0161hu.\n(2) A k\u00e1ra h \u1e63 sva sv\u0101 vidirghan.\nDr. Hoernle\u2014On Ekotibh\u00e1va.\n\nexplanation of the term given by Prof. Nilmani Mukherjee, M.A., in Devan\u00e1gari.\n\nDr. Hoernle remarked that he agreed with Dr. Mitra that every rule of Pr\u00e1krit phonetics could not eo ipso be applied to the P\u00e1li or G\u00e1th\u00e1. With regard to the particular case of ekotibh\u00e1va, though there was no rule in any Pr\u00e1krit grammar under which a consonant might be elided and its associate vowel carried over to the preceding syllable, still occasional instances of this practice did occur in Pr\u00e1krit literature; thus Pr. suhelli for Skr. sukha\u00e9li (Sapta\u015bataka, 211, 261, etc., contracted from suha\u00e9li); Pr. deula for Skr. devakula (Sapt. 109, contr. from deaula). Some of these instances were expressly noted in Hemachandra's grammar; thus deula in Hem. I, 271, r\u00e1ula (for Skr. r\u00e1jakula) in Hem. I, 267. After the analogy of these cases, the word ekakotibh\u00e1va might contract from eka-otibh\u00e1va into ekotibh\u00e1va, as Mr. Growse seemed to suggest. It seemed to him unsafe, however, to explain the formation of an old word like ekotibh\u00e1va on the authority of word-forms which occurred in a much later stage of the language, and even there only as exceptions. Another serious difficulty was the change of the cerebral t to the dental t, which the derivation of ekotibh\u00e1va from ekakotibh\u00e1va would require. There was no other example of such a change, as far as he was aware, known. The only two apparent instances, referred to in Prof. Kuhn's Beitr\u00e4ge (p. 37, P\u00e1li d\u0113\u1e47\u1e0dima = Skr. din\u1e0dima, Pr. suffix ittha = Skr. ishta), were obviously of a different character. To his mind, the great difficulty attending the derivation from ekakotibh\u00e1va lay in the accumulative force of the objections. Each objection, taken by itself, might be met more or less successfully; but the derivation assumed the concurrent operation of three distinct phonetic laws (elision of a consonant, elision of the associate vowel, and change of cerebral to dental) all of which would be very exceptional in P\u00e1li or G\u00e1th\u00e1, and two of which were exceptional even in Pr\u00e1krit.\n\nDr. R. Mitra expressed his thanks to Dr. Hoernle for his remarks and for the instances he cited. They opened a new line of research. They were apparently of a later date than the Pr\u00e1krit grammars, and belonged to Jain Magadhi and other dialects which differed considerably from the M\u0101h\u0101r\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dr\u012b Pr\u00e1krit of Vararuchi; but they were not enough to prove that Mr. Growse was right when he urged that the transmutation of eka-ko\u1e6di into ekoti was in accordance with rule. Turning to the note of B\u00e1b\u016b Saratchandra Das, he said\u2014\n'I am glad B\u00e1bu Saratchandra D\u00e1s has sent us the fruits of his researches in connexion with the subject under discussion which has for some time engaged the attention of Oriental scholars in Europe. Ordinarily, so rare are the contributions we get from the Boeotia of Central Asia, that every little crumb we obtain from that quarter in regard to matters with which we are interested is welcome.\n\n'It is interesting to be informed that the term ekotibh\u00e1va is well-known in Tibet, and is to be met with in many Tibetan works. To me it is particularly gratifying to know that the second member of the compound term is \u00fati, as I took it to be, when I submitted to the Society my note on the subject, and not k\u00f3ti as originally supposed by Professor Max M\u00fcller, and since repeated by Mr. Growse. I regret only that the B\u00e1bu has not made greater use of the resources he has at command than what he seems to have done in the note now before the meeting. Some extracts from the Tibetan and Sanskrit works he has procured from Lhasa, would have been most welcome to us. In questions of this kind, ancient records are of infinitely greater use than the cogitations of modern scholars.\n\n'In regard to the spelling of the term, the B\u00e1bu says that in all the dictionaries he has got, the term is written with a dental t and a long \u00ed. The dental t is what I have met with in seven different MSS. of the Lalita Vistara and in one of the Da\u015babh\u00fami\u015bvara, and it is what is invariable in ancient P\u00e1li texts. But I am rather puzzled about the long \u00ed. The B\u00e1bu's MSS. are all Tibetan, with one exception, which, he says, 'is written in the Devan\u00e1gari character of the 8th or 9th century A.D.' Now, the Tibetan alphabet does not include a letter or mark for the long \u00ed. Csoma de Koros, in his Tibetan Grammar, gives only one \u00ed, and that the short one. And if the authority of this renowned Tibetan scholar is of any value we cannot expect to find the long \u00ed in Tibetan MSS. In his preface he says, 'there are five vowel sounds: a, i, u, e, o, pronounced according to the general pronunciation in Latin in the continent of Europe, without any distinction into short or long, but observing a middle sound.' In his Dictionary there is not a single word given with a long \u00ed or \u00fa. My friend B\u00e1bu Prat\u00e1pachandra Ghosha has favoured me with an extract, either from Carey's translation of Schoeter's Tibetan Grammar or some other authority, the name of which he has forgotten, which runs thus: 'Sometimes the vowels are placed above each other, and then they are pronounced as a long vowel; but it is more frequently the case that they denote an abbreviation of the word, so that the reader ought to make two syllables of it. Sometimes the vowel (\u00ed) is placed over a letter in an opposite direction to that above mentioned, for instance `\u00ed', &c.; but though the shape is altered the\nsound is the same; it is read to express the Sanskrit f.' This reversed mark is very uncommon, and in ordinary Tibetan writings it is not met with. It is certain too that the Tibetans do not make any distinction between the long and the short i. It is unsafe therefore to rely upon Tibetan texts in this respect.\n\n'The reference to the Sanskrit MS. is also puzzling to me. I cannot make out what B\u00e1b\u00fa Saratchandra D\u00e1s means by 'Devan\u00e1gari character of the 8th or the 9th century A.D.' I am not aware of any such specific character, and I should very much like to know how the vowel-marks are put in it before I can decide its value. The B\u00e1b\u00fa's reading may be correct, but I cannot say as much for the correctness of the MS. Anyway we have on the one side a single MS., and that in a country where the distinction between the long and the short i is very much neglected, if not positively unknown, and on the other eight MSS. from a country where the distinction is carefully observed, and the whole of the P\u00e1li texts examined by Mr. Childers. In this state of evidence before me, I cannot venture to come to other than an adverse conclusion.\n\n'The derivation given by B\u00e1b\u00fa Saratchandra D\u00e1s of the term under notice is not his, nor taken from his Tibetan MSS., but founded upon a Sanskrit passage written by Professor Nilmani Mukerji. The passage has been incorrectly transliterated by B\u00e1b\u00fa Saratchandra D\u00e1s. The word uttarithah is obviously intended for ityarthah, and the utah should have been written with a long \u016b.\n\n'The derivation of the word as given by the Professor does not appear to me to be satisfactory. The crucial word is \u00fati, the second member of the compound, and it may be derived from more than one Sanskrit root. Professor Mukerji derives it\u2014from ve, kta and chvi, but it is not what we find in our Sanskrit dictionaries, and it necessitates recourse to two affixes when one is quite sufficient. Chvi as an affix is rarely used, and not at all needed here. Ve with kti makes \u00fati, and this is the form most used by our lexicographers and exegetes, and I see no reason to reject it in favour of a derivation which no Sanskrit author has used, and which involves the use of two affixes for a single purpose. It amounts to a preference for a novelty for the sake of novelty only. I go further, and hold that, under the rule of P\u00e1nini, kr\u012bbhvashiyoge sampa-dya kartari chvi (5.4.50) the affix chvi seems inapplicable in the present instance. The rule requires a complete change of substance (abh\u00fatataddbh\u00e1va\u2014and the leading example is Brahmi bhavati, or change into Brahma. The subject has been explained at some length by Professor Tar\u00e1n\u00e1tha Tarkav\u00e1chaspati, in a note in his edition of the Siddh\u00e1ntakanud\u00ed, but I cannot cite his words from memory. This much, however, is certain that the stringing on a thread does not imply such a change\nof condition. There can be no unification of substance in the act of stringing on a thread, and therefore the affix appears to me to be of doubtful propriety. In fact the learned Professor has resorted to it solely to account for the supposed long \u012b in the Tibetan texts, and as I cannot see my way at present to admit the accuracy of the reading, I deny the necessity of the inappropriate affix.\n\n'B\u00e1b\u00fa Saratchandra D\u00e1s says that my derivation of the word from ve and kti does not seem to him to be correct, because it does not strictly give the meaning of the term in accordance with the rules of Sanskrit grammar.' He has not cited the rule, but certain it is that whatever the rule, it did not stand in the way of Sridhara Sv\u00e1mi, the commentator on the Bh\u00e1gavata nor of the authors of the Rig Veda: they all use the word with a short \u012b, and I am content to err with them.\n\n'The word s\u016btra has been used apparently with a view to make the meaning consonant with the interpretation of the compound term given by a L\u00e1m\u00e1, but it is not permissible. It is not suggested by the text. The same remark applies to the epithet ananta-dh\u00e1r\u00e1-v\u00e9hikatay\u00e1 'the endless flow of the stream.' There is no justification for it in the text. It may be that in Tibet the meaning of the term is different from what Sanskrit and P\u00e1li scholars have assigned to it; but that does not necessitate a different derivation. The learned Professor is thoroughly familiar with the Lalita Vistara, which is the oldest work in which the term was first met with, for he is the author of a Sanskrit abridgment of that work, and he must have noticed in the 22nd chapter of it, that the term cannot there be explained to mean 'the endless flow of the stream.' The term there qualifies the first of a set of four meditations, each of which lasts for a few minutes. Of course during the continuance of any one of these meditations there is a continuous, or unbroken, or undisturbed flow of attention as shown in Aphorism 2 of the 3rd Book of Patanjali's Yoga, but there is no endlessness in it. When the second meditation begins, the first is lost, and with it 'the flow of the stream' terminates, and does not return again in its original form in the course of the subsequent meditations. In such a case the most appropriate meaning is that which the P\u00e1li authorities ascribe to the word, and which Professor Max M\u00fcller has accepted, i.e., it means concentration of the mind or ek\u00e1grat\u00e1, or as I put it on the authority of Sridhara Sv\u00e1mi, making one subject the object of our thought, and there need be no doubt that that is the right meaning. Just now I have not access to Csoma's MS. glossary of Tibetan technical terms, it being with B\u00e1b\u00fa Saratchandra D\u00e1s at Darjiling, but from the quotation given in his paper, it is evident that Csoma had no idea about the 'endless stream.' He uses the word 'union' which for a popular rendering\nis about the same as concentration, or bringing the mind to one centre. The Tibetans may have current among them a different meaning, but in an enquiry about the radical meaning of a Sanskrit term found in Sanskrit works, we are not concerned with any possible change which it may have undergone in the language of a non-Sanskritic nation.*\n\nProfessor Nilmani Mukerjea said\u2014Ekot\u00edbh\u00e1va is a kind of meditation in a Buddhistic sense, meaning literally absorption into one. It also means, according to Tibetan writers, the apostolic succession, so to speak, of grand Lamas. The succession of Lamas is compared to a garland of flowers; and one who succeeds to the musnud of the High Priest in Tibet, is looked upon as a new flower strung into the garland of lamahood.\n\nProf. Max M\u00fcller analyses the word into eka, koti, and bh\u00e1va. Though no known rule of grammar is cited to justify the elision of ka, and though the attempts of Mr. Growse to explain the same by rules of Pr\u00e1krita grammar are unsatisfactory, there are instances in Sanskrit in which such elisions of intermediate syllables are admitted as anomalies (nip\u00e1tas) by Sanskrit grammarians. I would cite a few instances only\u2014Prishat-udara Prishodara, Patat-anjali P\u00e1tanjali, V\u00e1ri-v\u00e1haka Val\u00e1haka, J\u00edvana-m\u00fata Jim\u00fata, &c., &c.\n\nAccording to the etymology given by Prof. Max M\u00fcller, ekot\u00edbh\u00e1va may mean a kind of meditation; but it can scarcely be strained to mean the unbroken succession of grand Lamas, in which sense the word is understood by Tibetan authors.\n\nDr. R\u00e1jendral\u00e1la Mitra has given a less anomalous, though not quite a correct derivation of the word, dividing it into eka, \u00fati and bh\u00e1va. Now the component parts of the word as stated by the learned doctor, meaning respectively 'one,' \"weaving\" and \"being\" cannot be compounded by any known rule of Sanskrit grammar, inasmuch as \u00fati and bh\u00e1va are both verbal nouns,* and cannot satisfy the first and most important rule of Sanskrit composition (sam\u00e1sat).\n\nAccording to Dr. Mitra's etymology the word would mean \"being weaving into one,\" which is not intelligible enough. I have therefore thought fit to adopt the reading \"ekot\u00edbh\u00e1va\" with a long \u00ed recommended by my friend, Babu Sarat Chandra D\u00e1s, C. I. E. The above reading occurs twice in a dictionary of Sanskrit words by a Tibetan\n\n* At the last meeting of the A. S. B., Dr. Mitra, while admitting that \u00fati comes from a verbal root and a verbal affix, denied that it is a verbal noun, and saw no objection to its being compounded with another verbal noun.\n\n\u2020 \u0938\u092e\u093e\u0938\u0903 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u093f\u0935\u093f\u0927\u093f:\u2014\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u093f\u0935\u093f\u0927\u093f:\u0964\n\u0926\u0947\u0916\u093f \u092c\u0948\u0932\u094d\u092f\u0947\u2014\u2014\u092c\u0948\u0932\u094d\u092f\u0947\u0964\nauthor. I have also been assured by my friend that he has found the word spelt with a long \u012b in other Sanskrit works of Tibetan origin. Dr. Mitra contends that as the Tibetan alphabet has no long \u012b, the word in question cannot be written with a long \u012b. But the question, whether the Tibetan alphabet has a long \u012b or not, has nothing to do with the word ekot\u012bbh\u0101va, inasmuch as it is found in Sanskrit books compiled by Tibetan authors, and written with a long \u012b in the Devan\u0101gar\u012b characters.\n\nNow ekot\u012bbh\u0101va with a long \u012b will most appropriately convey the two meanings stated above. I would therefore analyse the word into eka, uta,* chvi, and bh\u0101va. The effect of the suffix chvi on the base uta according to the well-known rule of Sanskrit grammar, would be the changing its final vowel into a long \u012b; and the whole compound word would thus mean the state of being woven into one.\n\nDr. Mitra contends that the suffix chvi means abh\u016bta-tadbh\u0101va (occurrence of a thing that did not exist before), and that it cannot be a component part of ekot\u012bbh\u0101va, which has nothing of that idea in it. With due deference to the learned doctor, I must take the liberty to differ from him. When ekot\u012bbh\u0101va is used in the sense of meditation, it clearly means concentration of attention on one object and thereby connotes a state of mind which did not exist before. Similarly when ekot\u012bbh\u0101va signifies the succession of a Tibetan pontiff, it as clearly points to the happening of an event which was not in existence before.\n\nDr. Mitra also objects to the insertion of the suffix chvi after \"uta\" on the ground that it is preceded by \"eka,\" maintaining that it cannot be said of one single object that it has come to pass and did not exist before. But surely it would not be too much to attribute abh\u016bta-tadbh\u0101va to the installation of a new pontiff who thereby becomes a member of the Tibetan Lamahood.\n\nThe learned doctor takes exception to the etymology of \"uta,\" given in S. C. D\u00e1s note. Uta is derived from \u0909\u0924\u094d and \u0924\u093f\u0928\u094d, but Dr. Mitra derives it from \u0935\u091a\u0928\u094d and \u0924\u093f\u0928\u094d. Now the verb \u0935\u091a\u0928\u094d means going, not weaving; and though \u0909\u0924\u094d is changed into \u0935\u091a\u0928\u094d in the second preterite (\u0935\u093f\u091a\u093e\u0930\u093f\u0924\u094d), it can never take that form before the affix \u0924\u093f\u0928\u094d.\u2020\n\n* Uta has another form \u00fata, but it matters little, which form is used.\n\n\u2020 In the Sanskrit explanation of the phrase ekot\u012bbh\u0101va inserted in B\u0101bu Sarat Chandra's note, I have said, \u090f\u0915\u094b\u0924\u093f\u0928\u094d \u0909\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0947 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0925\u092e\u094d\u0964 Dr. Mitra objects to my Sanskrit, remarking that instead of s\u016btre the locative form, s\u016btre\u1e47a the instrumental form should be substituted. But I have used the locative form advisedly, because the idea of instrumentality is kept in the background, and prominence is given to that of something (\u0935\u091a\u0928\u094d) containing something else. I would cite here only one parallel passage from the K\u0101dambar\u012b, p. 14, G. C. Vidyaratna's edition, Uttara-bh\u0101ga\u2014'\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0925\u092e\u0947\u093d\u0938\u094d\u092e\u093f \u0930\u0942\u092a\u0902 \u092e\u093e\u0927\u094d\u092f\u092e\u0915\u093e\u0932\u092e\u094d.'\nAfter what has been stated above, it is superfluous perhaps, to cite examples in which the last \u0935 of a word compounded with bh\u0101va is converted into a long i. The rule on the subject is too clear to admit of cavil; and a few instances will suffice\u2014\u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940\u092d\u093e\u0935\u0903, \u0930\u091c\u094d\u091c\u0941\u092d\u093e\u0935\u0903, \u092d\u091c\u0940\u092d\u093e\u0935\u0903, \u091a\u093e\u0939\u094b\u092d\u093e\u0935\u0903 &c., &c.\n\nIn reply to Prof. Mukerjea's remarks, Dr. Mitra observed that he did not derive the word from vaya and kti. He had been careful in saying that he derived it from ve and kti. As to the difficulty raised about a participle being made the subject of a condition (bh\u0101va), it was a mistake. He did not accept \u00fati as a particle, but as a noun substantive, meaning lil\u00e1 'recreation', as explained by Sridh\u00e1ra Sv\u00e1m\u00ed, and therefore there was no participle to disturb his explanation. The other points raised were too technical to be explained off hand at the meeting; many things had been assigned to him which he had not said.\n\nThe following remarks with reference to the subject of the above discussion have been received from Babu Sarat Chandra D\u00e1s since the meeting:\n\n\"In the Tibetan passage from Lam-rim Chhenpo, \"Tsonkhapa,\" the founder of the Gelug-pa (the yellow-cap school) is identified with the 11th Buddha or Tath\u00e1gata. In, the Sanskrit passage from page 33 of Vyutpatti\" the word \"ekotibh\u0101v\u0101d\" is used to convey the literal signification explained by me, but only with reference to the mind and its motives.\n\nPage 33 \"vyutpatti.\"\n\n\"sa vitarkah vich\u0101r\u0101nam vyupa s\u0101m\u0101 dadhy\u0101tmam sampras\u0101d\u0101chchetasa ekotibh\u0101vadd vitarkamavich\u0101ram sam\u0101dhija sampriti sukham dvit\u012byam dhy\u0101nam upasampadya viharati.\"\n\nIn this passage the word ekotibh\u0101va conveys the literal meaning (as explained by me) with regard to mind.\n\nfrom \"Lamrim\" ssin-bri (leaf 150\u2014151.)\n\n\"Bdag-chag-gi ston-pa \u015b\u0101kya thub-pahi bstan-pa hdi da\u00f1\n\n\"Eje Rin-po chhe (Tso\u1e45 khapa) da\u00f1 thugs (spirit) rgyud gohig-pahi.\n\n\"(Ekota\u1e25) bskal bssa\u00f1 gis sa\u00f1s rgyas bohu gchig-pa\n\n\"de-bshin gsegs-pa spyan legs-da\u00f1, bskal bssa\u00f1 sa\u00f1s rgyas\n\n\"Sto\u1e45-po thamd chad kyi mdsad pahi smonlam gi mthu\n\n\"grub-pa mtha\u1e45 ma sa\u00f1s rgyas mas pahi\n\nbstan-pa gsum-la hbyun Shi\u1e45 &c. &c.\n\nIn this passage the Tibetan equivalent of the word Ekota\u1e25 clearly explains the identity of the spirit of the 11th Tath\u00e1gata with that of Tson-khapa.\n2.

Smith, Esq.\n\nSir Alfred Lyall, Lieutenant-Governor of the N.W.P., has sent me for identification a parcel of 16 Gupta Gold coins lately found in the Gorakhpur District, a description of which will be interesting to numismatists.\n\nMr. D.T. Roberts, Collector of Gorakhpur, states that the coins were found by some chamaras when digging in a field adjoining an old 'dih' in the village of Kotwa in Tahsil Bansgaon of the Gorakhpur District. They were found loose under some bricks. Nothing is known as to the history of the mound of ruins at Kotwa. This last remark applies to all the numerous mounds which are found in almost all parts of the Gorakhpur and Basti Districts.\n\nThe buildings were in all cases of brick, and the images and ornaments appear generally to have been made of terra cotta, and in consequence a recognizable building is never met with, excepting some stupas, which can be recognized by their circular outline.\n\nTradition is absolutely silent concerning all these ancient remains. The villagers as a rule ascribe them to the forest tribe of Tharus, but the ascription is evidently incorrect, and due to the fact that when the ancestors of the present inhabitants immigrated, they found the country, as far as it was peopled at all, in possession of the Tharus. The immigrants knew nothing of an earlier and vanished civilization, and naturally ascribed all ruins to the people whom they found in\noccupation of the country. In the south-west of the Basti District the Rajput and other medieval settlers displaced Bhars. In parts of Gorakhpur and Basti the Doms or Dom Katars were the ruling tribe, which had to give way before the immigrants from the west. Consequently in some places ruined mounds will be ascribed to Bhars or Doms instead of Thartas, but nowhere is there any trace of a genuine continuous tradition handed down from the times of Buddhist ascendancy and civilization. So far as appears, the Gorakhpur and Basti Districts lapsed into jungle during the disturbances which accompanied the extinction of Buddhism, and remained for centuries unoccupied by settled or civilized inhabitants.\n\nThe thread of tradition was thus broken, and nothing can be learned of the past history of the country except from coins, and such other fragments of antiquity as may have survived.\n\nIn the course of three and a half years' residence in the Basti District I have not succeeded in discovering a single inscription. Coins are therefore of special importance in the eastern districts of the N.W.P. from being almost the only legible memorials of the past which have survived.\n\nThe hoard of sixteen coins which is the subject of this notice is remarkable for the variety of types included in it. No less than seven distinct types are comprised in this small batch of coins. They all belong to the reigns of Chandra Gupta II, and Kumara Gupta Mahendra of the Imperial or Early Gupta dynasty.\n\nIf Mr. Fleet is right in placing the beginning of the dynasty in A.D. 318\u2014319, the approximate date of these coins is A.D. 400, but I refrain from expressing any opinion on this subject pending the completion of Mr. Fleet's great work on the Gupta Inscriptions.\n\nIn the following description the references are to my Catalogue published in Part I. of the Society's Journal for 1884.\n\nNos. 1\u20145.\n\nChandra Gupta II.

R. S. E. Communicated by the Hon. Dr. Mahendral\u0101l Sarkar, C. I. E.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThis paper, which is devoted to a consideration of Monge\u2019s differential equation to lines of the second order (noticed by Boole at the end of the first chapter of his \u201cDifferential Equations\u201d), is divided into six sections. The first section gives a short historical introduction; the second section treats of the easiest way of deriving the Mongian equation from the equation of the Conic; the differential equations of all parabolas, all circles, and all Conics referred to co-ordinate axes through the centre, are easily obtained incidentally. The third section shews how the Mongian equation can be completely integrated by ordinary methods, a problem which does not appear to have been solved before. The fourth section shews how the same equation may be integrated by means of an integrating factor; and, this process furnishes an immediate proof of a theorem by Professor Michael Roberts, relating to a second integral of the Mongian equation. The fifth section furnishes an easy proof of the permanency of form of the Mongian equation, as well as of several other differential equations whose g\nmeanings are pointed out; formulae are added for the verification of the theorem stated in this section. The last section contains a criticism of Professor Sylvester's geometrical interpretation of the Mongian equation; the Professor's theorem is deduced with ease, but it is pointed out that the geometrical theorem, though perfectly correct, is not at all the geometric interpretation of the Mongian equation as contemplated by Boole; the theorem is, in fact, a truism; what Boole sought for in vain has yet to be discovered.\n\nThe paper will be printed in Part II of the Journal for 1887.\n\nLIBRARY.\n\nThe following additions have been made to the Library since the Meeting held in June last.\n\nTRANSACTIONS, PROCEEDINGS AND JOURNALS,\n\npresented by the respective Societies and Editors.\n\nAmsterdam.

Beveridge, Esq., O. S.\n   (Abstract.)\n\nIn this paper the author first draws attention to the fact that the era of Lakshmana Sena is mentioned by Abul Fazl in the Akbarnama, according to whom it began in 1119 A.D., and states that although the era has been discussed by more than one scholar it appears that its date, or even the event denoted by it, has not yet been positively ascertained. He then reviews the dates that have been assigned by different writers for the commencement of the era, and explains how the era came to be mentioned by Abul Fazl, and why there seems to be a probability of the date given by him being correct, there being also a corroboration of it in the Tabaq\u00e1t-i-N\u00e1siri. The point being a most interesting one the author\ntrusts that some one will take up the enquiry, since it concerns the date of the accession of the last Hindu king of Bengal.\n\nIn a supplement to the paper the author advances further reasons for concluding that the date of the commencement of the era given by Abul Fuzl is correct, and finally he suggests that the translation of a Sanskrit inscription from Buddha Gya given by Dr. Mitra in his second paper on the Sena R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Bengal might bear a slightly different interpretation, which would make it refer to the 74th year of the reign of Lakshmana Sena, instead of 74 years after the expiration of his reign, and from which it would follow that the era originated with that king.\n\nThe paper will be published in the Journal, Part I.\n\n5. The sacred and ornamental characters of Tibet.\u2014By Babu Sarat Chandra Das, C. I. E.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nAfter a brief allusion to the introduction of the art of writing into Tibet, the writer gives a short account of the steps taken to establish Buddhist institutions in the country consequent on Buddhism being made the State religion, and of the subsequent necessity for increasing the written characters of the language, the letters of the alphabet originally designed being found insufficient for the translation of the Buddhist sacred scriptures and Sanskrit grammars and dictionaries into Tibetan. The account is followed by a description of the principal changes that the written language has undergone, accompanied with drawings of the various kinds of characters and the purposes for which they are used.\n\nThe paper will be published in the Journal, Part I.\n\n6. On the Authorship of the Mrichchhaka\u1e6dik\u0101.\u2014By Pandit Maheshchandra Ny\u00e1yaratna, C. I. E.\n\nA paper was read by B\u00e1bu Asutosh Mukerji, M. A., F. R. A., F. R. S. E., at a meeting of this Society on the 6th April last, in which he attempted to prove that king S\u00fadraka, the reputed author of the Mrichchhaka\u1e6dik\u0101 was not its real author. Commenting on this paper Dr. Hoernle referred to a new theory about the authorship of the play advanced by Professor Pischel in the Introduction to his edition of \u015ar\u012bg\u00e1rla-tilaka. This theory ascribes the authorship to the celebrated Dandin, the author of Da\u015bakum\u0101ra-charita and K\u0101vyad\u0101r\u015ba.\n\nI purpose to briefly examine the theories of B\u00e1bu Asutosh Mukerji and Professor Pischel.\n\nThe chief ground on which B\u00e1bu Asutosh Mukerji bases his theory is, that in the introduction of the play, a stanza occu\nS\u00fadraka is said to have entered the fire (\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0915\u0943\u0924\u093f\u0915\u0930\u094d\u092e \u0938\u092e\u093e\u0927\u093f). B\u00e1bu \u00c1sutosh thinks that S\u00fadraka could by no means be the author when his entering into fire is mentioned in the play itself. Another argument of B\u00e1bu \u00c1sutosh Mukerji is, that there are lengthy panegyrics on S\u00fadraka in several stanzas which could hardly have occurred in the play, had it been written by himself. B\u00e1bu \u00c1sutosh Mukerji concludes that the play was composed under royal patronage, and that the dramatist assigned the work to his patron; such a supposition being, according to B\u00e1bu \u00c1sutosh Mukerji, in perfect accordance with what is known of poets and their royal patrons.\n\nThe second argument of B\u00e1bu \u00c1sutosh Mukerji, viz., the presence of verses landatory of the author in the work itself, has hardly any weight. There is a rule* that in Sanskrit dramas there should be praise of the author and his work in the introduction, through the mouth of one of the actors, in order to excite the interest of the audience; and in almost all Sanskrit dramas extant we find this rule strictly observed. It need hardly be noticed that the verses come out of the mouth of one of the dramatis personae and therefore the author does not directly take upon himself the indelicacy of praising himself.\n\nB\u00e1bu \u00c1sutosh Mukerji's first and chief argument is also not a very strong one.\n\nIt can easily be met by supposing that the stanza in question is an interpolation. There are three other stanzas in the introduction ascribing the play to S\u00fadraka, and the play is traditionally ascribed to him. Prithv\u00eddhar\u00e1 and other commentators of the play all hold that S\u00fadraka was the author. The rules\u2020 elaborated for the construction of Sanskrit dramas require that the name of the author should be given at the beginning of a play. Here the name of S\u00fadraka has been given as that of the author in several stanzas. It is hardly possible to overlook all these considerations simply because there is a line in one of the stanzas which seems to indicate that S\u00fadraka could not be its author. It is hard to believe that a poet who wished the work to pass for the work of S\u00fadraka would put in a line from which the imposture would at once be detected. If a modern critic can see the absurdity of a poet's saying of himself that \"he entered the fire,\" the same absurdity would doubtless have presented itself to the minds of the men who set up the story. It is paying but a poor compliment to the intelligence of the poet and his royal patron to suppose that they could not perceive that this line would serve effectually to expose the imposture.\n\n* \u0905\u0928\u0941\u092d\u0935\u0940\u0915\u0930\u0923\u0902 \u0924\u0924\u094d\u0930 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0936\u0902\u0938\u0928\u093e\u0902 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u094b\u091a\u0928\u093e\u0964 \u092d\u0930\u0924\u0903\u0964\n\u2020 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u092f\u093e\u0938 \u0930\u091c\u094d\u091e\u0947 \u0935\u093f\u0935\u093f\u0927\u0915\u0932\u094d\u092a\u0947\u0928 \u091a \u0915\u0940\u0902 \u092e\u0947\u092f\u0941\u0903\u0964 \u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e\u093f\u0915\u0903\u0964\nEither, therefore, the line in question is an altered reading introduced subsequent to the death of S\u016bdraka, or the stanza in which it occurs is an interpolation, or it is susceptible of an interpretation which will remove the difficulties felt by the critics.\n\nSuch an interpretation is not hard to come by. D\u012bk\u1e63hita Lalla in his commentary thus explains the passage \"\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0924\u094d\u0935\u093e \u091a\u093e\u092f\u0941\u0903-\u0938\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093e\u0902\u0938\u093f\"\u2014\n\nThe purport of this is that by means of astrological calculations he came to know the time of his death, and entered the fire at a sacrifice called Sarvasv\u0101ra, like Sarabha\u1e45ga (in the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a). The use of the past tense (\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0935\u093f\u0927\u093f) is with reference to S\u016btradh\u0101ra\u2019s reciting the stanzas on the stage in future time, (and not in reference to the time when the play was composed). It may appear strange to Western ideas that a man should mention the time of his death from mere astrological calculations. But the thing is quite a common occurrence in this country. My uncle, a profound Sanskrit scholar, found on a reference to his horoscope that he should die when 75 years and 7 months old. When he nearly reached that age he hastened to Benares to die in that sacred city. The late venerable Professor T\u0101r\u0101n\u0101th Tarka-v\u0101chaspati also repaired to Benares a short time before his death, and would not wait even for a month though he had some urgent business at hand, and was in sound health at the time, for his horoscope told him that his end was near. I know of another profound Sanskrit scholar who drew up his will in all haste because his horoscope seemed to indicate that he had but a short time to live.\n\nThe phrase \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0935\u093f\u0927\u093f \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0935\u093f\u0927\u093f may also be explained thus \u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0924\u094d\u0935\u093e \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0935\u093f\u0927\u093f \u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0924\u094d\u0935\u093e-\n\nthat is, he performed the rite of Agnisam\u0101ropana (before he entered the ascetic stage). It was not an uncommon practice of kings of old of this country to abdicate the throne in favour of their eldest sons and repair to the forest and lead an ascetic life. A certain religious observance called the Agnisam\u0101ropana had to be performed on this occasion. It may be mentioned that in the stanza in which \"(\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0935\u093f\u0927\u093f \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0935\u093f\u0927\u093f)\" occurs, exactly the same circumstances in which a man may enter the ascetic stage according to the rules of the S\u016btras are to be found.\nIt is difficult to say which of these two interpretations is the correct one. But it is manifest from this that the passage does not place any insuperable difficulty in the way of our accepting the traditional belief that S\u00fadraka was the author of the play. It may be remarked by the way that the assertion that it is a very common practice to name works after the names of the royal patrons of their authors is too vague and general to be of use in settling a debatable question; as a matter of fact the practice is not so common as is assumed. Except in the instance of Sr\u00edharsha who was the royal patron of Dh\u00e1vaka, and had the works of the latter named after himself, there is no other case on record in the annals of Sanskrit literature; and even the case of Sr\u00edharsha himself is now admitted to be a doubtful one. Under the circumstances I hold it reprehensible to raise a doubt where satisfactory explanations are accessible. To accept a conclusion founded upon such a doubt is to open a wide door for the falsification of history.\n\nThe chief argument of Dr. R. Pischel may be summarised thus:\u2014Dandin is the reputed author of three famous works; of these K\u00e1vy\u00e1dar\u015ba and Da\u015bakum\u00e1ra are two. As to the third there is difference of opinion. Dandin in his K\u00e1vy\u00e1dar\u015ba twice quotes a verse \u091c\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0939\u0947\u0902 \u0924\u0940\u0935\u094d\u0930 \u0924\u0924\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0935\u094b\u0902 \u0938\u092e\u093e\u0928\u093f &c., which is found in the Mr\u00edchchhaka\u1e6dik\u00e1. Now, it is generally supposed that Dandin never quotes verses from other writers; and all the verses given in the K\u00e1vy\u00e1dar\u015ba are of his own composing. It is, therefore, highly probable that the Mr\u00edchchhaka\u1e6dik\u00e1, from which he has quoted a verse, is a work of his own, the missing third. The force of this argument depends entirely on the premiss that Dandin never quotes his examples from others. I do not think it necessary for me on the present occasion to examine all the verses he has given in his work by way of examples. I may note, however, that Professor Wilson in the preface to his edition of Da\u015bakum\u00e1ra Oharita writes.\u2014\u201cIt (Kavy\u00e1dar\u015ba) is not of great extent; but the rules are illustrated by examples taken, it is affirmed, from different authors.\u201d And Professor Wilson is quite right, for the following four verses from the M\u0101habh\u00e1rata, S\u00e1kuntala \u015aisup\u00e1lidha and K\u00e1damvori cannot otherwise be accounted for. The second part of the second example is borrowed verbatim.\nThe verse on which the argument is founded is, I hold, adverse to the theory. An explanation of the first passage where the verse \u0935\u093f\u0937\u094d\u0923\u0941\u0924\u0940\u092f &c. is given (II, 226, p. 218, Cal. edition, 1863) would itself show that the verse has been quoted from some other author. Having given there the definition of the rhetorical figure Upreksh\u0101 and illustrated it by examples, the author writes:\n\n| Do. | Do. |\n|-----|-----|\n| \u0915\u093e\u0935\u094d\u092f\u0935\u093f\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0928\u092e\u094d | \u0915\u093e\u0935\u094d\u092f\u0935\u093f\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0928\u092e\u094d |\n\nHere the author evidently controverts the opinion of some rhetoricians who regarded the verse in question \u0935\u093f\u0937\u094d\u0923\u0941\u0924\u0940\u092f &c. as an example of Upam\u0101. He shows by a long argument, and it may be remarked, by the way, that this is the only instance where the author is distinctly controversial\u2014that these rhetoricians are mistaken. Now these rhetoricians may very well be assumed to be older than Dr.\nthe rhetoricians referred to were not older but contemporary writers, it is hard to imagine that they would have noticed a verse written by a contemporary, as Sanskrit authors, when they quote, usually quote from old authors. In his note on this passage the late Professor Premchand Tarkabagia, very justly writes, \"\u0930\u0942\u092a\u092e\u093f\u0924\u093f \u092a\u094d\u0930\u093e\u091a\u0940\u0928\u092a\u0926\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0938\u094d\u092e\u093f\u0924\u093f \u0926\u0941\u0932\u094d\u0939\u0947: \u0964\" that is, by the words \"\u0930\u0942\u092a\u092e\u093f\u0924\u093f,\" is meant the old verse (hemistich). The presumption is almost irresistible that the verse must have been old and well-known when it was discussed by several rhetoricians. The verse is quoted a second time later on, (II, 362, page 314) and here the whole couplet, and not the first two feet only, has been given. The object here was to give an example of two distinct and independent rhetorical figures in one and the same stanza. Now it is not quite easy to give an example in which no dispute could possibly arise. It is likely, therefore, that the author here quotes a stanza, in the first half of which he has established conclusively that there is the figure Utpreksha, and in the second half of which there is a clear and undisputed case of Upam\u00e1. It may also be mentioned that this stanza is the stock example in Sanskrit treatises on rhetoric of distinct and independent rhetorical figures occurring in one and the same verse.\n\nDandin, in his Kavyadars'a, does not say, as the author of Rasagangadhara does*, that he will not extract verses from other authors by way of rhetorical examples. On the contrary he distinctly states that he will compile from old writers and take into account the usage of old poets.\u2020 It may be mentioned that Jagannatha, the author of Rasagangadhara, who distinctly lays down for himself the rule that he will never give examples from other authors, but will always give examples of his own composing, has himself quoted the verse \"\u091c\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0928\u093f\u0935\u0940\u0935 \u0938\u0924\u094d\u092f\u094b\u093d\u0939\u093e\u0928\u093f\" &c. (See \u091c\u0928\u094d\u0928\u093f\u0935\u0940\u0935\u093e\u0938\u0915\u0930\u0923) exactly under the same circumstances as those in which it has been quoted by Dandin. Both the authors give certain examples of the rhetorical figure Utpreksha, and then go on to discuss the figure in this verse. Is it then to be wondered at that Dandin should have quoted a verse from a well-known work, a verse moreover which has become a stock example with rhetoricians?\n\nIt may also be remarked that if the Mrichchhaka\u1e6dik\u00e1 were really a work of Dandin's, it would be rather strange that he should quote only one single verse from it, (and that on two occasions) for he might very\n\n* \u091c\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0928\u093f\u0935\u0940\u0935 \u092e\u0943\u0924\u094d\u092f\u0941\u092e\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0917\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0927\u093e\u092a\u094d\u0930\u093e\u092a\u094d\u0924\u0902 \u0915\u093e\u0935\u094d\u092f\u0902 \u0938\u0924\u094d\u092f\u0902 \u0928\u093f\u0927\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0935\u0902 \u092a\u0930\u092e\u0902 \u0915\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0941 \u0964 \u0924\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0928 \u0907\u0924\u094d\u092f\u0947\u0935\u0947\n\u0926\u0941\u0937\u094d\u091f\u092e\u093e\u0923\u0902 \u092e\u0928\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0902 \u0917\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0939: \u0915\u0925\u0942\u0930\u093f\u0915\u093e\u0915\u093e\u0936\u092e\u0936\u093f\u0937\u094d\u091f\u0924\u093e \u091a\u0928\u094d\u0926\u094d\u0930\u0902 \u0964\n\u0930\u0938\u0917\u093e\u0919\u094d\u0917\u093e\u0930\u0903 \u0964 \u0967 \u0906\u0928\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0903 \u0964\n\n\u2020 \u092a\u0942\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0947\u0928\u093e\u0915\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092f\u0902 \u0938\u0902\u092c\u0943\u0926\u094d\u0927\u0902 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u092f\u094b\u091c\u0928\u092a\u0926\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0925\u092e\u094d \u0964 \u091a\u093e\u0930\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0938\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0940\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0925\u092e\u094d \u0928\u093f\u092f\u0924\u0947 \u0915\u093e\u0935\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0932\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0923\u092e\u094d \u0964\n\u0915\u093e\u0935\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0926\u0930\u094d\u0936\u0903 \u0964 \u0967 \u0964 \u0968\neasily have quoted many more. In a treatise on rhetoric all that the author has to do is to expound rhetorical rules, and if he had a long play written by himself it would be strange if he did not make a freer use of the materials it would offer to his hand.\n\nThat the age of the *M\u1e5bcchchhaka\u1e6dik\u0101* is anterior to that of Dandin will abundantly appear from the following considerations:\n\nThat the *M\u1e5bcchchhaka\u1e6dik\u0101* was composed at the time of S\u016bdraka, or at least immediately after his death, hardly admits of doubt.\n\nNow there is only one S\u016bdraka known in ancient Indian history. And the age of that Sudraka has been given in the *Skandapur\u0101\u1e47a* as 3290 years after the advent of the *Kaliyuga*, that is, about 1700 years ago. This brings the age of S\u016bdraka to the second century of the Christian era. But Professor Pischel himself admits that the age of Dandin cannot be earlier than the 7th or the 6th century. In the *Subh\u0101shita-Haravali* there occurs the following verse:\n\n```\n\u0924\u094b \u092a\u0943\u0925\u094d\u0935\u0940\u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0947 \u0930\u092e\u094d\u092f\u094b \u0930\u093e\u092e\u093f\u0915\u0947\u0936\u094d\u0935\u0930\u093f\u0923\u0903\u0964\n\u0915\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092f\u0902 \u091a \u0935\u093f\u0926\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0947\u0930\u093e\u091c\u094d\u091e\u0940\u0926\u0930\u094d\u0936\u0928\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0902 \u0930\u093e\u092e\u092e\u094d\u0964\n```\n\nFrom this it appears that S\u016bdraka was anterior to, or at least contemporary of, Sanmila. Now Sanmila is anterior to K\u0101lidasa, as appears from the following passage from the introduction to the *M\u0101lavik\u0101gnimitra*\n\n```\n\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u093f\u0937\u094d\u0920\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0902 \u0927\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092f\u0915\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092f\u0938\u093f\u0926\u094d\u0927\u0935\u093f\u092a\u0941\u0932\u093e\u0926\u0940\u0928\u093e \u092a\u094d\u0930\u092d\u093e\u0938\u0924\u093f\u0930\u0938\u094d\u092f \u092c\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0928\u093e\u0902 \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0937\u094d\u0920\u0903 \u0915\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092f\u0926\u093e\u092f\u0915\u0903 \u0939\u0943\u0926\u093f \u0936\u094d\u0930\u094b\u0924\u0947 \u092c\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0928\u093e\u0902\u0964\n```\n\nDandin, however, is unquestionably later than Kalidasa, so that the *M\u1e5bcchchhaka\u1e6dik\u0101* could never have been written by Dandin. Again V\u0101mana, in his *K\u0101vyalank\u0101ra-s\u016btrav\u1e5btti* mentions S\u016bdraka.\n\n---\n\n* Quoted by Pundit Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar in his 2nd pamphlet on \"Widow marriage.\" Professor Wilson in the Introduction to his translation of *M\u1e5bcchchhaka\u1e6dik\u0101* has also referred to this passage of the *Skandapur\u0101\u1e47a*.

It follows therefore that Dandin could by no means have been the author of the Mrichchhaka\u1e6dik\u0101. More remarkable still is the fact that V\u00e1mana not only mentions S\u00fadraka, but quotes passages from the Mrichchhaka\u1e6dik\u0101 itself. This hardly leaves any doubt that the Mrichchhaka\u1e6dik\u0101 is anterior to the time of Dandin. Moreover, the author of the Vrihat S\u00e1ngadharapaddhati quotes several verses from K\u00e1vy\u0101darsa ascribing the authorship of each of them to Dandin; but when quoting the verse, \u0915\u093f\u092e\u094d\u092c\u0926\u094d\u0935\u093f\u0928\u093f &c., he does not mention the name of Dandin as its author. This conclusion is very much strengthened by a comparison of the style of the Dasakum\u0101ra Charita with that of the Mrichchhaka\u1e6dik\u0101. It leaves no doubt that the two works could not have proceeded from the pen of one and the same writer. The Dasakum\u0101ra abounds in long sa\u1e41\u015b\u0101sas, unusual verbal inflections, and inversions of the regular position of words in sentences. The Mrichchhaka\u1e6dik\u0101, on the other hand, even in its prose portion, is written in quite a simple and easy style. Professor Pischel holds that \"The state of life as described in Mrichchhaka\u1e6dik\u0101 is precisely the same as that in the Dasakum\u0101ra Charita.\" This opinion is hardly tenable. The hero of the Mrichchhaka\u1e6dik\u0101 is a man of true nobility of nature, truthful, generous, gentle, and brave. The play gives a vivid description of different phases of society including a very graphic account of the administration of justice. The moral tone of the Da\u015bakum\u0101ra is distinctly lower. The tales are full of low love intrigues, and are sometimes conceived in very bad taste indeed.\n\nIn fact a careful perusal of the two works, Mrichchhaka\u1e6dik\u0101 and the Da\u015bakum\u0101ra, would, I feel sure, convince every candid reader that they could hardly have been written by one and the same author.\n\nIt is needless to examine the other arguments advanced by Professor Pischel. They do not seem to me to have much weight. If his main argument is untenable, the subsidiary arguments will hardly be of any avail.\n\nI trust I have said enough to shew that neither B\u00e1bu \u00c1sutosh Mukerji nor Professor Pischel has succeeded in establishing each his theory regarding the authorship of Mrichchhaka\u1e6dik\u0101.\n\n7.

S., Curator of the Herbarium, Royal Botanical Gardens, Calcutta.\n\nWhen stationed at Kohima in 1886 I often heard both from Europeans and natives of the springs in the Namba forest. On my way to Calcutta last January I visited one of these. As the only notice of them hitherto published\u2020 is meagre and barely correct, further observation seemed called for. I was assured that in place of being of a scalding temperature those who resorted thither bathed in the springs. No European at Kohima knew the exact temperature.\n\nOn my way down I received from an officer\u2021 passing up, a better account of the largest spring. The temperature I was told, is that of a comfortable bath, varying little throughout the year; the water in the rains reaching above the knee, at this time, (January), would probably not reach further than half way up the calf.\n\nThe spring was reached at noon on January 16th. It is eleven miles from Golaghat on the Golaghat-Dimapur road where this crosses the Namba river, from whose right bank it is six paces distant at a point twenty-five paces above the bridge. Thirty paces below the bridge the Dhunsiri river, a considerable stream, receives the Namba from the left. The Dhunsiri even in the cold weather is muddy, the Namba is a clear stream, with a bed of white sand, containing some rather angular quartz pebbles. The banks of both streams are about 18 feet high, and are clay with alluvial mud above.\n\nThe depression in which the spring lies, is circular, about 20 feet across and 3 feet deep; the edges mud, the bottom white sand with pebbles, as in the bed of the adjacent stream 15 feet lower. This depression is in Long. 93\u00b0 56' E. and Lat. 26\u00b0 24' N., and is 350 feet above the sea.\u00a7 Gas bubbles up all over its area, a very strong escape in the\n\n---\n\n* Sub-Assistant to the Commissioner of Assam at Golaghat.

The gas was odourless and did not burn. The water was five inches deep in the centre; my feet sank slowly in the sand, causing more violent ebullition of gas; by the time the sand had reached my knees it was difficult to extract my feet. The water was beautifully clear, with a sharp but not disagreeable taste. The temperature of the spring was 110\u00b0 Fh., that of the Namba being 63\u00b76\u00b0 Fh. The effects on the skin appeared to be only those of hot water. Still, all classes of natives attribute to it curative properties in cases of skin disease, and take long journeys to bathe there, leaving offerings of money in the pool. These disappear; removed they suppose by the spirit of the spring. I was fortunate enough to find a bronze coin. Its upper surface is much corroded: that which rested on the sand is less affected. To an expert* the effects looked like those which H\u2082S would produce. From a rough calculation I estimated the discharge at over eight gallons per minute. I brought away some of the water for chemical examination.\n\nBefore the result of this examination was received a number of manuscripts were discovered in a long unopened drawer in the Library of the Royal Botanical Gardens.

Soroo Noon-Poong, the principal spring, is eleven miles from Golaghat and situated close to the edge of the right bank of the Nambur, exactly where the road leading from Golaghat to Deemapoor crosses it, on the left bank of the Dhunsiri.\n\n| Date          | Temperature |\n|---------------|-------------|\n| 1845.

On the 27th of October last, I estimated that the Soroo Noon-poong was discharging about 30 gallons of water per minute. The waters of the Burra Noon-poong being mingled with those of the jan, renders it difficult to form any just estimate of the quantity of water discharged in a given time; this circumstance also accounts for the low temperature of the spring.\"\n\nThe memoranda are dated, Golaghat, November 1st, 1854.\n\nThe chemical examination by Dr. Warden yielded the following information:\n\n| Parts per 100,000 |\n|------------------|\n| Total solids at 100\u00b0 C | 124 |\n| Chlorine | 66 |\n\nThe water was too old for estimation of organic matter. Nitrates and sulphates were present; nitrites absent. There was a distinct trace of H\u2082S, but whether this was originally present in the water or produced by the action of sulphates in the presence of organic matter the analyst was not in a position to offer an opinion. There was blackening of the solid residue left after evaporation of the water\u2014on ignition\u2014indicating presence of much organic matter.\n\n9. Further notes on Indian Amphipoda.\u2014By G. M.

An inscription on stone (broken into three parts) dated 1720 Vikram\u00e1diya Samvat, found in village Khukhr\u00e1, which was at one time the seat of the Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1s of Chu\u1e6di\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur. The text (see Plate III) may be read thus\u2014\n\n1 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u092c\u0930\u0938\u093f\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u0930\u094d\u092f\n2 \u0915 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0926\u093f. \u0938\u093e\u0935 \u092a\u0902\u091a\n3 \u091a\u0940 \u092a\u0902\u091a . \u092c\u094d\u0930\u091c\u092a\u093e\u0930\u093f\n4 \u0936\u093f\u0935\u092e\u0924 \u0935\u093f\u0926\u094d\u092f\u094b . \u091a\u0940\n5 \u0930\u0941\u092a \u092d\u093e\u0937 \u0928\u0930\u0947\u0902\u0926\u094d\u0930 \u0967\u096d\u0968\u0966\n\n\"The Raghn\u00e1th Narendra\" mentioned in the inscription, was the most renowned among the former chiefs of Chu\u1e6di\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur.\n\n(2.) A photographic negative of the above inscription.\n\n(3.) Twenty-five copper coins dug out of the earth in the village of Khukhr\u00e1 in Chu\u1e6di\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur, probably of the age of the emperor Akbar.\n\n(4.) And lastly, a mutilated stone idol, found in the S\u00faraj Mandil (temple of the Sun) at the village Sutiamb\u00e1, in Chu\u1e6di\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur. The so-called temple of the sun, a mere thatched shed, is mentioned in the annals of the N\u00e1gavams\u00ed family.\n\n\"I beg further to send you herewith for preservation some rubbings I took last year from inscriptions found in and about Doesanagar, once the capital of Chu\u1e6di\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur. I had not had sufficient time at my disposal to complete my enquiries about them. One of the inscriptions is dated 1711 Samvat, and names Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja R\u00e1ma Sh\u00e1h, father of Raghn\u00e1th mentioned above. This is the oldest inscription I have seen in Chu\u1e6di\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur.\"\n\nDr. Hoernle stated that he had examined the coins, which were of the following types:\n1 Copper, of Isl\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h (like No. 363, in Thomas' \"Chronicles\").\n4 do., of Ibrah\u00edm Sh\u00e1h Sharq\u00ed, of Jaunpur, d. 822, 834.\n8 do., of Husain Sh\u00e1h, of Jaunpur, date 864.\n1 do., of Gangeya Deva of Chedi.\n\nThe remainder, extremely worn and illegible.\n\nRegarding the rubbings from Doesanagar, Dr. Hoernle said, that they were inscriptions in the Hind\u00ed language and in modern N\u00e1gari characters of large size. The body of the letters measured about 2 inches, and with the superscribed vowel-marks, 3 inches. The several inscriptions run as follows:\n\nI\n\n1 \u0938\u092e\u093e\u0928 \u0938\u092e\u093e\u0928 \u0938\u0926 \u0930\u092e\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0926 \u0906\u0936\u093f\u092f\u094b\u0964\n2 \u0935\u0948\u0937\u094d\u0923\u0935 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u092d\u0941 \u0905\u0928\u093f\u091a\u094d\u091b\u093e \u092e\u093e\n3 \u0935\u093f\u0937\u094d\u0923\u0941\u0964 \u0924\u0940 \u0930\u093e\u092e \u0927\u093e\u0930 \u0928\u0930 \u0926\u0947\u0935 \u0917\u0941\u092a\u094d\u0924 \u091a\u0930\u093f\n4 \u0928\u093e\u0925 \u092e\u0947\u0964 \u0924\u093e \u0926\u093f\u0932 \u092c\u093e\u092a\u0940 \u0915\u0940\u091a\u094d\u091b \u092e\u0939\n5 \u091a\u092e\u091c\u093e\u0915\u0932\u0947\u0965 \u0967\u096d\u0967\u0967 \u0938\u0902\u0935\u0924\n\ni.e., 'Know it to be the year seventeen hundred and eleven; count it to be Saturday the eighth of the light half of Vais\u00e1kh.

From the N\u00e1gavams\u00e1val\u00ed, published by B\u00e1b\u00fa R. D. Haldar, and a copy of which the B\u00e1b\u00fa had kindly given him, Dr. Hoernle stated, he had extracted the following genealogy. The founder of the family was Phan\u00edmu\u1e47u\u1e6d\u00e1 R\u00e1y, who reigned 59 years;\nhe was followed by 26 lineal successors, all bearing the surname of R\u00e1y. Then there appeared to have been some kind of break. The 28th member of the family was Bh\u00edmakarna, who at first reigned together with his elder brother Shy\u00e1makarna, but afterwards became sole ruler for 10 years. He was followed, in lineal succession, by 16 rulers, all distinguished by the surname of Kar\u00f1a. Then followed, as the 44th R\u00e1j\u00e1, Vair\u00ed\u015b\u00e1la, who reigned 14 years. He was said to have served with distinction in many wars under the Mogul emperor Aurangzib (1658\u20141707). He was followed by Durjana S\u00e1la, who fell out with the Emperor and was imprisoned by him in the fort of Gw\u00e1l\u00edyar for 12 years. At the end of that time he was reconciled to the emperor, who not only permitted him to return home, but conferred on him and on his successors the title of Sh\u00e1h. Durjana S\u00e1la reigned altogether 41 years. He had four sons, of whom the eldest was Madhukara Sh\u00e1h and the youngest R\u00e1ma Sh\u00e1h. The former succeeded his father and reigned 18 years. He was succeeded by his son, Deva Sh\u00e1h, who again was succeeded by his uncle R\u00e1ma Sh\u00e1h, the 48th of the line of N\u00e1gavams\u00ed R\u00e1j\u00e1s. He was said to have been in great favour with the emperor of his time (Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1n or Aurangzib) to whom he gave a daughter in marriage. He was the Sh\u00e1h of the inscription of 1711. He reigned 25 years and was succeeded by his son Raghu\u0144\u00e1th Sh\u00e1h, the most celebrated of the line, who reigned 36 years, and was succeeded by his son Jadun\u00e1th Sh\u00e1h for 18 years, and his grandson Sivan\u00e1th Sh\u00e1h for 9 years, and great-grandson Udayan\u00e1th Sh\u00e1h for 7 years. The latter was succeeded by his uncle, Shy\u00e1m Sundar Sh\u00e1h, a brother of Sivan\u00e1th Sh\u00e1h, who only reigned 5 months, and was followed by his brother Balar\u00e1ma Sh\u00e1h. He reigned 3 years and was succeeded by his son Ma\u1e47in\u00e1th Sh\u00e1h, who reigned 14 years. Now followed Darpan\u00e1th Sh\u00e1h, a son of Nripan\u00e1th Sh\u00e1h, who was another of the 13 brothers of Sivan\u00e1th Sh\u00e1h. Darpan\u00e1th reigned 29 years and was succeeded by his son Devan\u00e1th Sh\u00e1h who reigned 14 years, and his grandson Govindan\u00e1th Sh\u00e1h who reigned 17 years. The latter appeared to have been the first to assume the title of Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1, in addition to the family title of Sh\u00e1h. He was succeeded by his eldest son Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja Jagann\u00e1th Sh\u00e1h, the 59th of his line who, at the time of the composition of the N\u00e1gavams\u00e1vali, had been reigning 17 years. This was in the year 1895 Samvat, or 1838 A.D. Calculating backwards from this date, R\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h would have ascended the throne about 1649 A.D.; which would agree with his inscription dated 1711 Samvat or 1654 A.D. Raghu\u0144\u00e1th Sh\u00e1h came to the throne about 1674 A.D., and his inscriptions are dated 1720 Sam. = 1663 A.D., and 1742 Sam. = 1685 A.D. The unnamed inscription of 1729 Sam. = 1672 A.D. would also belong to him. The emperor, to whom R\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h gave his daughter might have been Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1n, who reigned up to\n1658 A.D., or his successor Aurangzib. It was quite clear, however, that the N\u00e1gavams\u00e1val\u00ed was wrong in making Durjana S'\u00e1la a contemporary of Aurangzib; for the former's reign commenced about 1590 A.D. when Akbar was on the throne of Dohl\u00ed. His imprisonment in Gw\u00e1l\u00edyar, accordingly, must be placed in the time of Akbar or of Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr, the latter of whom commenced to reign in 1605. This agreed with a statement of B\u00e1b\u00fa R. D. Haldar, that the coins presented by him were traditionally said \"to have been brought to Chutiy\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur by the followers of Durjana S'\u00e1la from Gw\u00e1l\u00edyar, where he was incarcerated during the time of Akbar or Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr.\" The person Hari N\u00e1th, mentioned in R\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h's inscription, was according to the N\u00e1gavams\u00e1val\u00ed, the minister of R\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h as well as of Raghn\u00e1th Sh\u00e1h. He was referred to in the latter Sh\u00e1h's inscription as the Brahmach\u00e1ri, a title by which he was also mentioned in the N\u00e1gavams\u00e1val\u00ed.\n\nThe Philological Secretary exhibited two gold coins, forwarded by F.S. Growse Esq., Magistrate of Fathg\u00e1rah. One of them was a coin of Chandra Gupt\u00e1 II, in a rather clipped condition; the other was a coin of Gangeya Deva of Chedi (A.D. 1020-1040) in very good condition.\n\nThe Philosophical Secretary read the following Reports on finds of Treasure Trove Coins.\n\nReport on 232 silver coins forwarded by the Collector of Muzaffarpur, with his No. 717, R. dated Muzaffarpur, the 8th August 1887.\n\nThe coins were found by six persons at R\u00e1japakhar, Thana Mahna, Zillah Muzaffarpur.\n\nA nominal list of the coins was attached to the Collector's letter, in which the coins were stated to belong to the following Mughal Emperors: Akbar, Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr, Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n, Aurangzib, Bah\u00e1dur Sh\u00e1h, Farukhsir, Raf\u00edn-d-darj\u00e1t, Mu\u1e25ammad Sh\u00e1h, and Sh\u00e1h '\u00c1lam. This is not quite correct. There are no coins of Sh\u00e1h '\u00c1lam in the collection; those attributed to him, really belong to Bah\u00e1dur Sh\u00e1h, as shown by the dates they bear. Again, among the coins ascribed to Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n, there are two which belong to Raf\u00edn-d-daulah, as also shewn by the dates they bear, and from other numismatic considerations.\n\nThe following is a correct list of the coins.\n\n| I.

On the obverse is represented the goddess Durga\nseated; the reverse contains the legend: Sri Madangeya Deva.\n\nReport on 112 old coins, forwarded by the Deputy Commissioner of\nGujrat, with his No. 434, dated 2 May 1887.\nThe coins are said to have been found in the villages of Dillawal,\nDhul and Dhunu, of the Gujrat District.\n\nThey are all of silver, and belong to two entirely different species\nof coins; viz., 81 are rupees of different Mughal emperors of Dehli,\nwhile 31 are half-rupees of the Hind\u00fa kings of Kabul; total 112 coins.\nThe Kabul coins are the more ancient, and date from the 9th century\nA.D. The Mughal coins range between 1627 and 1761 A.D.\nThe 81 Mughal coins belong to the following emperors:\nI, Shah Jah\u00e1n 1627-1658 A.D., indifferent\nspecimens; date and mint unknown, ... 2\nII, Aurangzib, 1658-1707 A.D. lettered surfaces,\na, Type I, date in top line, 2 varieties, of\nvarious dates and mints ... 18\nb, Type II, date in middle line, 2 varieties,\nof various dates and mints, ... 6\nc, Type III, date in the bottom line, of\nvarious dates and mints ... 5\n\nIII, Bahadur Shah, 1707-1712 A.D., of 3 different\ntypes, various dates and mints ... 11\n\nIV, Jahandar Shah, 1712 A.D., mint: Lahor, ... 3\n\nV, Farukh Sir, 1712-1719 A.D., of 2 different\ntypes, various dates and mints ... 11\n\nVI, Rafiu-d-darjat, 1719 A.D., mint Multan ... 1\n\nVII, Rafiu-d-Daulah, (Shah Jehan II) 1719 A.D.\nmint: Daru-l-Khilafat Shah Jahansabad ... 1\n\nVIII, Muhammad Shah, 1719-1748 A.D., of various\ndates and mints:\na, Type I, Satiq Qiran, ... ... 9\nb, Type II, Badih Shah Ghazi, ... 13\n\nIX, Alamgir Sani, 1754-1761 A.D. mint Sirhind, 1\n\nTotal ... 81\n\nThe 31 Kabul coins, all belong to the type Samanta\nDeva; obv.

They are supposed to be the earliest kind of Indian coins but probably were in use down to the comparatively late times of the Mahammadan conquest, side by side with more regular currencies. They consist of small flat pieces of metals of all kinds of shapes, marked with a great variety of \"punches,\" some on one side only, others (though rarely) on both\nsides. Many of these punches are of a distinctly Buddhist character, e.g., the bodhi tree within a railing. Other punches represent a peacock above a chaitya, an elephant, bull, deer, dog, frog, three human figures placed in a row, wheels or suns of various forms, etc. etc. Generally these coins consist of more or less pure silver. They are numerously found all over India. A large hoard of such coins, containing 1,191 pieces, was found in January 1885, in the Chaibassa District of Bengal (see Proceedings, As. Soc. Beng., for November 1885, p. 126).\n\nThe coins in the present collection appear to be, nearly all, of either pure or nearly pure silver. Most of them, about 200, are square or oblong; some 75 are nearly circular, the others are of no definite shape. Most of them are in very good condition, but 113 are more or less spoilt by abrasion or corrosion.\n\nThe Philological Secretary read the following letter from Mr. F. S. Growse, with regard to the discussion on the word Ekotibh\u0101va which took place at the last meeting of the Society:\n\n\"I have not seen the 'Academy,' and therefore I cannot say how much of my letter Professor Max M\u00fcller has published.\n\n\"Had I anticipated that any part of it would have the honour of appearing in print I should have been more careful to emphasize the deference I really entertain for Dr. Mitra's extensive learning, before proceeding to dissent from the view of so eminent a scholar even on such a minor matter as the derivation of a single word. I did not think it necessary to cumber a short private note with the elaborate formalities of conventional compliment.\n\n\"I presume that my letter was not published in its entirety, otherwise it would have been clear to any reader that the gist of it was the suggestion that classical Sanskrit formations are more influenced by Pr\u00e1krit rules than orthodox grammarians have ever yet acknowledged. Thus I was by no means guilty of omitting the important word 'Pr\u00e1krit'; upon the presumed omission of which Dr. Mitra has commented at considerable length.\n\n\"One example that I quoted was the Sanskrit v\u012bja, 'seed.' This is ordinarily derived from the root jan with the prefix vi. I prefer to see in it a contraction\u2014on Pr\u00e1krit rule\u2014of the word virya, 'virility.'\n\n\"Similarly, pace Dr. Mitra, I believe that the rules of modern Italian orthography throw much light on the colloquial pronunciation of ancient Latin, and help to solve many of the difficulties and prosodiacal anomalies of Plautine scansion.\n\n\"The assertion that 'under no circumstances can the rule appeal to produce ekoti, but only ekauti,' is\u2014I am sure\u2014one that Dr. Mit\nwould not wish to press. The substitution of o for au being one of the very commonest features of Prakrit etymology.\n\n\"I am still of opinion that the only serious objection to the derivation from eka-koti is the conversion of the cerebral t in koti into a dental. And this Professor Max M\u00fcller at the very outset clearly recognised as an irregularity.\n\n\"To conclude with an incidental criticism. I cannot think that sukara is rightly explained as 'the bristled one.' Rather I should say the name means 'the grunter'; in the same way as mayura is the bird that 'miows', the peacock's cry being often with difficulty distinguishable from that of a cat.\"\n\nThe Philological Secretary read the following notes.\n\nFind of Coins of G\u00e1nggeya Deva of Chedi.\u2014By V. A. Smith Esq.\n\nSixty-five silver coins of G\u00e1nggeya Deva, king of Chedi (A.D. 1020\u20141040) were lately found by two labourers digging a field in Parg\u00e1na Salimpur-Majhau\u00ed of the Gorakhpur District, and have been sent to me by the Collector, Mr. D.T. Roberts, for identification. The name of the village in which they were found is not stated. The coins all agree with the specimen figured and described by Sir A. Cunningham in Archaeological Reports, Vol. X, page 25, Plate X, 3. They are all in excellent condition. I had not the means of weighing them accurately, but they doubtless agree in weight with Sir A. Cunningham's eight specimens, which weighed 60 or 61 grains each.\n\nSteps have been taken to acquire the coins under the Treasure Trove Act.\n\nI take this opportunity of informing the Society that Sir Alfred Lyall, Lieutenant-Governor of the N.W.P., has lately issued an excellent set of rules under the Treasure Trove Act, framed with the object of mitigating, so far as possible, the severity of the law, and of encouraging finders to bring coins to the Collector. But the people in this part of the country are so ignorant and suspicious that no rules are of much use to encourage them to come forward. These eastern districts of the N.W.P. are full of ancient mounds, many of which are of very early date, and great numbers of coins must be annually found, but it is very difficult to get hold of any. The various finds which I have acquired for Government were all obtained through the intervention of the police.\n\nLarge Find of Coins of Govinda Chandra Deva of Kanauj\u2014By V. A. Smith Esq. (1125\u20141150 A.D.)\n\nThe workmen of the Bengal and North-Western Railway recently\nfound about 800 coins of Govinda Chandra Deva of Kanauj near Nau-\npura in the Bahraich District, Oudh.\n\nThe coins are in the hands of Mr. A. Izat, Agent of the Railway\nCompany, who proposes to devote the proceeds of the sale of the\ntreasure to the endowment of the school at Gorakhpur for the children\nof European railway employ\u00e9s.\n\nThe metal of the coins is very impure gold, with a large admixture\nof silver. Two, which I bought for six rupees each, are in very fine\ncondition.\n\nMr. Izat will be glad to sell any number. The coins are of the\nusual and well-known type.\n\nFind of Gold Gupta Coins in the Basti District, N. W. P.\u2014By\n\nV. A. Smith Esq.\n\nDuring the month of August 1887, after a heavy fall of rain, a\nshepherd found eleven gold Gupta coins at Mauza Sarai, about half\na mile south of the Basti Jail. Mauza Sarai, which is uninhabited,\nand the adjoining village of Misranlier, on the bank of the Kuana river,\noccupy the site of an ancient town, which ignorant tradition ascribes\nto the forest tribe named Tharu.\n\nOne of the eleven coins found has been made away with, but I\nsucceeded with a little difficulty in securing the remaining ten, which\nwill be dealt with under the Treasure Trove Act. The usual allegations\nwere made that a large quantity of the coins had really been dis-\ncovered, but I have not been able to elicit any proof of the alleged fact.\n\nNine of the coins belong to the Archer Type, class II, with lotus\nseat reverse, of Chandra Gupta II, which is by far the commonest type\nof the Gupta coinage. Two specimens of this type are in very fine\ncondition. The monograms are 8a, 8b, 10b, and 19b.*\n\nThe tenth coin is a variety of the rare Swordsman and Umbrella\ntype of Chandra Gupta II, but is at first sight not readily recognizable,\nowing to the fact that there is not room on the coin for the umbrella.\nA close inspection shows that the attendant is holding its handle, but\nno more of it is visible. The obverse legend is illegible, except the\nsingle character 'kra', probably part of the word 'Vikramaditya'.\nThe reverse legend is distinctly 'Vikramadityah'. The coin now\ndescribed differs from that shown in my Plate III, figure 8, in that the\nreverse goddess of the new coin has no pedestal.\n\nThe form of the conjunct y in the coin\u2014\n\n* The references are to my paper in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal for 1884, Part I.\nand consists of two closely parallel horizontal lines, two tenths of an inch long, brought back under the t and two preceding characters.\n\nMonogram 7a. Weight, not ascertained, but seems to be normal. The coin is oval, its length from top to bottom being '75, and its width '68 of an inch.\n\nThe fire-altar on the obverse, which is sometimes wanting in coins of this type, is very distinct in this specimen.\n\nThe Weight of the Rati Seed in Southern India.\u2014By V. A. Smith Esq.\n\nThe weight of the rati seed (Abrus precatorius), which is the basis of the Hind\u00fa metrical system, is known to vary in different localities. General Cunningham's experiments fixed the weight for Northern India as 1\u00b79229, and Mr. Laidlay's yielded the practically identical result of 1\u00b7825, which is the more convenient value to adopt for calculation.\n\nMy friend Mr. F. C. Black, C. E., informs me that in Southern India the seeds run to a larger size. When at Hamp\u00ed in the Bellary District of the Madras Presidency, he was struck with this fact, and took the trouble of weighing 672 seeds. The gross weight was 1440 grains, and the average figure is consequently 2\u00b71428 grains.\n\nThe difference between the weights of the rati seed in Northern and Southern India seems worth noting, as it would have to be taken into account in discussing the meteorology of the Southern coinages, should such a discussion be undertaken.\n\nOn the Assurs\u2014By W. H. P. Driver Esq.\n\nQuite lately I have come upon a variety of stone beads which have been washed out of the ground, and which the villagers tell me their ancestors informed them were made and worn by mythological people called Assurs. There are no Assur settlers near the villages where the beads were found, the population being Uraon and having no knowledge whatever of the existence of the Assur tribe, who live in the extreme west of this district.\n\nAs the Assurs themselves say they come from the east, I am inclined to think they are descendants of the mythological Assuras of the Puranas, and had at one time reached an advanced state of civilization, of which they have now lost all traces.\n\nCoins similar in size and shape to these* were found in fields with stone beads, pieces of iron and thick tiles, but I do not send them, as owing to exposure and the ignorant people who found them having tried to polish them up, the original marks have been almost all obliterated.\n\nThese beads, coins &c. were not all found in the same spot but in different parts of the same fields.\n\n* Vis. Two silver coins forwarded by Mr. Driver to the Secretary.\nFrom time immemorial similar beads have been found in certain fields by the cowherd boys (Uraons) and the tradition regarding them has been handed down, that they belonged to 'Assurs', who lived there before the Uraons came into the country. These Uraons do not know that such people as Assurs exist at the present day, but say they belonged to the \"Sat-jug.\" These fields have for generations been owned and cultivated by Uraons, and neither Hindus nor Muhammadans have ever had anything to do with them.\n\nThere are no settlements of Assurs now within fifty miles of these sites, nor have there been any for many generations, but they have a tradition that they came from the east, they being now settled in the west of this district (Lohardagga).\n\nThese same Assurs, though now in a very degraded condition, have traditions amongst them, that before the Uraons came and turned them out, they rode in palkis and were clever artisans. They are still rather clever at smelting and working iron.\n\nAs some of the beads I have found are still unpierced, although shaped and polished, it would appear that they were being manufactured where they are now found.\n\nFrom all these considerations I am inclined to believe that the present Assurs are really descendants of the people who made the beads and used the coins, though it is quite possible that they learnt their art from Greek settlers.\n\nI believe similar stone beads have been found in various parts of India, and I should feel much obliged if you could let me know what is the opinion of antiquarians concerning them, and if it is not possible that they might have been used as money, words or numbers, by people who did not know how to write.\n\nI believe there has not been found any written character which can be attributed to the Kols, who are undoubtedly the most ancient settlers of India.\n\nBabu Sarat Chandra Das exhibited some Tibetan,* Sanskrit-Tibetan,\u2020 and Nepalese\u2021 MSS. in which the much discussed word \"Eko-tibh\u00e2va\" occurred with a dental \"t\" and a long \"i\"; and made the following remarks: \"Dr. Mitra has said (vide p. 176, Proceedings of\n\n* A Tibetan Dictionary written in Tibetan characters.\n\u2020 A Sanskrit-Tibetan Dictionary written in a form of the Deva-N\u00e2gari character and Tibetan.\n\u2021 \"Dasa Bhumisvara\" a Nepalese MS. obtained from Nepal by B.

Pandit Harimohan Vidy\u00e2bhusan, Librarian of the Oriental section, assures me that this is the copy which has been noticed by Dr. Mitra.)\nthis Society, No. VII, July last) \"some extracts from the Tibetan and Sanskrit works he has procured from Lhasa would have been most welcome to us. In questions of this kind ancient records are of infinitely greater use than the cogitations of modern scholars.\" Gentlemen, if you be disposed to consider these MSS. which I now submit for examination, as old and genuine, the etymology of this Buddhist term will, I hope, be definitely settled; for in all these MSS. which are obtained from different places, by different persons, at different times, the word occurs with a dental t and a long \"i.\" Among these MSS. you will find Csoma's MSS. Glossary of Tibetan technical terms in English in which the word \"Ekotibh\u0101va\" is clearly written with a dental \"t\" and a long \"i.\" If, according to Dr. Mitra and his friend Babu P. C. Ghosha, there exists no means to write the Sanskrit \u090f\u0915\u094b\u091f\u093f\u092c\u094d\u0939\u093e\u0935 in Tibetan, how could Csoma in his transliteration of a chapter of the Tangyur write the word with a long \"i\"? Csoma's Glossary is about 50 years old, and it is in his own handwriting. With regard to Dr. Mitra's assertion of the long \"i\", I would refer you to p. 20 of Csoma's Tibetan Grammar where, under the heading \"Alphabetical scheme of the Sanskrit language when written in Tibetan characters,\" you will find a long \"i\" (\u090f\u0915\u094b\u091f\u093f\u092c\u094d\u0939\u093e\u0935) written as \u090f\u0915\u094b\u091f\u093f\u092c\u094d\u0939\u093e\u0935.\n\nThe Philological Secretary exhibited to the meeting a curious old brass vase, belonging to Dr. Geoffrey C. Hall, Superintendent of the Central Prison in Allahabad. It had been found some few years ago in the District of Mirzapur, buried in an old temple. It was in the form of a small jug (see Plate IV), about 3 inches high, with two figures attached on opposite sides, forming supporters. One of the figures was represented standing, holding a fan in its right hand; the other was seated, having a spoon in its right hand, and a pan in the left.\n\nBabu Sarat Chandra Das, explained that the vase, of bell metal, was a miniature representation of an incense-burner, such as are set up in Nepalese temples. They are of very large size, about 4 feet high, and are served by Nepalese monks of the Tantrik school who wear locks. Two of the latter are represented in the act of serving the miniature burner. One holds a spoon in his right hand to put incense into the burner from a pan which is in his left hand. The other holds a fan to blow the glowing mass in the burner.\n\nThe following papers were read.\u2014\n1. \u00c9tudes sur les Arachnides de l'Asie m\u00e9ridionale, faisant partie des collections de l'Indian Museum (Calcutta).

Br\u00fchl, Esq.: Rajshahye College.\n\nFirst Paper.\n\nPreliminary Experiments.\n\nResins, bitter principles, and colouring matters form those groups of naturally occurring compounds the knowledge of which is yet in a rather rudimentary and therefore unsatisfactory state. Chemists have not yet discovered the key to the secret of the constitution of most of those compounds; and as long as this key is not found, an investigation of them must be destitute of that attraction which attaches itself to experiments on those groups of compounds which can be made the subject of a well-planned series of experiments. For there being comparatively little to guide the experimenter in his researches, the latter must be of a more or less tentative character, and the time and labour spent in such researches are not unfrequently disproportionate to the results obtained. As, however, resins as well as bitter principles and colouring matter are of considerable interest to the student of vegetable physiology, a thorough investigation of these somewhat heterogeneous groups of compounds is highly desirable; and India, as a tropical country, might be expected to offer a fair field to the investigator.\n\nAmong the Indian resins about which comparatively little is known to the chemist, the resin of Cannabis indica deserves to be specially mentioned. When we remember the peculiar intoxicating effects of ganja and the valuable medicinal properties of the extract and tincture of Cannabis indica, we should feel rather astonished at the scantiness of the information one can obtain from books and periodicals with reference to the ingredients and active principles of ganja, churrus, and bhang, if it were not for the high price of these substances, which makes a full investigation of them a rather expensive business.\n\nThe following is an account, interspersed with a few historical notes, of a number of qualitative experiments chiefly undertaken with the object of obtaining some data which might come of use in a more extensive series of experiments on Cannabis indica.\n\nPreparation.\u2014A method of preparing the resin from ganja has been devised by T. and H. Smith. The subject was also taken up by G. Martins, who in the year 1855 wrote a dissertation entitled: 'Studien \u00fcber den Hanf.' He prepared the resin from the Extractum Cannabis\nindic\u00e6 spirituoseum, and found it easily soluble in alcohol, ether, and essential oils, but only little soluble in dilute solutions of alkalis and acids. I have prepared a small quantity of the resin according to Martins' method; but I find that the latter is liable to entail some loss.\n\nPhysical properties.\u2014As many resinous substances have been proved to be mixtures of several resins by the judicious use of different solvents, I have studied the action of different solvents on the resin of Cannabis indica, and I have found it soluble in carbon disulphide, methylic, ethylic, butyric, and amylc alcohols, in acetic, benzoic, and camphoric ethers, further in methyl nitrate, trichloronitromethane, ethene dichloride, ether, oil of turpentine, benzene, toluene, and naphthalene dichloride. In all these liquids the resin dissolves easily and completely with the formation of brown solutions. It appears from these experiments that the pure resin of Cannabis indica, that is to say, the resinous substance remaining after the removal of colouring matters and essential oils, must be regarded as a homogeneous substance.\n\nAs in the case of other resins, an emulsion is formed when water is added to the alcoholic solution. Whilst, however, ether completely extracts the resin when shaken up with this emulsion; benzene, toluene, and mineral naphtha are not able to do so. A convenient mode of preparing the resin in a state of purity might, perhaps, be based on this observation.\n\nMartins describes the taste of the resin as extremely bitter. I find that if taken in small lumps, especially after treating it for a length of time with boiling water, it appears at first to be nearly tasteless, but produces afterwards a grating sensation in the throat. If, however, swallowed in a state of fine subdivision, which can be obtained by one or two drops of the alcoholic solution being poured into say twenty cubic centimeters of water; or when evaporated in alcoholic solution with milk-sugar under constant stirring, it is very bitter indeed and leaves a peculiarly nasty after-taste.\n\nIf ganja be cohabated with alcohol, the distillate, especially that obtained on heating the substance with alcohol to the boiling point of the latter in a retort connected with a Liebig's condenser and a receiver and allowing it to stand for some time when only a small quantity of alcohol passes over, is of a greenish colour and has a nauseous odour. The aqueous and dilute sulphuric acid extracts of ganja also have a sickening smell, especially when allowed to stand for a short time. This smell is evidently due to the volatile oil contained in ganja, which was found by Personne to consist of two hydrocarbons, called by him Cannabene and Cannabene hydride respectively, the latter being a crystallizable solid, whilst the former is a colourless liquid, causing giddiness and headache. According to Martins, 'the narcotic effects\nof Hashish are due to hemp-resin'; whilst Personne ascribes them to Cannabene.\n\nPhysiological Action.\u2014This leads us to the physiological action of the resin. In the 'Chemisches Centralblatt' of 1886 occurs a short note on 'Cannabinon', which is described as a balsamo-resinous substance prepared in a state of purity by E. Merk in Darmstadt. This 'Cannabinon', evidently identical with the resin which forms the subject of this paper, is there said to be soluble in alcohol, ether, chloroform, carbon disulphide, amylic alcohol, benzol, volatile and fixed oils. 0\u00b71 gram is dispensed with one gram of ground roasted coffee. It is said to be an hypnotic, inducing a quiet sleep. According to some observers no evil after-effects have been observed, whilst according to others the administration of the drug causes vomiting, giddiness, trembling, etc. It is stated in the note that 'Cannabinon' must not be confounded with 'Tetanin', which produces the hemp-intoxication. The tetanin here mentioned is probably identical with one of the constituents of the essential oil of Cannabis indica; but as the term tetanin has been applied to one of the Ptomaines, it will be preferable to use the terms introduced by Personne. I have tried an experiment on myself with the following results:\n\nAt 8\u00b730 a.m. swallowed a dose of 0\u00b712 grams of the freshly prepared resin mixed with milk-sugar; at 10 a.m. drowsiness came on; slight nausea and headache; at 10\u00b730 a.m. gone to bed; lying for some time in a half-waking state; a certain amount of nervousness and great tendency to magnify sounds; (the calling-out of a little girl developed into a fearful, sustained wail, which caused me to jump out of bed in great alarm; the crackling of the straw in the mattress was magnified into the patter of hail); sleep rather disturbed; fully awake again at 4 p.m.; giddiness, nausea, slight headache, dulness and disinclination to think, on the whole a feeling very much like sea-sickness, alleviated by a walk in the fresh air and by taking a cup of tea. It remains to be seen whether these evil after-effects can be avoided by continued treatment of the resin with boiling water. On the whole the effects of the drug on different persons appear to differ considerably.* It does not appear to be perfectly settled whether this difference solely is due to differences in race, climate, etc., or to slight differences in the composition of the drug. The question can be definitely settled only by carefully isolating the constituents of ganja and testing the physiological effects of each by a series of experiments. At one time it was thought possible that some of the\n\n* See Lauder Brunton, Pharmacology, page 1027; Ringer's Therapeutics, page 561 and ff.\nphysiological effects of ganja might be due to the presence of an alkaloid. Dragendorff,* in dealing with the opium alkaloids, remarks that our knowledge of the active principles of *Cannabis indica* can hardly be said to be complete, and states that at his suggestion Mr. Masig examined Hashish and Herba *Cannabis indica* for alkaloids without any positive result. I have performed three collateral series of experiments in order to ascertain whether traces of an alkaloid can be detected in tolerably fresh ganja. The available ganja was divided into three portions; the one was macerated for about seven hours in dilute acetic acid (2 cc. of glacial acetic acid to 98 cc. of water); the other two were digested twice with very dilute sulphuric acid at a temperature of from 40\u00b0 to 50\u00b0 C for about three hours each time, and the brown liquid was filtered after pressing out the ganja. To one of these two portions four times its own volume of absolute alcohol was added; the other was concentrated by being heated to about 50\u00b0 C for some hours, while a current of dry air was passed through it; and after concentration it was mixed with four times its own volume of absolute alcohol. On addition of the alcohol the liquid became turbid and a sediment was soon formed. After standing for 36 hours the liquid was cooled by means of a refrigerating mixture and filtered. The course pursued further on was, on the whole, that recommended by Dragendorff,\u2020 excepting that the petroleum-naphtha at my disposal, having its boiling-point above 70\u00b0 C, could not be used for the purpose. The results of the three series of experiments were identical. The benzene extract from the acid solutions left a yellow, oily, strongly smelling residue, when evaporated on watch-glasses; the oily liquid, when gently heated, lost its disagreeable smell, being at the same time converted into a soft resinous substance; it consisted therefore of a mixture of the essential oil and the resin of ganja, which was already proved by Martins to be slightly soluble in dilute acids. The acid chloroform extracts yielded some long and slender, colourless, microscopical crystals, but in too small a quantity to allow of their identification; on applying the usual tests, however, it was easy to prove the absence of any distinct alkaloidal reaction. On addition of ammonia to the acid solution, after having been agitated once more with benzene, a slight precipitate was formed, which was seen under the microscope to consist of stellar groups of badly developed crystals, which did not react like alkaloids. Neither the benzene and chloroform, nor the amyllic alcohol and the last chloroform extracts\n\n---\n\n* Dragendorff, Die gerichtlich-chemische Ausmittlung von Giften, 2nd ed., page 240.\n\u2020 Loc. cit., pages 141\u2014153.\nfrom the alkaline solutions left any residue that might have been mistaken for an alkaloid. I can therefore confirm the results of Mr. Masig's experiments, according to which ganja does not contain any alkaloid.\n\nChemical behaviour. Action of acids.\u2014It has been already observed that the resin is slightly soluble in dilute acids. As some resinous substances belong to the group of glucosides, the resin of *Cannabis indica* was treated for some time with boiling dilute sulphuric acid, and the resulting liquid tested for glucose in the usual way. No glucose was found to have been formed; from which it appears that the resin of *Cannabis indica* is no glucoside.\n\nConcentrated sulphuric acid easily dissolves the resin at the common temperature to form a brown solution; a drop of this solution poured into a few cubic centimeters of water causes a pale-yellow turbidity.\n\nWhen treated with a mixture of equal volumes of nitric (spec. gr. = 1\u00b741) and sulphuric acids (spec. gr. = 1\u00b781), the resin swells up and a somewhat violent reaction sets in; the mixture becomes hot; a dark brown solution is formed; and when the quantity of the acid mixture used is not too great, a brownish-black friable mass floats on the surface. This mass is scarcely soluble in pure water, but easily dissolves in alcohol and in a hot solution of sodic carbonate, in the latter case forming a dark-brown solution, which when evaporated leaves an amorphous residue, and when treated with dilute hydrochloric acid gives an amorphous brown precipitate, whilst dilute acetic acid produces apparently no change. The substance therefore behaves very much like some humic acids; it contains, however, nitrogen, inasmuch as it evolves vapours having an offensive smell and a strongly alkaline reaction, when subjected to dry distillation.\n\nNitric acid of specific gravity 1\u00b741 acts only slowly on the resin at the common temperature, but more rapidly at the boiling-point; whilst nitric acid of specific gravity 1\u00b750 acts violently on the resin even at the common temperature, forming a reddish-brown solution, in which the addition of water causes the formation of a flocculent amorphous precipitate. The product of the action of the nitric acid on the resin has, however, been already studied by Bolas and Francis*), who prepared a nitro-derivative of the resin, to which they gave the name Oxycannabin; according to them it is a colourless crystalline substance and has a composition expressed by the formula C\u2082\u2080H\u2082\u2080O\u2087\n\nAction of nascent hydrogen.\u2014Two portions of the resin were exposed to the action of nascent hydrogen, evolved in the one case from\n\n* See Neues Handw\u00f6rterbuch der Chemie, vol. II, page 385.\nmagnesium filings and dilute sulphuric acid, in the other case from sodium amalgam and water.\n\nIn either case the resin hardly changed in appearance. It was washed with water, dissolved in alcohol, the solution filtered, and the alcohol driven off. The residue exactly resembled the original resin; caustic potash solution did not act on it at the common temperature; nitric and sulphuric acids dissolved it to form brown solutions, etc. Hence it appears that the resin is not acted upon by nascent hydrogen.\n\nAction of halogens.\u2014In order to study the action of chlorine on the resin, the latter was made up with finely powdered potassic chlorate into small pellets, which were thrown, one by one, into hydrochloric acid of specific gravity 1\u00b715. The pellets soon began to swell up and to assume an orange yellow colour. Some more hydrochloric acid and powdered potassic chlorate was added from time to time; and finally the resulting mass was rubbed up in a mortar together with fresh quantities of the acid and salt, until the colour of the product had become a uniform orange-yellow. It was then washed with a large quantity of hot water and the residue dissolved in benzene, in which potassium chloride and chlorate are insoluble. The benzene was next distilled off; the residue consisted of a reddish-brown mass, somewhat adhesive at the common temperature and still more so when gently heated. It was found to be easily soluble in alcohol, ether, acetone, ethyl, acetate, benzene. When heated on a piece of platinum foil, it melts, then evolves white fumes, and finally disappears without leaving any residue. On application of the exceedingly delicate test recommended by Beilstein in his Handbuch der organischen Chemie, the substance was found to contain chlorine. It is therefore a Chloro-derivative of the resin of Cannabis indica.\n\nThe alcoholic solution of this chlorine-compound gives an emulsion with water. An alcoholic solution of silver nitrate, which is reduced by the resin itself on standing for a short time, gives no precipitate with a similar solution of the chloro-derivative at the common temperature; but when heated to the boiling-point, a white precipitate comes down, soluble in ammonia, whilst the liquid assumes a brown colour.\n\nAn aqueous solution of potassic hydroxide dissolves the chloro-derivative, slowly at the common temperature, more rapidly when heated. Treated with a solution of caustic potash in absolute alcohol it dissolves rapidly to form a dark-brown solution, which gives, of course no precipitate with water. A current of carbonic anhydride was next passed for some time through the alkaline solution, and the liquid was filtered off from the precipitate of potassic carbonate due to an excess of the alkali used. A portion of the solution, which had still an alka-\nline reaction, was evaporated and ignited in a platinum crucible, when a residue was left. This was dissolved in dilute hydrochloric acid and a drop of this solution was mixed with a drop of platinic chloride on a glass slide, when the characteristic octahedra and three-rayed groups of potassic platinichloride made their appearance under the microscope. Hydrochloric acid causes a turbidity in the alkaline solution of the chloro-derivative; the precipitate proves itself amorphous under the microscope. Precipitates are formed, when aqueous solutions of calcic chloride, magnesic chloride, cupric chloride, silver nitrate, ferric chloride, platinic chloride are added to the aqueous or dilute alcoholic solution of the potassium compound of the chloro-derivative. All these precipitates are soluble in alcohol and are therefore not formed, when alcoholic solutions of the above-mentioned salts are added to an alcoholic solution of the potassium compound. As result of the preceding investigation it may therefore be stated that the resin of Cannabis indica is acted upon by Chlorine, a chloro-derivative being produced, which has decidedly acid properties, forming with most metals amorphous compounds insoluble in water, but soluble in alcohol.\n\nBromine also acts on the resin. When alcoholic solutions of the resin and of bromine are mixed and the resulting mixture is poured into water, a sulphur yellow precipitate comes down, which by the aid of the microscope is seen to be granular-amorphous. It dissolves in alcohol, ether, ethyl acetate, and benzene to form yellow or orange-yellow solutions. In the solid state it forms an orange-yellow resinoid substance, hardly soluble in an aqueous solution of caustic potash. When rubbed up with cupric oxide and tested before the blow-pipe, it gives the bromine-reaction. Hence bromine acts on the resin with the formation of a bromo-derivative.\n\nAction of caustic alkalis. A number of experiments were also performed with a view to study the action on the resin of potassic and sodic hydroxides in aqueous and alcoholic solutions as well as in the solid state, and at different temperatures. The want of sufficient materials, however, have prevented me hitherto from arriving at definite results.\n\nThe following paper on the subject will contain an account of qualitative and quantitative experiments concerning the products of the action of halogens on the resin as well as the products of the dry distillation of the resin per se and with potassic and sodic hydroxides, whilst the constituents of the essential oil of Cannabis indica as well as the colouring matter of ganja will occupy my attention, as soon as time and circumstances permit.\n4. *Materials for a literary history of Hindustan.*\u2014By G.

Communicated by The Hon'ble\nMahendralal Sarkar, M.D., C.I.E.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThe object of the author in the present memoir, has been to bring\ntogether a number of theorems and methods in Plane Analytic Geo-\nmetry which have accumulated in his hands during his study of that\nsubject; some of the easier of these propositions have already been\ngiven in the author's Lectures on Analytic Geometry, now in course\nof delivery at the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science;\na few have been published elsewhere without demonstration; most of\nthe theorems, however, are here given for the first time. The paper\nnow printed contains the first thirty-two sections of the memoir, which,\nwhen completed, will, in addition to the sections now printed, contain\ntheorems on Elliptic Coordinates, Elliptic Inversion, and other ana-\nlogous subjects. The first section is introductory, and contains a\nstatement of the object of the memoir, and a very brief outline of the\nprincipal topics discussed. The second section is devoted to a con-\nsideration of the notions which lie at the basis of analytical geometry;\nthe relation between analysis and geometry is pointed out, as well as\ntwo fundamental ideas which made possible the existence of analytical\ngeometry; the terms Translation-transformation, Rotation-transforma-\ntion and Compound-transformation, which are freely used later on, are\nhere explained for the first time. Sections three to five are devoted\nto the right line. In the third section is obtained the Cartesian equa-\ntion of the line at infinity, which is used in the theory of asymptotes\ngiven in the twelfth section. The fourth section contains a new proof\nof the condition that the general equation of the second degree may\nrepresent a pair of right lines; this method has the additional advan-\ntage of furnishing at once the coordinates of the point of intersection\nof the two lines given by the general equation; the term Point-func-\ntion is here first used and defined. The fifth section contains an inves-\ntigation of the area of the triangle formed by any line with a pair of\nlines given by the general equation of the second degree; the le-\nof the intercepted portion of the line, as well as the product of the two sides, is easily found; as an application of the formulae in this section, which are all very compactly expressed in the determinant notation, the area of the parallelogram formed by two lines given by the general equation and two others drawn parallel to them through the origin, is found. In the two following sections, some properties of the circle are discussed; the sixth section shews that the constant term in the equation of a circle represents the square of the tangent drawn from the origin to the circle, whence flow some interesting properties; the seventh section treats of the chords and tangents of circles and conics; the geometric meaning of Professor Burnside's equation is pointed out, and the equation of the tangents, drawn from any point to a conic, is obtained by a process of transformation. The next eight sections contain a systematic discussion of the general equation of the second degree, supplementary to what is given in ordinary text-books. The eighth section contains some preliminary remarks; the ninth section treats of the transformation of the general equation, and introduces the subject of the classification of conics, which is completed in the eleventh section; the term Asymptotic Constant is here introduced and explained. The tenth section gives an elaborate discussion of the invariants and covariants of a single conic; the terms Translation-invariant, Rotation-invariant, and General-invariant are here introduced and explained; some extensions of Dr. Boole's Theorems are given, and the results finally arrived at, are classified and tabulated. In the eleventh section, the lengths of the axes and the area of the conic given by the general equation, are obtained with ease. The twelfth section contains a very satisfactory improvement on the ordinary method of obtaining the equation of the asymptotes of a conic; a modification of this method, as well as some applications, are added. The thirteenth section gives two methods of determining the well-known equation for the eccentricity, and a third method, given later on, is here mentioned. The fourteenth section determines the position and magnitude of the director-circle, both in rectangular and oblique coordinates; and, in the case of the equilateral hyperbola, it is proved to degenerate into the centre of the curve. In the fifteenth section, two methods are given for transforming the general equation, when the asymptotes are taken as lines of reference; the new equation thus obtained is then geometrically interpreted. Sections sixteen to twenty deal with Laplace's Linear Equation to a Conic; the sixteenth section treats of the genesis of the equation; the seventeenth section furnishes the meaning of the constants involved; the\nbetween Laplace's Equation and the Theory of Elliptic Motion; the nineteenth section throws still further light on the matter by a geometric interpretation and a reference to Gauss's Characteristic Equation; the twentieth section shews how the equation for the eccentricity may be obtained from Laplace's Equation. The twenty-first section primarily deals with the area of the triangle formed by two tangents drawn from any point to a conic and the line joining their points of contact; the length of the chord of contact is also found; numerous interesting applications of the formulae are added; thus, the area of the quadrilateral formed by two tangents and the two central radii-vectores to the points of contact, is calculated; and, finally the very interesting theorem is established that any point is outside a conic, on the curve, or inside it, according as the point-function is positive, zero or negative.\n\nThe next two sections treat of the inclinations of tangents to conics; the twenty-second section gives a very general theorem connecting the inclinations of any two tangents to a conic and of the chord of contact, to any line, while the twenty-third section gives some geometrical applications, which clearly bring out the correlation between some properties of the circle and the ellipse. The twenty-fourth section furnishes a method of generating similar conics; the case of the equilateral hyperbola is shewn to be a limiting case, in a very peculiar and special sense. In the twenty-fifth section, it is proved, as an illustration of the general theory of envelopes, that the envelopes of the sides of an equilateral triangle inscribed in any given triangle, are three parabolas, which are connected by some very neat geometrical relations.\n\nThe twenty-sixth section deals with the reciprocals of central conics, and, it is shewn that the second focal pedal of a conic is the inverse of a conic. The twenty-seventh section treats of the reciprocal polars of evolutes of a family of curves which include conics as a very particular case; the formulae are finally extended to the case of any curve, and, it is shewn that if the coordinates of a point on the primitive curve can be expressed by means of a single variable parameter, the coordinates of the corresponding point on the reciprocal polar of the evolute may be similarly expressed; the analytical theorems obtained in this section are of very great generality, and some of them, of beautiful symmetry. The twenty-eighth section gives various miscellaneous properties of the ellipse, while the twenty-ninth section is concerned with two theorems on plane confocals. The next two sections deal with the parabola; the thirtieth section solves a purely dynamical problem, which is applied in the thirty-first section to obtain some beautiful properties of the parabola, relating to the sum of the squares of the reciprocals of the radii-vectores of the pedals of that curve.\nThe thirty-second section discusses the locus of the middle point of the polar-chord of a conic with respect to points situated on any curve; and, at the end of this section, the method of Elliptic Inversion is mentioned. This completes the analysis of the memoir, so far as it is at present ready for publication.\n\nThe paper will be published in full in Part II of the Journal for 1887.\n\n---\n\n**Library.**\n\nThe following additions have been made to the Library since the Meeting held in August last.\n\n---\n\n**Transactions, Proceedings and Journals,**\n\n*presented by the respective Societies and Editors.*\n\nAmsterdam.

T. Atkinson, Esq., C.S., President, in the Chair.\n\nThe following members were present:\nBabu Gaurd\u00e1s Bais\u00e1k, H. Beveridge, Esq., Babu Saratchandra D\u00e1s, C.I.E., E. Gay, Esq., Dr. Hoernle, A. Hogg, Esq., E. J. Jones, Esq., Dr. W. King, Rev. Fr. E. Lafont, S.J., C.I.E., C.S.

Pope, Esq., Pandit Harapras\u00e1d S\u00e1stri, Maulavi Ghol\u00e1m Sarwar, D. Waldie, Esq.\n\nThe minutes of the last meeting were read and confirmed.\n\nEighty-nine presentations were announced, as detailed in the appended Library List.\n\nThe following gentlemen have expressed a wish to withdraw from the Society:\n\nJ. R. Napier, Esq.\nLt.-Col. W. E. Gowan.\n\nThe Secretary reported the death of the following Member of the Society:\n\nBabu R\u00e1kh\u00e1l D\u00e1s H\u00e1ld\u00e1r.\n\nThe President announced that the Council had sanctioned the following works for publication in the Bibliotheca Indica:\n\n1. The commentary on the Ny\u00e1yavindu, by Dharmostar\u00e1ch\u00e1rya, to be edited by Professor Peterson, of Bombay.\n\nIt is in contemplation to print the Tibetan text of the work pari passu with the Sanskrit, and Professor Peterson has been asked how the arrangement can be best carried out.\n2. The translation of the Ain-i-Akbari, by Lt.-Col. Jarrett, from where it was left off by the late Mr. Blochmann.\n\n3. The Ri\u00e1z-us-Sal\u00e1t\u00edn, or the Garden of Kings, Persian text and English translation. By Maulvi Abdul Haq Abid, Professor of Arabic and Persian in the Calcutta Madrasah College.\n\n4. The Brihaddharmapur\u00e1na, one of the principal Upapur\u00e1anas, to be edited by Pandit Hara Pras\u00e1d S\u00e1stri.\n\n5. The Bodhisattv\u00e1vad\u00e1na Kalpalat\u00e1, by Kshemendra, to be edited by Babu Sarat Chandra D\u00e1s.\n\nWith regard to the Bodhisattv\u00e1vad\u00e1na Kalpalat\u00e1, Pandit Hara Pras\u00e1d S\u00e1stri remarked as follows:\n\nThe three copies of the Bodhisattv\u00e1vad\u00e1na Kalpalat\u00e1 which we have in Cambridge and in Calcutta are incomplete. They contain, so to say, only the second volume of the work, i.e., from 50 to 108th Pallava.\n\nAt the end of the colophon, in Add. 913, Cambridge Library, the scribe declares that the first half of the work is lost and could not be found anywhere.*\n\nIn noticing an old manuscript of the same work in the Asiatic Society's Library Dr. Rajendral\u00e1l Mitra says that \"the codex under notice is obviously incomplete as it commences from the 51st chapter or pallava. It appears, however, from the presence of an invocatory verse at the beginning of the chapter and the absence of all such invocation at the beginning of subsequent chapters that the work was divided into two parts, of which the first included 50 chapters and the second 58.\"\n\nFrom the similarity of names one might at first be inclined to infer that the Bodhisattv\u00e1vad\u00e1na Kalpalat\u00e1 is the sequel of another work called the Bodhisattv\u00e1vad\u00e1na, but the following facts show that those two works are quite distinct.\n\nIn Add. 1306, Cambridge Library, a palm leaf manuscript copied in the reign of Anantamalla of Nepal in, N. S. 422, A. D. 1302, we get for the first time a glimpse of the existence of the first part of the work. The first 174 leaves of that manuscript are lost and the 175th leaf begins with the middle of the 41st Avad\u00e1na and continues to the end of the 49th and then begins the second half. The entire manuscript was in existence in 1302 and since then the first volume has been missing.\n\nFurther there is a metrical list appended at the end of the manuscript in the Society's Library which gives the names and contents of the avad\u00e1nas of the first volume. On examination, I find that, with one exception, all the names mentioned in that list agree with the names\n\n* \u090f\u0924\u0924\u094d \u091c\u094d\u091e\u0947\u092f\u0938\u094d\u0915\u0928\u094d\u0924-\u0935\u0926\u094d\u0935\u0932\u092e\u094d\u092c\u0924\u0915\u092a\u094d\u0930\u092f\u0936\u094d\u091a \u092a\u0930\u093e\u091c\u093f\u0924\u0947\u0928\u0964 \u092a\u0942\u0930\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0947 \u0915\u0941\u0937\u094d\u0920\u093f\u0924\u0903 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u093e\u092a\u094d\u0924\u0903\u0964\nof the avad\u0101nas, as given in the copy of the work brought from Tibet by B\u00e1b\u00fa Sarat Chandra D\u00e1s. The single exception is, that the B\u00e1b\u00fa\u2019s Tibetan MS. substitutes an avad\u0101na, called Garbhakr\u00e1nti, for the avad\u0101na of the metrical list which is called Shaddanta.\n\nSince therefore among 50 avad\u0101nas there is only a difference of one name, the identity of the Tibetan manuscript with the lost work may be said to be complete. To B\u00e1b\u00fa Sarat Chandra D\u00e1s, is due the credit of recovering an ancient and valuable work which was given up for lost in India for about six hundred years.\n\nIn editing the second volume of the work B\u00e1b\u00fa Sarat Chandra will have the benefit, besides the block-print and the Tibetan translation, which he has brought from Lhasa, of the three manuscripts in the Libraries of Cambridge and Calcutta. But in editing the first volume he will have to depend entirely on the excellent and very carefully executed block-print and the Tibetan translation. I shall of course be always ready to render him any assistance that lies in my power in editing the Sanskrit portion of this valuable work, which may be considered as a store-house of Buddhist legends of the Mah\u00e1y\u00e1na school, as the Mah\u00e1vastu is a store-house of those of the Mah\u00e1sanghik\u00e1s. The work is written in easy flowing verse and in simple poetic and idiomatic Sanscrit. It is entirely free from that verbosity and tediousness of narration which characterises Buddhist Sanskrit works in general, a circumstance which may be accounted for by the fact that, as tradition informs us, the Kalpalat\u00e1 was composed by a Brahmanic Sanskrit scholar, at the request of his Buddhist friends. B\u00e1b\u00fa Sarat Chandra\u2019s edition of Kalpalat\u00e1 will not only be a valuable contribution to the Buddhist Sanskrit Literature, but will be a great help to scholars desirous of studying the Tibetan language, because they will be able to learn it through the medium of Sanskrit.\n\nThe work will be published with the Sanskrit and Tibetan texts in juxta-position.\n\nThe following extract from a letter from Professor Max M\u00fcller to B\u00e1b\u00fa Sarat Chandra D\u00e1s on the subject of Ekotibh\u00e1va was read\u2014\n\nIt seems to me that your interpretation is right\u2014at all events, it is the best I know. I have taken the liberty to make a few alterations in your quotations from P\u00e1nini\u2019s grammar, so as to enable English readers to understand better what you mean. I have always had great faith in Tibetan translations, and I expect much from that quarter for an elucidation of Buddhist difficulties.\n\nB\u00e1b\u00fa Sarat Chandra D\u00e1s exhibited a curious reed organ, called Ph\u00e9ng, the favourite musical instrument of the Siamese and the people\nof Laos: also an old Tibetan Sanskrit Dictionary, brought from Lhasa, arranged in alphabetical order, and written in the U-m\u00e9, or headless character of Tibet.\n\nThe Rev. Fr. Lafont made the following remarks on the musical instrument exhibited by B\u00e1b\u00fa Sarat Chandra D\u00e1s:\n\nThe Ph\u00e9ng is a free-reed instrument, of very sweet tone and very cleverly made. The fourteen pipes are most carefully tuned to a full natural octave in the middle key and r\u00e9, mi, fa of a treble, with the la and di of a lower tone. The perfect chord do, mi, sol, do, is particularly good, and the two pipes tuned in sol are in perfect unison. It is interesting to see the careful manner in which the length of each pipe is adjusted by deep longitudinal slits, cleverly corrected for pitch by tiny little bits firmly cemented. The performer has only to blow gently through one universal mouth-piece carrying the wind to all the pipes, but allowing only those to speak where the little hole made above the reed is covered by the fingers of the musician. It is difficult to believe that the instrument is the result of pure native Siamese ingenuity, I feel inclined to think that a European musician had a hand in it.\n\nThe following papers were read\u2014\n\n1. A general Theorem on the Differential Equations of Trajectories.\u2014By B\u00e1b\u00fa Asutosh Mukhop\u00e1dhy\u00e1y, M. A., F. R. A. S., F. R. S. E.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nIn a paper on \"The Differential Equation of a Trajectory,\" which has been published in Part II of the Journal for 1887, and an abstract of which has already been given in the present volume,* the author pointed out that Mainardi's complicated solution of the problem of determining the oblique trajectory of a system of confocal ellipses, is equivalent to a pair of remarkably simple equations, which admit of an interesting geometrical interpretation. On re-examining the whole question to see if the very artificial process of Mainardi, by no means less complicated than his result, could be materially simplified, the author has been led to a very general theorem on the differential equations of trajectories, which is established and illustrated in the present paper. The paper is divided into five sections, of which the first is introductory. The second section contains the enunciation and demonstration of the theorem, the chief characteristic of which is the property that whenever the coordinates of a point on any curve can be expressed\n\n* The equations on page 161 are wrongly printed; they should have been\n\n\\[ x = h \\cos \\phi \\cdot \\cosh n (\\lambda + \\phi) \\]\n\\[ y = h \\sin \\phi \\cdot \\sinh n (\\lambda + \\phi) \\]\n\nwhere \\( \\lambda^2 = a^2 - b^2 \\), so that \\( h \\) is half the distance between the foci.\nby means of a single variable parameter, the coordinates of the corresponding point on the oblique trajectory may be similarly expressed. The third section gives the first example where the theorem is applied to the solution of Mainardi's problem. The fourth section contains the next six examples; the second example deals with a system of confocal hyperbolas; the third example considers a system of parabolas which have a common principal axis, and which touch each other at their common vertex; the fourth example treats, in two different ways, of a pencil of coplanar rays radiating from a point; the fifth example is about a system of circles which touch each other at a given point; the sixth example is concerned with a system of parabolas which have a common focus and principal axis; the seventh example considers the case of a certain transcendental curve. The fifth and last section of the paper treats of the application of the theory of Conjugate Functions to the subject under consideration; a new theorem is established which materially simplifies the calculations in many cases, of which three striking examples are given; the eighth example treats of the oblique trajectory of a tricircular sextic; the ninth example considers the inverses of a system of confocal ellipses, while the tenth example deals with a transcendental curve; the results are obtained with remarkable ease by the general theorem of this paper and a judicious use of conjugate functions; but from an inspection of their very form, it is clear that to have obtained the equations of these trajectories by the ordinary process, would have been well-nigh impossible. Lastly, a very interesting method is pointed out by which we may obtain, without any difficulty, an infinite number of curves whose oblique trajectories may be determined with ease by the theorems and methods of this paper.*\n\nThe paper will be published in full in Part II, of the Journal for 1887.\n\n2.
