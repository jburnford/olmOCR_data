Orientalists are greatly indebted to the Sayyid for his disinterested labours, but his text seems to have been made from a single and defective MS. and is often incorrect, especially in the case of proper names. I have collated it with the excellent MSS. in the India Office and the British Museum, and have thus been able to make numerous corrections. I have also consulted the MS. in the Library of the R.A.S., but it is not a good one. I have, with Mr. Rogers's permission, revised the translation, and I have added many notes.\n\nThere is an account of the Memoirs in the sixth volume of Elliot & Dowson's \"History of India,\" and there the subject of the various recensions is discussed. There is also a valuable note by Dr. Rieu in his \"Catalogue of Persian MSS.,\" i, 253. It is there pointed out that there is a manuscript translation of the first nine years of the Memoirs by William Erskine in the British Museum. I have consulted this translation and found it helpful. The MS. is numbered Add. 26,611. The translation is, of course, excellent, and it was made from a good MS.\n\nA translation of what Dr. Rieu calls the garbled Memoirs of Jah\u0101ng\u012br was made by Major David Price and published by the Oriental Translation Committee of the Royal Asiatic Society in 1829. The author of this work is unknown, and its history is an unsolved problem. It is occasionally fuller than the genuine Memoirs, and it contains some picturesque touches, such as the account\nof Akbar's deathbed. But it is certain that it is, in part at least, a fabrication, and that it contains statements which Jah\u0101ng\u012br could never have made. Compare, for instance, the account of the death of Sohr\u0101b, the son of M\u012brz\u0101 Rustam, near the end of Price's translation, pp. 138\u20139, with that given in the genuine Memoirs in the narrative of the fifteenth year of the reign, p. 293, and also in the Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, p. 139. Besides being inaccurate, the garbled or spurious Memoirs are much shorter than the genuine work, and do not go beyond the fifteenth year. Price's translation, too, was made from a single and badly written MS.\u00b9 which is now in the R.A.S. Library.\n\nDr. Rieu remarks that it is to be regretted that so poor a fabrication as the garbled Memoirs should have been given to the world as a genuine production of Jah\u0101ng\u012br. This being so, it is appropriate that the present translation of the genuine Memoirs should be published by the Royal Asiatic Society.\n\nWhen Jah\u0101ng\u012br had written his Memoirs for the first twelve years of his reign he made them into a volume, and had a number of copies made and distributed (Elliot, vi, 360). The first of these he gave to Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n, who was then in high favour. The present publication is a translation of the first volume of the Memoirs, but the translation of the whole Memoirs, together with the additions of Mu'tamad Kh\u0101n and Mu\u1e25ammad H\u0101d\u012b, has been completed, and it is to be hoped that its publication will follow in due course.\n\nJah\u0101ng\u012br reigned for twenty-two years, but ill-health and sorrow made him give up the writing of his Memoirs in the seventeenth year of his reign (see Elliot, vi, 280). He then entrusted the task to Mu'tamad Kh\u0101n, the author\n\n\u00b9 It is owing to the crabbed writing of Price's MS. that at p. 21 Jah\u0101ng\u012br is made to say that the Prince of Kashmir belonged to the society of Jogis. The real statement is that the prince belonged to the Chak family.\nof the Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, who continued the Memoirs to the beginning of the nineteenth year. He then dropped writing the Memoirs in the name of the emperor, but he continued the narrative of the reign, to Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u2019s death, in his own work, the Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma. Mu\u1e25ammad H\u0101d\u012b afterwards continued the Memoirs down to Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u2019s death, but his work is little more than an abridgment of the Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma. Sayyid Al\u1e25mad\u2019s edition contains the continuations of the Memoirs by Mu\u02bftamad and Mu\u1e25ammad H\u0101d\u012b, and also Mu\u1e25ammad H\u0101d\u012b\u2019s preface and introduction. But this preface and introduction have not been translated by Mr. Rogers, and I do not think that a translation is necessary. Mu\u1e25ammad H\u0101d\u012b is a late writer (see Elliot, vi, 392), his date being the first quarter of the eighteenth century, and his introduction seems to be almost wholly derived from the Ma\u02bf\u0101\u1e63ir-i-Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u012b of K\u0101mg\u0101r \u1e24usain\u012b (Elliot, vi, 257). It consists mainly of an account of Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u2019s life from his birth up to his accession.\n\nIt is perhaps unnecessary to say anything about the importance of Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u2019s Memoirs. They give a lively picture of India in the early decades of the seventeenth century, and are a valuable supplement to the Akbar-n\u0101ma. I may be allowed, however, to end this preface with the following remarks which I contributed to the Indian Magazine for May, 1907:\n\n\u201cThe Royal authors of the East had more blood in them than those kings whose works have been catalogued by Horace Walpole. To find a parallel to them we must go back to Julius C\u00e6sar, and even then the advantage is not upon the side of Europe. After all, the commentaries of the famous Roman are a little disappointing, and certainly the Memoirs of B\u0101bar and Jah\u0101ng\u012br are far more human and fuller of matter than the story of the Gallic Wars. All Mu\u1e25ammadans have a fancy for writing chronicles and autobiographies, and several Mu\u1e25ammadan\nkings have yielded to the common impulse. Central Asia has given us the Memoirs of Tamarlane, B\u0101bar, and Haidar, and the chronicle of Abu-l-ghazi; Persia has given us the Memoirs of Shah Tahmasp, and India the Memoirs of the Princess Gulbadan and Jah\u0101ng\u012br. In modern times we see the same impulse at work, for we have the biography of the late Ameer of Afghanistan and the diary of the Shah of Persia.\n\n\"The contributions to literature by Royal authors which come to us from the East form a department by themselves, and one which is of great value. Nearly all Eastern histories are disfigured by adulation. Even when the author has had no special reason for flattery and for suppression of truth, he has been dazzled by the greatness of his subject, and gives us a picture which no more reveals the real king than does a telescope the real constitution of the Morning Star. But when Eastern monarchs give us chronicles, the case is different. They have no occasion for fear or favour, and mercilessly expose the failings of their contemporaries. Not that they are to be trusted any more than other Orientals when speaking of themselves. B\u0101bar has suppressed the story of his vassalage to Shah Isma\u2018il, of his defeat at Ghajdaw\u0101n, and his treatment of \u2018\u0100lam Lodi; and Jah\u0101ng\u012br has glossed over his rebellion against his father, and the circumstances of Shir-\u0101fgan\u2019s death. But when they have to speak of others\u2014whether kings or nobles\u2014they give us the whole truth, and perhaps a little more. An amiable Princess like Gulbadan Begam may veil the faults and weaknesses of her brothers Hum\u0101y\u016bn and Hind\u0101l; but B\u0101bar strips the gilt off nearly every one whom he mentions, and spares no one\u2014not even his own father.\n\n\"The Memoirs of B\u0101bar, Haidar, and Gulbadan have been translated into English, and those of Tahmasp have been translated into German; but unfortunately Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u2019s\nhave never been fully translated,\\(^1\\) though there are extracts in Elliot & Dowson's History, and Major Price many years ago gave us from an imperfect manuscript a garbled account of a few years of his Memoirs. Yet in reality Jah\u0101ng\u012br's Memoirs are not inferior in interest to those of B\u0101bar. Indeed, we may go further and say there is twice as much matter in them as in B\u0101bar's Memoirs, and that they are by far the most entertaining of the two works. Not that Jah\u0101ng\u012br was by any means as remarkable a man as his great-grandfather. He was a most faulty human being, and his own account of himself often excites our disgust and contempt. But he had the sense not to confine his narrative to an account of himself, and he has given us a picture of his father, the great Akbar, which is a bigger 'plum' than anything in B\u0101bar's Memoirs. But his account of himself has also its charm, for it reveals the real man, and so he lives for us in his Memoirs just as James VI\u2014to whom, and to the Emperor Claudius, he bears a strange and even ludicrous resemblance\u2014lives in the 'Fortunes of Nigel' or Claudius in Suetonius and Tacitus. Jah\u0101ng\u012br was indeed a strange mixture. The man who could stand by and see men flayed alive, and who, as he himself tells us, put one man to death and had two others hamstrung because they showed themselves inopportunely and frightened away his game, could yet be a lover of justice and could spend his Thursday evenings in holding high converse. He could quote Fird\u016bsi's verse against cruelty to animals\u2014\n\n'Ah! spare yon emmet, rich in hoarded grain\u2014\nHe lives with pleasure, and he dies with pain';\n\nand be soft-hearted enough to wish that his father were alive to share with him the delicious mangoes of India. He could procure the murder of Abu-l-fa\u017cl and avow\n\n\\(^1\\) A translation was begun by the Rev. Mr. Lowe for the Asiatic Society of Bengal, but only one fasciculus was published. This was in 1889.\nthe fact without remorse, and also pity the royal elephants because they shivered in winter when they sprinkled themselves with cold water. 'I observed this,' he says, 'and so I ordered that the water should be heated to the temperature of luke-warm milk.' And he adds: 'This was entirely my own idea; nobody had ever thought of it before.' One good trait in Jah\u0101ng\u012br was his hearty enjoyment of Nature and his love for flowers. B\u0101bar had this also, but he was old, or at least worn out, when he came to India, and he was disgusted by an Indian attempt to poison him, and so his description of India is meagre and splenetic. Jah\u0101ng\u012br, on the other hand, is a true Indian, and dwells delightedly on the charms of Indian flowers, particularises the pal\u0101s, the bok\u016bl, and the champa, and avows that no fruit of Afghanistan or Central Asia is equal to the mango. He loved, too, to converse with pandits and Hindu ascetics, though he is contemptuous of their avatars, and causes the image of Vishnu as the boar avatar to be broken and flung into the Pushkar lake.\n\n\"It is a remark of Hallam's that the best attribute of Muhammadan princes is a rigorous justice in chastising the offences of others. Of this quality Jah\u0101ng\u012br, in spite of all his weaknesses, had a large share, and even to this day he is spoken of with respect by Muhammadans on account of his love of justice. It is a pathetic circumstance that it was this princely quality which was to some extent the cause of the great affront put upon him by Mah\u0101bat Kh\u0101n. Many complaints had been made to Jah\u0101ng\u012br of the oppressions of Mah\u0101bat in Bengal, and crowds of suppliants had come to Jah\u0101ng\u012br's camp. It was his desire to give them redress and to punish Mah\u0101bat for his exactions, together with his physical and mental weakness, which led to his capture on the banks of the Jhilam.\n\n\"One of the many interesting observations in his Memoirs\nis his account of an inscription he saw at Hindaun. He says that in the thirteenth year of his reign, as he was marching back to Agra, he found a verse by someone inscribed on the pillar of a pleasure-house on an islet in the lake at Hindaun. He then proceeds to quote it, and it turns out to be one of Omar Khayyam's! This is FitzGerald's paraphrase:\n\n'For some we loved, the loveliest and the best\nThat from his vintage Time hath prest,\nHave drunk their Cup a Round or two before,\nAnd one by one crept silently to rest.'\n\n\"The same quatrain has also been quoted by Baday\u016bn\u012b in his history, and the interesting thing about Jah\u0101ng\u012br's quotation of it is that he could see the beauty of the verse and at the same time did not know who was the author. There is also an interest in the fact that the third line contains a different reading from that given in Whinfield's edition of the text. Hindaun is in the Jaipur territory, and one would like to know if the inscription still exists.\n\n\"Among other things in Jah\u0101ng\u012br's Memoirs there is the description of the outbreak of the Plague, given to him by a lady of his court [which has been quoted by Dr. Simpson in his book upon Plague], and there is a very full account of Kashmir, which is considerably superior to that in the Ayin Akbari, which Sir Walter Lawrence has praised.\"\n\nWith reference to the portrait of Jah\u0101ng\u012br prefixed to this volume, it may be interesting to note that it appears from Mr. E. B. Havell's \"Indian Sculpture,\" p. 203, that the British Museum possesses a drawing by Rembrandt which was copied from a Moghul miniature, and which has been pronounced by Mr. Rouffaer to be a portrait of Jah\u0101ng\u012br. Coryat (Purchas, reprint, iv, 473) thus describes Jah\u0101ng\u012br's personal appearance:\u2014\"He is fifty and three years of age, his nativity-day having been celebrated with wonderful pomp since my arrival here. On that day he weighed himself in a pair of golden scales, which by great\nchance I saw the same day; a custom he observes most inviolably every year. He is of complextion neither white nor black, but of a middle betwixt them. I know not how to express it with a more expressive and significant epitheton than olive. An olive colour his face presenteth. He is of a seemly composition of body, of a stature little unequal (as I guess not without grounds of probability) to mine, but much more corpulent than myself.\"\n\nAs regards the bibliography of the T\u016bzuk-i-Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u012b, I have to note that there is an Urdu translation by Munsh\u012b Ahmad \u2018Ali Sim\u0101b of R\u0101mp\u016bra, that is, Aligarh in Tonk. It was made from Mu\u1e25ammad \u1e24\u0101di\u2019s edition under the patronage of Mu\u1e25ammad Ibr\u0101h\u012bm \u2018Ali Kh\u0101n Naw\u0101b of Tonk, and was published by Newal Kishor in 1291 (1874). There is also a Hindi translation by Munsh\u012b Debi Prasad which was published in 1905 at Calcutta by the Bh\u0101rat Mitra Press. The Urdu translation referred to by Mr. Blumhardt in his Catalogue of Hindustani MSS., p. 61, and noticed by Elliot, vi, 401, and Garcin de Tassy, iii, 301, is, as the two latter writers have remarked, a translation of the Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma. The MS. referred to by Elliot, vi, 277, as having been in the possession of General Thomas Paterson Smith, and which is described in Eth\u00e9\u2019s Catalogue of the India Office MSS., No. 2833, p. 1533, was made by Sayyid Mu\u1e25ammad, the elder brother of Sayyid Ahmad. As the end of the MS. the copyist gives some account of himself and of his family. He made the copy from copies in the Royal Library and in the possession of Rajah Rogh\u016b N\u0101th Singh alias L\u0101l Singh J\u0101lp\u016br. He finished it in October, 1843. Sayyid Mu\u1e25ammad was Munsif of Hutg\u0101m in the Fathp\u016br district. He died young in 1845. My friend Mr. T. W. Arnold, of the India Office, informs me that Sayyid Ahmad told him that he found a valuable illustrated MS. of the T\u016bzuk in the d\u00e9bris of the Delhi Royal Library, and took it home, but that it was lost when his house was plundered.\nby the mutineers. There is in the Bodleian a copy in Sayyid Ahmad\u2019s own handwriting. He states that he made use of ten good MSS. The Englishman at whose request he made the copy was John Panton Gubbins, who was once Sessions Judge of Delhi. This copy is described in the Bodleian Catalogue, p. 117, No. 221. The MS. No. 220 described on the same page was brought home by Fraser, and is a good one, but only goes down to the end of the 14th year.\n\nH. BEVERIDGE.\n\nMarch, 1909.\n\nPostscript.\u2014Since writing this Preface I have been enabled by the kindness of Mr. Irvine to examine the Hindi Jah\u0101ng\u012br-n\u0101ma of Debi Prasad. It is not a translation, but an abstract, and I do not think it is of much value. Being a Jodhpur man he has been able, perhaps, to correct some spellings of places, but he does not seem to have consulted any MSS., and when he comes to a difficulty he shirks it. The most valuable adjunct to the T\u016bzuk, after the Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, is the Ma\u2019\u0101\u0161ir-i-Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u012b of K\u0101mg\u0101r Husain\u012b. It is important as giving the early history of Jah\u0101ng\u012br, that is, of the time when he was Prince Selim. There are three copies of his work in the British Museum, but the so-called Ma\u0101thir-i-Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u012b of the India Office Library, No. 3098, or 324 of the new Catalogue, is only a copy of the Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma.\n\nI regret that the number of Errata and Addenda is so large, but when I began the revision I did not know that Sayyid Ahmad\u2019s text was so incorrect. It will be seen that at pp. 158 and 162 I have made two erroneous notes.\n\nH. B.\nI am writing to express my deep concern regarding the current situation in our community. The recent increase in crime rates has been alarming, and I believe it is essential that we take immediate action to address this issue.\n\nAs a member of the local council, I have been actively engaged in discussions with various stakeholders to find solutions. However, I am aware that this problem requires a comprehensive approach involving law enforcement, community leaders, and citizens alike.\n\nI urge everyone to come together and contribute their ideas and efforts towards creating a safer environment for all residents. Together, we can make a significant impact and ensure that our community thrives.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Name]\nJAH\u0100NG\u012aR'S MEMOIRS.\n\nIn the Name of God, the Merciful, the Clement.\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nBY the boundless favour of Allah, when one sidereal hour of Thursday, Jum\u0101d\u0101-\u1e63-\u1e63\u0101n\u012b 20th, A.H. 1014 (October 24th, 1605), had passed, I ascended the royal throne in the capital of Agra, in the 38th year of my age.\u00b9\n\nTill he was 28 years old, no child of my father had lived, and he was continually praying for the survival of a son to dervishes and recluses, by whom spiritual approach to the throne of Allah is obtained. As the great master, Khw\u0101ja Mu\u2018inu-d-d\u012bn Chisht\u012b, was the fountain-head of most of the saints of India, he considered that in order to obtain this object he should have recourse to his blessed threshold, and resolved within himself that if Almighty God should bestow a son on him he would, by way of complete humility, go on foot from Agra to his\n\n\u00b9 That is, he was 37 years 3 months by the lunar calendar, and 36 years 1 month by solar reckoning (P\u0101dsh\u0101h-n\u0101ma, i, 69). Elliot and all the MSS. have 8th Jum\u0101d\u0101-\u1e63-\u1e63\u0101n\u012b as the date of the accession, but this is clearly wrong, as Akbar did not die till 13th Jum\u0101d\u0101-\u1e63-\u1e63\u0101n\u012b. Evidently the copyists have, as is so often the case, misread bi\u1e63tam as ha\u1e63\u1e6dam. See Blochmann's remark, p. 454, note 3. That Jah\u0101ng\u012br was not at this time 38 is shown by his stating at p. 37 that he celebrated his 38th birthday at Lahore after the capture of Khusrau.\nblessed mausoleum, a distance of 140 kos. In A.H. 977, on Wednesday, 17th Rabi\u2018u-l-awwal (August 31st, 1569), when seven ghar\u012b of the aforesaid day had passed, when Libra (Miz\u0101n) had risen to the 24th degree, God Almighty brought me into existence from the hiding-place of nothingness. At the time when my venerated father was on the outlook for a son, a dervish of the name of Shaikh Salim, a man of ecstatic condition, who had traversed many of the stages of life, had his abode on a hill near Sikr\u012b, one of the villages of Agra, and the people of that neighbourhood had complete trust in him. As my father was very submissive to dervishes, he also visited him. One day, when waiting on him and in a state of distraction, he asked him how many sons he should have. The Shaikh replied, \u201cThe Giver who gives without being asked will bestow three sons on you.\u201d My father said, \u201cI have made a vow that, casting my first son on the skirt of your favour, I will make your friendship and kindness his protector and preserver.\u201d The Shaikh accepted this idea, and said, \u201cI congratulate you, and I will give him my own name.\u201d When my mother came near the time of her delivery, he (Akbar) sent her to the Shaikh\u2019s house that I might be born there. After my birth they gave me the name of Sultan Salim, but I never heard my father, whether in his cups or in his sober moments, call me Muhammad Salim or Sultan Salim, but always Shaikh\u016b B\u0101b\u0101. My revered father, considering the village of Sikr\u012b, which was the place of my birth, lucky for him, made it his capital. In the course of fourteen or fifteen years that hill, full of wild beasts, became a city containing all kinds of gardens and buildings, and lofty, elegant edifices and pleasant places, attractive to the heart. After the conquest of Gujar\u0101t this village was named Fathp\u016br. When I became king it occurred to me to change my name, because this resembled that of the Emperor of R\u016bm. An inspiration from the hidden world brought it into my mind\nthat, inasmuch as the business of kings is the controlling of the world, I should give myself the name of Jah\u0101ng\u012br (World-seizer) and make my title of honour (laqab) N\u016bru-d-d\u012bn, inasmuch as my sitting on the throne coincided with the rising and shining on the earth of the great light (the Sun). I had also heard, in the days when I was a prince, from Indian sages, that after the expiration of the reign and life of King Jal\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn Akbar one named N\u016bru-d-d\u012bn would be administrator of the affairs of the State. Therefore I gave myself the name and appellation of N\u016bru-d-d\u012bn Jah\u0101ng\u012br P\u0101dsh\u0101h. As this great event took place in Agra, it is necessary that some account of that city should be given.\n\nAgra is one of the grand old cities of Hindustan. It had formerly an old fort on the bank of the Jumna, but this my father threw down before my birth, and he founded a fort of cut red stone, the like of which those who have travelled over the world cannot point out. It was completed in the space of fifteen or sixteen years. It had four gates and two sally-ports, and its cost was 35 lakhs of rupees, equal to 115,000 tom\u0101n of current Persian coinage and to 10,500,000 kh\u0101n\u012b according to the T\u016br\u0101n reckoning. The habitable part of the city extends on both sides of the river. On its west side, which has the greater population, its circumference is seven kos and its breadth is one kos. The circumference of the inhabited part on the other side of the water, the side towards the east, is $2\\frac{1}{2}$ kos, its length being one kos and its breadth half a kos. But in the number of its buildings it is equal to several cities of \u2018Ir\u0101q, Khur\u0101s\u0101n, and M\u0101war\u0101\u2019-n-nahr (Transoxiana) put together. Many persons have erected buildings of three or four storeys in it. The mass of people is so great, that moving about in the lanes and bazars is difficult. It is on the boundary of the second climate. On its east is the province of Qanauj; on the west, N\u0101gor; on the north, Sambhal; and on the south, Chander\u012b.\n\nIt is written in the books of the Hindus that the source\nof the Jumna is in a hill of the name of Kalind,\\(^1\\) which men cannot reach because of the excessive cold. The apparent source is a hill near the pargana of Khizr\u0101b\u0101d.\n\nThe air of Agra is warm and dry; physicians say that it depresses the spirits (\\(r\u016b\u1e25r\u0101 ba ta\u1e25l\u012bl mibarad\\)) and induces weakness. It is unsuited to most temperaments, except to the phlegmatic and melancholy, which are safe from its bad effects. For this reason animals of this constitution and temperament, such as the elephant, the buffalo, and others, thrive in its climate.\n\nBefore the rule of the Lod\u012b Afghans, Agra was a great and populous place, and had a castle described by Mas\u02bf\u016bd b. Sa\u02bfd b. Salm\u0101n in the ode (\\(qas\u012bda\\)) which he wrote in praise of Ma\u1e25m\u016bd, son of Sultan Ibr\u0101h\u012bm, son of Mas\u02bf\u016bd, son of Sultan Ma\u1e25m\u016bd of Ghazn\u012b, on the capture of the castle\u2014\n\n\"The fort of Agra appeared in the midst of the dust\nLike a mountain, and its battlements like peaks.\"\\(^2\\)\n\nWhen Sikandar Lodi designed to take Gwalior he came to Agra from Delhi, which was the capital of the Sultans of India, and settled down there. From that date the population and prosperity of Agra increased, and it became the capital of the Sultans of Delhi. When God Almighty bestowed the rule of India on this illustrious family, the late king, B\u0101bar, after the defeat of Ibr\u0101h\u012bm, the son of Sikandar Lodi, and his being killed, and after his victory over R\u0101n\u0101 S\u0101\u1e45g\u0101, who was the chief of the Rajas of Hindustan, established on the east side of the Jumna, on improved land, a garden (\\(ch\u0101rb\u0101gh\\)) which few places equal in beauty. He gave it the name of Gul-afsh\u0101n\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The Sanskrit Kalinda.\n\n\\(^2\\) The couplet appears in Mas\u02bf\u016bd\u2019s divan, B.M. MS. Egerton, 701, p. 142a, line 4. The preceding lines show that the dust (\\(gard\\)) referred to in the first line means the dust caused by the invading army. I take the words \\(bar\u016b b\u0101rh\u0101\u012b\\) to mean the battlements or pinnacles of the fortress, the \u012b at the end of \\(b\u0101rh\u0101\\) being intensive.\n(Flower-scatterer), and erected in it a small building of cut red stone, and having completed a mosque on one side of it he intended to make a lofty building, but time failed him and his design was never carried into execution.\n\nIn these Memoirs, whenever \u0160\u0101h\u012bb qir\u0101n\u012b is written it refers to Am\u012br Tim\u016br G\u016brg\u0101n; and whenever Fird\u016bs-mak\u0101n\u012b is mentioned, to B\u0101bar P\u0101dsh\u0101h; when Jannat-\u0101shy\u0101n\u012b is used, to Hum\u0101y\u016bn P\u0101dsh\u0101h; and when \u2018Arsh-\u0101shy\u0101n\u012b is employed, to my revered father, Jal\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn Muhammad Akbar P\u0101dsh\u0101h Gh\u0101z\u012b.\n\nMelons, mangoes, and other fruits grow well in Agra and its neighbourhood. Of all fruits I am very fond of mangoes. In the reign of my father (\u2018Arsh-\u0101shy\u0101n\u012b) many fruits of other countries, which till then were not to be had in India, were obtained there. Several sorts of grapes, such as the s\u0101hib\u012b and the \u1e25abshi\u00b9 and the kishmishi, became common in several towns; for instance, in the bazars of Lahore every kind and variety that may be desired can be had in the grape season. Among fruits, one which they call anan\u0101s (pineapple), which is grown in the Frank ports,\u00b2 is of excessive fragrance and fine flavour. Many thousands are produced every year now in the Gul-afsh\u0101n garden at Agra.\n\nFrom the excellencies of its sweet-scented flowers one may prefer the fragrances of India to those of the flowers of the whole world. It has many such that nothing in the whole world can be compared to them. The first is the champa (Michelia champaca), which is a flower of exceedingly sweet fragrance; it has the shape of the saffron-flower, but is yellow inclining to white. The tree is very symmetrical\n\n\u00b9 Erskine\u2019s manuscript translation of the T\u016bzuk-i-Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u012b, B.M. MS. Add. 26,611, and the B.M. MS. have chin\u012b, not \u1e25abshi. But I.O. MS. No. 181 and the R.A.S. MS. have husain\u012b, and this seems right. See Memoirs, Leyden & Erskine, p. 326, and the Haidarabad Turk\u012b text, p. 284. The kishmishi is a small grape like that of which currants are made.\n\n\u00b2 Cf. infra the account of the 11th year, p. 173.\nand large, full of branches and leaves, and is shady. When in flower one tree will perfume a garden. Surpassing this is the keor\u0101\u00b9 flower (Pandanus odoratissimus). Its shape and appearance are singular, and its scent is so strong and penetrating that it does not yield to the odour of musk. Another is the r\u0101e bel,\u00b2 which in scent resembles white jessamine. Its flowers are double and treble (?). Another is the m\u016blsari\u00b3 (Mimusops Elengi). This tree, too, is very graceful and symmetrical, and is shady. The scent of its flowers is very pleasant. Another is the ketk\u012b\u2074 (Pandanus ?), which is of the nature of the keor\u0101, but the latter is thorny, whereas the ketk\u012b has no thorns. Moreover, the ketk\u012b is yellowish, whereas the keor\u0101 is white. From these two flowers and also from the chambeli\u2075 (Jasminum grandiflorum), which is the white jessamine of wil\u0101yat (Persia or Afghanistan), they extract sweet-scented oils. There are other flowers too numerous to mention. Of trees there are the cypress (sarw), the pine\n\n\u00b9 See Memoirs, L. & E., p. 330.\n\u00b2 The name r\u0101e bel is not given in Clarke's Roxburgh, but perhaps it is one of the jessamines, and may be the bela of Clarke (p. 30). The r\u0101e bel is described by Abu-l-fazl (Blochmann, pp. 76 and 82). The statement about its flowers being double and treble is obscure. Erskine renders the passage \"The leaves are generally two and three fold.\" The Persian word is \u1e6dabaqa, which apparently is equivalent to the t\u016b\u012b or fold of the \u0100yin-i-Akbar\u012b, Persian text, i, 96. The reference may be to the flowers growing in umbels.\n\u00b3 This is the bokul of Indian gardens (Clarke, p. 313), and well deserves Jah\u0101ng\u012br's praise. It is probably the bhols\u0101ri mentioned in the \u0100yin (Blochmann, No. 10, p. 83). Blochmann gives bholsir\u012b (p. 70) as the name of a fruit-tree, and the bhols\u0101ri of p. 83 may be a mistake for m\u016blsari.\n\u2074 The text has sewt\u012b, but the sewt\u012b seems to be the Rosa glandulifera of Roxburgh (Clarke, p. 407) and has no resemblance to the Pandanus. See also the description of the sewt\u012b, Blochmann, p. 82. (Perhaps there are two sewt\u012bs, one famous for fragrance, the other for beauty. See l.c., pp. 76 and 82.) What is meant in the text is evidently a Pandanus and the ketk\u012b of Blochmann, p. 83. I have followed, therefore, I.O. MS. 181, and have substituted ketk\u012b for sewt\u012b. The ketk\u012b may be Pandanus inermis, which has no thorns (Clarke, p. 708). Erskine also has ketk\u012b.\n\u2075 L.c., p. 33 et seq.\n(san\u016bbar), the chan\u0101r (Platanus orientalis), the white poplar (saf\u012bd\u0101r, Populus alba), and the b\u012bd mull\u0101 (willow), which they had formerly never thought of in Hindustan, but are now plentiful. The sandal-tree, which once was peculiar to the islands (i.e., Java, Sumatra, etc.), also flourishes in the gardens.\n\nThe inhabitants of Agra exert themselves greatly in the acquirement of crafts and the search after learning. Various professors of every religion and creed have taken up their abode in the city.\n\nAfter my accession, the first order that I gave was for the fastening up of the Chain of Justice, so that if those engaged in the administration of justice should delay or practise hypocrisy in the matter of those seeking justice, the oppressed might come to this chain and shake it so that its noise might attract attention. Its fashion was this: I ordered them to make a chain of pure gold,\\(^1\\) 30 gaz in length and containing 60 bells. Its weight was 4 Indian maunds, equal to 42 \u2018Ir\u0101q\u012b maunds. One end of it they made fast to the battlements of the Sh\u0101h Burj of the fort at Agra and the other to a stone post fixed on the bank of the river. I also gave twelve orders to be observed as rules of conduct (dast\u016bru-l-\u2018amal) in all my dominions\u2014\n\n(1) Forbidding the levy of cesses under the names of tamgh\u0101 and mir bahri (river tolls), and other burdens which the j\u0101gird\u0101rs of every province and district had imposed for their own profit.\n\n(2) On roads where thefts and robberies took place, which roads might be at a little distance from habitations, the\n\n\\(^1\\) Du Jarric, who got his information from missionary reports, seems to imply that the chain was of silver, and says that Jah\u0101ng\u012br was following the idea of an old Persian king. It is mentioned in the Siyar al-muta\u2019akhkhir\u012bn (reprint, i, 230) that Mu\u1e25ammad Sh\u0101h in 1721 revived this, and hung a long chain with a bell attached to it from the octagon tower which looked towards the river.\nj\u0101g\u012brd\u0101rs of the neighbourhood should build sar\u0101\u2019\u012bs (public rest-houses), mosques, and dig wells, which might stimulate population, and people might settle down in those sar\u0101\u2019\u012bs. If these should be near a kh\u0101l\u012b\u1e63a estate (under direct State management), the administrator (muta\u1e63add\u012b) of that place should execute the work.\n\n1 (3) The bales of merchants should not be opened on the roads without informing them and obtaining their leave.\n\n(4) In my dominions if anyone, whether unbeliever or Musalman, should die, his property and effects should be left for his heirs, and no one should interfere with them. If he should have no heir, they should appoint inspectors and separate guardians to guard the property, so that its value might be expended in lawful expenditure, such as the building of mosques and sar\u0101\u2019\u012bs, the repair of broken bridges, and the digging of tanks and wells.\n\n(5) They should not make wine or rice-spirit (darbahra)\u00b2 or any kind of intoxicating drug, or sell them; although I myself drink wine, and from the age of 18 years up till now, when I am 38, have persisted in it. When I first took a liking to drinking I sometimes took as much as twenty cups of double-distilled spirit; when by degrees it acquired a great influence over me I endeavoured to lessen the quantity, and in the period of seven years I have brought myself from fifteen cups to five or six. My times for drinking were varied; sometimes when three or four sidereal hours of the day remained I would begin to drink, and sometimes at night and partly by day. This went on till I was 30 years old. After that I took to drinking always at night. Now I drink only to digest my food.\n\n\u00b3 (6) They should not take possession of any person\u2019s house.\n\n\u00b9 In text this is wrongly made part of regulation 2.\n\u00b2 Gladwin and the MSS. have dilbahra (exhilarating drink), and this is probably correct. Jah\u0101ng\u012br would know little about rice-spirit.\n\u00b3 This regulation is more fully expounded in Price, p. 7.\n(7) I forbade the cutting off the nose or ears of any person, and I myself made a vow by the throne of God that I would not blemish anyone by this punishment.\n\n(8) I gave an order that the officials of the Crown lands and the j\u0101g\u012brd\u0101rs should not forcibly take the ryots\u2019 lands and cultivate them on their own account.\n\n(9) A government collector or a j\u0101g\u012brd\u0101r should not without permission intermarry with the people of the pargana in which he might be.\n\n(10) They should found hospitals in the great cities, and appoint physicians for the healing of the sick; whatever the expenditure might be, should be given from the kh\u0101li\u1e63a establishment.\n\n(11) In accordance with the regulations of my revered father, I ordered that each year from the 18th\\(^1\\) of Rab\u012b\u02bfu-l-awwal, which is my birthday, for a number of days corresponding to the years of my life, they should not slaughter animals (for food). Two days in each week were also forbidden, one of them Thursday, the day of my accession, and the other Sunday, the day of my father\u2019s birth. He held this day in great esteem on this account, and because it was dedicated to the Sun, and also because it was the day on which the Creation began. Therefore it was one of the days on which there was no killing in his dominions.\\(^2\\)\n\n(12) I gave a general order that the offices and j\u0101g\u012brs of my father\u2019s servants should remain as they were. Later, the man\u1e63abs (ranks or offices) were increased according to\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) It is curious that Jah\u0101ng\u012br should give the 18th Rab\u012b\u02bfu-l-awwal as his birthday, while the authorities give it as the 17th. Probably the mistake has arisen from Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u2019s writing Rab\u012b\u02bfu-l-awwal instead of Shahr\u012bwar. His birthday was Rashn the 18th day of Shahr\u012bwar (see Akbarn\u0101ma, ii, 344), but it was the 17th Rab\u012b\u02bfu-l-awwal. See Muhammad H\u0101di\u2019s preface, p. 2, and Beale, and Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u2019s own statement a few lines above. Possibly Jah\u0101ng\u012br wished to make out that he was born on the 18th Rab\u012b\u02bfu-l-awwal and a Thursday, because he regarded Thursday as a blessed day (mub\u0101rak shamba), whilst he regarded Wednesday as peculiarly unlucky, and called it kam, or gam, shamba.\n\n\\(^2\\) Cf. Elliot\u2019s translation, vi, 513, and note 2.\neach one's circumstances by not less than 20 per cent. to 300 or 400 per cent. The subsistence money of the *ah\u0101dis* was increased by 50 per cent., and I raised the pay of all domestics by 20 per cent. I increased the allowances of all the veiled ladies of my father's harem from 20 per cent. to 100 per cent., according to their condition and relationship. By one stroke of the pen I confirmed the subsistence lands\u00b9 of the holders of *aimas* (charity lands) within the dominions, who form the army of prayer, according to the deeds in their possession. I gave an order to Mir\u0101n \u1e62adr Jah\u0101n, who is one of the genuine Sayyids of India, and who for a long time held the high office of *\u1e63adr* (ecclesiastical officer) under my father, that he should every day produce before me deserving people (worthy of charity).\u00b2 I released all criminals who had been confined and imprisoned for a long time in the forts and prisons.\u00b3\n\nAt a propitious hour I ordered that they should coin gold and silver of different weights. To each coin I gave a separate name, viz., to the *muhr* of 100 *tola*, that of *n\u016br-sh\u0101h\u012b*; to that of 50 *tola*, that of *n\u016br-sult\u0101n\u012b*; to that of 20 *tola*, *n\u016br-daulat*; to that of 10 *tola*, *n\u016br-karam*; to that of 5 *tola*, *n\u016br-mihr*; and to that of 1 *tola*,\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 The MSS. have \"the subsistence lands of people in general (*ah\u0101li*) and the *aimas*.\"\n\n\u00b2 In the text and in Elliot, vi, 515, this is made a separate order, but it is not so in the MSS. If it were, we should have thirteen instead of twelve regulations. This is avoided in text and in Elliot by putting the 6th and 7th regulations into one ordinance. With regard to the regulation about releasing the prisoners, Sir Henry Elliot is somewhat unjust to Jah\u0101ng\u012br in his commentary at p. 515. It was only those who had been *long* imprisoned whom Jah\u0101ng\u012br released, and his proceedings at Ranthambhor in the 13th year (T\u016bzuk, p. 256) show that he exercised discrimination in releasing prisoners. The account in Price, p. 10, may also be consulted. There Jah\u0101ng\u012br says he released 7,000 men from Gwalior alone. It may be remembered that most of these were political offenders. Private criminals were for the most part put to death, or mutilated, or fined. There were no regular jails.\n\n\u00b3 The above translation of the Institutes should be compared with Sir Henry Elliot's translation and his commentary: History of India, E. & D., vol. vi, Appendix, p. 493.\nn\u016br-jah\u0101n\u012b. The half of this I called n\u016br\u0101n\u012b, and the quarter, raw\u0101j\u012b. With regard to the silver coins (sikkas), I gave to the coin of 100 tola the name of kaukab-i-t\u0101l\u012b\u2018 (star of horoscope); to that of 50 tola, the name of kaukab-i-iqb\u0101l (star of fortune); to that of 20 tola, the name of kaukab-i-mur\u0101d (star of desire); to that of 10 tola, the name of kaukab-i-bakht (star of good luck); to that of 5 tola, the name of kaukab-i-sa\u2019d (star of auspiciousness); to that of 1 tola, the name of jah\u0101ng\u012br\u012b. The half jah\u0101ng\u012br\u012b I called sult\u0101n\u012b; the quarter, ni\u1e63\u0101r\u012b\u00b9 (showering money); the dime, khair-i-qab\u016bl (the acceptable). Copper, also, I coined in the same proportions, and gave each division a particular name. I ordered that on the gold muhr of 100, 50, 20, and 10 tola the following verse by \u0100\u1e63af Kh\u0101n\u00b2 should be impressed \u2014 namely, on the obverse was this couplet:\n\n\u201cFate\u2019s pen wrote on the coin in letters of light,\nThe Sh\u0101h N\u016bru-d-d\u012bn Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u201d;\n\nand between the lines of the verse the Creed (Kalima) was impressed. On the reverse was this couplet, in which the date of coinage was signified:\n\n\u201cThrough this coin is the world brightened as by the sun,\nAnd the date thereof is \u2018Sun of Dominion\u2019 (\u0100ft\u0101b-i-Mamlakat).\u201d\u00b3\n\nBetween the lines of the verse, the mint, the Hijra year, and the regnal year were impressed. On the n\u016br-jah\u0101n\u012b, which is in the place of the ordinary gold muhr and exceeds it in weight by 20 per cent. (as 12 to 10), is impressed this couplet of the Am\u012bru-l-umar\u0101:\n\n\u201cSh\u0101h N\u016bru-d-d\u012bn Jah\u0101ng\u012br ibn Akbar P\u0101dsh\u0101h\nMade gold\u2019s face bright with the sheen of sun and moon.\u201d\n\n\u00b9 Erskine\u2019s MS. has \u1e6b\u1e63\u0101r\u012b for ni\u1e63\u0101r\u012b, and akhtar-i-qab\u016bl instead of khair-i-qab\u016bl.\n\u00b2 This is Blochmann\u2019s \u0100\u1e63af Kh\u0101n No. iii, viz.

(1605).\nAccordingly, a hemistich was impressed on each face, and also the mint, and the Hijra and regnal year. The *jah\u0101ng\u012br\u012b sikka*, also, which is greater in weight by 20 per cent., was reckoned as equal to a rupee, its weight being fixed in the same manner as that of the *n\u016br-jah\u0101n\u012b* (each was a *tola* in weight, but one was in gold and the other was in silver). The weight of a *tola* is $2\\frac{1}{2}$ *misq\u0101ls* of Persia and T\u016br\u0101n.\\(^1\\)\n\nIt would not be good to give all the versified chronograms which were made for my accession.

The words S\u0101\u1e25\u012bb-Qir\u0101n-i-\u1e62\u0101n\u012b yield only 1013 according to *abjad*, and this is a year too little. But the verse states that Prosperity (or Fortune), Iqb\u0101l, laid his head at the second lord of conjunction's feet, and the head of Iqb\u0101l, according to the parlance of chronogram-composers, is the first letter of the word, that is, alif, which stands for one (1) in *abjad*, and so the date 1014 is made up. S\u0101\u1e25\u012bb-Qir\u0101n-i-\u1e62\u0101n\u012b means 'the second lord of conjunction,' and is a title generally applied to Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n; the first lord of conjunction (i.e. the conjunction of Jupiter and Venus) was Tim\u016br.\n\n\\(^3\\) A great officer under Hum\u0101y\u016bn and Akbar. See \u0100y\u012bn, Blochmann, p. 317.\nSa'id Kh\u0101n, who was one of the confidential nobles and connected with my father by marriage. His origin was from the Moghul tribe, and his ancestors were in the service of my forefathers. At the time of his taking leave, as it was said that his eunuchs oppressed and tyrannized over the weak and the poor, I sent a message to him that my justice would not put up with oppression from anyone, and that in the scales of equity neither smallness nor greatness was regarded. If after this any cruelty or harshness should be observed on the part of his people, he would receive punishment without favour.\n\nAgain, having previously bestowed on Shaikh Farid Bukh\u0101r\u012b, who had been Mir Bakhsh\u012b in my father's service, a dress of honour, a jewelled sword, a jewelled inkstand and pen, I confirmed him in the same post, and in order to exalt him I said to him, \"I regard thee as S\u0101\u1e25\u012bbu-s-saif-wa-l-qalam\" (\"Captain Sword and Captain Pen\"). Muq\u012bm, to whom my father had given at the end of his reign the title of Waz\u012br Kh\u0101n and the viziership of his dominions, I selected for the same title, rank, and service. I also gave Khw\u0101jag\u012b Fat\u1e25u-llah a dress of honour, and made him a bakhshi, as formerly. 'Abdu-r-Razz\u0101q Ma'm\u016br\u012b, although when I was prince he had left my service without cause or reason and had gone over to my father, I made bakhshi as formerly, and I gave him a dress of honour. To Aminu-d-daula, who when I was prince had the post of bakhshi, and without my leave had run away and taken service with my revered father, not looking to his offences I gave the office\n\n1 Blochmann, p. 331. He had 1,200 eunuchs. He is generally styled Sa'id Chaghatai. The exact nature of his relationship does not appear. It is not mentioned in his biography in the Ma'\u0101\u015fir, ii, 403. Perhaps the word (nisbat) does not here mean affinity by marriage.\n\n2 According to the account in Price, p. 16, and in the Ma'\u0101\u015fir, ii, 405, Sa'id Kh\u0101n gave a bond that if his people were oppressive he would forfeit his head.\n\n3 He does not seem to have had any real power, and he was soon superseded. See Ma'\u0101\u015fir, iii, 932.\nof \u0100tish-i-beg\u012b\u00b9 (Head of the Artillery), which he had held under my father. I left all those who were in possession of posts, both inside and outside, in the positions which they had with my father. Sharif Kh\u0101n\u00b2 had lived with me from his early years. When I was prince I had given him the title of kh\u0101n, and when I left Allahabad to wait upon my honoured father I presented him with a drum and the t\u016bm\u0101n-togh (standard of y\u0101k tails). I had also promoted him to the rank of 2,500 and given him the government of the province of Bihar. I gave him complete control over the province, and sent him off there. On the 4th of Rajab, being fifteen days after my accession, he waited upon me. I was exceedingly pleased at his coming, for his connection with me is such that I look upon him as a brother, a son, a friend, and a companion. As I had perfect confidence in his friendship, intelligence, learning, and acquaintance with affairs, having made him Grand Vizier, I promoted him to the rank of 5,000 with 5,000 horse and the lofty title of Amiru-l-umara, to which no title of my servants is superior. Though his position might have warranted a higher rank, he himself represented to me that until some notable service on his part had become perceptible to me he would not accept a higher grade than that mentioned (5,000).\n\nAs the reality of the loyalty of my father\u2019s servants had not yet become apparent, and certain faults and errors and unbecoming intentions which were not approved at the throne of the Creator or pleasing to His creatures had\n\n\u00b9 It appears from Erskine and from I.O. MS. that this is a mistake for Y\u0101tish-beg\u012b, \u2018Captain of the Watch,\u2019 and that the name is Am\u012bnu-d-d\u012bn, and not Aminu-d-daula. See Akbarn\u0101ma, iii, 474, etc.\n\n\u00b2 Sharif Kh\u0101n had been sent by Akbar to recall Jah\u0101ng\u012br to his duty, but instead of coming back he stayed on. He did not accompany Jah\u0101ng\u012br when the latter went off the second time to wait upon his father. Probably he was afraid to do so. Jah\u0101ng\u012br appointed him to Bihar before he left Allahabad to visit his father for the second time. Jah\u0101ng\u012br says Sharif waited upon him fifteen days after his accession, and on\nshown themselves, they of themselves became ashamed. Though on the day of my accession I had forgiven all offences and determined with myself that I would exact no retribution for past deeds, yet on account of the suspicion that had been aroused in my mind about them I considered the Amiru-l-umar\u0101 my guardian and protector; although God Almighty is the guardian of all His servants, and is especially so of kings, because their existence is the cause of the contentment of the world. His father, \u2018Abdu-\u1e63-\u1e62amad, who in the art of painting had no equal in the age, had obtained from the late king (Jannat-\u0101shy\u0101n\u012b) Hum\u0101y\u016bn the title of Sh\u012br\u012bn-qalam (Sweet pen), and in his council had attained a great dignity and was on intimate terms with him (the king). He was one of the chief men of Sh\u012br\u0101z. My honoured father, on account of his former services, paid him great honour and reverence. I made Raja M\u0101n Singh\u2014who was one of the greatest and most trusted noblemen of my father, and had obtained alliances with this illustrious family, inasmuch as his aunt had been in my father\u2019s house (i.e. was his wife),\u00b9 and I had married his sister, and Khusrau and his sister Sult\u0101nu-n-nis\u0101 Begam, the latter of whom is my eldest child, were born of her\u2014as before, ruler of the province of Bengal. Though as in consequence of certain of his acts he had no expectation of this favour towards himself, I dignified him with a ch\u0101rqab (vest without sleeves) as a robe of honour, a jewelled sword, and\n\n4th Rajab. This is another proof, if proof were needed, that the copyists have misread the opening sentence of the T\u016bzuk and have written hashtam instead of bistam, for 4th Rajab is fifteen days after 20th Jum\u0101d\u0101-l-akhir. The P\u0101dsh\u0101hn\u0101ma and Kh\u0101fi Kh\u0101n have 20th, and Price and Price\u2019s original say that Shar\u012bf arrived sixteen days after the accession.\n\n\u00b9 I.O. MS. 181 and Mu\u1e25ammad H\u0101di have Sult\u0101n Ni\u1e63\u0101r Begam. Kh\u0101fi Kh\u0101n, i, 245, has Sult\u0101n Begam, and says she was born in 994. Price\u2019s Jah\u0101ng\u012br, p. 20, says she was born a year before Khusrau. She built a tomb for herself in the Khusrau B\u0101gh, Allahabad, but she is not buried there (see J.R.A.S. for July, 1907, p. 607). She died on 4th Sha\u02bfb\u0101n, 1056 (5th September, 1646), and was at her own request buried in her grandfather\u2019s tomb at Sikandra (P\u0101dsh\u0101hn\u0101ma, ii, 603\u20134).\none of my own horses, and sent him off to his province, which is a place of (or can keep up) 50,000 horse. His father was Raja Bhagw\u0101n D\u0101s. His grandfather, Raja Bih\u0101r\u012b Mal, was the first of the Kachw\u0101ha Rajputs to have the honour of entering my father\u2019s service, and he excelled his tribe in truth and sincerity of friendship, and in the quality of valour. After my accession, when all the nobles with their retinues presented themselves at my palace, it came into my mind that I should send this body of retainers under my son, Sultan Parwiz, to make a holy war against the R\u0101n\u0101, who was one of evil deeds, and a foul infidel of the country of Hindustan, and in my father\u2019s time had had troops sent constantly against him, but had not been driven off. In a fortunate hour I invested my said son with gorgeous robes of honour, a jewelled waist-sword, a jewelled waist-dagger, and a rosary of pearls intermixed with rubies of great price of the value of 72,000 rupees, \u2018Ir\u0101q and Turkm\u0101n horses and famous elephants, and dismissed him. About 20,000 horsemen with nobles and chief leaders were appointed to this service. The first was \u0100\u1e63af Kh\u0101n, who in my father\u2019s time was one of his confidential servants, and for a long time had been confirmed in the post of bakhshi and afterwards became \u1e0d\u012bw\u0101n ba istiql\u0101l (Chancellor with full powers); him I advanced from the rank of an Amir to that of Vizier, and promoting him from the command of 2,500 horse to that of 5,000 made him guardian to Parwiz. Having honoured him with a robe of honour, jewelled waist-sword, a horse and an elephant, I ordered that all the man\u1e63abd\u0101rs (commanders), small and great, should not depart from such orders as he thought proper to give them. I made \u2018Abdu-r-Razz\u0101q Ma\u2019m\u016br\u012b his bakhshi and Mukht\u0101r Beg, \u0100\u1e63af Kh\u0101n\u2019s paternal uncle, diwan to Parwiz. I also presented to Raja Jagann\u0101th, son of Raja Bih\u0101r\u012b Mal, who had the rank of 5,000, a robe of honour and a jewelled waist-sword.\n\nAgain, I gave R\u0101n\u0101 Shankar, cousin of the R\u0101n\u0101\u2014to\nwhom my father had given the title of R\u0101n\u0101, proposing to send him with Khusrau against the R\u0101n\u0101, but at that time he (Akbar) became a shanqar (a falcon, i.e. he died)\u2014a robe of honour and a jewelled sword, and sent him with him.\n\nI presented M\u0101dho Singh, brother\u2019s son of Raja M\u0101n Singh, and R\u0101wal S\u0101l Darb\u0101ri with flags, from this consideration, that they were always present at Court and belonged to the Sekh\u0101wat\u00b9 R\u0101jp\u016bts, and were confidential servants of my father. Each received also the rank of 3,000.\n\nI promoted Shaikh Ruknu-d-d\u012bn the Afghan, to whom when I was prince I had given the title of Sh\u012br Kh\u0101n, from the grade of 500 to that of 3,500. Sh\u012br Kh\u0101n is the head of his clan and a very valiant man. He lost his arm by the sword in service against the Uzbegs.\u00b2 \u2018Abdu-r-Rahman, son of Shaikh Abu-l-fazl, Mah\u0101 Singh, grandson of R\u0101ja M\u0101n Singh, Z\u0101hid Kh\u0101n, son of \u0160\u0101diq Kh\u0101n, Waz\u012br Jamil, and Qar\u0101 Kh\u0101n Turkm\u0101n were exalted to the rank of 2,000; all these obtained robes of honour and horses, and were dismissed. Manohar also obtained leave to join the expedition. He is of the tribe of the Sekh\u0101wat Kachhw\u0101has, and on him in his young days my father bestowed many favours. He had learned the Persian language, and, although from him up to Adam the power of understanding cannot be attributed to any one of his tribe, he is not without intelligence. He makes Persian verses, and the following is one of his couplets:\u2014\n\n\u201cThe object of shade in Creation is this:\nThat no one place his foot on the light of my Lord, the Sun.\u201d\u00b3\n\n\u00b9 Should be Shaikh\u0101wat.\n\u00b2 The R.A.S. and L.O. MSS. have here Umr\u0101 instead of Uzbegs. Umr\u0101 here stands, I think, for Umr Singh, the R\u0101n\u0101 of Udaipur, and the meaning is that Sh\u012br Kh\u0101n lost his arm in service against the R\u0101n\u0101.\n\u00b3 The point of the verse seems to be that light is regarded as something spread like a carpet on the ground, and that to place the foot upon\nIf the details were to be described of all the commanders and servants appointed by me, with the conditions and connections and rank of each, it would be a long business. Many of my immediate attendants and personal followers and nobles\u2019 sons, house-born ones (kh\u0101naz\u0101d\u0101n) and zealous Rajputs, petitioned to accompany this expedition. A thousand ahadis, the meaning of which is single ones (Blochmann, p. 20), were also appointed. In short, a force was collected together such that if reliance on the Friend (God) were vouchsafed, it could have embarked on enmity and conflict with any one of the monarchs of power.\n\n\u201cSoldiers came up from all sides,\nSeizing life from heroes of the world in battle;\nThey had no fear of death from the sharp sword,\nNo terror of water\\(^1\\) and no flight from fire;\nIn valour singular, in vigour a crowd,\nAnvils in endurance, rocks in attack.\u201d\n\nWhen I was prince I had entrusted, in consequence of my extreme confidence\\(^2\\) in him, my own \u016bz\u016bk seal\\(^3\\) to the Am\u012bru-l-umar\u0101 (Sharif), but when he was sent off to the province of Bihar I made it over to Parwiz. Now that Parwiz went off against the R\u0101n\u0101, I made it over, according to the former arrangement, to the Am\u012bru-l-umar\u0101.\n\nParwiz was born of \u0160\u0101h\u012bb-Jam\u0101l (Mistress of Beauty),\n\nit is to insult the sun. Compare Price, p. 33; but Manohar\u2019s verse is wrongly translated there owing to a badly written MS. For Manohar see Akbarn\u0101ma, iii, 221, and Baday\u016bn\u012b, iii, 201, also Blochmann, p. 494, and his article in Calcutta Review for April, 1871, also the Dabist\u0101n, translation, ii, 53.\n\n\\(^1\\) Probably here \u0101b means both water and the water of the sword.

After several other children had been born to me and had been received into God\u2019s mercy, a daughter was born of Karamsi,\\(^3\\) who belonged to the R\u0101\u1e6dhor clan, and the child received the name of Bih\u0101r B\u0101n\u016b Begam. To Jagat Gos\u0101\u2019\u012bn,\\(^4\\) daughter of the Mota Raja (the fat raja), was born Sul\u1e6d\u0101n Khurram, in the 36th year of my father\u2019s reign, corresponding to A.H. 999,\\(^5\\) in the city of Lahore. His advent made the world joyous (\\textit{khurr\u0101m}),\\(^6\\)\n\n---\n\n1 Text, \\textit{\u1e63ab\u012byya} (daughter), and this led Blochmann (p. 477, note 2) to say that if Sayyid Ahmad\u2019s text was correct Jah\u0101ng\u012br must have forgotten, in the number of his wives, which of them was the mother of Parwiz. As a fact, Sayyid Ahmad\u2019s text is not correct, though the R.A.S. MS. agrees with it. The two excellent I.O. MSS. have \\textit{khw\u012bsh} (relative), which is here equivalent to cousin. So also has the B.M. MS. used by Erskine. According to Muhammad H\u0101di\u2019s preface Parwiz\u2019s mother was the daughter of Khw\u0101ja \u1e24asan, the paternal uncle of Zain Kh\u0101n Koka. His birth was in Mu\u1e25arram, 998, or 19th \u0100b\u0101n (November, 1589). See also Akbarn\u0101ma, iii, 568.\n\n2 I.e., both were Akbar\u2019s foster-brothers.\n\n3 Price, p. 20, has Karmitty, and says the daughter only lived two months. Karamsi appears twice in the Akbarn\u0101ma as the name of a man; see Akbarn\u0101ma, ii, 261, and iii, 201. The name may mean \u2018composed of kindness.\u2019 The statement in Price is wrong. Bih\u0101r B\u0101n\u016b was married to \u1e6cahmuras s. Prince D\u0101niy\u0101l in his 20th year (see T\u016bzuk, M. H\u0101di\u2019s continuation, p. 400). According to M. H\u0101di\u2019s preface, Karamsi was the daughter of R\u0101ja Kesho D\u0101s R\u0101\u1e6dhor, and her daughter Bih\u0101r B\u0101n\u016b was born on 23rd Shahr\u012bwar, 998 (September, 1590). Kesho D\u0101s R\u0101\u1e6dhor is probably the Kesho D\u0101s M\u0101r\u016b of the T\u016bzuk.\n\n4 Best known as Jodh B\u0101\u012b (Blochmann, p. 619).\n\n5 It is extraordinary that Jah\u0101ng\u012br should have put Sh\u0101h-Jah\u0101n\u2019s birth into A.H. 999. The I.O. MSS. support the text, but the R.A.S. MS. has A.H. 1000, which is without doubt right. Cf. Akbarn\u0101ma, Bib. Ind., iii, 603. Later on, a great point was made of his having been born in a millennium. The date is 5th January, 1592.\n\n6 Muhammad H\u0101di says in his preface, p. 6, that Sh\u0101h-Jah\u0101n\u2019s grandfather Akbar gave him the name of Sultan Khurram, \u2018Prince Joy,\u2019 because his birth made the world glad. It was noted that the child was born in the first millennium, and also that, like his father, he was born in the same month as the Prophet.\nand gradually, as his years increased, so did his excellencies, and he was more attentive to my father than all (my) other children, who was exceedingly pleased with and grateful for his services, and always recommended him to me and frequently told me there was no comparison between him and my other children. He recognised him as his real child.\n\nAfter that (Khurram's birth) some other children were born who died in infancy, and then within one month two sons were borne by concubines. One of these I called Jah\u0101nd\u0101r and the other Shahry\u0101r.\\(^1\\)\n\nAbout this time there came a petition from Sa\u02bf\u012bd Kh\u0101n with regard to granting leave to M\u012brz\u0101 Gh\u0101z\u012b, who was a son of the ruler of the province of Thathah (Tattah in Sind).\\(^2\\) I said that as my father had betrothed his sister to my son Khusrau, please God, when this alliance came into force, I would give him leave to return to Sind.\n\nA year before I became king I had determined that I would drink no wine on Friday eve, and I hope at the throne of God that He will keep me firm in this resolve as long as I live.\n\nTwenty thousand rupees were given to M\u012brz\u0101 Mu\u1e25ammad Riz\u0101 Sabzw\u0101r\u012b to divide amongst the faqirs and the needy of Delhi. The viziership of my dominions I gave in the proportions of half and half to Kh\u0101n Beg,\\(^3\\) to whom when I was prince I had given the title of Waz\u012bru-l-mulk, and to Waz\u012br Kh\u0101n \\(^4\\) (Muq\u012bm), and I gave to Shaikh Far\u012bd Bukh\u0101r\u012b, who held the rank of 4,000, that of 5,000.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Gladwin says they were twins, but this seems a mistake. They were both born about the time of Akbar's death.\n\n\\(^2\\) In MS. No. 310 of Eth\u00e9's Cat. of I.O. MSS. Sa\u02bf\u012bd Kh\u0101n is described as giving as his reason for asking for M. Gh\u0101z\u012b that he had adopted him as his son. Price's Jah\u0101ng\u012br, p. 21, says the same thing.\n\n\\(^3\\) This should be J\u0101n, and is so in I.O. MS. 181.\n\n\\(^4\\) See Ma\u02bf\u0101\u0161iru-l-umar\u0101, iii, 932. The meaning of the half and half is that the two men were made coadjutors.\nI promoted R\u0101m D\u0101s Kachhw\u0101ha, whom my father had favoured, and who held the rank of 2,000, to that of 3,000. I sent dresses of honour to M\u012brz\u0101 Rustam, son of M\u012brz\u0101 Sult\u0101n Husain and grandson of Sh\u0101h Ism\u0101\u2018il, the ruler of Qandahar, and to \u2018Abdu-r-Rah\u012bm Kh\u0101nkh\u0101n\u0101n, son of Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n, and to \u012araj and D\u0101r\u0101b, his sons, and to other nobles attached to the Deccan (command). Barkh\u016brd\u0101r, son of \u2018Abdu-r-Rahm\u0101n, son of Mu\u2019ayyid Beg, as he had come to court without a summons, I ordered back to his jagir.\n\n1 It is not according to good manners to go to the king\u2019s banquet without a summons, otherwise there would be no forbidding of the doors and walls to the foot of desire.\n\nA month had elapsed after my auspicious accession when L\u0101la Beg, who while I was prince had obtained the title of B\u0101z Bah\u0101dur, obtained the blessing of waiting on me. His rank, which had been 1,500, was raised to 4,000. I promoted him to the Subah of Bihar and gave him 2,000 rupees. B\u0101z Bah\u0101dur is of the lineage of the special attendants of our family; his father\u2019s name was Niz\u0101m, and he was librarian to Hum\u0101y\u016bn. Kesho D\u0101s M\u0101r\u016b, who is a R\u0101jp\u016bt of the province of Mairtha and is greater in loyalty than his contemporaries, I promoted to the rank of 1,500. I directed the \u2018ulam\u0101 and the learned men of Islam to collect those of the distinctive appellations of God which were easy to remember, in order that I might make them into my rosary 2 (ward). On Friday eves 3 I associate with learned and pious men, and with dervishes and recluses. When Qilij Kh\u0101n, who was one of the old retainers of the State in my revered father\u2019s reign, was appointed to the government of the province of Gujarat, I presented him with a lakh of rupees for his expenses.

I knew him in my childhood when I read the \u201cForty Sayings\u201d with Shaikh \u2018Abdu-n-Nab\u012b, whose history is given in detail in the Akbarn\u0101ma. From these early days till now Mir\u0101n \u1e62adr Jah\u0101n has acted towards me with single-minded loyalty, and I regard him as my preceptor in religious matters (khal\u012bfa). Whilst I was prince and before my revered father\u2019s illness, and during that time, when the ministers (pillars of the State) and the high nobles had become agitated, and each had conceived some idea of gain for himself and wished to become the originator of some act which could only bring ruin on the State, he had not failed in the activity of his service and devotedness.\n\nHaving made \u2018In\u0101yat Beg, who for a long period in the reign of my father had been Master of Works (D\u012bw\u0101n-i-buy\u016btat\u0101t) and held the rank of 700, half-vizier of my dominions in the place of Waz\u012br Kh\u0101n, I gave him the high title of I\u2019tim\u0101du-d-daula with the rank of 1,500, and I appointed Waz\u012br Kh\u0101n to the D\u012bw\u0101n\u012b of the province of Bengal, and assigned to him the settlement of the revenues thereof. To Patr D\u0101s, who in the time of my father had the title of R\u0101y R\u0101y\u0101n, I gave the title of Raja Bikram\u0101jit. The latter was one of the great Rajas of India, and it was in his reign that astronomical observatories were established in India. I made Patr D\u0101s Master of Ordnance, and ordered that he should always have light artillery in the\n\n---\n\n1 The text has \u2018Abdu-l-Ghan\u012b, but this, as the MSS. show and Blochmann has pointed out, is a mistake for \u2018Abdu-n-Nab\u012b. \u2018Abdu-n-Nab\u012b was strangled, and the common report is that this was done by Abu-l-fa\u017cl. If this be true it is rather surprising that Jah\u0101ng\u012br does not mention it as an excuse for killing Abu-l-fa\u017cl. Cf. the account of Mir\u0101n \u1e62adr Jah\u0101n in Price, p. 24. The \u201cForty Sayings\u201d is a book by J\u0101m\u012b. See Rieu, Cat. i, 17, and also Dr. Herbelot s.v. Arbain.\n\n2 This should be Ghiy\u0101\u1e63 Beg. He was father of N\u016brjah\u0101n. According to the Ma\u02be\u0101\u1e63iru-l-umr\u0101 (i, 129), he was commander of 1,000 under Akbar.\n\n3 Topkh\u0101na-i-rik\u0101b, lit. stirrup-arsenal. It means light artillery that could accompany royal progresses. See Bernier, and Irvine, A. of M., 134.\narsenal, 50,000 light guns\\(^1\\) and 3,000 gun-carriages, ready and in efficient order. He was a khatr\u012b by caste, and rose in my father\u2019s service from being accountant of the elephants\u2019 stables to be diwan and an amir. He is not wanting in military qualities and in administrative skill. I made Khurram, the son of Kh\u0101n A\u02bfzam (\u2018Aziz Koka), who had had the rank of 2,000, an officer of 2,500.\n\nAs it was my desire that many of the Akbar\u012b and Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u012b officers should obtain the fruition of their wishes, I informed the bakhshis that whoever wished to have his birthplace made into his jagir should make a representation to that effect, so that in accordance with the Chingiz canon (t\u016bra) the estate might be conveyed to him by \u0101l tamgh\u0101 and become his property, and he might be secured from apprehension of change. Our ancestors and forefathers were in the habit of granting jagirs to everyone under proprietary title, and adorned the farmans for these with the \u0101l tamgh\u0101 seal, which is an impressed seal made in vermilion (i.e. red ink). I ordered that they should cover the place for the seal with gold-leaf (\u1e6dil\u0101posh) and impress the seal thereon, and I called this the alt\u016bn\\(^2\\) tamgh\u0101.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Text, topch\u012b, which seems properly to mean a gunner, but the number is preposterous. Cf. Blochmann, p. 470, and Price, p. 28. Price\u2019s original has 6,000 topch\u012b mounted on camels, and has p\u0101yitakht, i.e. the capital. Erskine has \u201cTo have always in readiness in the arsenal arms and accoutrements for 50,000 matchlock men.\u201d This seems reasonable, for even if Jah\u0101ng\u012br ordered 50,000 musketeers, he would not have required them to be kept in the arsenal. It seems to me that though ch\u012b in Turki is the sign of the agent (nomen agentis) it is occasionally used by Indian writers as a diminutive. Thus topch\u012b here probably means a small gun or a musket, and in Hindustani we are familiar with the word chilamch\u012b, which means a small basin. At p. 301 of the T\u016bzuk, four lines from foot, we have the word ilch\u012b, which commonly means an ambassador\u2014an agent of a people\u2014used certainly not in this sense, and apparently to mean a number of horses. It is, however, doubtful if ilch\u012b here be the true reading.\n\n\\(^2\\) Text, akn\u016bn (now), which is a mistake for alt\u016bn (gold). See Elliot and Dowson, vi, 288. \u0100l is vermilion in Turki and alt\u016bn -gold. Jah\u0101ng\u012br means that he changed the name from \u0101l tamgh\u0101 to alt\u016bn tamgh\u0101.\nI had selected from the other sons of Sh\u0101hrukh, Mirz\u0101 Sult\u0101n,\\(^1\\) son of Mirz\u0101 Sh\u0101hrukh the grandson of Mirz\u0101 Sulaim\u0101n, who was a descendant (great-grandson) of Mirz\u0101 Sult\u0101n Ab\u016b Sa\u02bfid and for a long time ruler of Badakhshan, and with consent of my\\(^2\\) revered father brought him into my service. I count him as a son, and have promoted him to the rank of 1,000. I also promoted Bh\u0101o Singh, son of Raja M\u0101n Singh and the most capable of his sons, from his original rank to that of 1,500. I raised Zam\u0101na Beg,\\(^3\\) son of Ghay\u016br Beg of Kabul, who has served me personally from his childhood, and who, when I was prince, rose from the grade of an ahadi to that of 500, giving him the title of Mah\u0101bat Kh\u0101n and the rank of 1,500. He was confirmed as bakhshi of my private establishment (sh\u0101gird-p\u012bsha).\n\nI promoted Raja Bir Singh Deo, a Bandela Rajput, who had obtained my favour, and who excels his equals and relatives in valour, personal goodness, and simple-heartedness, to the rank of 3,000. The reason for his advancement and for the regard shown to him was that near the end of my revered father\u2019s time, Shaikh Abu-l-fazl, who excelled the Shaikhz\u0101das of Hindustan in wisdom and learning, had adorned himself outwardly with the jewel of sincerity, and sold it to my father at a heavy price. He had been summoned from the Deccan, and, since his feelings towards me were not honest, he both publicly and privately spoke against me. At this period when, through strife-exciting intriguers, the august feelings of my royal father were entirely embittered against me, it was certain that if he obtained the honour of waiting on him (Akbar) it would be the cause of more confusion, and would preclude me\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Mirz\u0101 Sult\u0101n was great-grandson of Sulaim\u0101n.\n\n\\(^2\\) Perhaps the reference is to the boy\u2019s own father. He was alive at this time, and Akbar was not.\n\n\\(^3\\) This is the man who afterwards rebelled and made Jah\u0101ng\u012br his prisoner.\nfrom the favour of union with him (my father). It became necessary to prevent him from coming to Court. As Bir Singh Deo\u2019s country was exactly on his route and he was then a rebel, I sent him a message that if he would stop that sedition-monger and kill him he would receive every kindness from me. By God\u2019s grace, when Shaikh Abu-l-fazl was passing through Bir Singh Deo\u2019s country, the Raja blocked his road, and after a little contest scattered his men and killed him. He sent his head to me in Allahabad. Although this event was a cause of anger in the mind of the late king (Akbar), in the end it enabled me to proceed without disturbance of mind to kiss the threshold of my father\u2019s palace, and by degrees the resentment of the king was cleared away.\n\nI made Mir Ziy\u0101\u2019u-d-din of Qazwin, who had done me service in the days of my princehood and had shown loyalty, commander of 1,000 and accountant of the stables. An order was given that every day thirty horses should be produced before me for the purpose of making presents. I honoured Mirz\u0101 \u2018Ali Akbarsh\u0101h\u012b, who is one of the distinguished braves of this family,\\(^1\\) with the rank of 4,000, and gave him the sarkar of Sambhal as his jagir.\n\nOne day the Amiru-l-umar\u0101 (Shar\u012bf Kh\u0101n) greatly pleased me by an incidental remark. It was this: \u201cHonesty and dishonesty are not confined to matters of cash and goods; to represent qualities as existing in acquaintances which\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Text, ul\u016bs-i-Dihli. Blochmann (p. 482 n.) points out that this is a very doubtful term, as Mirz\u0101 \u2018Ali came from Badakhshan. On examining three MSS. of the T\u016bzuk-i-Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u012b I find no word Dihli, but the words \u012bn ul\u016bs, \u2018this tribe or family,\u2019 and I think this must be the correct reading, and refers to the Timurides. The same phrase occurs at text, p. 173. Blochmann suggests to read D\u016bld\u0101y for Dihli, but I think it more probable that the word Dihli should be \u2018\u0101l\u012b. Mirz\u0101 \u2018Ali was styled Akbarsh\u0101h\u012b, and no doubt this is why Jah\u0101ng\u012br writes \u012bn ul\u016bs or ul\u016bs-i-\u2018\u0101l\u012b. Mirz\u0101 \u2018Ali is often mentioned in the Akbarn\u0101ma in connection with the wars in the Deccan, and is generally called Akbarsh\u0101h\u012b, e.g. at p. 702. For an account of his pathetic death see Blochmann, l.c., the Ma\u2019\u0101\u015firu-l-umar\u0101, iii, 357, and the text, p. 163.\ndo not exist, and to conceal the meritorious qualities of strangers, is dishonesty. In truth, honesty of speech consists in making no distinction between intimates and strangers and in describing each man as he really is.\"\n\nWhen I sent off Parwiz I had said to him, \"If the Rana himself, and his eldest son who is called Karan, should come to wait upon you and proffer service and obedience, you should not do any injury to his territory.\" My intention in this recommendation was of two kinds; one, that inasmuch as the conquest of Transoxiana was always in the pure mind of my revered father, though every time he determined on it things occurred to prevent it, if this business could be settled, and this danger dismissed from my mind, I would leave Parwiz in Hindustan, and in reliance on Allah, myself start for my hereditary territories, especially as at this time there was no permanent ruler in that region. B\u0101q\u012b Kh\u0101n, who, after \u2018Abdu-llah Kh\u0101n and \u2018Abdu-l-Mu\u2019min Kh\u0101n, his son, had acquired complete independence, had died, and the affairs of Wali Muhammad Kh\u0101n, his brother, who is now the ruler of that region, had not as yet been brought into proper order. Secondly, to bring about the termination of the war in the Deccan, of which a part in the time of my revered father had been acquired, so that it might come into possession, and be incorporated with the Imperial dominions. My hope is that through the favour of Allah both these undertakings will be accomplished.\n\n\"Though a king should seize the seven climes,\\(^1\\)  \nHe still would labour to take others.\"\n\nI promoted Mirz\u0101 Sh\u0101hrukh,\\(^2\\) grandson of Mirz\u0101 Sulaim\u0101n, (once) the ruler of Badakhshan, who was nearly related to\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The MSS. have a different reading, \"If a king seize country and climes,\" etc.\n\n\\(^2\\) Sh\u0101hrukh was married to Jah\u0101ng\u012br's half-sister, Shakaru-n-nis\u0101. He was a Timurid.\nmy family, and held the rank of 5,000 in my father's service, to the rank of 7,000. The Mirz\u0101 is a true Turk in disposition and simple-minded. My father conferred great honour on him, and whenever he bade his own sons sit he gratified him also with this distinction. Notwithstanding the mischievous propensities of the people of Badakhshan, the Mirz\u0101 in this familiarity never left the right road, or undertook anything that might lead to unpleasantness. I confirmed him in the Subah of Malwa just as my father had kindly conferred it on him.\n\nI conferred on Khw\u0101ja 'Abdu-llah, who is of the Naqsh-band\u012b family, and in the commencement of his service was an ahadi, and who had risen by degrees to the command of 1,000, but without reason had gone into my father's service, the rank and jagir my father had conferred on him. Although I considered it best for my own prosperity that my attendants and people should go into his (Akbar's) service, yet this had occurred without my leave, and I was rather annoyed at it. But the fact is that he is a manly and zealous man; if he had not committed this fault he would have been a faultless hero (jaw\u0101n).\n\nAb\u016b-n-nab\u012b,\u00b9 the \u016azbeg, who is one of the distinguished inhabitants of M\u0101war\u0101'a-n-nahr and in the time of 'Abdu-l-Mu'min Kh\u0101n was governor of Mashhad, obtained the rank of 1,500.\n\nShaikh \u1e24asan is the son of Shaikh Bah\u0101.\u00b2 From the days of his childhood to this day he has always been in my service and in attendance on me, and when I was prince was distinguished by the title of Muqarrab Kh\u0101n.

After my accession, in consequence of the perfect confidence I had in him, I sent him to Burhanpur to bring the children and dependants of my brother D\u0101niy\u0101l to wait on me, and sent a message to the Kh\u0101nkh\u0101n\u0101n in low and high words\\(^1\\) and profitable admonitions. Muqarrab Kh\u0101n performed this service correctly and in a short time, and, clearing off the suspicions which had entered the minds of the Kh\u0101nkh\u0101n\u0101n and the nobles of that place, brought those who had been left behind by my brother in safety and security, together with his establishment and property and effects, to Lahore, and there presented them before me.\n\nI promoted Naqib Kh\u0101n,\\(^2\\) who is one of the genuine Sayyids of Qazwin and is called Ghiy\u0101\u1e63u-d-d\u012bn \u2018Ali, to the rank of 1,500. My father had distinguished him with the title of Naqib Kh\u0101n, and in his service he had complete intimacy and consideration. Shortly after his accession he (Akbar) had discussed several matters with him, and from this familiarity he called him \u0101k\u1e96\u016bnd. He has no equal or rival in the science of history and in biographies. There is in this day no chronologist like him in the inhabited world. From the beginning of Creation till the present time, he has by heart the tale of the four quarters of the world. Has Allah granted to any other person such faculty of memory?\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Text, Suk\u1e96un\u0101n-i-past u buland. Cf. Steingass, s.v. past. Words gentle and severe seem meant.\n\n\\(^2\\) See Blochmann, p. 447. He is mentioned by Du Jarric as disputing with the Catholic priests before Jah\u0101ng\u012br (see J.A.S.B. for 1896, p. 77). According to Baday\u016bn\u012b, iii, 98, it was Naq\u012bb\u2019s father, \u2018Abdu-l-Lat\u012bf, with whom Akbar read (see Akbarn\u0101ma, ii, 19). \u2018Abdu-l-Lat\u012bf and his family arrived in 963 (1556). Erskine understands Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u2019s remark to mean that Naq\u012bb was his (Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u2019s) teacher, but probably Jah\u0101ng\u012br means that it was Naq\u012bb\u2019s father who taught Akbar, or he has confounded the father and son. As Naq\u012bb lived till 1023 (1614), he would probably be too young in 1556 to have been Akbar\u2019s teacher.\nShaikh Kab\u012br, who was of the family of the venerable Shaikh Salim, I had honoured with the title of Shaj\u0101'at Kh\u0101n when I was prince, on account of his manliness and bravery. I now selected him for the rank of 1,000.\n\nOn Sha'b\u0101n 27th (28th December, 1605) a strange thing was done by the sons of Akhayr\u0101j, son of Bhagw\u0101n D\u0101s, the paternal uncle\\(^1\\) of Raja M\u0101n Singh. These unlucky ones, who bore the names of Abhay R\u0101m, Bijay R\u0101m, and Shy\u0101m R\u0101m, were exceedingly immoderate. Notwithstanding that the aforesaid Abhay R\u0101m had done improper (disproportioned) acts, I had winked at his faults. When at this date it was represented to me that this wretch was desirous of despatching his wives and children without leave to his own country and afterwards of himself running away to the R\u0101na, who is not loyal to this family, I referred to R\u0101m D\u0101s and other Rajput nobles, and said to them that if any one of them would become security for them, I would confirm the rank and jagir of those wretches, and passing over their offences would forgive them. In consequence of their excessive turbulence and bad disposition no one became security. I told the Am\u012bru-l-umar\u0101 that as no one would be bound for them, they must be handed over to the charge of one of the servants of the Court until security was forthcoming. The Am\u012bru-l-umar\u0101 gave them over to Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Kh\u0101n K\u0101kar, who was afterwards dignified with the title of Dil\u0101war Kh\u0101n, and H\u0101tim,\\(^2\\) second son of Mangl\u012b, who held the title of Sh\u0101hnaw\u0101z Kh\u0101n.\\(^3\\) When these wished to disarm these foolish people, they refused, and, not observing the dues of good manners, began, together with their servants, to quarrel and fight.

He betook himself to driving them off, and I sent Shaikh Farid also after him. One Rajput armed with a sword, and another with a dagger stood up to the Am\u012bru-l-umar\u0101. One of his attendants named Qu\u1e6db engaged the man with the dagger and was killed. The Rajput also was cut to pieces. One of the Afghan attendants of the Am\u012bru-l-umar\u0101 attacked the one who had the sword and killed him. Dilawar Kh\u0101n drew his dagger and turned towards Abhay R\u0101m, who with two others was holding his ground, and after wounding one of these fell down after receiving wounds from the three. Some of the ahadis and the men of the Am\u012bru-l-umar\u0101 opposed and slew these doomed men. A Rajput drew his sword and turned to Shaikh Farid; he was met by a \u1e24abshi slave, who brought him down. This disturbance took place in the courtyard of the public palace. That punishment served as a warning to many who had not looked to consequences. Ab\u016b-n-nab\u012b represented that if such a deed had been done in the \u016azbeg country the whole family and connections of that band of men would have been destroyed. I replied that as these people had been treated kindly and educated by my revered father I carried on the same benevolence to them, and justice demands that many shall not be chastised for the fault of one.\n\nShaikh \u1e24usain J\u0101m\u012b, who now sits on the cushion of darw\u012bsh\u012b and is one of the disciples of the dervish of Shiraz, had written to me from Lahore six months before my accession that he had seen in a dream that saints and pious men had delivered over the affairs of the kingdom to that\n\n---\n\n1 I.O. MSS. have Ab\u016b-l-wal\u012b. He was an \u016azbeg, and received the title of Bah\u0101dur Kh\u0101n. See Ma'\u0101\u1e63\u012bru-l-umar\u0101, i, 400, and Akbarn\u0101ma, iii, 820 and 839, where he is called Ab\u016b-l-Ba\u1e33\u0101. The real name seems to be Ab\u016bl Be or Bey, and this is how Erskine writes the name.\n\n2 The text seems corrupt. The I.O. MSS. say nothing about Shiraz, but merely that \u1e24usain J\u0101m\u012b was a disciple who had a dervish character (s\u012brat); nor does the R.A.S. MS. mention Shiraz.\nchosen one of the Court of Allah (Jah\u0101ng\u012br), and that, rejoicing in this good news, he should await the event, and that he hoped that when it had occurred, the faults of Khw\u0101ja Zakariyy\u0101, who was one of the Ahr\u0101riyya, would be pardoned.\n\nI conferred on T\u0101sh Beg Furj\u012b, who was one of the old servants of the State, and whom my father had honoured with the title of T\u0101j Kh\u0101n, and who had the rank of 2,000, that of 3,000, and I raised Tukhta Beg K\u0101bul\u012b from the rank of 2,500 to that of 3,000. He is a brave and active man, and was greatly trusted in the service of my uncle, Mirz\u0101 Muhammad Hak\u012bm. I promoted Ab\u016b-l-Q\u0101sim Tamk\u012bn, who was one of my father\u2019s old servants, to the rank of 1,500. There are few men such as he for abundance of children; he has thirty sons, and if his daughters do not number so many they must be half that number. I dignified Shaikh \u2018Al\u0101\u2019u-d-d\u012bn, grandson of Shaikh Sal\u012bm, who had strong connections with me, with the title of Isl\u0101m Kh\u0101n, and promoted him to the rank of\n\n---\n\n1 That is, descended from the famous Central Asian saint Khw\u0101ja Ahr\u0101r.\n\n2 Something seems to have fallen out of the text and MSS., for this passage is obscure and not connected with the context. It is clearer in Price\u2019s version, where it is brought in as part of Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u2019s statements about promotions, and where (p. 40) we read as follows:\u2014\u201cI shall now return to the more grateful subject of recording rewards and advancements . . . . On Khw\u0101ja Zakariyy\u0101, the son of Khw\u0101ja Muhammad Y\u0101\u1e25y\u0101, although in disgrace, I conferred the rank of 500. This I was induced to do on the recommendation of the venerated Shaikh Husain J\u0101m\u012b. Six months previous to my accession,\u201d etc. Evidently the statement about Zakariyy\u0101\u2019s promotion has been omitted accidentally from the T\u016bzuk. There is a reference to the Shaikh\u2019s dream in Mu\u1e25ammad H\u0101d\u012b\u2019s preface to the T\u016bzuk (p. 15). He says there that it was the saint Baha\u2019u-l-haqq who appeared in a dream to \u1e24usain J\u0101m\u012b and told him that Sult\u0101n Sal\u012bm would soon be king.\n\n3 I.e. of Furj or Furg in Persia. But Furj\u012b is a mistake for Q\u016br\u010d\u012b (belonging to the body-guard). He was a Mogul. See Blochmann, p. 457.\n\n4 Text has wrongly Pakhta. See Blochmann, p. 469. He received the title of Sard\u0101r Kh\u0101n.\n\n5 Should be Namak\u012bn. See Blochmann, p. 199.\n2,000. He had grown up with me from his childhood, and may be a year younger than I. He is a brave and well-dispositioned youth, and is distinguished in every way above his family. Till now he has never drunk intoxicating drinks, and his sincerity towards me is such that I have honoured him with the title of son.\n\nI have bestowed on \u2018Ali Asghar B\u0101rha, who has not a rival in bravery and zeal, and is the son of Sayyid Ma\u1e25m\u016bd Kh\u0101n B\u0101rha, one of my father\u2019s old nobles, the title of Saif Kh\u0101n, and thus distinguished him amongst his equals and connections. He is evidently a brave youth. He was always one of the confidential men who went with me to hunt and to other places. He has never in his life drunk anything intoxicating, and as he has abstained in his youth he probably will attain high dignities. I granted him the rank of 3,000.\n\nI promoted Farid\u016bn, son of Mu\u1e25ammad Quli Kh\u0101n Barl\u0101s, who held the rank of 1,000, to that of 2,000. Farid\u016bn is one of the tribe of Chaghat\u0101y, and is not devoid of manliness and courage.\n\nI promoted Shaikh B\u0101yazid, grandson of Shaikh Salim, who held the rank of 2,000, to that of 3,000. The first person who gave me milk, but for not more than a day, was the mother of Shaikh B\u0101yazid.\n\n\u00b9One day I observed to the Pandits, that is, the wise men of the Hindus, \u201cIf the doctrines of your religion are based on the incarnation of the Holy Person of God Almighty in ten different forms by the process of metempsychosis, they are virtually rejected by the intelligent. This pernicious idea requires that the Sublime Cause, who is void of all limitations, should be possessed of length, breadth, and thickness. If the purpose is the manifestation of the Light of God in these bodies, that of itself is existent equally in\n\n\u00b9This passage has been translated by Elliot (vi, 289). See also Price (p. 44), where the discussion is fuller.\nall created things, and is not peculiar to these ten forms. If the idea is to establish some one of God\u2019s attributes, even then there is no right notion, for in every faith and code there are masters of wonders and miracles distinguished beyond the other men of their age for wisdom and eloquence.\u201d\u00b9 After much argument and endless controversy, they acknowledged a God of Gods, devoid of a body or accidents,\u00b2 and said, \u201cAs our imagination fails to conceive a formless personality (\u1e93\u0101t-i-mujarrad), we do not find any way to know Him without the aid of a form. We have therefore made these ten forms the means of conceiving of and knowing Him.\u201d Then said I, \u201cHow can these forms be a means of your approaching the Deity?\u201d\n\nMy father always associated with the learned of every creed and religion, especially with Pandits and the learned of India, and although he was illiterate, so much became clear to him through constant intercourse with the learned and wise, in his conversations with them, that no one knew him to be illiterate, and he was so acquainted with the niceties of verse and prose compositions that his deficiency was not thought of.\n\nIn his august personal appearance he was of middle height, but inclining to be tall; he was of the hue of wheat; his eyes and eyebrows were black, and his complexion rather dark than fair; he was lion-bodied,\u00b3 with a broad chest, and his hands and arms long. On the left side of his nose he had a fleshy mole, very agreeable in appearance, of the size\n\n\u00b9 Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u2019s idea is somewhat vaguely expressed, but his meaning seems to be that the ten incarnations do not illustrate any attribute of God, for there have been men who performed similar wonders. The corresponding passage in the text used by Major Price is differently rendered by him, but his version is avowedly a paraphrase, and it appears incorrect in this passage.\n\n\u00b2 Literally, \u201cof the How and the Why.\u201d\n\n\u00b3 Text, shir-and\u0101m, \u2018tiger-shaped,\u2019 which I think means thin in the flank (see Steingass, s.v.). I have taken the translation of the words mal\u0101\u1e25at and sab\u0101\u1e25at from Elliot. See his note vi, 376, where the two words seem wrongly spelt.\nof half a pea. Those skilled in the science of physiognomy considered this mole a sign of great prosperity and exceeding good fortune. His august voice was very loud, and in speaking and explaining had a peculiar richness. In his actions and movements he was not like the people of the world, and the glory of God manifested itself in him.\n\n\"Greatness in his manner, kingship in his lineage,\nAs if Solomon would have put the ring on his finger.\"\u00b9\n\nThree months after my birth my sister, Sh\u0101hz\u0101da Kh\u0101nam, was born to one of the royal concubines; they gave her over to his (Akbar\u2019s) mother, Maryam Mak\u0101n\u012b. After her a son was born to one of the concubines, and received the name of Sh\u0101h Mur\u0101d. As his birth occurred in the hill country of Fathp\u016br, he was nicknamed Pah\u0101r\u012b. When my revered father sent him to conquer the Deccan, he had taken to excessive drinking through associating with unworthy persons, so that he died in his 30th year, in the neighbourhood of J\u0101ln\u0101p\u016br, in the province of Berar. His personal appearance was fresh-coloured; he was thin in body and tall of stature. Dignity and authority were evident in his movements, and manliness and bravery manifested themselves in his ways. On the night of Jum\u0101d\u0101-l-awwal 10th, A.H. 979 (September, 1572), another son was born to one of the concubines. As his birth took place at Ajm\u012br in the house of one of the attendants of the blessed shrine of the reverend Khw\u0101ja Mu\u2018\u012bnu-d-d\u012bn Chisht\u012b, whose name was Shaikh D\u0101niy\u0101l, this child was called D\u0101niy\u0101l.\n\nAfter the death of my brother Sh\u0101h Mur\u0101d, he (Akbar), towards the end of his reign, sent D\u0101niy\u0101l to conquer the Deccan and followed him himself. When my revered father was besieging \u0100s\u012br (\u0100s\u012brgarh) he, with a large body of nobles such as the Kh\u0101nkh\u0101n\u0101n and his sons, and M\u012brz\u0101 Y\u016bsuf Kh\u0101n, invested the fort of Ahmadnagar, and it came\n\n\u00b9 Erskine has \"Let Sulaim\u0101n place his ring on his finger.\"\ninto the possession of the victorious officers about the time that \u0100s\u012br was taken. After my father \u2018Arsh-\u0101shy\u0101ni had returned in prosperity and victory from Burhanpur towards his capital, he gave the province to D\u0101niy\u0101l and left him in possession of that territory. D\u0101niy\u0101l took to improper ways, like his brother Sh\u0101h Mur\u0101d, and soon died from excessive drinking, in the 33rd year of his age. His death occurred in a peculiar way. He was very fond of guns and of hunting with the gun. He named one of his guns yaka u jan\u0101za, \u2018the same as the bier,\u2019 and himself composed this couplet and had it engraved on the gun:\n\n\u201cFrom the joy of the chase with thee, life is fresh and new;\nTo everyone whom thy dart strikes, \u2019tis the same as his bier.\u201d\u00b9\n\nWhen his drinking of wine was carried to excess, and the circumstance was reported to my father, farmans of reproach were sent to the Kh\u0101nkhan\u0101n. Of course he forbade it, and placed cautious people to look after him properly. When the road to bring wine was completely closed, he began to weep and to importune some of his servants, and said: \u201cLet them bring me wine in any possible way.\u201d He said to Murshid Quli Kh\u0101n, a musketeer who was in his immediate service: \u201cPour some wine into this yaka u jan\u0101za, and bring it to me.\u201d That wretch, in hope of favour, undertook to do this, and poured double-distilled spirit into the gun, which had long been nourished on gunpowder and the scent thereof, and brought it. The rust of the iron was dissolved by the strength of the spirit and mingled with it, and the prince no sooner drank of it than he fell down.\n\n\u201cNo one should draw a bad omen:\u00b2\nIf he does, he draws it for himself.\u201d\n\n\u00b9 Price translates\u2014\n\u201cIn pleasure of the chase with thee, my soul breathes fresh and clear;\nBut who receives thy fatal dart, sinks lifeless on his bier.\u201d\n\n\u00b2 Perhaps referring to the name which D\u0101niy\u0101l gave to his gun, and which recoiled on himself, but the MSS. and text have nagirad, and not bayirad.\nD\u0101niy\u0101l was of pleasing figure, of exceedingly agreeable manners and appearance; he was very fond of elephants and horses. It was impossible for him to hear of anyone as having a good horse or elephant and not take it from him. He was fond of Hindi songs, and would occasionally compose verses with correct idiom in the language of the people of India, which were not bad.\n\nAfter the birth of D\u0101niy\u0101l a daughter was born to Bibi Daulat-Sh\u0101d whom they named Shakaru-n-nis\u0101 Begam.\u00b9 As she was brought up in the skirt of my revered father\u2019s care, she turned out very well. She is of good disposition and naturally compassionate towards all people. From infancy and childhood she has been extremely fond of me, and there can be few such relationships between brother and sister. The first time when, according to the custom of pressing the breast of a child and a drop of milk is perceptible, they pressed my sister\u2019s breast and milk appeared, my revered father said to me: \u201cB\u0101b\u0101! drink this milk, that in truth this sister may be to thee as a mother.\u201d God, the knower of secrets, knows that from that day forward, after I drank that drop of milk, I have felt love for my sister such as children have for their mothers.\n\nAfter some time another girl was born to this same Bibi Daulat-Sh\u0101d, and he (Akbar) called her \u0100r\u0101m B\u0101n\u016b Begam.\u00b2 Her disposition was on the whole inclined to excitement and heat. My father was very fond of her, so much so that he described her impolitenesses as politenesses, and in his august sight they, from his great love, did not appear bad. Repeatedly he honoured me by addressing me, and said: \u201cB\u0101b\u0101! for my sake be as kind as I am, after me, to this sister, who in Hindi phrase is my darling\n\n\u00b9 The MSS. have Shakar-nis\u0101r, \u2018sugar-sprinkling.\u2019 She lived into Sh\u0101h-Jah\u0101n\u2019s reign.\n\u00b2 She died unmarried in Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u2019s reign.\n(that is, dearly cherished). Be affectionate to her and pass over her little impolitenesses and impudences.\"\n\nThe good qualities of my revered father are beyond the limit of approval and the bounds of praise. If books were composed with regard to his commendable dispositions, without suspicion of extravagance, and he be not looked at as a father would be by his son, even then but a little out of much could be said.\n\nNotwithstanding his kingship and his treasures and his buried wealth, which were beyond the scope of counting and imagination, his fighting elephants and Arab horses, he never by a hair's breadth placed his foot beyond the base of humility before the throne of God, but considered himself the lowest of created beings, and never for one moment forgot God.\n\n\"Always, everywhere, with everyone, and in every circumstance,\nKeep the eye of thy heart secretly fixed on the Beloved.\"\n\nThe professors of various faiths had room in the broad expanse of his incomparable sway. This was different from the practice in other realms, for in Persia there is room for Shias only, and in Turkey, India, and T\u00fbr\u00e2n there is room for Sunnis only.\n\nAs in the wide expanse of the Divine compassion there is room for all classes and the followers of all creeds, so, on the principle that the Shadow must have the same properties as the Light, in his dominions, which on all sides were limited only by the salt sea, there was room for the professors of opposite religions, and for beliefs good and bad, and the road to altercation was closed. Sunnis and Shias met in one mosque, and Franks and Jews in one church, and observed their own forms of worship.\n\n1 This must, I think, be the meaning, though according to the wording the statement would seem to be that there is no room for Shias except in Persia. Erskine has \"None but Shias are tolerated in Persia, Sunnis in R\u00fbm and T\u00fbr\u00e2n, and Hindus in Hindustan.\"\n\n2 Kings are regarded as shadows of God.\nHe associated with the good of every race and creed and persuasion, and was gracious to all in accordance with their condition and understanding. He passed his nights in wakefulness, and slept little in the day; the length of his sleep during a whole night and day (nycthemeron) was not more than a watch and a half. He counted his wakefulness at night as so much added to his life. His courage and boldness were such that he could mount raging, rutting elephants, and subdue to obedience murderous elephants which would not allow their own females near them\u2014although even when an elephant is bad-tempered he does no harm to the female or his driver\u2014and which were in a state in which they might have killed their drivers or the females, or not have allowed their approach. He would place himself on a wall or tree near which an elephant was passing that had killed its mahout and broken loose from restraint, and, putting his trust in God\u2019s favour, would throw himself on its back and thus, by merely mounting, would bring it under control and tame it. This was repeatedly seen.\n\nHe ascended the throne in his 14th year. Hem\u016b, the infidel whom the Afghan ruler had raised to high station, collected a wonderful force after King Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s death, with a stud of elephants such as no ruler of Hindustan had at that time, and he went towards Delhi. Hum\u0101y\u016bn had appointed Akbar to drive off some of the Afghans from the foot-hills of the Panjab, but just then he exemplified the hemistich which is a description of the accident and the chronogram of his death\u2014\n\n\u201cThe august monarch (Hum\u0101y\u016bn) fell from the roof. The news (of the death) was conveyed to my father by Nazar-jivi.\u201d\u00b9\n\nBair\u0101m Kh\u0101n, who was then his tutor, having collected the nobles who were in the province, chose an auspicious\n\n\u00b9 The chronogram is one year short, yielding 962 instead of 963.\nhour and seated him on the throne of rule in pargana Kal\u0101n\u016br, near Lahore.\n\nWhen Hem\u016b reached the neighbourhood of Delhi, Tard\u012b Beg Kh\u0101n and a large force that was in the city drew up to oppose him. When the preparations for the combat had been made the armies attacked one another, and, after considerable endeavours and strife, defeat fell on Tard\u012b Beg Kh\u0101n and the Moguls, and the army of darkness overcame the army of light.\n\n\u201cAll things and battles and fights are of God,\nHe knows whose will be the victory,\nFrom the blood of the brave and the dust of the troops,\nThe earth grew red and the heavens black.\u201d\n\nTard\u012b Beg Kh\u0101n and the other defeated ones took the road to my revered father\u2019s camp. As Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n disliked Tard\u012b Beg, he made this defeat an excuse to put him to death.\n\nA second time, through the pride engendered in the mind of this accursed infidel by his victory, he came out of Delhi with his force and elephants and advanced, while the glorious standards of His Majesty (Akbar) proceeded from Kal\u0101n\u016br for the purpose of driving him away. The armies of darkness and light met in the neighbourhood of Panipat, and on Thursday, Mu\u1e25arram 2nd, A.H. 964 (November 5th, 1556), a fight took place. In the army of Hem\u016b were 30,000 brave fighting horsemen, while the gh\u0101z\u012bs of the victorious army were not more than 4,000 or 5,000. On that day Hem\u016b was riding an elephant named Haw\u0101\u02bei. Suddenly an arrow struck the eye of that infidel and came out at the back of his head. His army, on seeing this, took to flight. By chance Sh\u0101h Qul\u012b Kh\u0101n Ma\u1e25ram with a few brave men came up to the elephant on which was the wounded Hem\u016b, and would have shot an arrow at the driver, but he cried \u201cDo not kill me; Hem\u016b is on this elephant.\u201d A number of men immediately conveyed Hem\u016b as he was to the king (Akbar). Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n represented\nthat it would be proper if the king with his own hand should strike the infidel with a sword, so that obtaining the reward of a gh\u0101zi (warrior of the Faith) he might use this title on the imperial farmans. The king answered, \"I have cut him in pieces before this,\" and explained: \"One day, in Kabul, I was copying a picture in presence of Khw\u0101ja \u2018Abdu-\u1e63-\u1e62amad Sh\u012br\u012bn Qalam, when a form appeared from my brush, the parts of which were separate and divided from each other. One of those near asked, 'Whose picture is this?' It came to my tongue to say that it was the likeness of Hem\u016b.\" Not defiling his hand with his (Hem\u016b's) blood, he told one of his servants to cut off his head. Those killed in the defeated army numbered 5,000 in addition to those who fell in various places round about.\n\nAnother of the well-known deeds of Akbar was the victorious expedition against Gujarat, and his rapid march there, at the time when Mirz\u0101 Ibr\u0101h\u012bm \u1e24usain, Mu\u1e25ammad \u1e24usain Mirz\u0101, and Sh\u0101h Mirz\u0101 revolted from this State and went towards Gujarat, and all the nobles of that province, combining with the turbulent of those parts, besieged the fort of Ahmadabad in which was Mirz\u0101 \u2018Az\u012bz Koka with the royal army. His Majesty, in consequence of the distracted state of J\u012bj\u012b Ang\u0101, the mother of the last-named Mirz\u0101, started for Gujarat with a body of royal troops without delay from the capital of Fathpur. Having covered in the space of nine days the long road which it should take two months to accomplish, sometimes on horseback, sometimes on a camel or in a bullock-cart, he arrived at Sarn\u0101l.\n\nWhen, on 5th Jum\u0101d\u0101-l-awwal, 980 (September 15th, 1572), he reached the neighbourhood of the enemy's camp, he consulted with those who were loyal to him. Some said he should make a night attack on the camp. His Majesty, however, said that a night attack was the resort of the faint-hearted and the way of the deceitful, and immediately gave orders to beat the drums and set the horsemen\nat them. When the river S\u0101bar Mah\u012b (S\u0101barmati) was reached, he ordered his men to cross it in order. Muhammad Husain Mirz\u0101 was agitated by the noise of the army of victory, and himself came forward to reconnoitre. Subh\u0101n Quli Turk, also with a troop of brave men, went to the river\u2019s bank to enquire into the enemy\u2019s position. The Mirz\u0101 asked what troops these were. Subh\u0101n Quli replied that they were of the army of King Jal\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn Akbar. That ill-fated one would not believe this, and said his spies had seen the king fourteen days before in Fathpur, and that it was clear Subh\u0101n Quli was lying. To this Subh\u0101n Quli rejoined, \u201cNine days ago the king with this expedition started from Fathpur.\u201d \u201cHow could elephants have come?\u201d \u00b9 asked the Mirz\u0101. \u201cWhat need was there of elephants?\u201d answered Subh\u0101n Quli. \u201cYoung men and heroes who cleave rocks, and are better than famous and raging elephants, have come; the difference between loyalty and sedition will now become known.\u201d The Mirz\u0101, after this conversation, turned aside and began to marshal his troops. The king waited until his advanced guard sent word that the enemy had put on their armour. He then moved forward, and although he sent several times to order the Kh\u0101n A\u02bf\u1e93am to advance, the latter stood still. It was said to Akbar that, as the enemy was in force, it would be well to remain on his side of the river until the army of Gujarat arrived from within the fort. His Majesty answered: \u201cAlways, and especially in this affair, I have put my trust in God. If I had considered routine, I should not have come in this rapid manner. Now that our foe is ready for the fight, we ought not to delay.\u201d With these words, and with his innate reliance on God as his shield, he put his horse into the river with a few chosen men whom he had appointed to ride with him. Though it was not supposed\n\n\u00b9 According to the \u1e6cabaq\u0101t, Elliot, v, 366, what the Mirz\u0101 said was \u201cWhere are the elephants?\u201d\nthat there was a ford, he crossed in safety. He had called for his helmet, but in the agitation of bringing it his armour-bearer dropped the face-guard (buff\u00e9). His comrades did not regard this as a good omen, but he said at once, \"It is an excellent omen, for it has revealed my face.\" Meantime the wretched Mirz\u0101 arrayed his ranks to fight his benefactor.\n\n\"If thou come out (to fight) with thy benefactor,\nIf thou wert the sphere, thou wouldest be reversed.\"\n\nThe Kh\u0101n A'\u1e93am had had no idea that the king would cast the shadow of his compassion on these regions with such speed and eagerness, and he believed no one who gave him news of that arrival, until convinced by visible proof. Then, arraying the army of Gujarat, he prepared to march. Meanwhile \u0100saf Kh\u0101n also sent news to him. Before his army issued from the fort the enemy had appeared from amongst the trees. The king, taking the Divine aid as the security of his courage, started off. Muhammad Qul\u012b Kh\u0101n Turk and Tard\u012b Kh\u0101n D\u012bw\u0101na came forward with a band of brave followers, and after a little fighting turned rein. On this His Majesty said to Bhagw\u0101n D\u0101s, \"The enemy are unnumbered and we are few; we must attack with one face and one heart; for a clenched fist is more useful than an open hand.\" With these words he drew his sword, and with shout of Allahu-akbar and Y\u0101 Mu'\u012bn charged with those devoted to him.\n\n\"The sense of the age evaporated with the clamour,\nThe ear of the heavens was split with the shouts.\"\n\nThe royal right and left wings and a band of brave men in the centre fought with valour. Stars (kaukab\u0101'\u012b), which are a kind of firework, were lighted by the enemy; they\n\n1 The word for 'face-guard' is p\u012bsh-r\u0101y (front-face), and Jah\u0101ng\u012br makes his father pun upon the word, saying, \"It has loosed (opened) my front-face.\" Cf. Price, p. 54.\n2 'The helper.' This is an allusion to Akbar's patron saint, Mu'\u012bnu-d-d\u012bn Chisht\u012b, whose name he adopted as his battle-cry.\ntwisted about among the thorn-bushes, and created such confusion that a noted elephant of the enemy began to move and threw their troops into disarray. With this the royal centre came up and dispersed Mu\u1e25ammad \u1e24usain and his force. M\u0101n Singh Darb\u0101r\u012b overcame his foe under the king\u2019s eyes, and R\u0101gho D\u0101s Kachhw\u0101ha sacrificed his life. Mu\u1e25ammad Waf\u0101, who was of the house-born of the State, behaving very bravely, fell wounded from his horse. By the favour of the Creator who cherishes His servants, and simply through the courage and good fortune of the exalted king, the enemy were scattered and defeated. In gratitude for this great victory the king turned his face in supplication to the throne of his merciful Maker, and poured forth his thanks.\n\nOne of the kal\u0101wants (musicians) represented to His Majesty that Saif Kh\u0101n Kokalt\u0101sh had offered the coin of his life in loyalty to the State, and on enquiry it appeared that when Mu\u1e25ammad \u1e24usain Mirz\u0101 with some of his riffraff was attacking the centre Saif Kh\u0101n met him and fighting valiantly became a martyr. The Mirz\u0101 himself was wounded by the hands of the brave men of the main body. The Kokalt\u0101sh mentioned is the elder brother of Zain Kh\u0101n Koka.\n\nA strange circumstance was this: on the day before the battle, when the king was eating, he asked Haz\u0101ra, who was learned in the science of looking at the shoulder-blades (a kind of divination), to see on whose side the victory would be. Haz\u0101ra said: \u201cThe victory will be on your side, but one of the chiefs of your army will become a martyr.\u201d Whereupon Saif Kh\u0101n Koka said, \u201cWould that this blessing might fall to my lot!\u201d\n\n\u201cMany an omen that we have treated as jest\\(^1\\)  \nBecame true when the star passed by.\u201d\n\n\\(^1\\) The reading in the lithograph seems wrong; the MSS. have az b\u0101zicha, \u2018in jest.\u2019\nIn short, M\u012brz\u0101 Mu\u1e25ammad \u1e24usain turned his reins, but his horse's feet became entangled in the thorn-brake and he fell. An ahadi of the king, Gada\u02bf \u2018Al\u012b by name, found him, and having mounted him before him on his horse took him to the king. As two or three claimed a share in his capture, His Majesty asked who had made him prisoner. \"The king's salt,\" he answered. The king ordered his hands, that had been fastened behind him, to be tied in front. Meanwhile he asked for water. Farhat Kh\u0101n, who was one of the confidential slaves, struck him on the head, but the king, disapproving of this, sent for his private drinking water and satisfied his thirst. Up to this time M\u012brz\u0101 \u2018Aziz Koka and the garrison of the fort had not come out. After the capture of the M\u012brz\u0101, His Majesty was proceeding slowly towards Ahmadabad. He had delivered the M\u012brz\u0101 to R\u0101y R\u0101y Singh R\u0101\u1e6dhor, one of the Rajput chiefs, to be put on an elephant and brought with him. Meanwhile Ikhtiy\u0101ru-l-mulk, who was one of the influential Gujarati leaders, made his appearance with an army of nearly 5,000 men. Complete confusion fell upon the royal troops. The king, as his natural valour and lofty disposition required, ordered the drums to be beaten, and Shaj\u0101\u02bfat Kh\u0101n, Raja Bhagw\u0101n D\u0101s, and some others charged on in front to fight this force. Fearing that the enemy might get possession of M\u012brz\u0101 Mu\u1e25ammad \u1e24usain, R\u0101y R\u0101y Singh's men, by the advice and plan of the aforesaid Raja (Bhagw\u0101n D\u0101s), cut off his head. My father did not want to kill him. The forces of Ikhtiy\u0101ru-l-mulk also were dispersed, and he was thrown from his horse into the thorn thicket. Suhr\u0101b Beg Turkm\u0101n cut off his head and brought it in. It was only by the grace and power of God that such a victory was won by a small number of men.\n\nIn the same way are beyond all reckoning the conquest of the province of Bengal, the capture of well-known and celebrated forts in Hindustan such as Chitor and Rantambh\u014dr, the subjection of the province of Khandesh, and the\ntaking of the fort of \u0100s\u012br and of other provinces which by the exertions of the royal armies came into the possession of the servants of the State. If these were related in detail it would be a long story.\n\nIn the fight at Chitor, the king with his own hand killed Jitmal, the leader of the men in the fort. He had no rival in shooting with a gun, and with the one with which he killed Jitmal, and which was called Sangr\u0101m, he killed some 3,000 or 4,000 birds and beasts.\\(^1\\) I may be reckoned a true pupil of his. Of all sports I am most disposed to that with the gun, and in one day have shot eighteen deer.\n\nOf the austerities practised by my revered father, one was the not eating the flesh of animals. During three months of the year he ate meat, and for the remaining nine contented himself with \u0160\u016bf\u012b food, and was no way pleased with the slaughter of animals. On many days and in many months this was forbidden to the people. The days and months on which he did not eat flesh are detailed in the Akbarn\u0101ma.\n\nOn the day I made I'tim\u0101du-l-mulk diwan,\\(^2\\) I put Mu'izzu-l-mulk in charge of the d\u012bw\u0101n-i-buy\u016bt\u0101t (care of buildings). The latter is a Sayyid of B\u0101kharz,\\(^3\\) and under my revered father was accountant of the kurkar\u0101q department.\\(^4\\)\n\nOn one of my accession days, a hundred of the Akbari and Jah\u0101ngiri servants were promoted to higher rank and jagirs. At the commencement of the Ramaz\u0101n '\u012ad, as it was the first after my accession, I came down to the '\u012adg\u0101h from my auspicious throne. There was a great crowd, and having performed the dues of thanksgiving and praise\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Ab\u016b-l-fa\u017cl is more moderate; he says (Blochmann, p. 116) that Akbar killed 1,019 animals with Sangr\u0101m.\n\n\\(^2\\) Blochmann says, of Mashhad, p. 381.\n\n\\(^3\\) The furriery. See Blochmann, pp. 87 n. and 616. Kurk means 'fur' in Turki.\nI returned to the palace, where according to the verse \"From the table of kings favours come to beggars,\" I commanded a sum of money to be spent in alms and charity. Some lakhs of d\u0101ms of this were entrusted to D\u016bst Mu\u1e25ammad (afterwards Khw\u0101ja Jah\u0101n), who divided them amongst faqirs and those who were in want, and a lakh of d\u0101ms each was given to Jam\u0101lu-d-din \u1e24usain Anj\u016b (the lexicographer), Mirz\u0101 \u0160adr Jah\u0101n, and Mir Mu\u1e25ammad Riz\u0101 Sabzaw\u0101r\u012b to dispose of in charity in different quarters of the city. I sent 5,000 rupees to the dervishes of Shaikh Mu\u1e25ammad \u1e24usain J\u0101m\u012b, and gave directions that each day one of the officers of the watch should give 50,000 d\u0101ms to faqirs. I sent a jewelled sword to the Kh\u0101nkh\u0101n\u0101n, and promoted Jam\u0101lu-d-din Anj\u016b to the rank of 3,000. The office of \u0160adr was entrusted to Mir\u0101n \u0160adr Jah\u0101n, and I ordered H\u0101ji Koka, who was one of my father's foster-sisters, to bring before me in the palace such women as were worthy to be presented with land and money. I promoted Z\u0101hid Kh\u0101n, son of Mu\u1e25ammad \u0160\u0101diq Kh\u0101n, from the rank of 1,500 to that of 2,000.\n\nIt had been the custom that when the gift of an elephant or horse was made to anyone, the naqibs and the Masters of the Horse (Mir \u0100kh\u016br\u0101n) took from him a sum of money as jilaw\u0101na (bridle-money). I gave orders that this money should be paid by the government, so that people might be freed from the importunities and demands of that set of men.\n\nAt this time S\u0101lb\u0101han arrived from Burhanpur and produced before me the horses and elephants of my deceased brother D\u0101niy\u0101l. Of the elephants, one male named Mast\n\n---\n\n1 The word y\u0101tish is omitted in text, but occurs in the MSS.\n2 H\u0101ji Koka was sister of Sa\u02bf\u0101dat Y\u0101r Koka (Akbar-n\u0101ma, iii, 656). According to Price this passage refers to a widows' fund.\n3 This was one of Akbar's regulations (Blochmann, p. 142). The amount was ten dams on each muhr of the horse's value, calculated on an increase of 50 per cent. See also Price, p. 61.\nAlast appeared to me the best, and I gave him the name of N\u016br Gaj. A wonderful thing showed itself in this elephant; on the sides of his ears small lumps had grown about the size of melons, and from them came fluid such as drops from an elephant in the rutting season; moreover, the top of his forehead was more prominent than in other elephants. It was a splendid and imposing animal.\\footnote{This passage is not clear, but the peculiarity to which attention is drawn seems rather the prominent forehead than the oozing fluid. Price (p. 62) has a fuller account of this elephant.}\n\nI gave to my son Khurr\u0101m (Sh\u0101h-Jah\u0101n) a rosary of jewels, with the hope that he might obtain fulfilment of all his desires, both in visible and in spiritual things.\n\nAs I had remitted in my dominions customs duties amounting to krors, I abolished also all the transit dues (s\u0101\u2019ir-jih\u0101t) in Kabul, which is one of the noted towns on the road to Hindustan. These brought in 1 kror and 23 lakhs of dams. From the provinces of Kabul and Qandahar large sums used to be derived every year from customs (zak\u0101\u2019t), which were in fact the chief revenue of those places. I remitted these ancient dues, a proceeding that greatly benefited the people of Iran and Turan.\n\n\u0100\u1e63af Kh\u0101n\u2019s jagir in the subah of Bih\u0101r had been given to B\u0101z Bah\u0101dur; I therefore ordered that a jagir in the Panjab should be given to him. As it was represented to me that a large sum was in arrears in his jagir, and now that the order for exchange had been given its collection would be difficult, I directed that a lakh of rupees should be given to him from the Treasury and the arrears recovered from B\u0101z Bah\u0101dur for the royal revenues.\n\nI promoted Shar\u012bf \u0100mul\u012b to the rank of 2,500, original and increase. He is a pure-hearted, lively-spirited man. Though he has no tincture of current sciences, lofty words and exalted knowledge often manifest themselves in him. In the dress of a faqir he made many journeys, and he\nhas friendship with many saints and recites the maxims of those who profess mysticism. This is his conversation, not his practice (q\u0101li-\u0101 ast na h\u0101l\u012b). In the time of my revered father he relinquished the garments of poverty and asceticism, and attained to amirship and chiefship. His utterance is exceedingly powerful, and his conversation is remarkably eloquent and pure, although he is without Arabic. His compositions also are not devoid of verve.\\(^1\\)\n\nA garden in Agra had been left by Sh\u0101h Quli Kh\u0101n Ma\u1e25ram, and as he had no heirs I handed it over to Ruqayya Sult\u0101n Begam, the daughter of Hind\u0101l Mirz\u0101, who had been the honoured wife of my father.\\(^2\\) My father had given my son Khurr\u0101m into her charge, and she loved him a thousand times more than if he had been her own.\n\n**THE GREAT FEAST OF NAUR\u00dcZ.**\n\nOn the night of Tuesday, Zi-l-q\u0101\u1e0da 11th, A.H. 1014 (March 11th or 12th, 1606), in the morning, which is the time of the blessing of light, his Eminence the Great Luminary passed from the constellation of the Fish to the House of Honour in the constellation of the Ram. As this was the first New Year\u2019s Day after my auspicious accession I ordered them to decorate the porticoes of the private and public halls of the palace, as in the time of my revered father, with delicate stuffs, and to adorn them handsomely. From the first day of the Naur\u00fcz to the 19th degree of the Ra\u02ben (Aries), which is the day of culmination, the people gave themselves over to enjoyment and happiness. Players and singers of all bands and castes were gathered together.

She long survived him.\ncaptivate the hearts of angels kept up the excitement of the assemblies. I gave orders that whoever might wish for intoxicating drinks and exhilarating drugs should not be debarred from using them.\n\n\"Cupbearer! brighten my cup with the light of wine;  \nSing, minstrel, for the world has ordered itself as I desire.\"\u00b9\n\nIn my father's time it had become established that one of the great nobles should prepare an entertainment on each of the 17 or 18 days of the festival, and should present His Majesty the king with choice gifts of all kinds of jewels and jewelled things, precious stuffs, and elephants and horses, and should invite him to take the trouble to come to his assembly. By way of exalting his servants, he would deign to be present, and having looked at the presents would take what he approved of and bestow the remainder on the giver of the entertainment. As my mind was inclined to the comfort and ease of the army and subjects, I this year let them off their gifts with the exception of a few from my immediate retainers, which I accepted in order to gratify them. In those same days many servants of the State obtained higher rank. Amongst them I raised Dil\u0101war Kh\u0101n Afgh\u0101n to 1,500, and I raised R\u0101ja B\u0101so, who was a landholder of the hill country of the Panjab, and who from the time I was prince till now has kept the way of service and sincerity towards me and held the rank of 1,500, to 3,500. Sh\u0101h Beg Kh\u0101n, the governor of Qandahar, I promoted to 5,000, and R\u0101y R\u0101y Singh, a R\u0101jp\u016bt noble, obtained the same rank. I gave 12,000 rupees for expenses to R\u0101n\u0101 Shankar.\n\nAt the beginning of my reign, a son of that Muzaffar Gujar\u0101t\u012b who claimed to be descended from the rulers of that country lifted up the head of disturbance and attacked and plundered the environs of the city of Ahmadabad.\n\n\u00b9 These are the opening lines of an ode of H\u0101fiz.\nSome sardars such as Pim\u00b9 Bah\u0101dur \u016azbeg and R\u0101y \u2018Ali Bhat\u012b, who were amongst the distinguished and brave men there, became martyrs in that outbreak. At length R\u0101ja Bikram\u0101jit and many mansabdars were provided by me with 6,000 or 7,000 horse, and appointed to assist the army of Gujarat. It was decided that when things had quieted down, by the driving off of those seditious people, R\u0101ja Bikram\u0101jit should be Subahdar of Gujarat. Qilij Kh\u0101n, who had been previously nominated to this office, should come to Court. After the arrival of the royal troops the thread of the rebels\u2019 union was severed; they took refuge in different jungles, and the country was reduced to order. The news of this victory reached the ear of my state and dignity in the most acceptable of hours (New Year time).\n\nAbout this time there came a representation from my son Parwiz that the R\u0101n\u0101 had left th\u0101na Mandal, which is about 30\u00b2 or 40 kos from Ajmir, and had run away, and that a force had been appointed to pursue him; and that it was to be hoped the good fortune of Jah\u0101ng\u012br would cause him to become non-existent.\n\nOn the last day of the feast of the New Year, many servants of the State were honoured with favours and increase of rank. Pishrau Kh\u0101n was an old retainer and had come from Persia (wil\u0101yat) with Hum\u0101y\u016bn; indeed, he was one of the men whom Sh\u0101h Tahm\u0101sp had sent with Hum\u0101y\u016bn. His name was Mihtar Sa\u02bf\u0101dat. As under my father he was superintendent (d\u0101rogha) and head (mihtar) of the farr\u0101sh-kh\u0101na (store department), and had no equal in this service, he had given him the title of Pishrau Kh\u0101n (the active Kh\u0101n). Though he was a subordinate (?) servant and had an artificer\u2019s disposition (qalaqch\u012b mashrab),\n\n\u00b9 Ma\u02bf\u0101\u0161iru-l-umar\u0101, Yal\u012bm instead of Pim or Bim.

Some of these short-sighted ones, through the multitude of their crimes and offences, had become hopeless of pardon and indulgence, and imagined that by making Khusrau a tool they might conduct the affairs of State through him. They overlooked the truth that acts of sovereignty and world rule are not things to be arranged by the worthless endeavours of defective intellects. The just Creator bestows them on him whom he considers fit for this glorious and exalted duty, and on such a person doth He fit the robe of honour.\n\n\"He who is seized of Fortune cannot be deprived of it;\nThrone and diadem are not things of purchase;\nIt is not right to wrest crown and dominion\nFrom the head which God, the Crown-cherisher, has indicated.\"\n\nAs the futile imaginations of the seditious and short-sighted had no result but disgrace and regret, the affairs of the kingdom were confirmed in the hands of this suppliant\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) I think Jah\u0101ng\u012br means that though the Kh\u0101n was an excellent servant in his own line, he was hardly fit for the command of 2,000 or for the title of Kh\u0101n. Cf. his praise of him at p. 71 (Blochmann, p. 498). He was called Pishrau probably from his going on ahead with the advance camp, as being in charge of the carpets, etc., as well as because of his personal activity.\n\n\\(^2\\) In Price's Jah\u0101ng\u012br, p. 15, Jah\u0101ng\u012br states that he had imprisoned Khusrau in the upper part of the royal tower in the castle of Agra. It was from this confinement that Khusrau escaped.\nat the throne of Allah. I invariably found Khusrau preoccupied and distracted. However much, in favour and affection for him, I wished to drive from his mind some of his fears and alarms, nothing was gained until, at last, by the advice of those whose fortune was reversed, on the night of Sunday, Zi-l-hijja 8th, of the year mentioned (April 6th, 1605), when two gharis had passed, he made a pretence\\(^1\\) of going to visit the tomb of His Majesty (Akbar), and went off with 350 horsemen, who were his adherents, from within the fort of Agra. Shortly after, one of the lamp attendants who was acquainted with the Waziru-l-mulk gave him the news of Khusrau\u2019s flight. The Vizier took him to the Am\u012bru-l-umar\u0101, who, as the news seemed true, came in a distracted state of mind to the door of the private apartments and said to one of the eunuchs, \u201cTake in my request and say that I have a necessary representation to make, and let the king honour me by coming out.\u201d As such an affair had not entered my thoughts, I supposed that news had come from the Deccan or Gujarat. When I came out and heard what the news was, I asked, \u201cWhat must be done? Shall I mount myself, or shall I send Khurram?\u201d The Am\u012bru-l-umar\u0101 submitted that he would go if I ordered it. \u201cLet it be so,\u201d I said. Afterwards he said, \u201cIf he will not turn back on my advice, and takes up arms, what must be done?\u201d Then I said, \u201cIf he will go in no way on the right road, do not consider a crime anything that results from your action. Kingship regards neither son nor son-in-law. No one is a relation to a king.\u201d\n\nWhen I had said these words and other things, and had dismissed him, it occurred to me that Khusrau was very much annoyed with him, and that in consequence of the\n\n\\(^1\\) Du Jarric says it was in this way that he was allowed to pass the sentinels. Du Jarric gives the date of Khusrau\u2019s flight as 15th April, 1606 (this would be New Style). By Sunday night is meant Saturday evening. Sunday was Akbar\u2019s birthday.\ndignity and nearness (to me) which he (the Amir) enjoyed, he was an object of envy to his equals and contemporaries.\\footnote{Elliot (vii, 292) makes the Amiru-l-umar\u0101 envious of his peers, and Jah\u0101ng\u012br apprehensive lest he should destroy Khusrau, but he had just told him that nothing he did against Khusrau would be wrong. Clearly Jah\u0101ng\u012br's fear was that his favourite should be destroyed by Khusrau, or perhaps by the Amir's treacherous associates.} Perhaps they might devise treachery and destroy him. I therefore ordered Mu'izzu-l-mulk to recall him, and selecting in his place Shaikh Farid Bakhsh\u012b-begi commanded him to start off at once, and to take with him the mansabdars and ahadis who were on guard. Ihtim\u0101m Kh\u0101n the kotw\u0101l was made scout and intelligence officer. I determined, God willing, to start off myself when it was day. Mu'izzu-l-mulk brought back the Amiru-l-umar\u0101.\n\nAbout this time, Ahmad Beg Kh\u0101n and D\u016bst Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n had been sent off to Kabul,\\footnote{The text has a curious mistake here: instead of ba Kabul it has bak\u0101wal ('superintendent of the kitchen') as part of D\u016bst Mu\u1e25ammad's name. D\u016bst was not bak\u0101wal, but held higher office, and was later put in charge of the fort of Agra and given the title of Khw\u0101ja Jah\u0101n.} and had got as far as Sikandra, which was on Khusrau's route. On his arrival they came out of their tents with some of their people, and returned and waited on me with the news that Khusrau had taken the Panjab road and was hastening on. It occurred to me that he might change his route and go somewhere else. As his maternal uncle, M\u0101n Singh, was in Bengal, it occurred to many of the servants of the State that he might go in that direction. I sent out on every side, and ascertained that he was making for the Panjab. Meantime day dawned, and in reliance on the grace and favour of God Almighty, and with clear resolve, I mounted, withheld by nothing and no one.\n\n\"In truth, he who is pursued by sorrow\nKnows not how the road is or how he may travel it.\nThis he knows, that horror drives him on:\nHe knows not with whom he goes nor whom he leaves behind.\"\nWhen I reached the venerable mausoleum of my revered father, which is three kos from the city, I begged for aid to my courage from the spirit of that honoured one. About this time they captured and brought in \\(^1\\) Mirz\u0101 \u1e24asan, son of Mirz\u0101 Sh\u0101hrukh, who had proposed to accompany Khusrau. He could not deny it when I questioned him, and I ordered them to tie his hands and mount him on an elephant.\\(^2\\) This was the first good omen manifested through the kindness and blessing of that venerable one. At midday, as it had become exceedingly hot, having rested awhile under the shade of a tree, I said to the Kh\u0101n A\u02bf\u1e93am that we, with all our composure, were in such a state that we had not taken till now our regular allowance of opium, which it was the practice to take the first thing in the morning, and no one had reminded us of the omission. We might imagine from this what was now the condition of that graceless one (Khusrau).\\(^3\\)\n\nMy trouble was this, that my son without any cause or reason should become an opponent and an enemy. If I should make no endeavour to capture him, the fractious or rebellious would have an instrument, or else he would take his own way and go for an asylum to the \u016azbegs or the Persians, and contempt would fall upon my government. On this account, having made a special point of capturing him, I went on after a short rest two or three kos beyond pargana Mathura, which is 20 kos from Agra, and I alighted at one of the villages of that pargana where there is a tank.\n\nWhen Khusrau arrived at Mathura, he met \u1e24usain Beg Badakhsh\u012b, who was of those who had received favours from my revered father and was coming from\n\n---\n\n1 Price, p. 6, note.\n2 According to Kh\u0101fi Kh\u0101n (i, 250) he was put to death, unless the expression \u201cclaws of death\u201d is merely rhetorical. The Ma\u02bf\u0101\u1e63ir (iii, 334) says he was imprisoned.\n3 The above obscure passage is explained in Price, p. 69.\nKabul to wait on me. As it is the temperament of the Badakhshis to be seditious and turbulent, Khusrau regarded\\(^1\\) this meeting as a godsend, and made Husain Beg the captain and guide of 200 or 300 Badakhshan Aim\u0101qs, who were with him.\n\nAnyone whom they met, they plundered of horses and goods. Merchants and conveyers of goods were plundered by these rascals, and wheresoever they went men's wives and children were not safe from the calamity of these wretches. With his own eyes Khusrau was witnessing the oppression practised in the hereditary dominions of his ancestors, and after being a witness of the improper deeds of these rascals he a thousand times every moment wished death for himself. Finally, he had no remedy but to temporize with and support those dogs. If good luck and fortune had assisted him in his affairs, he would have made repentance and regret his voucher, and come without any deceit to wait on me. God, who knows the world of secrets, knows that I should have passed over his offences entirely and shown him such favour and affection that to the extent of a hair's point no estrangement or fear would have remained upon his mind. Inasmuch as during the lifetime of the late king (Akbar) an intention of joining in the sedition of some of the rebels had manifested itself in his mind, and he knew that this had come to my knowledge, he placed no reliance on my kindness and affection. His mother, while I was prince, in grief at his ways and behaviour and the misconduct of her brother M\u0101dho Singh,\\(^2\\) killed herself by swallowing opium (\\(tiry\u0101q\\)).\\(^3\\) What shall I write of her excellences and goodness? She had perfect intelligence, and her devotion to me was such that she would have\n\n---\n\n1 Elliot (vi, 293) observes that this is a very involved and obscure passage.\n2 Blochmann, p. 418.\n3 The word \\(tiry\u0101q\\) means both opium and antidote.\nsacrificed a thousand sons and brothers for one hair of mine. She constantly wrote to Khusrau and urged him to be sincere and affectionate to me. When she saw that it was of no use and that it was unknown how far he would be led away, she from the indignation and high spirit which are inherent in the Rajput character determined upon death. Her mind was several times disturbed, for such feelings were hereditary, and her ancestors and her brothers had occasionally showed signs of madness, but after a time had recovered. At a time when I had gone hunting, on Zi-l-hijja 26th, 1013\u00b9 (May 6th, 1605), she in her agitation swallowed a quantity of opium, and quickly passed away. It was as if she had foreseen this behaviour of her unworthy son.\n\nMy first marriage and that at the commencement of my adolescence was with her. After Khusrau\u2019s birth I gave her the title of Sh\u0101h Begam. When she could not endure the bad conduct of her son and brother towards me she became disgusted with life and died, thereby escaping the present grief and sorrow. In consequence of her death, from the attachment I had for her, I passed some days without any kind of pleasure in life or existence, and for four days, which amount to 32 watches, I took nothing in the shape of food or drink. When this tale was told to my revered father, a letter of condolence of excessive kindness and affection reached this devoted disciple, and he sent me a robe of honour and the auspicious turban tied just as he had taken it off his head. This favour threw water on the flame of my grief and afforded complete quiet and repose to my unquietude and disturbance. My intention in relating these circumstances is to point out that no evil fortune is greater than when a son, through the impropriety\n\n\u00b9 Blochmann, relying on Kh\u0101fi Kh\u0101n, puts her death in 1011, and the Akbar-n\u0101ma (iii, 826) puts it in 1012. The chronogram in the Khusrau B\u0101gh yields 1012. See J.R.A.S. for July, 1907, p. 604.\nof his conduct and his unapproved methods of behaviour, causes the death of his mother and becomes contumacious and rebellious to his father, without cause or reason, but simply through his own imaginations and futile ideas, and chooses to avoid the blessing of waiting upon him. Inasmuch as the Almighty Avenger lays a proper punishment on each action, of necessity his condition finally came to this, that he was caught under the worst circumstances, and falling from a position of trust became captive to perpetual incarceration.\n\n\"When the man of sense behaves as if drunk,\nHe puts his foot in a snare, his head in a noose.\"\n\nTo sum up, on Tuesday, Z\u012bl-hijja 10th, I alighted at the station of Ho\u1e0dal.\u00b9 Shaikh Far\u012bd Bakhsh\u012b and a band of valiant men were chosen to pursue Khusrau and became the vanguard of the victorious army. I sent back D\u016bst Muhammad, who was in attendance on me, on account of his previous service and his white beard, to take charge of the fort of Agra and of the zan\u0101na and the treasuries. When leaving Agra, I had placed the city in the charge of I'tim\u0101du-d-daula and Waz\u012bru-l-mulk. I now said to D\u016bst Mu\u1e25ammad, \"As we are going to the Panjab, and that province is in the diwani of I'tim\u0101du-d-daula, you will despatch him to us, and will imprison and keep watch over the sons\u00b2 of Mirz\u0101 Mu\u1e25ammad Hak\u012bm who are in Agra; as when such proceedings manifest themselves in the son of one's loins what may one expect from nephews and cousins?\" After the dispatch of D\u016bst Mu\u1e25ammad, Mu'izzu-l-mulk became bakhshi.\n\nOn Wednesday I alighted at Palwal, and on Thursday at Farid\u0101b\u0101d; on Friday, the 13th, I reached Delhi.\n\n\u00b9 Where Lord Bellomont died in 1656. See Manucci (Irvine), i, 71.\n\u00b2 Probably this means the grandsons. At p. 329 it is mentioned that the grandsons had been confined in Gwalior up to the 16th year.\nFrom the dust of the road (i.e. immediately) I hastened to the venerated tomb of Hum\u0101y\u016bn, and there besought help in my purpose, and with my own hand distributed money to poor persons and dervishes. Thence turning to the shrine of the venerable saint Shaikh N\u012bz\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn Auliy\u0101, I performed the dues of pilgrimage. After this I gave a portion\\(^1\\) of money to Jam\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn Husain Anj\u016b and another portion to \u1e24ak\u012bm Mu\u1e93affar that they might divide it amongst the poor and dervishes. On Saturday the 14th I stayed in Sar\u0101y Narela.\\(^2\\) This rest-house (sar\u0101y) Khusrau had burned as he went.\n\nThe rank of \u0100q\u0101 Mull\u0101, brother of \u0100\u1e63af Kh\u0101n, who had been exalted by becoming my servant, was fixed in original and increase at 1,000 with 300 horse. He was in close attendance during this journey. Considering that some of the Aim\u0101qs attached to the royal army were in league with Khusrau, and fearing that consequently some fraud or sedition might enter their minds, 2,000 rupees were given to their leaders to distribute amongst their men and make them hopeful of the Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u012b favour. I gave money to Shaikh Fa\u1e93lu-llah and R\u0101ja Dhirdhar to distribute to faqirs and brahmans on the road. I gave orders that to R\u0101n\u0101 Shankar in Ajmir should be given 30,000 rupees by way of assistance for his expenditure.\n\nOn Monday, the 16th, I reached the pargana of P\u0101nipat.\\(^3\\) This station and place used to be very propitious to my gracious father and honoured ancestors, and two great victories had been gained in it. One was the defeat of Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Lod\u012b, which was won by the might of the victorious hosts of His Majesty Fird\u016bs-mak\u0101n\u012b. The story of this has been written in the histories of the time.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) P\u0101ra, qu. \u2018a heap\u2019?\n\n\\(^2\\) Narela is said to be 15\u00bd miles north-west of Delhi. William Finch, in his itinerary, mentions the stage as Nalera, a name that corresponds with Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u2019s.\n\n\\(^3\\) 53 miles north of Delhi.\nThe second victory was over the wicked Hem\u016b, and was manifested from the world of fortune in the beginning of the reign of my revered father, as has been described by me in detail.\n\nAt the time that Khusrau had left Delhi and was proceeding to Panipat, it happened that Dil\u0101war Kh\u0101n had arrived there. When shortly before Khusrau\u2019s arrival he heard of this affair, he sent his children across the Jumna and bravely determined to hasten on and throw himself into the fort of Lahore before Khusrau should arrive. About this time \u2018Abdu-r-Rah\u012bm also reached Panipat from Lahore, and Dil\u0101war Kh\u0101n suggested to him that he too should send his children across the river, and should stand aside and await the victorious standards of Jah\u0101ng\u012br. As he was lethargic and timid, he could not make up his mind to do this, and delayed so much that Khusrau arrived. He went out and waited on him, and either voluntarily or in a state of agitation agreed to accompany him. He obtained the title of Malik Anwar and the position of vizier. Dil\u0101war Kh\u0101n, like a brave man, turned towards Lahore, and on his road informed everyone and everybody of the servants of the court and the karoriy\u0101n, and the merchants whom he came across, of the exodus of Khusrau. Some he took with him, and others he told to stand aside out of the way. After that, the servants of God were relieved of the plundering by robbers and oppressors. Most probably, if Sayyid Kam\u0101l in Delhi, and Dil\u0101war Kh\u0101n at Panipat, had shown courage and determination, and had blocked Khusrau\u2019s path, his disorderly force would not have been able to resist and would have scattered, and he himself would have been captured. The fact is that their talents (himmat) were not equal to this, but afterwards each made amends for his fault, viz., Dil\u0101war Kh\u0101n, by his rapid march, entered the fort of Lahore before Khusrau reached it, and by this notable service made amends for his earlier shortcoming.\nand Sayyid Kam\u0101l manfully exerted himself in the engagement with Khusrau, as will be described in its own place.\n\nOn \u0162i-l-hijja 17th the royal standards were set up in the pargana of Karn\u0101l. Here I raised \u2018\u0100bid\u012bn Khw\u0101ja, son of Khw\u0101ja Kal\u0101n J\u016byb\u0101r\u012b and p\u012brz\u0101da (spiritual adviser), son of \u2018Abdu-llah Kh\u0101n \u00dczbeg, who had come in the time of my revered father, to the rank of 1,000. Shaikh Niz\u0101m Thaneswari, who was one of the notorious impostors (shayy\u0101d\u0101n) of the age, waited on Khusrau, and having gratified him with pleasant news, again led him out of the (right) path, and then came to wait on me. As I had heard of these transactions, I gave him his road expenses and told him to depart for the auspicious place of pilgrimage (Mecca). On the 19th the halt was in pargana Sh\u0101h\u0101b\u0101d. Here there was very little water, but it happened that heavy rain fell, so that all were rejoiced.\n\nI promoted Shaikh Al\u1e25mad L\u0101hor\u012b, who from my princedom had filled the relationship of service and discipleship and the position of a house-born one (kh\u0101naz\u0101da) to the office of Mir-i-\u2018Adl (Chief Justice). Disciples and sincere followers were presented on his introduction, and to each it was necessary to give the token and the likeness (shast\n\n---\n\n1 Instead of t\u0101za the MSS. have p\u0101ra, and the meaning seems to be that he accompanied Khusrau for some distance. In Price\u2019s Jah\u0101ng\u012br (p. 81) it is said that Niz\u0101m received 6,000 rupees.\n\n2 This is an interesting passage, because it is Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u2019s account of his father\u2019s \u2018Divine Faith.\u2019 But it is obscure, and copyists seem to have made mistakes. It is explained somewhat by the MS. used by Price (trans., pp. 82, 83), where more details are given than in the text. It is there stated that Al\u1e25mad was Mir-i-\u2018Adl of Jah\u0101ng\u012br before the latter\u2019s accession.\n\n3 The text has dast u s\u012bna (hand and bosom), but the correct words, as is shown in the I.O. MS., No. 181, are shast u shabiha or shabah, and these refer to the ring or token and the portrait given by Akbar to the followers of the \u2018Divine Faith.\u2019 See Blochmann, pp. 166 n. and 203; and Baday\u016bn\u012b, ii, 338. Ahmad appears to be the Al\u1e25mad S\u016bf\u012b of Blochmann, pp. 208, 209, and of Baday\u016bn\u012b, ii, 404, and Lowe, p. 418. He was a member of the \u2018Divine Faith.\u2019\nThey were given on his recommendation (?). At the time of initiation some words of advice were given to the disciple: he must not confuse or darken his years with sectarian quarrels, but must follow the rule of universal peace with regard to religions; he must not kill any living creature with his own hand, and must not flay anything. The only exceptions are in battle and the chase.\n\n\"Be not the practiser of making lifeless any living thing,\nSave in the battlefield or in the time of hunting.\"\n\nHonour the luminaries (the Sun, Moon, etc.), which are manifesters of God's light, according to the degree of each, and recognize the power and existence of Almighty God at all times and seasons. Be careful indeed that whether in private or in public you never for a moment forget Him.\n\n\"Lame or low\\(^1\\) or crooked or unrefined,\nBe amorous of Him and seek after Him.\"\n\nMy revered father became possessed of these principles, and was rarely void of such thoughts.\n\nAt the stage of Al\u016bwa (?)\\(^2\\) I appointed Ab\u016b-n-nab\u012b (?)\\(^3\\) \u00dczbeg with fifty-seven other mansabdars to assist Shaikh Farid, and gave the force 40,000 rupees for its expenses. To Jamil Beg were given 7,000 rupees to divide among the Aim\u0101qs (cavalry). I also presented Mir Sharif \u0100mul\u012b\\(^4\\) with 2,000 rupees.\n\nOn Tuesday the 24th of the same month they captured five of the attendants and comrades of Khusrau. Two of\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Text, p\u016bj or p\u016bch, but the manuscript reading l\u016bk is preferable. Erskine's MS. has liy, naked.\n\n\\(^2\\) Price (p. 83) has Anand or Anwand.

On Farvardin 12th of the first year of my reign, Mirz\u0101 \u1e24usain and N\u016bru-d-d\u012bn Qul\u012b the kotw\u0101l entered Lahore, and on the 24th of the same month a messenger of Dil\u0101war Kh\u0101n arrived (there) with news that Khusrau was moving on Lahore and that they should be on their guard. On the same day the city gates were guarded and strengthened, and two days later Dil\u0101war Kh\u0101n entered the fort with a few men and began to strengthen the towers and walls. Wherever these were broken and thrown down he repaired them, and, placing cannon and swivel guns on the citadel, he prepared for battle. Assembling the small number of the royal servants who were in the fort, they were assigned their several duties, and the people of the city also with loyalty gave their assistance. Two days later, and when all was ready, Khusrau arrived, and, having fixed a place for his camp, gave orders to invest\\(^1\\) the city and to prepare for battle, and to burn one of the gates on any side where one could be got at. \u201cAfter taking the fort,\u201d he said to his wicked crew, \u201cI will give orders to plunder the city for seven days and to make captive the women and children.\u201d\n\nThis doomed lot set fire to a gate, and Dil\u0101war Beg Kh\u0101n, \u1e24usain Beg the diw\u0101n, and N\u016bru-d-d\u012bn Qul\u012b the kotwal built a wall inside opposite the gateway.\n\nMeantime Sa\u02bfid Kh\u0101n, who was one of those appointed to Kashmir and was now encamped on the Chen\u0101b, having heard the news, started rapidly for Lahore. When he reached the Ravi he sent word to the garrison of the fort that he came with a loyal intention and that they should admit him. They sent someone at night and conducted him and some of his men inside. When the siege had\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The text has *qail* by mistake for *qabl*.\nlasted nine days, news of the approach of the royal army came repeatedly to Khusrau and his adherents. They became helpless (b\u012b p\u0101), and made up their minds that they must face the victorious army.\n\nAs Lahore is one of the greatest places in Hindustan, a great number of people gathered in six or seven days. It was reported on good authority that 10,000 or 12,000 horse were collected, and had left the city with the view of making a night attack on the royal vanguard. This news was brought to me at the sar\u0101y of Q\u0101\u1e93i \u2018Al\u012b on the night of Thursday the 16th. Although it rained heavily in the night I beat the drum of march and mounted. Arriving in Sul\u1e6d\u0101np\u016br at dawn I remained there till noon. By chance, at this place and hour the victorious army encountered that ill-fated band. Mu\u2018izzu-l-mulk had brought a dish of roast meat,\\(^1\\) and I was turning towards it with zest when the news of the battle was brought to me. Though I had a longing to eat the roast meat, I immediately took a mouthful by way of augury and mounted, and without waiting for the coming up of men and without regard to the smallness of my force I went off in all haste. However much I demanded my chiltah (wadded coat), they did not produce it. My only arms were a spear and sword, but I committed myself to the favour of God and started off without hesitation. At first my escort did not number more than fifty horsemen; no one had expected a fight that day. In fine, when I reached the head of the bridge of Gobindw\u0101l,\\(^2\\) 400 or 500 horse, good and bad, had come together. When I had crossed the bridge the news of a victory was brought to me. The bearer of the good news was Shams\u012b, t\u016bshakch\u012b (wardrobe man), and for his good news he obtained the title of\n\n\\(^1\\) Biry\u0101n\u012b. See Blochmann, p. 60.\n\n\\(^2\\) The Gundv\u0101l of Tiefenthaler, i, 113. Cunningham, in his history of the Sikhs, spells it Go\u012bndw\u0101l. It is on the Beas.\nKh\u016bsh-khabar Kh\u0101n. Mir Jam\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn \u1e24usain, whom I had sent previously to advise Khusrau, came up at the same time and said such things about the number and bravery of Khusrau\u2019s men as frightened his hearers. Though news of the victory came continuously, this simple-minded Sayyid would not believe it, and expressed incredulity that such an army as he had seen could be defeated by Shaikh Farid\u2019s force, which was small and not properly equipped. When they brought Khusrau\u2019s litter\\(^1\\) with two of his eunuchs, the Mir admitted what had happened. Then, alighting from his horse, he placed his head at my feet and professed every kind of humility and submission, and said that there could be no higher or more lofty fortune than this.\n\nIn this command Shaikh Farid behaved with sincerity and devotion. The Sayyids of B\u0101rha, who are of the brave ones of the age, and who have held this place in every fight in which they have been, formed the van. Saif Kh\u0101n, son of Sayyid Mahm\u016bd Kh\u0101n B\u0101rha, the head of the tribe, had shown great bravery and had received seventeen wounds. Sayyid Jal\u0101l, also of the brethren of this band, received an arrow in his temple and died a few days later. At the time when the Sayyids of B\u0101rha, who were not more than fifty or sixty in number, having received wounds from 1,500 Badakhshi horsemen, had been cut to pieces, Sayyid Kam\u0101l, who, with his brothers, had been appointed to support the van, came up on the flank and fought with wondrous bravery and manliness. After that the men of the right wing raised the cry of P\u0101dsh\u0101h sal\u0101mat (\u201cLong live the King\u201d) and charged, and the rebels hearing the words, gave up and scattered abroad to various hiding-places. About 400 Aim\u0101qs became crushed on the plain of anger and overcome by the\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The text has singh\u0101san instead of sukh\u0101san.

Khusrau\u2019s box of jewels and precious things which he had always with him, fell into our hands.\n\n\"Who thought that this boy of few years Would behave so badly to his sire? At the first taste of the cup he brings up the lees. He melts away my glory and his own modesty. He sets on fire\\(^1\\) the throne of Kh\u016brsh\u012bd, He longs for the place of Jamsh\u012bd.\"\n\nShort-sighted men in Allahabad had urged me also to rebel against my father. Their words were extremely unacceptable and disapproved by me. I know what sort of endurance a kingdom would have, the foundations of which were laid on hostility to a father, and was not moved by the evil counsels of such worthless men, but acting according to the dictates of reason and knowledge I waited on my father, my guide, my qibla,\\(^2\\) and my visible God, and as a result of this good purpose it went well with me.\n\nIn the evening of the day of Khusrau\u2019s flight I gave R\u0101ja B\u0101so, who is a trusty zamindar of the hill-country of Lahore, leave to go to that frontier, and, wherever he heard news or trace of Khusrau, to make every effort to capture him. I also appointed Mah\u0101bat Kh\u0101n and M\u012brz\u0101 \u2018Al\u012b Akbarsh\u0101h\u012b to a large force, which was to pursue Khusrau in whatever direction he might go. I resolved with myself that if Khusrau went to Kabul, I would follow him and not turn back till he was captured. If not delaying in Kabul he should go on to Badakhshan and those regions, I would leave Mah\u0101bat Kh\u0101n in Kabul and return myself (to India). My reason for not going to Badakhshan was that that wretch would (in that case) certainly ally himself with the \u016azbegs, and the disgrace would attach to this State.\n\n\\(^1\\) Instead of the bas\u016bz\u0101n\u0101d of the text, the MSS. have b\u0101sh\u016br\u0101n\u0101d, he defiles. In the last line they have j\u0101y instead of takht.\n\n\\(^2\\) I.e. the place to which to turn in prayer.\nOn the day on which the royal troops were ordered to pursue Khusrau, 15,000 rupees were given to Mah\u0101bat Kh\u0101n and 20,000 to the ahadis, and 10,000 more were sent with the army to be given to whom it might be necessary to give it on the way.\n\nOn Saturday, the 28th, the victorious camp was pitched at Jaip\u0101l,\u00b9 which lies seven kos from Lahore. On the same day Khusrau arrived with a few men on the bank of the Chen\u0101b. The brief account of what had happened is that after his defeat those who had escaped with him from the battle became divided in opinion. The Afghans and Indians, who were mostly his old retainers, wished to double back like foxes into Hindustan, and to become a source of rebellion and trouble there. \u1e24usain Beg, whose people and family and treasure were in the direction of Kabul, suggested going to Kabul. In the end, as action was taken according to the wish of \u1e24usain Beg, the Hindustanis and the Afghans decided to separate themselves from him. On arriving at the Chen\u0101b, he proposed to cross at the ferry of Sh\u0101hp\u016br, which is one of the recognized crossings, but as he could find no boats there he made for the ferry of Sodharah, where his people got one boat without boatmen and another full of firewood and grass.\n\nThe ferries over the rivers had been stopped because before Khusrau\u2019s defeat orders had been given to all the jagirdars and the superintendents of roads and crossings in the subah of the Panjab that as this kind of dispute had arisen they must all be on the alert. \u1e24usain Beg wished to transfer the men from the boat with firewood and grass to the other, so that they might convey Khusrau across. At this juncture arrived Kil\u0101n,\u00b2 son-in-law of Kam\u0101l\n\n\u00b9 Elliot (vi, 299) has Jah\u0101n, and the word in the MSS. does not look like Jaip\u0101l.\n\u00b2 This word appears to be a mistake; it is not in the MSS.\nChaudhari of Sodharah, and saw a body of men about to cross in the night. He cried out to the boatmen that there was an order from the king Jah\u0101ng\u012br forbidding unknown men from crossing in the night, and that they must be careful. Owing to the noise and uproar, the people of the neighbourhood gathered together, and Kam\u0101l\u2019s son-in-law took from the boatmen the pole with which they propel the boat, and which in Hindustani is called ball\u012b, and thus made the boat unmanageable. Although money was offered to the boatmen, not one would ferry them over. News went to Ab\u016b-l-Q\u0101sim Namak\u012bn, who was at Gujarat, near the Chen\u0101b, that a body of men were wanting to cross the river by night, and he at once came to the ferry in the night with his sons and some horsemen. Things went to such a length that \u1e24usain Beg shot arrows at the boatmen,\u00b9 and Kam\u0101l\u2019s son-in-law also took to shooting arrows from the river-bank. For four kos the boat took its own way down the river, until at the end of the night it grounded, and try as they would they could not get it off. Meantime it became day. Ab\u016b-l-Q\u0101sim and Khw\u0101ja Khizr Kh\u0101n, who by the efforts of Hil\u0101l Kh\u0101n had assembled on this (? the west) side of the river, fortified its west bank, and the zamindars fortified it on the east.\n\nBefore this affair of \u1e2ausrau\u2019s, I had sent Hil\u0101l Kh\u0101n as saz\u0101wal to the army appointed for Kashmir under Sa\u02bf\u012bd Kh\u0101n, and by chance he arrived in the neighbourhood (of the ferry) that same night; he came in the nick of time, and his efforts had great effect in bringing together Ab\u016b-l-Q\u0101sim Kh\u0101n Namak\u012bn, and Khw\u0101ja Khizr Kh\u0101n in the capture of \u1e2ausrau.\n\nOn the morning of Sunday, the 24th of the aforesaid month, people on elephants and in boats captured \u1e2ausrau, and on Monday, the last day of the month, news of this\n\n\u00b9 When the boat stuck, the boatmen swam ashore, and it was probably then that \u1e24usain shot at them. See Blochmann, p. 414, n. 2.\nreached me in the garden of Mirz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n. I immediately ordered the Am\u012bru-l-umar\u0101 to go to Gujarat and to bring Khusrau to wait on me.\n\nIn counsels on State affairs and government it often happens that I act according to my own judgment and prefer my own counsel to that of others. In the first instance I had elected to wait on my revered father from Allahabad in opposition to the advice of my faithful servants, and I obtained the blessing of serving him, and this was for my spiritual and temporal good. By the same course of conduct I had become king. The second instance was the pursuit of Khusrau, from which I was not held back by taking time to ascertain the (auspicious) hour, etc., and from which I took no rest until I captured him. It is a strange thing that after I had started I asked \u1e24ak\u012bm \u2018Ali, who is learned in mathematics, how the hour of my departure had been (i.e. whether propitious or not), and he replied that in order to obtain my object if I had wished to select an hour, there could not have been for years one selected better than that in which I mounted.\n\nOn Thursday, Mu\u1e25arram 3rd, 1015, in Mirz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n\u2019s garden, they brought Khusrau before me with his hands tied and chains on his legs from the left side\\(^1\\) after the manner and custom of Chingiz Kh\u0101n. They made \u1e24usain Beg stand on his right hand and \u2018Abdu-r-Ra\u1e25\u012bm on his left. Khusrau stood weeping and trembling between them. \u1e24usain Beg, with the idea that it might profit him, began to speak wildly. When his purport became apparent to me I did not allow him to continue talking, but handed over Khusrau in chains, and ordered these two villains to be put in the skins of an ox and an ass, and that they\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) \u201cWith a chain fastened from his left hand to his left foot, according to the law of Chingiz Kh\u0101n\u201d (Gladwin\u2019s Jah\u0101ng\u012br, quoted by Elliot, vi, 507). But apparently what is meant is that Khusrau was led up from the left side of the emperor.\nshould be mounted on asses with their faces to the tail\\(^1\\) and thus taken round the city. As the ox-hide dried more quickly than that of the ass, \u1e24usain Beg remained alive for four watches and died from suffocation. \u2018Abdu-r-Ra\u1e25\u012bm, who was in the ass\u2019s skin and to whom they gave some refreshment from outside, remained alive.\n\nFrom Monday, the last day of \u0162\u012b-l-hijja, until the 9th of Mu\u1e25arram of the aforesaid year, I remained in Mirz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n\u2019s garden because the time was unpropitious.\\(^2\\) I bestowed Bhairawal,\\(^3\\) where the battle had taken place, on Shaikh Far\u012bd, and rewarded him with the high title of Murtaz\u0101 Kh\u0101n. For the sake of good government I ordered posts to be set up on both sides of the road from the garden to the city, and ordered them to hang up and impale the seditious Aim\u0101qs and others who had taken part in the rebellion. Thus each one of them received an extraordinary punishment. I gave headship to those landholders who had shown loyalty, and to every one of the Chaudharis between the Jhelam and the Chen\u0101b I gave lands for their support.\n\nOf \u1e24usain Beg\u2019s property there were obtained from the house of M\u012br Mu\u1e25ammad B\u0101q\u012b nearly seven lakhs of rupees. This was exclusive of what he had made over to other places and of what he had with him. After this, whenever his name is mentioned, the words\\(^4\\) g\u0101w\u0101n u khar\u0101n\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Du Jarric, in his history of the Jesuit Missions, gives some details about the punishment. The bullock and ass were slaughtered on the spot and their skins were sewed on the bodies of the unhappy men. Horns and ears were left on the skins.\n\n\\(^2\\) Perhaps the meaning is that the weather was bad.\n\n\\(^3\\) The proper form seems to be Bhaironw\u0101l, the Bhyrowal of the maps. It is on the right bank of the Bi\u0101h (Beas) on the road from Jalandhar to Amritsar. See Blochmann, p. 414, note.\n\n\\(^4\\) The words are omitted in the text. Erskine read in his MS. g\u0101n jizwan, which I do not understand. The I.O. MSS. and B.M. MS. Or 3276 have g\u0101w\u0101n u khar\u0101n. \u1e24usain Beg, whose proper name was \u1e24asan, was a brave soldier, and did good service under Akbar. See his biography in Blochmann, p. 454.\n(bullocks and asses) will be used. When he came to this Court in company with Mirz\u0101 Sh\u0101hrukh he had one horse. By degrees his affairs flourished so that he became possessed of treasure both visible and buried, and projects of this kind entered his mind.\n\nWhile Khusrau\u2019s affair was still in the will of God, as there was no actual governor between Afghanistan and Agra, which is a source of sedition and mischief, and, fearing that Khusrau\u2019s affair might be prolonged, I ordered my son Parwiz to leave some of the sardars to look after the R\u0101n\u0101 and to come to Agra with \u0100\u1e63af Kh\u0101n and a body of those nearly connected with him in the service. He was to consider the protection and management of that region his special charge. But by the blessed favour of Allah, Khusrau\u2019s affair was settled before Parwiz arrived in Agra; I accordingly ordered my aforesaid son to come and wait on me.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mu\u1e25arram 8th, I auspiciously entered the fort of Lahore. A number of loyalists represented to me that my return to Agra would be for the good of the State at this time when much was going amiss in Gujarat, in the Deccan, and in Bengal. This counsel did not meet with my approval, for the reports of Sh\u0101h Beg Kh\u0101n, the governor of Qandahar, showed that the officers of the Persian border were meditating an attack on that fortress. They had been moved thereto by the machinations of the residuum of the Mirzas of Qandahar\u2019s army, which was always shaking the chain of contention. The Persian officers had written letters to these malcontents, and there was likelihood of a disturbance. It occurred to me that the death of His Majesty Akbar and the unreasonable outbreak of Khusrau might put an edge on their design, and that they might attack Qandahar. What had occurred to my mind became a realized fact. The governor of Far\u0101h, the Malik of S\u012bstan, and the jagirdars of that neighbourhood, with the assistance of \u1e24usain Kh\u0101n, the\ngovernor of Herat, invaded Qandahar. Praise is due to the manliness and courage of Sh\u0101h Beg Kh\u0101n, who planted his foot firmly like a man, and strengthened the fort, and seated himself on the top of the third (?) citadel of the aforesaid fort in such a manner that outsiders could see his entertainments. During the siege he girded not his loins, but with bare head and feet arranged parties of pleasure; yet no day passed that he did not send a force from the fort to meet the foe and did not make manly efforts. This went on as long as he was in the fort. The Qizilb\u0101sh army had invested on three sides. When news of this reached Lahore it was clearly advisable to remain in that neighbourhood. A large force was immediately appointed under the leadership of Mirz\u0101 Gh\u0101zi, who was accompanied by a number of men of rank and servants of the Court, such as Qar\u0101 Beg and Tukhta Beg, who had been promoted with the titles of Qar\u0101 Kh\u0101n and Sard\u0101r Kh\u0101n. I appointed Mirz\u0101 Gh\u0101zi to a mansab of 5,000 personal, and horsemen, and bestowed drums on him. Mirz\u0101 Gh\u0101zi was the son of Mirz\u0101 J\u0101n\u012b Tarkh\u0101n, king of Thathah (Sind), and by the efforts of \u2018Abdu-r-Ra\u1e25\u012bm Kh\u0101nkhan\u0101n that country had been conquered in the reign of the late king. The country of Thathah was included in his jagir, and he held the rank with personality and horsemen of 5,000. After his death his son Mirz\u0101 Gh\u0101zi was raised to his rank and service. Their ancestors were among the amirs of Sult\u0101n \u1e24usain Mirza B\u0101y-qar\u0101, the ruler of Khurasan, and they were originally descended from the amirs of Tim\u016br (\u1e62\u0101\u1e25ib-qir\u0101n\u012b). Khw\u0101ja \u2018\u0100qil was appointed bakhshi of this army; 43,000 rupees were given to Qar\u0101 Kh\u0101n for road expenses, and 15,000 to Naqdi Beg and Qilij Beg, who were to accompany Mirz\u0101 Gh\u0101zi. I determined to stay at Lahore in order to settle this matter and with the intention of a tour to Kabul. About this time the rank of \u1e24ak\u012bm Fathu-llah was fixed, original and increased, at 1,000 personality and 300 horse. As Shaikh \u1e24usain J\u0101m\u012b had\nhad dreams about me which had come true, I gave him twenty lakhs of dams, equivalent to 30,000 or 40,000 rupees, for the expenses of himself and his monastery and the dervishes who were with him. On the 22nd I promoted \u2018Abdu-llah Kh\u0101n to the rank of 2,500 personal and 500 horse, original and increased. I ordered to be given to the ahadis two lakhs of rupees to be paid in advance and deducted by degrees from their monthly pay. I bestowed 6,000 rupees on Q\u0101sim Beg Kh\u0101n, the son-in-law of Sh\u0101h Beg Kh\u0101n, and 3,000 rupees on Sayyid Bah\u0101dur Kh\u0101n.\n\nIn Gobindw\u0101l, which is on the river Biy\u0101h (Beas), there was a Hindu named Arjun,\\(^1\\) in the garments of sainthood and sanctity, so much so that he had captured many of the simple-hearted of the Hindus, and even of the ignorant and foolish followers of Islam, by his ways and manners; and they had loudly sounded the drum of his holiness. They called him G\u016br\u016b, and from all sides stupid people crowded to worship and manifest complete faith in him. For three or four generations (of spiritual successors) they had kept this shop warm. Many times it occurred to me to put a stop to this vain affair or to bring him into the assembly of the people of Islam.\n\nAt last when Khusrau passed along this road this insignificant fellow proposed to wait upon him. Khusrau happened to halt at the place where he was, and he came out and did homage to him. He behaved to Khusrau in certain special ways, and made on his forehead a finger-mark in saffron, which the Indians (Hinduw\u0101n) call qashqa,\\(^2\\) and is considered propitious. When this came to my ears and I clearly understood his folly, I ordered them\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The fifth G\u016br\u016b of the Sikhs and the compiler of the Granth. He was the father of Har Govind. See Sayyid Mu\u1e25ammad La\u1e6d\u012bf\u2019s history of the Panj\u0101b, p. 253. Arjun\u2019s tomb is in Lahore.\n\n\\(^2\\) But qashqa is a Turkish word. The Hindi phrase seems to be \u1e6dik\u0101.\nto produce him and handed over his houses, dwelling-places, and children to Murtaza Khan, and having confiscated his property commanded that he should be put to death.\n\nThere were two men named Raj\u016b and Amb\u0101, who, under the shadow of the protection of the eunuch Daulat Khan, made their livelihood by oppression and tyranny, and had done many acts of oppression in the few days that Khusrau was before Lahore. I ordered Raj\u016b to the gallows and a fine to be taken from Amb\u0101, who was reputed to be wealthy. In short, 15,000 rupees were collected from him, which sum I ordered them to expend on bulghur-khanas (refectories) and in charity.\n\nSa\u2019dullah Khan, son of Sa\u2019d Khan, was promoted to the rank of 2,000 personal and 1,000 horse.\n\nIn his great desire to wait upon me, Parwiz traversed long distances in a short time, in the rainy season and incessant rain, and on Thursday, the 29th, when two watches and three ghari of day had passed, obtained the blessing of seeing me. With exceeding kindness and affection, I took him into the embrace of favour and kissed his forehead.\n\nWhen this disgraceful conduct showed itself in Khusrau, I had resolved not to delay in any place till I had captured him. There was a probability that he might turn back towards Hindustan, so it appeared impolitic to leave Agra empty, as it was the centre of the State, the abode of the ladies of the holy harem, and the depository of the world\u2019s treasures. On these accounts I had written when leaving Agra to Parwiz, saying that his loyalty had had this result, that Khusrau had fled and that Fortune had turned her face toward himself; that I had started in pursuit of Khusrau, and that he should consequently dispose of the affairs of the R\u0101n\u0101 in some way according to the necessity of the time, and for the benefit of the kingdom should himself come quickly to\nAgra. I had delivered into his charge the capital and treasury, which was equal to the wealth of Q\u0101r\u016bn,\\(^1\\) and I had commended him to the God of power. Before this letter reached Parwiz, the R\u0101n\u0101 had been so humbled that he had sent to \u0100\u1e63af Kh\u0101n to say that as by his own acts he had come to shame and disgrace, he hoped that he would intercede for him in such a way that the prince would be content with his sending B\u0101gha,\\(^2\\) who was one of his sons. Parwiz had not agreed to this, and said that either the R\u0101n\u0101 himself should come or that he should send Karan. Meantime the news of Khusrau\u2019s disturbance arrived, and on its account \u0100\u1e63af Kh\u0101n and other loyalists agreed to the coming of B\u0101gha, who obtained the blessing of waiting on the prince near Mandalg\u0101r.\n\nParwiz, leaving R\u0101ja Jagann\u0101th and most of the chiefs of his army, started for Agra with \u0100\u1e63af Kh\u0101n and some of those near to him and his own attendants, and with him brought B\u0101gha to the Court. When he came near Agra he heard the news of the victory over Khusrau and his capture, and after resting two days an order reached him that as matters appeared settled in all quarters he should betake himself to me, in order that on the prescribed date he might obtain the good fortune of waiting on me. I bestowed on him the parasol (aft\u0101b-g\u012br),\\(^3\\) which is one of the signs of royalty, and I gave him the rank of 10,000 and sent an order to the officials to grant him a tankhw\u0101h jagir. At this time I sent Mirz\u0101 \u2018Ali Beg to Kashmir; 10,000 rupees were delivered to Q\u0101\u1e93i \u2018Izzatu-llah to divide amongst faqirs and the poor of Kabul. Al\u1e25mad Beg Kh\u0101n was promoted to the rank of 2,000 personal and 1,250 horse, original and extra. At the same time Muqarrab Kh\u0101n, who had been sent to Burhanpur to bring the children of D\u0101niy\u0101l, returned after an absence of 6 months\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The cousin of Moses, famous for his wealth; the Korah of the Bible.\n\n\\(^2\\) Gladwin has N\u0101gh.\n\n\\(^3\\) Blochmann, p. 50.\n22 days and had the honour of an audience, and related in detail what had occurred in those regions.\n\nSaif Kh\u0101n was promoted to the rank of 2,000 personal and 1,000 horse. Shaikh \u2018Abdu-l-Wahh\u0101b\\(^1\\) of the Bukhara sayyids, who was governor of Delhi under the late king, was dismissed from the post (by me) for certain ill-deeds done by his men, and was entered amongst the holders of subsistence lands and the arb\u0101b-i-sa\u2018\u0101dat.\n\nIn the whole of the hereditary dominions, both the crown lands and the jagirs, I ordered the preparation of bulghur-kh\u0101nas (free eating-houses), where cooked food might be provided for the poor according to their condition, and so that residents and travellers both might reap the benefit.\n\nAmba\\(^2\\) Kh\u0101n Kashmiri, who was of the stock of the rulers of Kashmir, was selected for the rank of 1,000 personal and 300 horse. On Monday, Rabi\u2018u-l-\u0101khir 9th, I gave Parwiz a special sword; and jewelled swords were presented also to Qutbu-d-din Kh\u0101n Koka and the Amiru-l-umar\u0101. I saw D\u0101niy\u0101l\u2019s children, whom Muqarrab Kh\u0101n had brought; there were three sons and four daughters. The boys bore the names Tahm\u016bra\u1e63,\\(^3\\) B\u0101y-sunghar, and H\u016bshang. Such kindness and affection were shown by me to these children as no one thought possible. I resolved that Tahm\u016bra\u1e63, who was the eldest, should always be in waiting on me, and the others were handed over to the charge of my own sisters.\n\nA special dress of honour was sent to R\u0101ja M\u0101n Singh in Bengal. I ordered a reward of 30 lakhs of dams to Mirz\u0101 Gh\u0101zi. I bestowed on Shaikh Ibr\u0101him, son of\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Akbar-n\u0101ma, iii, 748, and Blochmann, p. 546. He was a man of piety and learning, and Jah\u0101ng\u012br means that he restored him to his former quiet life. The arb\u0101b-i-sa\u2018\u0101dat, or auspicious persons, were those who offered up prayers for the king\u2019s prosperity and other blessings.\n\n\\(^2\\) Amba was killed later by N\u016br-Jah\u0101n\u2019s husband, Sh\u012br Afgan (T\u016bzuk, pp. 54, 55).\n\n\\(^3\\) Blochmann, p. 310.\nQu\u1e6dbu-d-din Kh\u0101n Koka, the rank of 1,000 personal and 300 horse, and dignified him with the title of Kishwar Kh\u0101n.\n\nAs when I started in pursuit of Khusrav I had left my son Khurram in charge of the palaces and treasury, I now, when that affair had been settled, ordered the said son to attend upon Hazrat Maryam-zam\u0101n\u012b and the other ladies, and to escort them to me. When they reached the neighbourhood of Lahore, on Friday the 12th of the month mentioned, I embarked in a boat and went to a village named Dahr to meet my mother, and I had the good fortune to be received by her. After the performance of obeisance and prostration and greeting which is due from the young to the old according to the custom of Chingiz, the rules of Tim\u016br and common usage, and after worship of the King of the World (God), and after finishing this business, I obtained leave to return, and re-entered the fort of Lahore.\n\nOn the 17th, having appointed Mu\u02bfizzu-l-mulk bakhshi of the army against the R\u0101n\u0101, I dismissed him to it. As news had come of the rebellion of R\u0101y R\u0101y Singh and his son, Dulip, in the neighbourhood of N\u0101gor, I ordered R\u0101ja Jagann\u0101th to proceed against them with others of the servants of the State and Mu\u02bfizzu-l-mulk, and to put a stop to this disturbance. I gave 50,000 rupees to Sard\u0101r Kh\u0101n, who had been appointed to the place of Sh\u0101h Beg Kh\u0101n as Governor of Qandahar, and I promoted him to the rank of 3,000 personal and 2,500 horse. To Khizr Kh\u0101n, the late ruler of Khandesh, were given 3,000 rupees, and to his brother, Ahmad Kh\u0101n, who is one of the kh\u0101naz\u0101das of the State. H\u0101shim Kh\u0101n, son of Q\u0101sim Kh\u0101n, who is one of the house-born of the State, and\n\n---\n\n1 These words are not in the MSS., and they seem to have crept into the text by mistake and to be a premature entry of words relating to H\u0101shim, etc. The brother of the former ruler (or king) of Khandesh could hardly be a kh\u0101naz\u0101d.\nworthy of advancement, I promoted to the rank of 2,500 personal and 1,500 horse. I gave him also one of my own horses. I sent robes of honour to eight individuals amongst the nobles of the army of the Deccan.\\(^1\\) Five thousand rupees were given to Ni\u1e93\u0101m of Shiraz, the storyteller. Three thousand rupees were given for the expenses of the bulgh\u016br-kh\u0101na of Kashmir to the wak\u012bl of Mirz\u0101 \u2018Al\u012b Beg, the governor of that place, to send to Srinagar. I presented a jewelled dagger of the value of 6,000 rupees to Qu\u1e6db\u016b-d-d\u012bn Kh\u0101n.\n\nNews reached me that Shaikh Ibr\u0101h\u012bm B\u0101b\u0101, the Afghan, had opened a religious establishment (lit. one of being a shaikh and having disciples) in one of the parganas\\(^2\\) of Lahore, and as his doings were disreputable and foolish a considerable number of Afghans had collected round him. I ordered him to be brought and handed over to Parw\u012bz to be kept in the fort of Chunar; so this vain disturbance was put an end to.\n\nOn Sunday, 7th Jum\u0101d\u0101-l-awwal, many of the mansabdars and ahadis were promoted: Mah\u0101bat Kh\u0101n obtained the rank of 2,000 personal and 1,300 horse, Dil\u0101war Kh\u0101n 2,000 personal and 1,400 horse, Waziru-l-mulk 1,300 personal and 550 horse, Qayy\u0101m Kh\u0101n 1,000 personal and horse, Shy\u0101m Singh 1,500 personal and 1,200 horse; in the same way forty-two mansabdars were promoted. On most days the same observances occur. I presented Parw\u012bz with a ruby of the value of 25,000 rupees. On Wednesday the 9th of the aforesaid month, the 21st of Shahr\u012bwar,\\(^3\\) after three watches and four gharis, the feast for my solar weighing, which is the commencement of the 38th year of my age, took place. According to custom they got ready\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) This should be, according to the MSS., \u201carmy against the R\u0101n\u0101,\u201d not army of the Deccan.\n\n\\(^2\\) The MSS. have \u201cin the neighbourhood of Lahore.\u201d Parw\u012bz had then charge of Bihar.\n\n\\(^3\\) Text, wrongly, Bahman. Jah\u0101ng\u012br was born on the 21st of Shahr\u012bwar.\nthe weighing apparatus and the scales in the house of Maryam-zam\u0101n\u012b (his mother). At the moment appointed blessings were invoked and I sate in the scales. Each suspending rope was held by an elderly person who offered up prayers. The first time the weight in gold came to three Hindustani maunds and ten seers. After this I was weighed against several metals, perfumes, and essences, up to twelve weighings, the details of which will be given hereafter. Twice a year I weigh myself against gold and silver and other metals, and against all sorts of silks and cloths, and various grains, etc., once at the beginning of the solar year and once at that of the lunar. The weight of the money of the two weighings I hand over to the different treasurers for faqirs and those in want. On the same auspicious day I promoted Q\u016b\u1e6dbu-d-d\u012bn Kh\u0101n Koka, who for many years had expected such a day,\\(^1\\) with various favours. First, I gave him the rank of 5,000 personal and horse, and with this a special robe of honour, a jewelled sword, and one of my own horses, with a jewelled saddle, and I gave him leave to go to the subahdarship of the province of Bengal and Orissa, which is a place for 50,000 horse. As a mark of honour he set off accompanied by a large force, and two lakhs of rupees were given him as a sumptuary allowance. My connection with his mother is such that as in my childhood I was under her guardianship and care, I have not so much affection for my own mother as for her. She is to me my gracious mother, and I do not hold him less dear than my own brothers and children. Q\u016b\u1e6dbu-d-d\u012bn is the foster-brother who is most fit for fosterage. I gave 300,000 rupees to his auxiliaries. On this day I sent 130,000 as a marriage present (s\u0101ch\u012bq) for the daughter of Pah\u0101r\u012b (his brother Mur\u0101d), who had been betrothed to Parwiz.\n\n\\(^1\\) Apparently, had long looked forward to the happy day when Jah\u0101ng\u012br should be weighed as a king.\nOn the 22nd, B\u0101z Bah\u0101dur Qalm\u0101q, who had long been guilty of evil practices in Bengal, by the guidance of fortune obtained the honour of kissing my threshold. I gave him a jewelled dagger, 8,000 rupees, and promoted him to the rank of 1,000 personal and horse. One lakh of rupees and cash and jewels were bestowed on Parwiz. Kesho D\u0101s M\u0101r\u016b was promoted to the grade of 1,500 personal and horse. Ab\u016b-l-\u1e25asan, who had been the diwan and factotum of my brother D\u0101niy\u0101l, together with his children,\u00b9 had the honour of an audience, and was raised to the rank of 1,000 personal and 500 horse. On the 1st of the second Jum\u0101d\u0101 Shaikh B\u0101yaz\u012bd,\u00b2 who was one of the shaikhz\u0101das of Sikri, well known for brilliance of understanding and knowledge, and the connection of old service,\u00b3 was honoured with the title of Mu\u2019azzam Kh\u0101n, and to him I gave the government of Delhi. On the 21st of the same month I presented Parwiz with a necklace composed of four rubies and one hundred pearls. The rank of \u1e24ak\u012bm Mu\u1e93affar was fixed at 3,000 personal and 1,000 horse, original and extra. I gave 5,000 rupees to Nathu M\u0101l(?), R\u0101ja of Manjh\u014dli.\u2074\n\nA remarkable occurrence was the discovery, of a letter from M\u012brz\u0101 \u2018Az\u012bz Koka to \u2018Al\u012b Kh\u0101n, the ruler of Khandesh. I had had an impression that he had a particular enmity to me on Khusrau\u2019s account, who was his son-in-law. From the discovery of this writing it became clear that he had never given up his innate treachery, and had adopted this unbecoming attitude towards my revered father also. In short, this letter which he had written at some time to R\u0101ja \u2018Al\u012b Kh\u0101n\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 Perhaps the meaning is that he was introduced along with D\u0101niy\u0101l\u2019s children.\n\u00b2 Blochmann, p. 492.\n\u00b3 This refers to his parentage.\n\u2074 In the MSS. this name seems to be Bh\u012bm Mal. Manjh\u014dli is written Manjholah in Blochmann, p. 175.\nwas from beginning to end full of abuse and disapprobation, and said things which no enemy even could have written and such as could not be attributed to anyone, and far less to one like His Majesty, 'Arsh-\u0101shy\u0101n\u012b, a king and an appreciative sovereign, who from childhood had educated him and brought him up because of what was due for services rendered by his mother, and raised the standard of reliance on him to such a high degree as no other person possessed. This letter fell into the hands of Khw\u0101ja Ab\u016b-l-\u1e25asan in Burhanpur amongst the property of Raja \u2018Al\u012b Kh\u0101n. He brought and laid it before me. In reading and seeing it the hair on my limbs stood on end. But for the consideration and due recognition of the fact that his mother had given her milk to my father I could have killed him with my own hand. Having procured his attendance I gave the letter into his hand and told him to read it with a loud voice to those present. When he saw the letter I thought his body would have parted from his soul, but with shamelessness and impudence he read it as though he had not written it and was reading it by order. Those present in that paradise-like assembly of the servants of Akbar and Jah\u0101ngir and heard the letter read, loosened the tongue of reproach and of curses and abuse. I put the question to him, \"Leaving aside the treacheries which in reliance on your worthless self you contrived against my fortune, what was done to you by my father, who raised you and your family from the dust of the road to such wealth and dignity as to make you the envy of your contemporaries, that you should write these things to the enemies of his Empire? Why did you enrol yourself amongst the wicked and disloyal? Truly, what can one make of an original nature and innate disposition? Since your temperament has been nourished by the water of treachery, what else can spring up but such actions? Passing over what you did to myself, I gave you the rank you had held before, thinking that your treachery\nwas directed against me only. Since it has become known that you behaved in a similar way to your benefactor and visible Deity, I leave you to the thoughts and actions which you formerly had and still have.\u201d After these remarks his lips closed, and he was unable to make any reply. What could he have said in the presence of such disgrace? I gave an order to deprive him of his jagir. Although what this ingrate had done was unpardonable, yet in the end, from certain considerations, I passed it over.\n\nOn Sunday the 26th of the above-mentioned month was held the marriage feast of Parwiz and the daughter of Prince Mur\u0101d. The ceremony was performed in the house of Her Highness Maryam-zam\u0101n\u012b. The entertainment was arranged in the house of Parwiz, and all who were present were exalted with all kinds of honour and civilities. Nine thousand rupees were handed over to Sharif \u0100muli and other nobles, to be given in alms to faqirs and other poor people.\n\nOn Sunday the 10th Rajab I left the city to hunt in Girjhak and Nandana,\u00b9 and took up my quarters in the garden of R\u0101m D\u0101s, where I remained four days.\n\nOn Wednesday the 13th the solar weighing of Parwiz took place. They weighed him twelve times against various metals and other things, and each weighing came to two maunds and eighteen seers. I ordered the whole to be distributed amongst faqirs. At this time the rank of Shajn\u0101t Kh\u0101n was fixed at 1,500 personal and 700 horse, original and extra.\n\nAfter the march of Mirz\u0101 Gh\u0101zi and his force it occurred to me to send a second contingent after him. Having bestowed on Bah\u0101dur\u00b2 Kh\u0101n Q\u016brbeg\u012b the rank of 1,500 personal and 800 horse, original and extra, I started off\n\n\u00b9 ? Nandanpur. These places are in Sindsag\u0101r, near Mult\u0101n.\n\u00b2 MS. 181 has Bah\u0101r, and it has 600 instead of 800 horse.\na body of cavalry,\\(^1\\) which came to about 3,000, with him under the leadership of Sh\u0101h Beg and Mu\u1e25ammad Am\u012bn. For the expenses of this force 200,000 rupees were given and 1,000 musketeers were also appointed.\n\nI left \u0100\u1e63af Kh\u0101n to guard Khusrau and defend Lahore. The Amiru-l-umar\u0101 was deprived of the honour of waiting on me, as he had a severe illness and remained in the city. \u2018Abdu-r-Razz\u0101q Ma\u2018m\u016br\u012b, who had been summoned from the R\u0101n\u0101\u2019s country, was promoted to be bakhshi at headquarters, and it was ordered that in company with \u2018Ab\u016b-l-\u1e25asan he should perform this service permanently. Following my father\u2019s rule, I appoint two men in association in the discharge of the chief offices, not from want of confidence in them, but because, as they are mortal and no man is safe from accidents or illness, if any confusion or obstacle should present itself to one the other is there so that the affairs of the servants of God may not come to ruin.\n\nAt this time also news came that at the Dasahr\u0101, which is one of the fixed feast days of the Hindus, \u2018Abdu-llah Kh\u0101n had made an incursion from K\u0101lp\u012b, which is his jagir, into the province of Bandilah, and displaying great valour made prisoner R\u0101m Chand, son of Madh\u016bkar, who for a long time had made a centre of disturbance in that difficult country and taken him to K\u0101lp\u012b. For this service he was presented with a standard and raised to 3,000 personal and 2,000 horse.\n\nPetitions from the subah of Bihar represented that Jah\u0101ng\u012br Quli Kh\u0101n had had a battle with Sangr\u0101m, one of the chief zamindars of Bihar, who had about 4,000 horse and innumerable foot, on account of certain opposition and\n\n\\(^1\\) Text, \u016aym\u0101q p\u016br\u012b (?). MS. 181 has b\u016br\u012b, and 305 seems to have the same. Can it mean \u2018red cavalry\u2019? As Blochmann has pointed out, 371, n. 2, the word \u016aym\u0101q does not always mean the tribe, but was used to denote a superior kind of cavalry.\ndisloyalty on rough land, and that on the field the aforesaid Kh\u0101n had exerted himself manfully. In the end Sangr\u0101m died of a gunshot wound; many of his men fell in the battle, and those saved from the sword took to flight. Since this distinguished affair had been brought about by Jah\u0101ng\u012br Quli Kh\u0101n, I promoted him to the rank of 4,500 personal and 3,500 horse.\n\nThree months and six days passed by in hunting; 581 animals were captured with the gun, hunting leopards and nets, and a qamarg\u0101h; of these 158 were killed by my own gun. The qamargah was held twice; on one occasion in Girjh\u0101k, when the ladies were present, 155 animals were killed; and the second time, in Nand\u012bna, 110.\\(^1\\) The details of the animals killed are as follows: mountain sheep, 180; mountain goats, 29; wild asses, 10; Nilgai, 9; antelope, etc., 348.\n\nOn Wednesday the 16th Shaww\u0101l I returned safe from my hunting, and when one watch and six gharis of day had passed I entered Lahore on the day named. During this hunting a strange affair was witnessed At Chandw\u0101lah, where a minaret had been erected, I had wounded in the belly a black antelope. When wounded, a sound proceeded from him such as I have never heard from any antelope, except in the rutting season. Old hunters and those with me were astonished, and said they never remembered nor had they heard from their fathers that such a voice issued from an antelope except at rutting time. This has been written down because it is not void of strangeness. I found the flesh of the mountain goat more delicious than that of all wild animals, although its skin is exceedingly ill-odoured, so much so that even when tanned the scent is not destroyed. I ordered one of the largest of the he-goats to be weighed; it was 2 maunds and 24 seers, equal to 21 foreign maunds\n\n\\(^1\\) The qamarg\u0101h or ring-hunt produced 265 head of game; the rest were shot at other times; the total of the list should be apparently 576.\n(Persian). I ordered a large ram to be weighed, and it came to 2 maunds and 3 seers Akbari, equal to 17 Persian (wilayati) maunds. The largest and strongest of the wild asses weighed 9 maunds and 16 seers, equal to 76 Persian (wilayati) maunds. I have frequently heard from hunters and those fond of the chase that at a certain regular time a worm develops in the horns of the mountain ram, and that this worm causes an irritation which induces the ram to fight with his hind, and that if he finds no rival he strikes his head against a tree or a rock to allay the irritation. After enquiry it seems that the same worm appears in the horn of the female sheep, and since the female does not fight the statement is clearly untrue. Though the flesh of the wild ass is lawful food and most men like to eat it, it was in no way suited to my taste.\n\nInasmuch as before this time the punishment of Dulip and of his father, R\u0101y R\u0101y Singh, had been ordered, there now came news that Z\u0101hid Kh\u0101n, the son of \u0160\u0101diq Kh\u0101n, and \u2018Abdu-r-Rahim, son of Shaikh Ab\u016b-l-fa\u017cl, and R\u0101n\u0101 Sankar and Mu\u2019izzu-l-mulk, with another force of mansabdars and followers of the Court, had heard news of Dulip in the neighbourhood of N\u0101gor, which is in the subah of Ajmir, and having moved against him had found him. As he could find no way of escape, of necessity he planted a firm foot and came to blows with the royal army. After a short encounter he was badly beaten and gave over many to slaughter, and himself, taking with him his own effects, fled into the vale of ruin.\n\n\"With broken arms and loosened belt,\nNo power to fight and no care for head.\"\n\nIn spite of his old age, I continued Qilij Kh\u0101n in his mansab because of his service under my father, and I ordered that he should get a jagir in the sarkar of K\u0101lp\u012b.\n\nIn the month Zi-l-q\u0101da the mother of Qu\u1e6dbu-d-d\u012bn Kh\u0101n Koka, who had given me her milk and was as\na mother to me or even kinder than my own kind mother, and in whose lap I had been brought up from infancy, was committed to the mercy of God. I placed the feet of her corpse on my shoulders and carried her a part of the way (to her grave). Through extreme grief and sorrow I had no inclination for some days to eat, and I did not change my clothes.\n\nFeast of the Second New Year.\n\nOn Wednesday the 22nd Zi-l-qa\u2019d\u0101, 1015 (10th March, 1607), when $3\\frac{1}{2}$ gharis of the day had passed, the sun rose to his House of Honour. They decorated the palace after the usual fashion: a great entertainment was prepared, and having seated myself at an auspicious hour on the throne of accession I exalted the nobles and courtiers with kindness and favour. On this same auspicious day it was learned from the reports sent from Qandahar that the army sent under Mirz\u0101 Gh\u0101zi, son of Mirz\u0101 J\u0101ni, to succour (which had been appointed to assist) Sh\u0101h Beg Kh\u0101n, had entered the city of Qandahar on the 12th of Shaww\u0101l. When the Persians heard of the arrival of the victorious army at the last stage before the aforesaid city,\u00b9 they became surprised and wretched and repentant, and did not draw rein until they had reached the Helmand, fifty or sixty kos distant.\n\nIn the second place it became known that the governor of Far\u0101h and a number of the officers of that neighbourhood had taken it into their heads, after the death of the late king, that in this confusion Qandahar might easily fall into their hands, and without waiting for an order from Sh\u0101h \u2018Abb\u0101s had collected together and won over the Chief of Sewist\u0101n (Sist\u0101n). Sending someone to\n\n\u00b9 The MSS. have the 6th stage instead of \u201clast.\u201d\nHusain Kh\u0101n, the governor of Herat, they asked for support from him. He also sent a force. After that they turned to attack Qandahar. Sh\u0101h Beg Kh\u0101n, the governor of that place, seeing that battle has two heads, and that if (which God forbid!) he should be defeated he would lose possession of Qandahar, thought that to confine himself in a fort would be better than to fight. He therefore determined to hold the fort, and sent quick messengers to the Court. It happened that at this time the royal standards had started from Agra in pursuit of Khusrau, and had arrived at Lahore. Immediately on hearing this news (from Sh\u0101h Beg Kh\u0101n), a large force was sent off of amirs and mansabdars under M\u012brz\u0101 Gh\u0101zi. Before the M\u012brz\u0101 reached Qandahar the news had been carried to the Sh\u0101h (of Persia) that the governor of Far\u0101h, with some of the jagirdars of that neighbourhood, had proceeded towards the province of Qandahar. Considering this an improper proceeding, he sent Husain Beg, a well-known man and one of his own intimates, to make enquiries. He also sent a farman in their names that they should move away from the vicinity of Qandahar and go to their own places and abodes, because the friendship and amity of his ancestors with the dignified family of Jah\u0101ng\u012br P\u0101dsh\u0101h were of old standing. That body, before the arrival of Husain Beg and the King\u2019s order, not being able to oppose the royal army, considered the opportunity of returning a favourable one. The said Husain Beg censured the men and started off to wait on me, which he had the honour to do at Lahore. He explained that the ill-fated army which had attacked Qandahar had acted without the order of Sh\u0101h \u2018Abb\u0101s. God forbid (he said) that in consequence of this any unpleasantness should remain in my mind. In short, after the victorious troops reached Qandahar, they, according to orders, delivered the fort over to Sard\u0101r Kh\u0101n, and Sh\u0101h Beg Kh\u0101n returned to Court with the relieving force.\nOn the 27th Z\u012b-l-q\u0101\u02bfda, \u2018Abdu-llah Kh\u0101n, having brought R\u0101m Chand Bandilah into captivity and chains, brought him before me. I ordered them to take the fetters from his legs, and bestowed on him a robe of honour, and handed him over to R\u0101ja B\u0101so that he might take security and release him and a number of his relations who had been captured with him. This through my clemency and kindness came to pass. He had never imagined such clemency and kindness as I showed to him.\n\nOn the 2nd Z\u012b-l-hijja I gave my son Khurram a t\u016bm\u0101n u tugh, a flag and drums, and bestowed on him the rank of 8,000 personal and 5,000 horse, and gave an order for a jagir. On the same day, having exalted Pir Kh\u0101n, son of Daulat Kh\u0101n Lod\u012b, who had come from Khandesh with the children of D\u0101niy\u0101l, with the title of \u0160al\u0101bat Kh\u0101n and honoured him with the rank of 3,000 personal and 1,500 horse, and presented him with a standard and drums, I promoted him to the distinction of sonship (farzand\u012b) beyond his fellows and equals. The ancestors and uncles of \u0160al\u0101bat Kh\u0101n\u2019s grandfather had been great and honourable among the tribe of Lod\u012b. An earlier Daulat Kh\u0101n, uncle of \u0160al\u0101bat Kh\u0101n\u2019s grandfather, when Ibr\u0101h\u012bm after his father Sikandar\u2019s death, began to behave ill to his father\u2019s amirs and destroyed many, became apprehensive, and sent his younger son, Dil\u0101war Kh\u0101n, to wait upon H.M. B\u0101bar in Kabul, and suggested to him the acquisition of Hindustan. As B\u0101bar also had this enterprise in mind, he at once proceeded in that direction, and did not turn his rein till he reached the neighbourhood of Lahore. Daulat Kh\u0101n with his followers obtained the good fortune to wait upon him, and performed loyal service. As he was an old man, adorned with inward and outward excellencies, he did much good service. He (B\u0101bar) generally called him \u201cfather,\u201d and entrusting to him as\n\n1 This is the famous Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n Lod\u012b of Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n\u2019s reign.\nbefore\\(^1\\) the government of the Panjab placed its amirs and jagirdars under his jurisdiction. Taking Dil\u0101war Kh\u0101n with him he (B\u0101bar) returned to Kabul. When he (B\u0101bar) came a second time into the Panjab with intent to invade Hindustan, Daulat Kh\u0101n waited on him, and about the same time died. Dil\u0101war Kh\u0101n was honoured with the title of Kh\u0101nkh\u0101n\u0101n, and was with B\u0101bar in the battle he had with Ibr\u0101h\u012bm. In the same way he was permanently in waiting on the late king Hum\u0101y\u016bn. In the th\u0101n\u0101 of Mungir, at the time of his (Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s) return from Bengal, he fought bravely against Sh\u012br Kh\u0101n Afgh\u0101n, and was made prisoner on the field of battle. Although Sh\u012br Kh\u0101n urged him to take service with him, he refused and said, \u201cThy ancestors were always the servants of mine: how, then, could I do this?\u201d Sh\u012br Kh\u0101n was enraged, and ordered him to be shut up in a wall.\\(^2\\)\n\n\u2018Umar Kh\u0101n, the grandfather of \u0160al\u0101bat Kh\u0101n Farzand, who was cousin of Dil\u0101war Kh\u0101n, had been treated with respect in the time of Sal\u012bm Kh\u0101n. After Sal\u012bm Kh\u0101n\u2019s death and the slaughter of Fir\u016bz, his son, at the hand of Muhammad Kh\u0101n, \u2018Umar Kh\u0101n and his brethren became suspicious of Muhammad Kh\u0101n and went to Gujarat, where \u2018Umar Kh\u0101n died. Daulat Kh\u0101n, his son, who was a brave young man of pleasant appearance, and good at all things, chose the companionship of \u2018Abdu-r-Rah\u012bm, son of Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n, who had been dignified with the title of Kh\u0101nkh\u0101n\u0101n in the reign of Akbar, and performed excellent service. The Kh\u0101nkh\u0101n\u0101n regarded him as his own brother, or even a thousand times better than his brother, and dearer. Most of the Kh\u0101nkh\u0101n\u0101n\u2019s victories were gained through Daulat Kh\u0101n\u2019s valour and manliness.\\(^3\\) When my\n\n---\n\n1 Text, ba dast\u016br.\n2 I.e. built him up in it.\n3 Jah\u0101ng\u012br did not like the Kh\u0101nkh\u0101n\u0101n, and so here belittles his services.\nrevered father, having taken the province of Khandesh and the fort of \u0100s\u012br, returned to Agra, he left D\u0101niy\u0101l in charge of that province and of all the provinces acquired from the rulers of the Deccan. At this time D\u0101niy\u0101l had separated Daulat Kh\u0101n from the Kh\u0101nkh\u0101n\u0101n, and was keeping him in attendance on himself and handing over to him for disposal all the business of the State. He showed him much favour and perfect affection until he died in his service. He left two sons, one Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n, and the other Pir Kh\u0101n; Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n, who was the elder, died a short time after his father. D\u0101niy\u0101l, too, wore himself out with drinking. After my accession I summoned Pir Kh\u0101n to Court. As I discovered in him a good disposition and natural abilities, I raised the pedestal of regard for him to the point that has been described. To-day there is not in my government any person of greater influence than he, so much so that on his representation I pass over faults which are not pardoned at the intercession of any of the other servants of the Court. In short, he is a young man of good disposition, brave, and worthy of favour, and what I have done for him has been done rightly, and he will be exalted by further favours.\u00b9\n\nAs I had made up my exalted mind to the conquest of M\u0101war\u0101\u02bea-n-nahr (Transoxiana), which was the hereditary kingdom of my ancestors, I desired to free the face of Hindustan from the rubbish of the factious and rebellious, and leaving one of my sons in that country, to go myself with a valiant army in due array, with elephants of mountainous dignity and of lightning speed, and taking ample treasure with me, to undertake the conquest of my ancestral dominions. In accordance with this idea, I despatched Parwiz to drive back the R\u0101n\u0101, and intended to go myself to the Deccan, when just at that moment the\n\n\u00b9 During Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n\u2019s reign, Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n Lod\u012b fled from Court, was pursued, and killed.\nimproper action of Khusrau took place, and it became necessary to pursue him and put an end to that disturbance. For the same reason, the undertaking of Parwiz did not assume a promising appearance, and regarding the exigency of the time he gave a respite to the R\u0101n\u0101. Bringing with him one of the R\u0101n\u0101\u2019s sons, he came to wait on me, and had the bliss of attending me in Lahore. When I was at ease about Khusrau\u2019s disturbance, and the repulse of the Qizilb\u0101shes, who had invested Qandahar, had been brought about in a facile way, it came into my mind to make a hunting tour to Kabul, which is like my native land. After that I would return to Hindustan, when the purposes of my mind would pass from design to action. In pursuance of these steps, on the 7th Z\u012bl-hijja, at an auspicious hour, I left the fort of Lahore and took up my quarters in the Dil-\u0101m\u012bz Garden, which is on the other side of the Ravi, and stayed there four days. Sunday, the 19th Farwardin, which is the culmination of His Majesty the Sun, I passed in the garden, and some of the servants of the Court were favourably and kindly honoured with increased rank. Ten thousand rupees were bestowed on \u1e24asan Beg, the envoy of the ruler of Persia (Sh\u0101h \u2018Abb\u0101s). Leaving Qilij Kh\u0101n, Mir\u0101n \u0160adr Jah\u0101n, and M\u012br Shar\u012bf \u0100mul\u012b in Lahore, I ordered them to settle in consultation any matters that might present themselves. On Monday I marched from the garden mentioned, and encamped at the village of Harhar, 3\u00bd kos distant from the city. On Tuesday the royal standards alighted at Jah\u0101ng\u012brp\u016br, which is one of my fixed hunting-places. In this neighbourhood had been erected by my order a man\u0101r at the head of the grave of an antelope called Mansaraj,\u00b9 which was without equal in fights with tame\n\n\u00b9 Perhaps the antelope\u2019s name was R\u0101j, and the syllable man the pronoun \u2018my,\u2019 when the translation would be \u2018my antelope R\u0101j.\u2019 See Elliot, vi, 302, and R.A.S. MS., No. 124.\nantelopes and in hunting wild ones. On a stone of that manar was carved this prose composition, written by Mull\u0101 Mu\u1e25ammad \u1e24usain of Kashmir, who was the chief of the elegant writers of the day: \u201cIn this enchanting place an antelope came into the world-holding (jah\u0101n-g\u012br\u012b) net of the God-knowing ruler N\u016bru-d-d\u012bn Jah\u0101ng\u012br P\u0101dsh\u0101h. In the space of one month, having overcome his desert fierceness, he became the head of the special antelopes.\u201d On account of the rare quality of this antelope, I commanded that no person should hunt the deer of this plain, and that their flesh should be to Hindus and Muhammadans as is the flesh of cows and pigs. They made the gravestone in the shape of an antelope. I ordered Sikandar Mu\u02bf\u012bn, the jagirdar of the aforesaid pargana, to build a strong fort in the village of Jahangirpur.\n\nOn Thursday, the 14th, I encamped in the pargana of Chand\u0101l\u0101.\u00b9 Thence on Saturday, the 16th, making one stage in the middle, I came to H\u0101fiz\u0101b\u0101d.\u00b2 I stayed in the station which had been erected by the exertions of the karor\u012b of that place, Mir Qiy\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn. Having reached the Chen\u0101b in two marches on Thursday, the 21st \u0162i-l-hijja, I crossed the river by a bridge which had been built there, and my camp was pitched in the neighbourhood of the pargana of Gujrat. At the time when His Majesty Akbar went to Kashmir, a fort had been built on that bank of the river. Having brought to this fort a body of Gujars who had passed their time in the neighbourhood in thieving and highway robbery, he established them here. As it had become the abode of Gujars, he made it a separate pargana, and gave it the name of Gujrat. They call Gujars a caste which does little manual work and subsists on milk and curds. On Friday I pitched at Khaw\u0101\u1e63\u1e63p\u016br, five kos from Gujrat, founded by Khaw\u0101\u1e63\u1e63\n\n\u00b9 Perhaps the Jandi\u0101la of the Indian Gazetteer, vii, 137.\n\u00b2 Indian Gazetteer, v, 239.\nKh\u0101n, a slave of Sh\u012br Kh\u0101n Afgh\u0101n. Thence, with two halts in the middle, I pitched on the bank of the Biha\u1e6d (Jhelam). On that night a great wind blew and a black cloud hid the face of the sky. The rain was of such violence that old men remembered none such. It turned to hail, and every hailstone was the size of a hen\u2019s egg. From the flooding of the river and the force of the wind and rain, the bridge broke. I, with the inmates of the harem, crossed in a boat. As there were few boats, I ordered the men not\\(^1\\) to cross in these, but to rebuild the bridge. It was finished in a week, and the whole army crossed with ease. The source of the Biha\u1e6d is a spring in Kashmir called the Vir-n\u0101g; in the language of India a snake is vir-n\u0101g. Clearly there had been a large snake at that place. I went twice to the spring in my father\u2019s lifetime; it is 20 kos from the city of Kashmir. It is an octagonal reservoir about 20 yards by 20. Near it are the remains of a place of worship for recluses; cells cut out of the rock and numerous caves. The water is exceedingly pure. Although I could not guess its depth, a grain of poppy-seed is visible until it touches the bottom. There were many fish to be seen in it. As I had heard that it was unfathomable, I ordered them to throw in a cord with a stone attached, and when this cord was measured in gaz it became evident that the depth was not more than once and a half the height of a man. After my accession I ordered them to build the sides of the spring round with stone, and they made a garden round it with a canal; and built halls and houses about it, and made a place such that travellers over the world can point out few like it. When the river reaches the village of Pamp\u016br, at a distance of ten kos from the city, it increases, and all the saffron of Kashmir is obtained in this village. I do not know if there is so much saffron in any other place in the world.\n\n\\(^1\\) Text omits the negative.\nThe annual crop is 500 maunds by Hindustan weight, equal to 5,000 wil\u0101yat (Persian) maunds. In attendance on my revered father, I went to this place at the season when the saffron was in flower. On other plants of the world, first the branches (stems) shoot out and then the leaves and flowers. On the contrary, when the saffron stem is four fingers breadth from the dry ground, its flowers shoot out, of the colour of the iris,\\(^1\\) with four petals, and in the middle are four threads (\\(r\u012bsha\\)) of an orange colour like that of the flower, and of the length of a finger-joint. This is the saffron. The land is not ploughed\\(^2\\) or irrigated, the plant springs up amongst the clods. In some places its cultivation extends for a kos, and in others for half a kos. It looks better from a distance. At the time of plucking, all my attendants got headache from its sharp scent. Though I drank wine and took a cup, I too got headache. I asked the animal-like Kashmiris, who were employed in picking the flowers, how they felt. I ascertained that they had never experienced headache in their lives.\n\nThe waters from the spring Vir-n\u0101g and of other streams and nullahs that join from right and left form the river Bihat, which passes through the heart of the city. Its breadth in most places is not more than a bowshot.\\(^3\\) No one drinks its water, because of its heaviness and indigestibility. All the people of Kashmir drink the water of a lake that is near the city, and is called Dall. The river Bihat enters this lake and flows through to the Panjab by the B\u0101r\u0101m\u016bla Pass, Pakl\u012b, and Dant\u016br.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Text, \\(\u015b\u016bsan\u012b\\); apparently a blue iris.\n\n\\(^2\\) The text has \\(shum\u0101r\\) wrongly for \\(shiy\u0101r\\), and it seems that the negative of the text is wrong, since it does not occur in the MSS. Ab\u016b-l-fa\u017cl gives the number of petals and stamens more correctly than Jah\u0101ng\u012br.\n\n\\(^3\\) Az tikka and\u0101z\u012b; perhaps \u2018the cast of a javelin.\u2019\nIn Kashmir there is plenty of water from streams and springs. By far the best is that of the L\u0101r valley, which joins the Bihat in the village of Shih\u0101bu-d-d\u012bn-p\u016br. This village is one of the celebrated places of Kashmir, and is on the Bihat. About a hundred plane-trees (chan\u0101r) of graceful form clustered together on one plot of ground, pleasant and green, join each other so as to shade the whole plot, and the whole surface of the ground is grass and trefoil; so much so that to lay a carpet on it would be superfluous and in bad taste. The village was founded by Sult\u0101n Zainu-l-\u2018\u0101bid\u012bn, who for 52 years ruled Kashmir with absolute sway. They speak of him as the great P\u0101dsh\u0101h. They tell many strange customs of his. There are many remains and traces of buildings of his in Kashmir. One of these is in the midst of a lake called Wul\u016br, and of which the length and breadth are more than three or four kos. It is called Zain-lank\u0101, and in making it they have exerted themselves greatly. The springs of this lake are very deep. The first time they brought a large quantity of stone in boats and poured it on the place where now the building stands it had no result. At last they sank some thousands of boats with stones, and with great labour recovered a piece of ground 100 gaz by 100 gaz out of the water, and made a terrace, and on one side thereof the Sultan erected a temple for the worship of his supreme God. Than this there is no finer place. He often came to the spot by boat and engaged in worship of the King of Wisdom. They say he spent many \u201cforty days\u201d in that place. One day a wicked son of his came to that place to kill him, and finding him alone, drew a sword and went in. When his eye fell on the Sultan,\n\n1 Lit. \u2018have joined hands.\u2019\n2 S\u012bh-barga; but this reading seems doubtful; perhaps it is s\u012br-i-barga, full of leaves. Jah\u0101ng\u012br says that to lay a carpet on the grass would be b\u012b-dard\u012b, unfeeling, unsympathetic, and kam sal\u012bqag\u012b.\n3 The text has naqsh bar j\u0101y, but the true reading seems to be naf\u012bz\u012btar.\nhowever, on account of his venerable dignity and the might of his virtues, he became confused and bewildered and turned away. The Sultan shortly after came out and seated himself in the boat with this same son, and started for the city. On the way he said to his son, \u201cI have forgotten my rosary; get into a canoe and fetch it for me.\u201d The son having gone into the temple sees his father in the same place, and the graceless man with complete shame of face falls at his father\u2019s feet and asks pardon for his fault. They have told many tales of such miracles as this of him, and they say also that he had well practised the science of khala\u2019.\u00b9 When, from the ways and methods of his sons, he perceived in them signs of haste in seeking for rule and government, he would say to them, \u201cTo me it is very easy to abandon rule, and even to pass away from life, but when I am gone you will do nothing, and the time of your prosperity will not endure long, but in a short time you will obtain the recompense of your evil deeds and your own dispositions.\u201d Having spoken thus, he gave up eating and drinking, and passed forty days in this manner. He made not his eye acquainted with sleep, and employed himself after the manner of men of piety and austerity in the worship of God Almighty. On the fortieth day he gave up the deposit of his existence, and entered into the mercy of God. He left three sons\u2014\u0100dam Kh\u0101n, H\u0101j\u012b Kh\u0101n, and Bahr\u0101m Kh\u0101n. They quarrelled with each other, and all three were ruined. The government of Kashmir was transferred to the tribe of the Chaks, who belonged to the class of the common soldiers of the country. During their dynasty three of the rulers constructed buildings on three sides of the terrace formed by Zainu-l-\u2018\u0101bid\u012bn in the Wulur Lake, but none of these is as strong as his.\n\n\u00b9 \u2018Ilm-i-khala\u2019-i-badan, \u2018withdrawal of the soul from the body\u2019 (Erskine).\nAutumn and Spring in Kashmir are things worthy to be seen. I witnessed the Autumn season, and it appeared to me to be better than what I had heard of it. I have never seen Spring in that province, but hope to do so some day. On Saturday the 1st of Mu\u1e25arram (18th April, 1607) I left the bank of the Bihat, and with one day between reached the fort of Roht\u0101s, which was built by Shir Kh\u0101n Afgh\u0101n. This fort was founded in a cleft of the ground, and the strength of it cannot be imagined. As the place is near the Ghakhar territory, and they are a proud and rebellious people, he had looked to this fort specially as a means of punishing and defeating them. When a little of the building had been done Shir Kh\u0101n died and his son, Salim Kh\u0101n, obtained the grace to complete it. On each of the gates\\(^1\\) they have carved on a stone the cost of erecting the fort; 16 krors, 10 lakhs of dams, and more were expended, equal in Hindustan reckoning to 4,025,000 rupees, and according to the currency of Iran to 120,000 t\u016bman, and in the currency of Turan to 1 arb, 21 lakhs and 75,000 kh\u0101n\u012b, that are now current.\\(^2\\)\n\nOn Tuesday the 4th of the month, having travelled four kos and three-quarters, I encamped at Tila.\\(^3\\) Thence I came down to the village of Bhakra. In the Ghakhar\n\n---\n\n1 So in text, but the MSS. and Elliot, vi, 307, have \u201con one of the gates.\u201d\n\n2 The figures seem wrong, and the MSS. differ. See Elliot, vi, 307. Apparently the correct sum in rupees is 34 lakhs 25,000. At p. 61 the khani of Turan is reckoned at one-third of a rupee. If the dam be taken at its ordinary value of one-fortieth of a rupee, the number of rupees should be 40 lakhs 25,000, and if the khani of Turan be one-third of a rupee we should read one kror instead of one arb. Probably Jah\u0101ng\u012br has used arb as meaning kror, and not 100 krors. There is a valuable note on his expedition through the Ghakkar country in Blochmann, p. 486. Blochmann takes the figures for the rupees to be four krors, but probably this is due to wrong pointing.\n\n3 The MSS. and text have Pila or Pila. I adopt Tila from Blochmann, p. 487, note. Elliot has Tillah, vi, 307, and note.\ntongue *bhakra*\\(^1\\) is a jungle. The jungle was composed of clusters of flowers, white and scentless. I came the whole way from Tila to Bhakra in the middle of the river-bed,\\(^2\\) which had running water in it, with oleander flowers of the colour of peach-blossom. In Hindustan this plant is always in full bloom (*purb\u0101r*). There was much of it on the banks of this river. The horsemen and men on foot who were with me were told to put bunches of the flower on their heads, and whoever did not do so had his turban taken off; a wonderful flower-bed was produced.\n\nOn Thursday the 6th of the month the halting-place was at Haty\u0101. On this road many pal\u0101s-trees (*Butea frondosa*) were in blossom. This flower, too, is peculiar to the jungles of Hindustan; it has no scent, but its colour is flaming orange. The base of the flower is black; the flower itself is as big as a red rose. It is so beautiful that one cannot take one\u2019s eyes off it. As the air was very sweet and clouds had hidden the sun, and rain was gently sprinkled about, I felt an inclination to drink wine. In short this road was traversed with great enjoyment and pleasure. They call the place Haty\u0101 because it was founded by a Ghakkar named H\u0101thi (elephant). From M\u0101rgala to Haty\u0101 the country is called Poth\u016bw\u0101r.\\(^3\\) In these regions there are few crows. From Roht\u0101s to Haty\u0101 is the place and abode of the Bh\u016bgy\u0101ls,\\(^4\\) who are related to and of the same ancestry as the Ghakkars.\n\nMarching on Friday the 7th, I travelled 4\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) kos and alighted at the station of Pakka.\\(^5\\) This place is called\n\n---\n\n1. In Tolbort\u2019s account of L\u016bdhiy\u0101na, J.A.S.B. for 1869, p. 86, *bhakhra* is given as the name of a creeping plant (*Pedalium murex*).\n2. *R\u016bd-kh\u0101na*; this, according to Blochmann, should be the river Kahan, *kh\u0101na* being a mistake for Kahan. See p. 487 note. But all the MSS. have *kh\u0101na*.\n3. See Elliot, vi, 309 note.\n4. B\u016bgy\u0101ls; Elliot, vi, 309. They are descendants of Sult\u0101n B\u016bg\u0101.\n5. Pakka is mentioned in Tiefenthaler, i, 114.\nPakka because the sar\u0101y is of burnt brick, and in the Hindi language what is ripe (that is, not raw material) is called pakka. The station was strangely full of dust and earth. The carts reached it with great difficulty owing to the badness of the road. They had brought from Kabul to this place r\u012bv\u0101j (rhubarb), which was mostly spoiled.\n\nOn Saturday the 8th we marched 4\u00bd kos and encamped at the village of Khar.\\(^1\\) Khar in the Ghakkar language is a rent and breakage. There are few trees in this country. On Sunday the 9th I halted beyond R\u0101walpindi. This place was founded by a Hindu named R\u0101wal, and pind\u012b in the Ghakkar tongue means a village. In the valley near this station there was a stream flowing, the waters of which were collected in a pool. As this halting-place was not devoid of freshness I alighted there for a time, and I asked the Ghakkars the depth of the pool. They gave me no precise answer, but said they had heard from their fathers that there were alligators in the pool which wounded animals that came there, and on that account no one had the boldness to go in. I ordered them to throw in a sheep. It swam across the pool and came out. I then ordered a farr\u0101sh to go in, and he also came out safe. It thus became clear that there was no foundation for what the Ghakkars had said. The pool was an arrow\u2019s flight in width.\n\nOn Monday the 10th the village of Kharb\u016bza\\(^2\\) was our stage. The Ghakkars in earlier times had built a dome here and taken tolls from travellers. As the dome was shaped like a melon it became known by that name. On Tuesday the 11th I halted at K\u0101la-p\u0101ni, which in Hindi means black water. There is a mountain pass (kotal) at this place called M\u0101rgalla; in Hindi m\u0101r means\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Khor; Elliot, vi, 309 note. Near the M\u0101niky\u0101la tope.\n\n\\(^2\\) Kharb\u016bza Sar\u0101y is marked on Elphinstone\u2019s map.\nto beat and *galla* is a caravan, the name therefore means the place of the plundering of the caravan. The boundary of the Ghakkar country is here. This tribe are wonderfully like animals; they are always squabbling and fighting with one another. Although I wished to put an end to this fighting, I was unable to do so.\n\n\"The soul of the fool is doomed to trouble.\"\u00b9\n\nOn Wednesday the 12th the camp was at B\u0101b\u0101 \u1e24asan Abd\u0101l. One kos to the east of this station there is a waterfall over which the stream rushes with great force. There is no fall like it on the way to Kabul. On the road to Kashmir there are two or three like it.\u00b2\n\nIn the middle of the basin, in which is the source of the stream, R\u0101ja M\u0101n Singh has erected a small building. There are many fish in the basin of the length of half a gaz and a quarter gaz. I halted three days at this enchanting place, drinking wine with those who were intimate with me and employing myself in catching fish. Until now I had never thrown a *sufra* net, which is a famous kind of net, and which in Hindi they call *bhanwar*\u00b3 *j\u0101l*. It is not easy to throw. I threw it with my own hand and caught twelve fish, and putting pearls into their noses,\u2074 let them loose in the water. I enquired\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 Mr. Rogers has \"The soul of the fool thou canst purchase for little.\" Perhaps the sense is \"God grants life to the fool on hard terms.\" Erskine has \"To serve a fool is hard indeed.\" Possibly the literal meaning is \"You buy the soul of the fool at a high price,\" that is, it costs a great deal to win him over. Elliot had what is probably the best rendering, \"Barbarous characters should be treated with severity\"; though in Elliot, vi, 310, the translation is, \"The life of fools is held very cheap in troublous times.\"\n\n\u00b2 Apparently this remark must have been written after Jah\u0101ng\u012br's visit to Kashmir by the B\u0101ram\u016bla route in the fourteenth year.\n\n\u00b3 *Bhanwar*, as Mr. Lowe has pointed out, means in Hindi an eddy or whirlpool.\n\n\u2074 William Finch says that at \u1e24asan Abd\u0101l there were many fish with gold rings in their noses hung by Akbar, and that the water is so clear that you may see a penny in the bottom. Jah\u0101ng\u012br's informants were\ninto the story of B\u0101b\u0101 \u1e24asan from the story-tellers and from the inhabitants of the place, but no one could tell me any particulars. The celebrated place at that station is a spring which flows from the foot of a little hill, exceedingly clear, sweet, and nice, as witness this couplet of Am\u012br Khusrav:\n\n\"In the bottom of the water, from its clearness, a blind man Can count the sand-grains in the heart of the night.\"\n\nKhw\u0101ja Shamsu-d-d\u012bn Mu\u1e25ammad Khw\u0101f\u012b, who was for long employed as Vizier by my revered father, had made a platform and a reservoir there, into which is led the water from the spring, and thence is used in cultivation and in gardens. On the edge of this terrace he had built a dome for his own burial. By chance his destiny was not there, and (the bodies of) \u1e24ak\u012bm Ab\u016b-l-fa\u1e6d\u1e25 Gil\u0101n\u012b and his brother \u1e24ak\u012bm Hum\u0101m, who were close to the person and had the complete confidence of my revered father, were placed in that dome in accordance with his order.\n\nOn the 15th the halt was at Amroh\u012b. It is a wonderfully green place, in which no ups and downs were visible. In this village and its neighbourhood there are 7,000 or 8,000 households of Khaturs and Dal\u0101z\u0101ks. All kinds of mischief and oppression and highway robbery take place through this tribe. I ordered the government of this region and Attock to be given to Zafar Kh\u0101n, son of Zain Kh\u0101n Koka, and that by the time of the return of the royal standards from Kabul they should march all the Dal\u0101z\u0101ks to Lahore and capture the head men of the Khaturs and keep them in prison.\n\napparently not versed in hagiography. B\u0101b\u0101 \u1e24asan Abd\u0101l is apparently the saint who was an ancestor of Ma\u02bf\u0161\u016bm Bhak\u0101r\u012b, and is buried at Qandahar. See Beale, and Jarrett's translation of the \u0100y\u012bn, ii, 324 note. The Sikhs identify the place with their B\u0101b\u0101 N\u0101nak. It is not a wife of Akbar who is buried at \u1e24asan Abd\u0101l, but \u1e24ak\u012bm Ab\u016b-l-fa\u1e6d\u1e25 and his brother.\n\n1 Elliot has Amard\u012b, but the MSS. have Amroh\u012b. The Ma\u02bf\u0101\u0161ir, ii, 755, has \u0100hr\u016b\u02be\u012b. See Blochmann, p. 522.\nOn Monday, the 17th, a march was made, and, with one stage in between, the royal standards alighted near the fort of Attock on the bank of the river Nil\u0101b (Indus). At this stage Mah\u0101bat Kh\u0101n was promoted to the rank of 2,500. This fort was built by the late king Akbar, and was completed by the labours of Khw\u0101ja Shamsu-d-d\u012bn Khw\u0101fi. It is a strong fort. At this time the water of the Nil\u0101b was low,\u00b9 and accordingly a bridge had been made with eighteen boats, and the people crossed over easily. I left the Amiru-l-umar\u0101 at Attock on account of weakness of body and illness. An order was given to the bakhshis that, as the province of Kabul could not support a large army, they should only allow the immediate attendants of the Court to cross the river, and until the return of the royal standards the royal camp should remain at Attock. On Wednesday, the 19th, with the princes and some of the private servants, having mounted on to a raft (with inflated skins underneath), and having crossed the river Nil\u0101b safely, I alighted on the bank of the river K\u0101ma. The K\u0101ma is a river that flows by the qa\u1e63ba (fortified town) of Jal\u0101l\u0101b\u0101d. The j\u0101la is a structure they make of bamboos and grass and place underneath it skins full of air. In this province they call them sh\u0101l (or s\u0101l). In rivers and streams in which there are rocks they are safer than boats. 12,000 rupees were given to M\u012br Shar\u012bf \u0100mul\u012b and to a number of men, who had been appointed to perform services at Lahore, to divide amongst the faqirs. An order was given to \u2018Abdu-r-Razz\u0101q Ma\u2018m\u016br\u012b\u00b2 and to Bih\u0101r\u012b D\u0101s, bakhshi of the Ahadis, to complete the force that had been appointed\n\n\u00b9 Az taqhy\u0101n far\u016bd \u0101mada. Perhaps the meaning is exactly the opposite, viz. 'had come down in violence.' But if so, could a bridge have been made, and with eighteen boats? The time was the 4th or 5th May. Elliot has \"the Nil\u0101b was very full.\"\n\n\u00b2 According to the Ma\u2018\u0101\u0161iru-l-umar\u0101, iii, 376, Ma\u2018m\u016br is a village in Arabia.\nto accompany \u017dafar Kh\u0101n and send them away. With one stage in between, the camp halted at the saray of B\u0101ra. On the other side of the river K\u0101ma there is a fort which Zain Kh\u0101n Koka built at the time when he was appointed to subjugate the Y\u016bsufza\u2019e Afghans, and called Naushahr (Newcastle). About 50,000 rupees were spent upon it. They say that Hum\u0101y\u016bn used to hunt rhinoceros in this region. I also heard from my father that he had twice or thrice witnessed such a hunt in the company of his father. On Thursday, the 25th, I alighted at the saray of Daulat\u0101b\u0101d. A\u1e25mad Beg of Kabul, jagirdar of Peshawar, with the Maliks of the Y\u016bsufza\u2019es and the Ghoriya-khel, came and waited on me. As the service of A\u1e25mad Beg was not approved, I transferred him from that territory (wil\u0101yat) and conferred it on Sh\u012br Kh\u0101n, the Afghan. On Wednesday, the 26th, I encamped in the garden of Sard\u0101r Kh\u0101n, which he had made in the neighbourhood of Peshawar. I walked round Ghorkhatr\u012b, which is the worshipping-place of the jogis in this neighbourhood, with the idea that I might see some faqirs from association with whom I might obtain grace. But that was like looking for the phoenix or the philosopher\u2019s stone. A herd without any religious knowledge came to my view, from seeing whom I derived nothing but obscurity of mind. On Thursday, the 27th, I arrived at the halting-place of Jamr\u016bd, and on Friday, 28th, at the Khaibar Kotal (Khyber Pass) and encamped at \u2018Al\u012b Masjid, and on Saturday I traversed the tortuous (m\u0101rp\u012bch, i.e. snake-twisting) Pass, and alighted at Gharib-kh\u0101na. At this stage Ab\u016b-l-q\u0101sim Namak\u012bn, Jagirdar of Jal\u0101l\u0101b\u0101d, brought an apricot, which was not inferior in beauty to good Kashmir apricots. At the stage of Daka they brought from Kabul gil\u0101s (cherries), which my revered father had entitled Sh\u0101h-\u0101l\u0101. As I was much inclined to eat them, inasmuch as I had not (hitherto?) obtained them, I ate them with great zest as a relish to wine. On Tuesday,\n2nd \u1e62afar, I encamped at Bas\u0101wal, which is on the bank of the river. On the other side of the river there is a mountain which has no trees or grass on it, and on that account they call this mountain the hill of Bidaulat (unfortunate). I heard from my father that in mountains like this there are mines of gold. On the mountain of \u0100la B\u016bgh\u0101n, at the time when my revered father went to Kabul, I had had a gamarg\u0101h hunt, and killed several red deer. As I had handed over the administration of all civil affairs to the Am\u012bru-l-umar\u0101, and his illness increased greatly, and forgetfulness came over his faculties to such an extent that what was settled in one hour he forgot in the next, and his forgetfulness was increasing day by day, on Wednesday, the 3rd \u1e62afar, I entrusted the duties of the viziership to \u0100\u1e63af Kh\u0101n, presenting him with a special robe of honour, and inkstand and a jewelled pen. It was a remarkable coincidence that twenty-eight years previously to this, at the same halting-place, my revered father had promoted him to the rank of M\u012br Bakhshi (chief paymaster). A ruby which his brother Ab\u016b-l-q\u0101sim had bought for 40,000 rupees and sent him, he presented as an offering on obtaining the viziership. He petitioned that Khw\u0101ja Ab\u016b-l-\u1e25asan, who held the offices of bakhshi and the Q\u016br, etc., might go with him. Jal\u0101l\u0101b\u0101d was transferred from Ab\u016b-l-q\u0101sim Namak\u012bn to \u2018Arab Kh\u0101n. A white rock was present in the river-bed; I ordered them to carve it in the form of an elephant.\n\n1 The MSS. have sad instead of chand, i.e. 100.\n2 This \u0100\u1e63af Kh\u0101n is Qaw\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn Ja\u2018far Beg and the No. iii of Blochmann, p. 411. Apparently his appointment as Mir Bakhshi was made in 989 (1581), in which year Akbar went to Kabul. Blochmann says \u0100\u1e63af Kh\u0101n was made Mir Bakhshi in the room of Q\u0101\u1e93\u012b \u2018Al\u012b, and we find at p. 372 of A.N., iii, that Q\u0101\u1e93\u012b \u2018Al\u012b Bakhshi was appointed in that year to the Panjab. Twenty-eight years before 1016 (to the beginning of which Jah\u0101ng\u012br is referring) yields 988. Bas\u0101wal is on right bank of Kabul River below Jal\u0101l\u0101b\u0101d.\n3 Text baul\u012b, but the MSS. have l\u016bl\u012b, i.e. dancing-girl.\nand cut upon its breast this hemistich, which agrees with the date of the Hijra year: \u201cThe white stone elephant of Jah\u0101ng\u012br P\u0101dsh\u0101h,\u201d that is, 1016.\n\nOn the same day Kaly\u0101n, son of R\u0101ja Bikram\u0101jit, came from Gujarat. Certain extraordinary proceedings on the part of this rebellious rascal had been reported to me. Amongst these was this. He had kept a Musulm\u0101n l\u016bl\u012b woman in his house, and for fear this affair should become known had killed her father and mother and buried them in his house. I ordered that he should be imprisoned until I could enquire into his proceedings, and after ascertaining the truth I ordered first that they should cut out his tongue and place him in perpetual confinement, and that he should eat his food with dog-keepers and outcasts. On Wednesday I encamped at Surkh\u0101b. Thence I alighted at Jagdalak. At this stage I saw many ball\u016b\u1e6d\u00b9-trees (oak or chestnut), which are the best wood for burning. Although this stage had neither passes nor declivities there were plenty of rocks. On Friday, the 12th, I encamped at \u0100b-i-b\u0101rik, and Saturday, the 13th, at Y\u016brt-i-p\u0101dsh\u0101h. On Sunday, the 14th, I alighted at Kh\u016brd K\u0101bul (little Kabul). At this stage I entrusted the Chief Justiceship and Qaziship of the city of Kabul to Q\u0101\u1e93i \u2018\u0100rif, son of Mull\u0101 \u0160\u0101diq \u1e24alw\u0101\u2019i. They brought some ripe sh\u0101h-\u0101l\u016b (cherries) from the village of Gulbah\u0101r to this place; of these I ate with much enjoyment nearly a hundred. Daulat, the head of the village of Jigr\u012b\u00b2(?), brought some uncommon flowers, such as I had never seen in my life. Thence I alighted at Bikr\u0101m\u012b. At this place they brought to show me a piebald\u00b3 animal, like the flying (i.e. jumping) mouse, which in the Hindi tongue they call galahr\u012b (squirrel), and said that mice would not\n\n\u00b9 Generally spelt ball\u016b\u1e6d, either the oak or the chestnut. Cf. Erskine\u2019s Baber, p. 145. Sir Alexander Burnes calls the ball\u016b\u1e6d the holly.\n\u00b2 See below, p. 52, where the Ra\u2019\u012bs or headman of Chikr\u012b is mentioned.\n\u00b3 Cf. Erskine\u2019s Baber, p. 145.\nfrequent any house in which this animal was. On this account they call this animal the master of mice. As I had never seen one before, I ordered my painters to draw a likeness of it. It is larger than a mongoose. On the whole it is very like a civet cat. Having appointed Al\u012bmad Beg Kh\u0101n to punish the Afghans of Bangash, I ordered \u2018Abdu-r-Razz\u0101q Ma\u2019m\u016br\u012b, who was in Attock, to take 2,000,000 rupees under the charge of Mohan D\u0101s, son of R\u0101ja Bikram\u0101jit, with him, and divide it among the auxiliaries of the aforesaid army. One thousand musketeers were also ordered to accompany this army.\n\nShaikh \u2018Abdu-r-Rahm\u0101n, son of Shaikh Ab\u016b-l-fa\u017cl, was promoted to the rank of 2,000 personal and 1,500 horse, and obtained the title of Afzal Kh\u0101n. 15,000 rupees were presented to \u2018Arab Kh\u0101n, and 20,000 rupees more for the repair of the fort of Pesh Bul\u0101gh.\u00b9 I bestowed Sark\u0101r Kh\u0101np\u016br\u00b2 in fief on Dil\u0101war Kh\u0101n Afgh\u0101n. On Thursday, the 17th, from the Mast\u0101n bridge as far as the Shahr-\u0101r\u0101 garden, which was the encamping place for the royal standards, scattering rupees, half-rupees, and quarter-rupees to faqirs and indigent persons on both sides of the road, I entered the aforesaid garden. It appeared to be very green and fresh. As it was a Thursday I gave a wine entertainment to my intimates, and on account of hilarity and excitement ordered those who were of equal age to myself and had been my playfellows to jump over the stream that flowed through the middle of the garden and was about four gaz in width. Most of them could not jump it, and fell on the bank or into the stream. Although I jumped it, yet now that I was 40 years of age I could not jump it with the\n\n\u00b9 The fort of Pesh Bul\u0101q is mentioned in the third volume of the Akbar-n\u0101ma, p. 312. It is marked on the map of Afghanistan between Daka and Jal\u0101l\u0101b\u0101d.\n\u00b2 Sic in text, but should be Jaunp\u016br as in the MSS.\nactivity that I had shown in the presence of my revered father when I was 30. On this day I perambulated seven of the famous gardens of Kabul. I do not think that I ever walked so far before.\n\nFirst of all I walked round the Shahr-\u0101r\u0101 (city-adorning), then the Maht\u0101b (moonlight) garden, then the garden that B\u012bka Begam, grandmother of my father, had made, then passed through the \u016arta-b\u0101gh (middle garden), then a garden that Maryam-mak\u0101n\u012b, my own grandmother, had prepared, then the \u0160urat-kh\u0101na garden, which has a large chan\u0101r-tree, the like of which there is not in the other gardens of Kabul. Then, having seen the Ch\u0101rb\u0101gh, which is the largest of the city gardens, I returned to my own abode. There were abundance of cherries on the trees, each of which looked as it were a round ruby, hanging like globes on the branches. The Shahr-\u0101r\u0101 garden was made by Shahr-b\u0101n\u016b\u00b9 Begam, daughter of M\u012brz\u0101 Ab\u016b Sa\u2018id, who was own aunt to the late king B\u0101bar. From time to time it has been added to, and there is not a garden like it for sweetness in Kabul. It has all sorts of fruits and grapes, and its softness is such that to put one\u2019s sandalled\u00b2 feet on it would be far from propriety or good manners. In the neighbourhood of this garden an excellent plot of land came to view, which I ordered to be bought from the owners. I ordered a stream that flows from the guzarg\u0101h (ferry, also bleaching green) to be diverted into the middle of the ground so that a garden might be made such that in beauty and sweetness there should not be in the inhabited world another like it. I gave it the name of Jah\u0101n-\u0101r\u0101 (world-adorning). Whilst I was at Kabul I had several entertainments in the Shahr-\u0101r\u0101 garden,\n\n\u00b9 There was also a Shahr-b\u0101n\u016b who was B\u0101bar\u2019s sister. B\u012bka Begam was B\u0101bar\u2019s widow and the lady who carried his bones to Kabul.\n\u00b2 Bakafsh-p\u0101y, which Erskine renders \u2018with slippers on\u2019 and Elliot \u2018with his shoes on.\u2019\nsometimes with my intimates and courtiers and sometimes with the ladies of the harem. At nights I ordered the learned and the students of Kabul to hold the cooking entertainment,\\(^1\\) *bughra*, and the throwing of *bughra*, together with *arghushtak* dances.\n\nTo each of the band of *Bughr\u0101\u2019iy\u0101n* I gave a dress of honour, and also gave 1,000 rupees to divide amongst themselves. To twelve of the trustworthy courtiers I ordered 12,000 rupees to be given, to be bestowed every Thursday, as long as I was in Kabul, on the poor and needy. I gave an order that between two plane-trees that were on the canal bank in the middle of the garden\u2014to one of which I had given the name of Far\u0101h-bakhsh (joy-giver) and the other S\u0101ya-bakhsh (shade-giver)\u2014they should set up a piece of white stone (marble?) one gaz in length and three-quarters of a gaz in breadth, and engrave my name thereon (and those of my ancestors) up to Tim\u016br. It was set forth on the other side that I had done away with the whole of the customs dues and charges of Kabul, and whichever of my\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) B\u0101yazid Biy\u0101t describes Hum\u0101y\u016bn as holding a cooking festival in Badakhsh\u0101n. See A.N., i, translation, p. 496, n. 2. They cooked *bughra*, which appears to be macaroni. The text wrongly has *raq\u1e93 az \u2018i\u0161q* (love-dances). The real word, as the MSS. show, is *arghushtag*, which is a kind of dance (not a child\u2019s game as in Johnson). It is described in Vullers, s.v., in accordance with the account in the Burh\u0101n-i-q\u0101\u1e6d\u012b\u2018. It is a dance by girls or young men, and is accompanied with singing and with clapping of hands, etc. Probably it is the dance described by Elphinstone in his account of Kabul, i, 311, where he says: \u201cThe great delight of all the western Afghans is to dance the Attun or Ghoomboor. From ten to twenty men or women stand up in a circle (in summer before their houses and tents, and in winter round a fire); a person stands within the circle to sing and play on some instrument. The dancers go through a number of attitudes and figures; shouting, clapping their hands, and snapping their fingers. Every now and then they join hands, and move slow or fast according to the music, all joining in chorus. When I was showed this, a love-song was sung to an extremely pretty tune, very simple, and not unlike a Scottish air.\u201d Erskine\u2019s translation is: \u201cCustards and confections were presented, and the amusements of dancing girls and arghustak were introduced.\u201d\ndescendants and successors should do anything contrary to this would be involved in the wrath and displeasure of God. Up to the time of my accession these were fixed and settled, and every year they took large sums on this account from the servants of God (the Muhammadan people in general). The abolition of this oppression was brought about during my reign. On this journey to Kabul complete relief and contentment were brought about in the circumstances of my subjects and the people of that place. The good and leading men of Ghazn\u012bn and that neighbourhood were presented with robes of honour and dealt kindly with, and had their desires excellently gratified.\n\nIt is a strange coincidence that (the words) \\( r\u016bz-i-panjshanba h\u012bzhdaham-i-\u1e62afar \\), Thursday, 18th \u1e62afar, which is the date of my entry into Kabul, give the Hijra date thereof.\n\nI ordered them to inscribe this date on the stone. Near a seat (\\( takht \\)) on the slope of a hill to the south of the city of Kabul, and which is known as Takht-i-sh\u0101h, they have made a stone terrace where Fird\u016bs-mak\u0101n\u012b (B\u0101bar) used to sit and drink wine. In one corner of this rock they have excavated a round basin which could contain about two Hindustani maunds of wine. He caused his own blessed name with the date to be carved on the wall of the terrace which is next to the hill. The wording is, \u201cThe seat of the king, the asylum of the world, Z\u0101hiru-d-din Mu\u1e25ammad B\u0101bar, son of \u2018Umar Shaikh G\u016brg\u0101n, may God perpetuate his kingdom, 914 (1508\u20139).\u201d I also ordered them to cut out of stone another throne parallel\n\n---\n\n1 The words seem to me to yield 1066, but if we read \\( pajshanba \\) instead of \\( panjshanba \\) we get 1016, which is the Hijra date of Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u2019s entry into Kabul and corresponds to 4th June, 1607. A marginal note on I.O.M. 305 makes the chronogram clear by writing \\( r\u016bz-i-panchanba h\u012bzhdah-i-\u1e62afar \\), thereby getting rid of the \\( m\u012bm \\) and the \\( y\u0101 \\) of \\( h\u012bzhdaham \\) and bringing out the figures 1016.\nto this, and dig another basin of the same fashion on its side, and engrave my name there, together with that of \u0160\u0101h\u012bb-q\u012br\u0101n\u012b (Tim\u016br). Every day that I sat on that throne I ordered them to fill both of the basins with wine and give it to the servants who were present there. One of the poets of Ghaznin found the date of my coming to Kabul in this chronogram\u2014\"The king of the cities of the seven climes\" (1016). I gave him a dress of honour and a present, and ordered them to engrave this date on the wall near the aforesaid seat. Fifty thousand rupees were given to Parwiz; Waz\u012br-al-mulk was made Mir Bakhshi. A firman was sent to Qilij Kh\u0101n to despatch 170,000 rupees from the Lahore treasury for expenses of the army at Qandahar. After visiting the Khiy\u0101b\u0101n (avenue) of Kabul and the Bib\u012b M\u0101h-r\u016b, I ordered the governor of that city to plant other trees in the place of those cut down by Husain Beg R\u016b-siy\u0101h (the black-faced). I also visited the \u016alang-y\u016brt of Ch\u0101l\u0101k and found it a very pleasant place. The Ra\u02beis of Chikr\u012b (Jigr\u012b?) shot with an arrow a rang\\(^1\\) and brought it to me. Up to this time I had never seen a rang. It is like a mountain goat, and there is a difference only in its horns. The horns of the rang are bent, and those of the goat are straight and convoluted.\n\nIn connection with the account of Kabul the commentaries of B\u0101bar\\(^2\\) passed in view before me. These were in his own handwriting, except four sections (\\(juz\\)\\(^3\\)) that I wrote myself. At the end of the said sections a sentence was written by me also in the Turki character, so that it might be known that these four sections were written by me in my own hand. Notwithstanding that I grew up in Hindustan, I am not ignorant of Turki\n\n---\n\n1 Evidently a kind of sheep.\n2 This is a reference to B\u0101bar\u2019s Memoirs.\n3 A \\(juz\\) is said to consist of eight leaves or sixteen pages. Does Jah\u0101ng\u012br mean that he wrote sixty-four pages?\nspeech and writing. On the 25th \u1e62afar I with the people of the harem visited the julg\u0101h (plain) of Saf\u012bd-sang, a very bright and enjoyable place. On Friday, the 26th, I enjoyed the blessing of a pilgrimage to (the tomb of) H.M. Fird\u016bs-mak\u0101n\u012b (B\u0101bar). I ordered much money and food, bread, and sweetmeats for the souls of the departed to be distributed to faqirs. Ruqayya Sult\u0101n Begam, daughter of M\u012brz\u0101 Hind\u0101l, had not performed a pilgrimage to her father\u2019s tomb, and on that day had the honour to do so. On Thursday, 3rd Rab\u012b\u2018u-l-awwal, I ordered them to bring my racehorses (\u0101sp\u0101n-i-dawanda) to the Khiy\u0101b\u0101n (avenue). The princes and the Amirs raced them. A bay Arab horse, which \u2018\u0100dil Kh\u0101n, the ruler of the Deccan, had sent to me, ran better than all the other horses. At this time the son of M\u012brz\u0101 Sanjar Haz\u0101ra and the son of M\u012brz\u0101 M\u0101sh\u012b, who were the chief leaders of the Haz\u0101ras, came to wait on me. The Haz\u0101ras of the village of\n\n---\n\n1 Probably the sections which Jah\u0101ng\u012br wrote were those printed in the Ilminsky edition and which bring the narrative down to B\u0101bar\u2019s death. They seem to have been in great measure copied from the Akbar-n\u0101ma. Jah\u0101ng\u012br does not say if he wrote them when he was in Kabul or previously. According to Blochmann, J.A.S.B. for 1869, p. 134, one juz\u2019 = two sheets of paper. The passage is translated in Elliot, vi, 315. Though Jah\u0101ng\u012br does not say when he wrote the four sections, I think that his language implies that these additions were in the manuscript when he was looking at it in Kabul. Perhaps he made them when he was a student in India, and for the sake of practice in Turki. He may have translated the sections from the Akbar-n\u0101ma. All, I think, he did in Kabul was to put the Turki note, stating that the sections were his. But possibly even this was done before. Elliot, vi, 315, has the words \u201cto complete the work,\u201d but these words do not occur in the MSS. that I have seen. The translation in Elliot, seems to represent Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u2019s words as meaning that the work was complete, but that the four sections were not, like the rest, in B\u0101bar\u2019s handwriting, and so Jah\u0101ng\u012br re-copied them. But it does not appear that there could be any object in his doing this. There is a valuable article in the Zeitschrift d. Deutschen Morgenl. Gesellsch. for 1883, p. 141, by Dr. Teufel, entitled \u201cB\u0101bur und Ab\u016b\u2019l-fa\u1e93l,\u201d in which the fragments in Ilminsky are discussed. But the passage in the T\u016bzuk-i-Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u012b is not referred to.\nMird\u0101d produced before me two rangs\\(^1\\) that they had killed with arrows. I had never seen a rang of this size; it was larger by 20 per cent. than a large m\u0101rkh\u016br(?).\n\nNews came that Sh\u0101h Beg Kh\u0101n, the governor of Qandahar, had reached the parganah of Shor,\\(^2\\) which is his jagir. I determined to give Kabul to him and return to Hindustan. A petition came from R\u0101ja Birsing-deo that he had made a prisoner of his nephew, who had been creating a disturbance and had killed many of his men. I ordered him to send him to the fort of Gwalior to be imprisoned there. The parganah of Gujrat\\(^3\\) in the Panjab Sark\u0101r I bestowed on Shir Kh\u0101n, the Afghan. I promoted Ch\u012bn Qilij, son of Qilij Kh\u0101n, to the rank of 800 personal and 500 horse. On the 12th I sent for Khusrau and ordered them to take the chains off his legs that he might walk in the Shahr-\u0101r\u0101 garden. My fatherly affection would not permit me to exclude him from walking in the aforesaid garden. I transferred the fort of Attock and that neighbourhood from Alhmad Beg to Zafar Kh\u0101n.\n\nTo T\u0101j Kh\u0101n, who was nominated to beat back the Afghans of Bangash, I gave 50,000 rupees. On the 14th I gave \u2018Ali Kh\u0101n Karori,\\(^4\\) who was one of my revered father\u2019s old servants and was the darogha of the Naq\u0101rakh\u0101na (drum-house), the title of Naubat Kh\u0101n, and promoted him to the rank of 500 personal and 200 horse. I made R\u0101m D\u0101s \u0101t\u0101l\u012bq to Mah\u0101 Singh, grandson of R\u0101ja M\u0101n Singh, who had also been nominated to drive back the rebels of Bangash. On Friday, the 18th, the wazn-i-qamar\u012b (the weighing according to the lunar year) for my 40th year took place.

I gave 10,000 rupees of the money of the weighing to ten of my confidential servants to divide amongst those who deserved it and the needy. On this day a petition came from Sard\u0101r Kh\u0101n, governor of Qandahar, by way of Haz\u0101ra and Ghazn\u012bn, in twelve days; its purport was that the ambassador of Sh\u0101h \u2018Abb\u0101s, who had started for the Court, had entered the Haz\u0101ra\u00b9 (country). The Shah had written to his own people: \u201cWhat seeker of occasion and raiser of strife has come against Qandahar without my order? Perhaps he does not know what is our connection with H.M. Sul\u1e6d\u0101n Tim\u016br, and especially with Hum\u0101y\u016bn and his glorious descendants. If they by chance should have taken the country into their possession they should hand it to the friends and servants of my brother Jah\u0101ng\u012br P\u0101dsh\u0101h and return to their own abodes.\u201d I determined to tell Sh\u0101h Beg Kh\u0101n to secure the Ghazn\u012bn road in such a way that travellers from Qandahar might reach Kabul with ease. At the same time I appointed Q\u0101\u1e93\u012b N\u016bru-d-d\u012bn to the \u1e62ad\u0101rat of the province of Malwah and Ujjain. The son of M\u012brz\u0101 Sh\u0101dm\u0101n Haz\u0101ra and grandson of Qar\u0101cha Kh\u0101n, who was one of the influential Amirs of Hum\u0101y\u016bn, waited on me. Qar\u0101cha Kh\u0101n had married a woman from the Haz\u0101ra tribe, and this son\u00b2 had been born by her. On Saturday, the 19th, R\u0101n\u0101 Shankar, son of R\u0101n\u0101 \u016aday Singh, was promoted to the rank of 2,500 personal and 1,000 horse. An order was given for the rank of 1,000 personal and 600 horse for R\u0101y Manohar. The Shinw\u0101r\u012b Afghans brought a mountain ram the two horns of which had become one and had become like a rang\u2019s horns.

I ordered my artists to paint him. He weighed four Hindustani maunds; the length of his horns was $1\\frac{1}{2}$ gaz.\\footnote{The MSS. have \u201cless than $1\\frac{1}{2}$ gaz by $\\frac{1}{8}$ ($n\u012bm-p\u0101o$).} On Sunday, the 27th, I gave the rank of 1,500 personal and 1,000 horse to Shaj\u0101\u02bfat Kh\u0101n, and the hawil\u012b (district surrounding) of Gwalior was placed in the jagir of Itib\u0101r Kh\u0101n. I appointed Q\u0101z\u012b \u02bfIzzatu-llah with his brothers to the Bangash duty. At the end of the same day a petition came to me from Isl\u0101m Kh\u0101n from Agra, together with a letter which Jah\u0101ng\u012br Quli Kh\u0101n had written to him from Bihar. Its purport was that on the 3rd \u1e62afar (30th May, 1607), after the first watch, \u2018\u0100li Quli Ist\u0101jl\u016b had wounded Qu\u1e6dbu-d-din Kh\u0101n at Bardwan, in the province of Bengal, and that he had died when two watches of the same night had passed. The details of this matter are that the aforesaid \u2018\u0100li Quli was sufrach\u012b (table servant) to Sh\u0101h Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl (the 2nd), ruler of Iran; after his death he took to flight through his natural wickedness and habit of making mischief, and came to Qandahar, and having met at Multan the Kh\u0101nkhan\u0101n, who had been appointed to the charge of the province of Tulamba,\\footnote{Should, I think, be Tattah, i.e. Sind.} started with him for that province. The Kh\u0101nkhan\u0101n in the field\\footnote{Ghaib\u0101na, \u2018secretly.\u2019 But the phrase merely means that the appointment was not made in the Emperor\u2019s presence.} placed him among the servants of the late king (Akbar), and he having performed services in that campaign was promoted to a rank in accordance with his condition, and was a long time in the service of my revered father. At the time when he (Akbar) went in prosperity to the provinces of the Deccan, and I was ordered against the R\u0101n\u0101, he came and became servant to me. I gave him the title of Shir-\nafgan (tiger-throwing). When I came from Allahabad to wait on my revered father, on account of the unfriendliness that was shown me, most of my attendants and people were scattered abroad, and he also at that time chose to leave my service. After my accession, out of generosity I overlooked his offences, and gave an order for a jagir for him in the Subah of Bengal. Thence came news that it was not right to leave such mischievous persons there, and an order went to Qu\u1e6dbu-d-d\u012bn Kh\u0101n to send him to Court, and if he showed any futile, seditious ideas, to punish him. The aforesaid Kh\u0101n had reason to know him (his character), and with the men he had present, immediately the order arrived, went hastily to Bardwan, which was his jagir. When he (Sh\u012br-afgan) became aware of the arrival of Qu\u1e6dbu-d-d\u012bn Kh\u0101n, he went out to receive him alone with two grooms. After he arrived and entered into the midst of his army (his camp) the aforesaid Kh\u0101n surrounded him. When from this proceeding on the part of Qu\u1e6dbu-d-d\u012bn Kh\u0101n a doubt arose in his mind, he by way of deceiving him said: \u201cWhat proceeding is this of thine?\u201d\u00b9 The aforesaid Kh\u0101n, keeping back his own men, joined him alone in order to explain the purport of the order to him. Seeing his opportunity he immediately drew his sword and inflicted two or three severe wounds upon him. Amba Kh\u0101n Kashmir\u012b, who was descended from the rulers of Kashmir and was connected (by marriage?) with the aforesaid Kh\u0101n, and had a great regard for him by way of loyalty and manliness, rushed forward and struck a heavy blow on \u2018Al\u012b Quli\u2019s head, and that vicious fellow inflicted a severe wound on Amba Kh\u0101n with the point of his sword.\u00b2 When they saw Qu\u1e6dbu-d-d\u012bn Kh\u0101n in this\n\n\u00b9 Text bargasht, \u2018he turned round.\u2019 But the MSS. have chi ravish-i-t\u016bzukast, \u201cWhat kind of arrangement is this?\u201d\n\n\u00b2 Shamsh\u012br-i-sikhak\u012b, \u2018pointed sword, poniard\u2019?\nstate, his men attacked him (Shir-afgan), and cut him in pieces and sent him to hell. It is to be hoped that the place of this black-faced scoundrel will always be there. Amba Kh\u0101n obtained martyrdom on the spot, and Qu\u1e6dbu-d-din Kh\u0101n Koka after four watches attained the mercy of God in his quarters. What can I write of this unpleasantness? How grieved and troubled I became! Qu\u1e6dbu-d-din Kh\u0101n Koka was to me in the place of a dear son, a kind brother, and a congenial friend. What can one do with the decrees of God? Bowing to destiny I adopted an attitude of resignation. After the departure of the late King and the death of that honoured one, no two misfortunes had happened to me like the death of the mother of Qu\u1e6dbu-d-din Kh\u0101n Koka and his own martyrdom.\n\nOn Friday, the 6th Rabi\u2018u-l-\u0101khir, I came to the quarters of Khurr\u0101m (Sh\u0101h-Jah\u0101n), which had been made in the \u016arta Garden. In truth, the building is a delightful and well-proportioned one. Whereas it was the rule of my father to have himself weighed twice every year, (once) according to the solar and (once according to the) lunar year, and to have the princes weighed according to the solar year, and moreover in this year, which was the commencement of my son Khurr\u0101m\u2019s 16th lunar year, the astrologers and astronomers\\(^1\\) represented that a most important epoch according to his horoscope would occur, as the prince\u2019s health\\(^2\\) had not been good, I gave an order that they should weigh him according to the prescribed rule, against gold, silver, and other metals, which should be divided among faqirs and the needy. The whole of that day was passed in enjoyment and pleasure in the house of B\u0101b\u0101 Khurr\u0101m, and many of his presents were approved.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The meaning of two words being used probably is that both Hindu and Persian astrologers are referred to. Blochmann, p. 311, says that Sh\u0101h-Jah\u0101n\u2019s birthday was 30th Rabi\u2018u-l-awwal.\n\n\\(^2\\) Lit., \u201cHis disposition had changed from equability.\u201d\nAs I had experienced the excellencies of Kabul, and had eaten most of its fruits, in consequence of important considerations and the distance from the capital, on Sunday, the 4th Jum\u0101d\u0101-l-awwal, I gave an order that they should send out the advance camp in the direction of Hindustan. After some days I left the city, and the royal standards proceeded to the meadow of Safid-sang. Although the grapes were not yet fully ripe, I had often before this eaten Kabul grapes. There are many good sorts of grapes, especially the \u0160ah\u012bb\u012b and Kishmishi. The cherry also is a fruit of pleasant flavour, and one can eat more of it than of other fruits; I have in a day eaten up to 150 of them. The term sh\u0101h-\u0101l\u016b means gil\u0101s\u00b9 (cherry), which are obtainable in most places of the country, but since gil\u0101s is like gil\u0101s, which is one of the names of the chalp\u0101sa (lizard), my revered father called it sh\u0101h-\u0101l\u016b. The zard-\u0101l\u016b paywand\u012b\u00b2 is good, and is abundant. There is especially a tree in the Shahr-\u0101r\u0101 garden, that Mirz\u0101 Mu\u1e25ammad \u1e24ak\u012bm, my uncle, planted, and is known as the Mirz\u0101\u02bei. The apricots of this tree are quite unlike the apricots of other trees. The peaches also are very delicious and plentiful. They had brought some peaches from Ist\u0101lif. I had them weighed in my presence, and they came exactly in weight to 25 rupees, which is 68 current misq\u0101l. Notwithstanding the sweetness of the Kabul fruits, not one of them has, to my taste, the flavour of the mango. The parganah of Mah\u0101ban was given as jagir to Mah\u0101bat Kh\u0101n. \u2018Abdu-r-Ra\u1e25\u012bm, paymaster of the Ahadis, was promoted to the rank of 700 personal\n\n\u00b9 Gil\u0101s is a cherry in Kashmiri. See Blochmann\u2019s \u0100y\u012bn, p. 616. Ab\u016b-l-fa\u017cl mentions in the \u0100y\u012bn (Blochmann, p. 66) that Akbar called gil\u0101s sh\u0101h-\u0101l\u016b.\n\n\u00b2 Paywand\u012b means \u2018to graft,\u2019 and possibly this is the meaning here, but Steingass gives paywand\u012b as part of the name of a plum. The text seems to be corrupt, and perhaps what Jah\u0101ng\u012br wrote was \u201cthe zard-\u0101l\u016b resembles the kh\u016bb\u0101n\u012b.\u201d\nand 200 horse. Mub\u0101rak Kh\u0101n Sarw\u0101n\u012b was appointed to the faujdarship of the sarkar of \u1e24i\u1e63\u0101r. I ordered that M\u012brz\u0101 Far\u012bd\u016bn Barl\u0101s should have a jagir in the Subah of Allahabad. On the 14th of the aforesaid month I gave Ir\u0101dat Kh\u0101n, brother of \u0100\u1e63af Kh\u0101n, the rank of 1,000 personal and 500 horse, and presenting him with a special robe of honour and a horse, bestowed on him the paymastership of the Subah of Patna and H\u0101jipur. As he was my q\u016brbeg\u012b, I sent by his hand a jewelled sword for my son (farzand) Isl\u0101m Kh\u0101n, the governor of the aforesaid Subah. As we were going along I saw near \u2018Al\u012b Masjid and Gharib-kh\u0101na a large spider of the size of a crab that had seized by the throat a snake of one and a half gaz in length and half strangled it. I delayed a minute to look on at this, and after a moment it died (the snake).\n\nI heard at Kabul that in the time of Ma\u1e25m\u016bd of Ghazni a person of the name of Khw\u0101ja T\u0101b\u016bt\u00b9 had died in the neighbourhood of Zuh\u0101k and B\u0101miy\u0101n, and was buried in a cave, whose limbs had not yet rotted asunder. This appeared very strange, and I sent one of my confidential record writers with a surgeon to go to the cave and, having seen the state of affairs as they were, to make a special report. He represented that half of the body which was next the ground had most\n\n\u00b9 Text has Y\u0101q\u016bt, but it is clear from the Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, p. 25, and from I.O. MS. 181 that the name is Khw\u0101ja T\u0101b\u016bt, \u2018the coffin Khw\u0101ja.\u2019 The author of the Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma was the person sent to make the inquiry, and he gives a long account of what he saw. A surgeon was sent with him, as the Khw\u0101ja was said to have been martyred, and it was necessary to report on the wounds. The coffin story is mentioned in the \u0100y\u012bn, i, 194. See Jarrett, ii, 409\u201310, but the translation is not quite accurate, I think. The punctuation of the text seems to me to be correct. It is characteristic of Jah\u0101ng\u012br and the author of the Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma that they take no notice of the colossal figures at B\u0101miy\u0101n, though Ab\u016b-l-fa\u017cl does. See Jarrett\u2019s note. It is stated in the Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma that Khw\u0101ja T\u0101b\u016bt was said to have been killed in the time of Ching\u012bz Kh\u0101n. If so, the Sult\u0101n Ma\u1e25m\u016bd mentioned by Jah\u0101ng\u012br must be Sult\u0101n Ma\u1e25m\u016bd Ghor\u012b.\nof it come asunder, and the other half which had not touched the ground remained in its own condition. The nails of the hands and feet and the hair of the head had not been shed, but the hair of the beard and moustache as far as one side of the nose had been shed. From the date that had been engraved on the door of the cave it appeared that his death had occurred before the time of Sul\u1e6d\u0101n Mahm\u016bd. No one knows the exact state of the case.\n\nOn Thursday, the 15th Arsl\u0101n B\u012b, governor of the fort of K\u0101hmad, who was one of the servants of middle rank (?) of Wali Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n, ruler of T\u016br\u0101n, came and waited on me.\u00b9 I had always heard that Mirz\u0101 \u1e24usain, son of Sh\u0101hrukh Mirz\u0101, had been killed by the \u016azbegs. At this time a certain person came and presented a petition in his name, and brought a ruby of the colour of an onion, which was worth 100 rupees, as an offering. He prayed that an army might be appointed to assist him, so that he might take Badakhshan out of the \u016azbegs\u2019 hands. A jewelled dagger-belt was sent him, and an order given that, as the royal standards had alighted in those regions, if he really was Mirz\u0101 \u1e24usain, son of Mirz\u0101 Sh\u0101hrukh, he should first hasten into my presence, so that having examined his petitions and claims I might send him to Badakhshan. Two hundred thousand rupees were sent for the army that had been sent with Mah\u0101 Singh and R\u0101m D\u0101s against the rebels of Bangash.\n\nOn Thursday, the 22nd, having gone to the B\u0101l\u0101 Hi\u1e63\u0101r, I inspected the buildings in that place. As the place was not fit for me I ordered them to destroy these buildings and to prepare a palace and a royal hall of audience. On the same day they brought a peach from Ist\u0101lif, bar\u0101bar sar-i-buh bakal\u0101n\u012b, \u201cas big as an owl\u2019s\n\n\u00b9 He was appointed governor of Sehw\u0101n (Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, p. 27).\nhead\u201d (?). I had not seen a peach of such a size, and ordered it to be weighed, and it came to 63 Akbari rupees, or 60 tolas. When I cut it in half its stone also came into two pieces, and its substance was sweet. I had in Kabul never eaten better fruit from any tree.\n\nOn the 25th news came from Malwa that Mirz\u0101 Sh\u0101hrukh had bid farewell to this transitory world, and God Almighty had submerged him in His mercy. From the day on which he entered the service of my revered father till the time of his departure, from no act of his could dust be brought into the royal mind. He always did his duty with sincerity. The aforesaid Mirz\u0101 apparently had four sons: \u1e24asan and \u1e24usain were born of the same womb (i.e. they were twins). \u1e24usain fled from Burhanpur and went by sea to Iraq, and thence to Badakhshan, where they say he now is, as has been written about his message and his sending some one to me. No one knows for certain whether it is the same Mirz\u0101 \u1e24usain, or the people of Badakhshan have raised up this one like other false Mirz\u0101s and given him the name of Mirz\u0101 \u1e24usain. From the time when Mirz\u0101 Sh\u0101hrukh came from Badakhshan and had the good fortune to wait on my father until now, nearly 25 years have passed. For some time the people of Badakhshan, on account of the oppression and injury they have to undergo from the \u016azbegs, have given notoriety to a Badakhshan boy, who had on his face the marks of nobility, as really the son of Mirz\u0101 Sh\u0101hrukh and of the race of Mirz\u0101 Sulaim\u0101n. A large number of the scattered \u016aym\u0101qs, and the hill-people of Badakhshan,\n\n---\n\n1 The MSS. merely have \u201cof a size that I had never seen before.\u201d Probably the text is corrupt, and the meaning may be \u201cas big as a head.\u201d Bih is a quince, and perhaps this is what is meant here. Or the meaning may be \u201cequal to the biggest for size.\u201d Or sar may be a mistake for sih and the meaning be \u201cequal in size to three (ordinary peaches).\u201d\nwhom they call Gharchal (Georgians ?), collected round him, and showing enmity and disputing with the \u016azbegs, took some of the districts of Badakhshan out of their possession. The \u016azbegs attacked that false Mirz\u0101 and captured him, and placing his head on a spear sent it round to the whole country of Badakhshan. Again the seditious people of Badakhshan quickly produced another Mirz\u0101. Up to now several Mirz\u0101s have been killed. It appears to me that as long as there is any trace of the people of Badakhshan they will keep up this disturbance. The third son of the Mirz\u0101 is Mirz\u0101 Sult\u0101n, who excels in appearance and disposition all the other sons of the Mirz\u0101. I begged him from his revered father, and have kept him in my own service, and having taken great pains with him reckon him as my own child. In disposition and manners he has no likeness to his brothers. After my accession I gave him the rank of 2,000 personal and 1,000 horse, and sent him to the Subah of Malwa, which was his father\u2019s place. The fourth son is Badi\u2018u-z-zam\u0101n, whom he always had in attendance on himself; he obtained the rank of 1,000 personal and 500 horse.\n\nWhile I was at Kabul, no qamarg\u0101h hunt had taken place. As the time for returning to Hindustan had come near, and I was very desirous of hunting red deer, I ordered them to go forward as soon as possible and surround the hill Faraq,\\(^1\\) which is seven kos from Kabul. On Tuesday, the 4th Jum\u0101d\u0101-l-awwal, I went to hunt. Nearly 100 deer had come into the enclosure (qamargah). About a half of these were taken, and a very hot hunt took place. I gave 5,000 rupees in rewards to the ryots who were present at the hunt. On the same day an increase of 500 horse was ordered to the rank of Shaikh\n\n\\(^1\\) I.O. MS. 181 has Qarqara mountains. There is also the reading Kharaq.\n'Abdu-r-Rahm\u0101n, son of Shaikh Ab\u016b-l-fa\u017cl, so as to bring it to 2,000 personal and (2,000) horse. On Thursday, the 6th, I went to the throne-place of the late king B\u0101bar. As I was to leave Kabul on the next day I looked on that day as a feast day, and ordered them to arrange a wine-party on the spot, and fill with wine the little reservoir they had cut in the rock. Cups were given to all the courtiers and servants who were present, and few days have passed in such enjoyment and pleasure. On Friday, the 7th, when a watch of day had passed, leaving the city auspiciously and with pleasure, a halt was made at the julg\u0101h (meadow) of the Safid-sang. From the Shahr-\u0101r\u0101 as far as the julgah I scattered to faqirs and poor people darb and charan, that is, half and quarter rupees.\\(^1\\) On that day, when I mounted my elephant for the purpose of leaving Kabul, the news arrived of the recovery of the Am\u012bru-l-umar\u0101 and Sh\u0101h Beg Kh\u0101n. The news of the good health of these two chief servants of mine I took as an auspicious omen for myself. From the julgah of the Safid-sang, marching one kos on Tuesday, the 11th, I halted at Bikr\u0101m. I left T\u0101sh Beg Kh\u0101n at Kabul to take proper care of Kabul and neighbourhood until the coming of Sh\u0101h Beg Kh\u0101n. On Tuesday, the 18th, I marched two and a half kos from the halting-place of B\u016btkh\u0101k by the road D\u016b'\u0101ba,\\(^2\\) and encamped at a spring on the bank of which there are four plane-trees. No one till now had looked to the preparation of this halting-place, and they were ignorant of its condition and suitability. It is in truth a most excellent spot, and one fit to have a building erected in it. At this halting-place another qamargah hunt took place, when about 112 deer, etc., were taken. Twenty-four rang antelope and 50 red antelope and 16 mountain goats were\n\n\\(^1\\) Blochmann, p. 31.\n\n\\(^2\\) D\u016b'\u0101ba is mentioned as a stage by W. Finch.\ntaken. I had never till now seen a rang antelope alive.\\footnote{The text omits the word \\textit{zinda}, 'alive.'} It is in truth a wonderful animal of a beautiful shape. Although the black buck of Hindustan looks very finely made, the shape and fashion and appearance of this antelope is quite a different thing. They weighed a ram and a rang; the ram came to a maund and 33 seers and the rang to two maunds and 10 seers. The rang, although of this size, ran so that ten or twelve swift dogs were worn out and seized it with a hundred thousand difficulties. The flesh of the sheep of the Barbary goat in flavour does not surpass that of the rang. In the same village kulangs (demoiselle crane) were also caught.\n\nAlthough Khusrau had repeatedly done evil actions and deserved a thousand kinds of punishment, my fatherly affection did not permit me to take his life. Although in the laws of government and the ways of empire one should take notice of such disapproved deeds, I averted my eyes from his faults, and kept him in excessive comfort and ease. It became known that he was in the habit of sending men to scoundrels who did not consider consequences, and of inciting them to give trouble and attempt my life, and making them hopeful with promises. A band of these ill-fated ones of little foresight having joined together, desired to attack me in the hunts that took place in Kabul and those parts. As the grace and protection of God Almighty are the guardians and keepers of this sublime dynasty, they did not attain to their end. On the day when the halt was at the Surkh\u0101b, one of that band went at the risk of his life to Khw\u0101ja Wais\u012b, the Diw\u0101n of my son Khurr\u0101m, and revealed that nearly 500 men at Khusrau's instigation had conspired with Fath\u016b-llah, son of \u1e24ak\u012bm Ab\u016b-l-fath, N\u016bru-d-d\u012bn, son of Ghiy\u0101\u1e63u-d-d\u012bn \u2018Al\u012b \u0100\u1e63af-kh\u0101n, and Shar\u012bf, son of I\u2019tim\u0101du-d-daulah (N\u016br-Jah\u0101n's father), and were awaiting an opportunity\nto carry out the designs of the enemies and evil-wishers of the king. Khw\u0101ja Wais\u012b told this to Khurram, and he in great perturbation immediately told me. I gave Khurram the blessing of felicity, and prepared to get hold of the whole set of those short-sighted ones and punish them with various kinds of punishment. Again, it came to my mind, as I was on the march, and the seizure of these people would create a disturbance and confusion in the camp,\\(^1\\) to order the leaders of the disturbance and mischief to be apprehended. I handed over Fat\u1e25u-llah in confinement to certain trusty men, and ordered capital punishment for the other two wretches, with three or four of the chief among the black-faced (conspirators). I had dignified Q\u0101sim \u2018Al\u012b, who was one of the servants of the late king Akbar, after my accession with the title of Day\u0101nat Kh\u0101n. He always accused Fat\u1e25u-llah of a want of loyalty, and said things about him. One day he said to Fat\u1e25u-llah: \u201cAt the time when Khusrau fled and the king pursued him, you said to me: \u2018The Panjab should be given to Khusrau and this quarrel cut short.\u2019\u201d Fat\u1e25u-llah denied this, and both resorted to oaths and curses (on themselves). Ten or fifteen days had not passed after this altercation when that hypocritical wretch was arrested, and his false oath did its business.\n\nOn Saturday, the 22nd Jum\u0101d\u0101-l-awwal, the news came of the death of the \u1e24ak\u012bm Jal\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn Muzaffar Ardist\u0101n\u012b, who was of a family of skill and medicine and claimed to be a descendant of Galen. At all events he was an unequalled healer. His experience added to his knowledge.\\(^2\\) As he was very handsome and well-made\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The urdu or camp was probably not with Jah\u0101ng\u012br then, and he thought that if he sent to it for the capture of 500 there would be confusion. He therefore contented himself at the time with arresting the ringleaders. There is a full account of the conspiracy in the Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, p. 27, etc.\n\n\\(^2\\) Possibly the meaning is \u201chis experience was greater than his skill.\u201d\nin the days of his youth (s\u0101da-r\u016b\u2019\u012bh\u0101)\\(^1\\) he frequented the assemblies of Sh\u0101h \u1e6cahm\u0101sp, and the king recited this hemistich about him:\n\n\u201cWe have a pleasant physician: come, let us all be ill.\u201d\n\n\u1e24ak\u012bm \u2018Al\u012b, who was his contemporary, exceeded him in skill. In short, in medical skill and auspiciousness and rectitude and purity of method and disposition he was perfect. Other physicians of the age could not compare with him. In addition to his medical skill he had many excellencies. He had perfect loyalty towards me. He built at Lahore a house of great pleasantness and purity, and repeatedly asked me to honour it (with my presence). As I was very fond of pleasing him I consented. In short, the aforesaid \u1e24ak\u012bm, from his connection with me and being my physician, had great skill in the management of affairs and business of the world, so that for some time at Allahabad I made him Diwan of my establishment. On account of his great honesty he was very exacting in important business, and people were vexed at this method of proceeding. For about twenty years he had ulcerated lungs, and by his wisdom preserved in some measure his health. When he was talking he mostly coughed so much that his cheek and eyes became red, and by degrees his colour became blue. I often said to him: \u201cThou art a learned physician: why dost thou not cure thy own wounds?\u201d He represented that wounds in the lungs were not of such a nature that they could be cured. During his illness one of his confidential servants put poison into some medicine he was in the habit of taking every day and gave it to him. When he perceived this he took remedies for it. He objected very much to be bled, although this was necessary. It happened that he was going to the privy when his cough overcame him and\n\n\\(^1\\) Lit., when he was smooth-faced, i.e. beardless.\nopened the wounds in his lungs. So much blood poured out of his mouth and brain that he became insensible and fell, and made a fearful cry. An \u0101ft\u0101bach\u012b (ewer-bearer) becoming aware of this, came into the assembly-room, and seeing him smeared with blood cried out: \"They have killed the \u1e25ak\u012bm.\" After examining him it was seen that there was no sign of wounds on his body, and that it was the same wound in the lungs that had begun to flow. They informed Qil\u012bj Kh\u0101n, who was the Governor of Lahore, and he, having ascertained the true state of the affair, buried him. He left no capable son.\n\nOn the 24th, between the garden of Waf\u0101 and Niml\u0101h, a hunt took place, and nearly forty red antelope were killed. A female panther (y\u016bz) fell into our hands in this hunt. The zamindars of that place, Laghm\u0101n\u012bs, Sh\u0101li, and Afghans, came and said that they did not remember nor had they heard from their fathers that a panther had been seen in that region for 120 years. A halt was made on the 2nd Jum\u0101d\u0101-l-\u0101khir, at the Waf\u0101 Garden, and the assembly for the solar weighing was held. On the same day Arsl\u0101n B\u012b, an \u016azbeg who was one of the Sardars and nobles of \u2018Abdu-l-M\u016bmin Kh\u0101n, and was at that time governor of the fort of K\u0101hmad, having left his fort, had the blessing of waiting on me. As he had come from friendship and sincerity, I exalted him with a special robe of honour. He is a simple \u016azbeg, and is fit to be educated and honoured. On the 4th of the month an order was given that \u2018Izzat Kh\u0101n, the governor\\(^1\\) of Jal\u0101l\u0101b\u0101d, should make the hunting-ground of the Arz\u012bna plain into a qamargah (ring-hunting ground). Nearly 300 animals were captured,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The L.O. MSS. do not call him governor, and the names of the animals captured differ in the MSS. from those given in the text. The latter are obviously wrong, and I have discarded them. The Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, p. 30, has Arzana as the name of the hunting-ground. Erskine has Arzina.\nnamely, 35 q\u0101ch (rams ?), 25 q\u016bshq\u012b (?), 90 arghal\u012b (wild sheep), 55 t\u016bghl\u012b (yaks?), 95 antelope (saf\u012bda).\n\nAs it was the middle of the day when I arrived at the hunting-place and the air was very hot, the (t\u0101z\u012b) Arabian dogs had been exhausted.\u00b9 The time for running dogs is in the morning or at the end of the day. On Saturday, the 12th, the halt was at Ak\u016bra Saray (?). At this stage Sh\u0101h Beg Kh\u0101n,\u00b2 with a good force, came and waited on me. He was one who had been brought up by my father, the late king Akbar. In himself he is a very brave man and energetic, so much so that constantly in the time of my father he fought several single combats, and in my own reign defended the fort of Qandahar from the hosts of the ruler of Iran. It was besieged for a year before the royal army arrived to his assistance. His manners towards his soldiers are those of an Amir (nobleman, umar\u0101y\u0101na), and not according to discipline (qudrat), especially towards those who have helped him in battles or are with him in campaigns. He jokes much with his servants, and this gives him an undignified appearance.\u00b3 I have repeatedly warned him about this, but as it is in his nature my remonstrances have had no effect.\n\nOn Monday, the 14th, I promoted H\u0101shim Kh\u0101n, who is one of the household, born ones of our dynasty, to\n\n\u00b9 Erskine has \u201cmany of the hounds were destroyed.\u201d Sag\u0101n-i-t\u0101z\u012b probably means greyhounds, whether bred in Arabia or elsewhere.\n\u00b2 Blochmann, p. 377, and Ma\u2019\u0101\u1e63iru-l-umar\u0101, ii, 642. He was an Argh\u016bn.\n\u00b3 The passage is obscure and the text is corrupt. Erskine\u2019s translation is: \u201cHis manners towards the soldiers is frank and gallant, but not according to the rules of discipline, especially towards those who have been or are in the wars with him. He is much flattered by his servants, which gives him a light appearance.\u201d Evidently Erskine read n\u0101z\u012b or n\u0101z instead of b\u0101z as in the text, and the MSS. support his reading. I think, however, that n\u0101z kash\u012bdan means \u2018to jest.\u2019 Instead of the t\u0101 bam\u0101ndand of text the MSS. have y\u0101 nam\u0101yand, the meaning being those soldiers who have served him well, or are doing so. We learn from Blochmann, p. 378, that Sh\u0101h Beg was \u201ca frank Turk.\u201d\nthe rank of 3,000 with 2,000 horse, and I made him governor of the province of Orissa. On the same day news came that B\u0101d\u012b\u2018u-z-zam\u0101n, son of Mirz\u0101 Sh\u0101hrukh, who was in the province of Malwa, through folly and youth had started with a body of rebels to go to the province of the R\u0101n\u0101 and join him. \u2018Abdu-llah Kh\u0101n, the governor of that place, being informed of this event, went after him, and having made him prisoner on the way, slew several of the wretches who had joined with him. An order was given that Ihtim\u0101m Kh\u0101n should start from Agra and bring the Mirz\u0101 to the court. On the 25th of the aforesaid month news came that Im\u0101m Quli Kh\u0101n, nephew of Wali Khan, ruler of M\u0101war\u0101\u2019-a-n-nahr, had killed him who was called Mirz\u0101 Husain, who had been reported to be the son of Mirz\u0101 Sh\u0101hrukh. In truth, the killing of the sons of Mirz\u0101 Sh\u0101hrukh is like the killing of the demons, as they say that from every drop of their blood demons are produced. In the station of Dhaka, Shir Kh\u0101n, the Afghan, whom when I left I had placed at Peshawar to guard the Khaibar Pass, came and waited on me. He had made no default in preserving and guarding the road. Zafar Kh\u0101n, son of Zain Kh\u0101n Koka, had been appointed to move on the Dal\u0101z\u0101k Afghans and the tribe of Khatur, who had perpetrated all kinds of misdeeds in the neighbourhood of Attock and the Beas and that vicinity. After performing that service and the conquest of those rebels, who numbered about 100,000 houses, and sending them off towards Lahore, he came and waited upon me at the same halting-place, and it was evident that he had performed that service as it ought to have been done. As the month of Rajab, corresponding with the Il\u0101hi month of \u0100b\u0101n, had arrived,\u00b9 and it was known that this\n\n\u00b9 The peculiarity of this year was that the lunar month and the solar month of Akbar\u2019s birth, viz. Rajab and \u0100b\u0101n, coincided, so that there was a double celebration.\nwas one of the months fixed for the lunar weighing (wazn-i-qamar\u012b) of my father, I determined that the value of all the articles which he used to order for his own weighing in the solar and lunar years should be estimated, and that what this came to should be sent to the large cities for the repose of the soul of that enlightened one, and be divided amongst the necessitous and the faqirs. The total came to 100,000 rupees, equal to 300 Ir\u0101q tum\u0101ns, and 300,000 of the currency of the people of M\u0101war\u0101\u2019-a-n-nahr.\n\nTrustworthy men divided that sum among the twelve chief cities, such as Agra, Delhi, Lahore, Gujarat (Ahmadabad), etc. On Thursday, the 3rd Rajab, I favoured with the title of Kh\u0101n-jah\u0101n my son (farzand) \u1e62al\u0101bat Kh\u0101n, who is not less to me than my own sons, and ordered that they should in all firmans and orders write of him as Kh\u0101n-jah\u0101n. A special robe of honour and a jewelled sword were also given him. Also, having entitled Sh\u0101h Beg Kh\u0101n Kh\u0101n-daur\u0101n, I presented him with a jewelled waist-dagger, a male elephant, and a special horse. The whole of the sarkars of Tirah, Kabul, Bangash, and the province of Saw\u0101d (Swat) Bajaur, with the (task of) beating back the Afghans of those regions, and a jagir and the faujdarship were confirmed to him. He took leave from B\u0101b\u0101 \u1e24asan Abd\u0101l. I also ordered R\u0101m D\u0101s Kachhw\u0101ha to receive a jagir in this province and to be enrolled among the auxiliaries of this Subah. I conferred on Kishan Chand, son of the Mota (fat) R\u0101ja, the rank of 1,000 personal and 500 horse. A firman was written to Murta\u1e93\u0101 Kh\u0101n (Sayyid Farid), governor of Gujarat, that as the good conduct and excellence and abstemiousness of the son of Miy\u0101n Wajihu-d-d\u012bn had been reported to me, he should hand over to him from me a sum of money, and that he should write and send me some of\n\n---\n\n1 Wajihu-d-d\u012bn was a famous Gujarat saint. He died in 998.\nthe names of God which had been tested. If the grace of God should be with me I would continually repeat\\(^1\\) them. Before this I had given leave to Zafar Kh\u0101n to go to B\u0101b\u0101 \u1e24asan Abd\u0101l to collect together game for sport. He had made a sh\u0101khband (literally a tying together of horns or branches). Twenty-seven red deer and 68 white ones came into the sh\u0101khband. I myself struck with arrows 29 antelope, and Parwiz and Khurr\u0101m also killed some others with arrows. Afterwards orders were given to the servants and courtiers to shoot. Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n was the best shot, and in every case of his striking an antelope the arrow penetrated through and through.\\(^2\\) Again, on the 14th of the month of Rajab, Zafar Kh\u0101n had arranged a qamargah at Rawalpindi. I struck with an arrow a red deer at a long distance, and was highly delighted at the arrow striking him and his falling down. Thirty-four red deer and 35 qar\u0101-q\u016byr\u016bgh (black-tailed) antelope, which in the Hindi language they call chik\u0101ra, and two pigs were also killed. On the 21st another qamargah had been arranged within three kos of the fort of Rohtas by the efforts and exertions of Hil\u0101l Kh\u0101n. I had taken with me to this hunt those who were screened by the curtains of honour (the members of the zan\u0101nah). The hunt was a good one and came off with great \u00e9clat. Two hundred red and white antelope were killed. Passing on from Rohtas, the hills of which contain these antelope, there are in no place in the whole of Hindustan, with the exception of Girjh\u0101k and Nandanah, red deer of this description. I ordered them\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The word used by Jah\u0101ng\u012br, and which has been translated \u2018repeat continually,\u2019 is mud\u0101wamat, and Erskine understood it to mean that Jah\u0101ng\u012br hoped to prolong his life by this exercise.\n\n\\(^2\\) Har ah\u016b\u2019i kih zad bar sar-i-ttr raft. The literal rendering apparently is: \u201cwhenever an antelope was struck by him the arrow entered up to its (the arrow\u2019s) head.\u201d Perhaps the meaning simply is every arrow (or bullet) that he shot went home.\nto catch and keep some of them alive, in order that possibly some of them might reach Hindustan for breeding purposes. On the 25th another hunt took place in the neighbourhood of Rohtas. In this hunt also my sisters and the other ladies were with me, and nearly 100 red deer were killed. It was told me that Shams Kh\u0101n, uncle of Jal\u0101l Kh\u0101n\u00b9 Gakkhar, who was in that neighbourhood, notwithstanding his great age took much delight in hunting, such that young men had not so much enjoyment in it. When I heard that he was well-disposed towards faqirs and dervishes I went to his house, and his disposition and manners pleased me. I bestowed on him 2,000 rupees, and the same sum on his wives and children, with five other villages with large receipts by way of livelihood for them, that they might pass their days in comfort and contentment. On the 6th Sha\u02bfban, at the halting-place of Chand\u0101lah, the Am\u012bru-l-umar\u0101 came and waited on me. I was greatly pleased at obtaining his society again, for all the physicians, Hindu and Musulman, had made up their minds that he would die. Almighty God in His grace and mercy granted him the honour of recovery, in order that it might be known to such as do not recognize His will that for every difficult ill, which those who look on the outside of causes only may have given up as hopeless, there is One who is powerful to provide a cure and remedy out of His own kindness and compassion. On the same day R\u0101y R\u0101y Singh,\u00b2 one of the most considerable of the Rajput Amirs, ashamed on account of the fault he had committed in the matter of Khusrau, and who was living at his home, came, and under the patronage of the Am\u012bru-l-umar\u0101 obtained the good\n\n\u00b9 Jal\u0101l Kh\u0101n was a grandson of Sul\u1e6d\u0101n \u0100dam (Blochmann, pp. 455 and 486).\n\u00b2 See infra for another notice of him in the chapter on Gujrat.\nfortune of waiting on me; his offences were pardoned. At the time that I left Agra in pursuit of Khusrau I had in full confidence left him in charge of Agra, so that when the ladies (mahalha) should be sent for he might come with them. After the ladies were sent for he went for two or three stages with them, and in the village of Mathura, on merely hearing foolish tales, separated from them, and went to his native place (Bikanir). He thought that as a commotion had arisen he would see where the right road was. The merciful God, who cherishes His servants, in a short time having arranged that affair broke the rope of the alliance of those rebels, and this betrayal of his salt remained a burden on his neck. In order to please the Amirul-umara I ordered the rank which he formerly held to be confirmed to him, and his jagir to remain as it was. I promoted Sulaiman Beg, who was one of my attendants from the time when I was prince, to the title of Fidai Khan. On Monday, the 12th, a halt was made at the garden of Dilamiz, which is on the bank of the river Ravi. I waited on my mother in this garden. Mirza Ghazi, who had done approved service in command of the army at Qandahar, waited on me, and I bestowed great favour on him.\n\nOn Tuesday, the 13th, I auspiciously entered Lahore. The next day Mir Khalilullah, son of Ghiyasuddin Muhammad, Mirmiran, who was of the descendants of Shah Nimatuallah Wali, paid his respects. In the reign of Shah Tahmasp there was no family of such greatness in the whole country, for the sister of the Shah, by name Janish Begam, was in the house of (married to) Mir Nimatuallah, the father of the Mirmiran.\n\n---\n\n1 One of Jahangir's wives was a daughter of Ray Ray Singh (of Bikanir). See Blochmann, p. 310.\n2 See Rieu, Cat. ii, p. 634.\nA daughter who was born to them, the Shah gave in marriage to his own son Isma'il Mirz\u0101, and making the sons of that Mirmir\u0101n sons-in-law, gave his younger daughter to his eldest son, who had the same name as his grandfather, and connected (in marriage) the daughter of Isma'il Mirz\u0101, who was born of the niece of the Shah, to another son, Mir Khalilu-llah. After the death of the Shah, by degrees the family went to decay, until in the reign of Sh\u0101h \u2018Abb\u0101s they became all at once extirpated, and they lost the property and effects that they had and could no longer remain in their own place. Mir Khalilu-llah came to wait upon me. As he had undergone trouble on the road, and the signs of sincerity were apparent from his circumstances, having made him a sharer of my unstinted favours I gave him 12,000 rupees in cash, and promoted him to the rank of 1,000 personal and 200 horse, and gave an order for a jagir.\n\nAn order was given to the civil department (d\u012bw\u0101niy\u0101n) to confer the rank of 8,000 personal and 5,000 horse on my son Khurram, and to provide a jagir for him in the neighbourhood of Ujjain, and to assign the Sarkar of \u1e24i\u1e63\u0101r Fir\u016bza to him. On Thursday, the 22nd, on the invitation of \u0100\u1e63af Kh\u0101n, I went with my ladies to his house and passed the night there. The next day he presented before me his own offerings, of the value of ten lacs of rupees, in jewels and jewelled things, robes, elephants, and horses. Some single rubies and jacinths and some pearls, also silk cloths with some pieces of porcelain from China and Tartary, were accepted, and I made a present of the rest to him. Murtaz\u0101 Kh\u0101n from Gujarat sent by way of offering a ring made of a single ruby of good colour, substance, and water, the stone, the socket, and the ring being all of one piece. They weighed 1\u00bd tanks and one surkh, which is equal to one misqal and 15 surkh. This was sent to me and much approved. Till that day no one had ever heard of\nsuch a ring having come to the hands of any sovereign. A single ruby weighing six surkhs or two tanks and 15 surkhs,\\(^1\\) and of which the value was stated to be \u00a325,000, was also sent. The ring was valued at the same figure.\n\nOn the same day the envoy of the Sharif of Mecca came to wait on me with a letter and the curtain of the door of the Ka\u2018bah. He showed great friendship towards me. The said envoy had bestowed on him 500,000 \\(d\u0101m\\), equal to 7,000 or 8,000 rupees, and I resolved to send the Sharif the equivalent of 100,000 rupees of the precious things of Hindustan. On Thursday, the 10th of the month, a piece of the Subah of Multan was added to the jagir of Mirz\u0101 Gh\u0101zi, though the whole of the province of Thattah had been given to him in jagir. He was also promoted to the rank of 5,000 personalty and 5,000 horse. The government of Qandahar and the protection of that region, which is the frontier of Hindustan, were assigned to his excellent administration. Conferring on him a robe of honour and a jewelled sword I gave him his leave. In fine, Mirz\u0101 Gh\u0101zi possessed perfection,\\(^2\\) and he made also good verses. He used Waq\u0101r\u012b as his takhallus, or poetic name (R\u016bz-i-r\u016bshan, Bhopal 1297, p. 455; also Ma\u2019\u0101\u1e63iru-l-unar\u0101, vol. iii, p. 347). This is one of his couplets:\n\n\u201cIf my weeping should cause her to smile, what wonder?\nThough the cloud weep, the cheek of the rose-bush smiles.\u201d\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) There is evidently something wrong in the text, for a ruby weighing 6 surkhs could not weigh 2 tanks and 15 surkhs. I.O. MS. 181 has barja instead of surkh, but I do not know what this means. Perhaps shash-g\u016bsha, \u2018hexagonal,\u2019 was intended. This view is confirmed by the Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, p. 31, which has shash paht\u016b, \u2018six-sided.\u2019 Erskine\u2019s MS. also had \u2018six-sided,\u2019 and he translates \u201ca six-sided ruby which weighed two tangs fifteen surkhs.\u201d I.O. MS. 305 has shash p\u0101rcha, and it is evident that this word, as also the barja of No. 181, is the p\u0101rche of Steingass, which means a segment or facet.\n\n\\(^2\\) This remark about Mirz\u0101 Gh\u0101zi, and also the quotation, do not occur in the two I.O. MSS.\nOn the 15th the offering of the Khankhanan was presented to me: 40 elephants, some jewelled and decorated vessels, some Persian robes, and cloth that they make in the Deccan and those parts, had been sent by him, altogether of the value of 150,000 rupees. M\u012brz\u0101 Rustam and most of the office-holders of that Subah had also sent good offerings. Some of the elephants were approved. News of the death of R\u0101y Durg\u0101,\u00b9 who was one of those who had been brought up by my revered father, arrived on the 18th of the month. He had been in attendance for forty years and more in the position of an Amir on my revered father, until, by degrees, he had risen in rank to 4,000. Before he obtained the good fortune of waiting on my father, he was one of the trusted servants of R\u0101n\u0101 Uday Singh. He died on the 29th. He was a good military man. Sult\u0101n Sh\u0101h, the Afghan, whose disposition was turbulent and mischievous, passed his time in the service of Khusrau, and had his complete intimacy, so much so that this rebel was the cause of the running away of that unfortunate one. After the defeat and capture of Khusrau he went off alone (?)\u00b2 into the skirts of the hills of Khizr\u0101b\u0101d and that region. At last he was made prisoner by Mir Mughal, the karori of that place. As he had been the cause of the destruction and ruin of such a son, I ordered them to shoot him with arrows on the plain of Lahore. The aforesaid karori was promoted to higher rank, and was dignified with a grand dress of honour. On the 29th Sh\u012br Kh\u0101n, the Afghan, who was one of my old servants, died. One might say that he took his own life, because he was continually drinking wine, to the extent that in every watch he used to drink four brimming cups of arrack of double strength. He had broken the fast of the Ramaz\u0101n of the past year,\n\n\u00b9 Blochmann, p. 417.\n\u00b2 Bayakt\u0101, but the I.O. MSS. have batagp\u0101y, \u2018rapidly.\u2019\nand took it into his head this year that he would fast in the month of Sha'ban on account of his having broken the fast of Ramazan, and would fast for two months together. In abandoning his usual custom, which is a second nature, he became weak and his appetite left him, and becoming very weak he passed away in his 57th year. Patronising his children and brothers according to their circumstances, I bestowed on them a portion of his rank and jagir.\n\nOn the 1st of the month of Shawwal I went to visit Maulana Muhammad Amin, who was one of the disciples of Shaikh Mahmud Kamangar (the bow-maker). The Shaikh Mahmud mentioned was one of the great men of his age, and H.M. Humayun had entire reliance on him, so much so that he once poured water on his hands. The aforesaid Maulana is a man of good disposition, and is free, notwithstanding the attachments and accidents (of the world), a faqir in manner and ways, and acquainted with brokenness of spirit. His company pleased me exceedingly. I explained to him some of the griefs that had entangled themselves in my mind and heard from him good advice and agreeable words, and found myself greatly consoled at heart. Having presented him with 1,000 bigha and 1,000 rupees in cash by way of maintenance, I took leave. One watch of day had passed on Sunday when I left Lahore on my way to the capital of Agra. Having made Qilij Khan governor, Mir Qawamuddin diwan, Shaikh Yusuf bakhshi, and Jamalu-d-din kotwal, and presented each according to his circumstances with dresses of honour, I turned towards my desired way. On the 25th, having passed over the river at Sultanpur, I proceeded two kos and halted at Nakodar. My revered father had given\n\n---\n\n1 Properly Zainuddin Mahmud. See the story in Badayuni, Ranking, p. 589; also Akbar-nama translation, i, 611, and Blochmann, p. 539 and note.\nShaikh Ab\u016b-l-fa\u017cl gold of the weight of 20,000 rupees to build an embankment between these two parganahs and prepare a waterfall, and in truth I found a halting-place exceedingly pleasant and fresh. I ordered Mu'izzu-l-mulk, the jagirdar of Nakodar, to erect a building and prepare a garden on one side of this embankment, so that wayfarers seeing it might be pleased. On Saturday, 10th Z\u012bl-q\u0101'\u1e0da, Waziru-l-mulk, who before my ascension had the good fortune to serve me, and was Diwan of my establishment, died of diarrhoea. At the end of his life a son of evil fortune (lit. footsteps) had been born in his house, who in the space of forty days ruined (Erskine has 'ate') both his father and mother, and who himself died when he was two or three years old. It occurred to me that the house of Waziru-l-mulk must not all at once be ruined, and patronising Man\u1e63\u016br, his brother's son, I gave him rank. Indeed, he showed no love to me (the scent of love did not come from him). On Monday, the 14th, I heard on the road that between Panipat and Karnal there were two tigers that were giving much trouble to wayfarers. I collected the elephants and sent them off. When I arrived at their (the tigers') place I mounted a female elephant, and ordered them to place the elephants round them after the manner of a qamargah (enclosure), and by the favour of Allah killed both with a gun, and thus got rid of the raging tigers that had closed the road to the servants of God. On Thursday,\n\n---\n\n1 I do not know if this is the author. There appears to be no mention of the construction in the Akbar-n\u0101ma. Nakodar is in the Jalandhar district (I.G., x, 180, and Jarrett, ii, 317). Perhaps the two tombs at Nakodar mentioned in I.G. as of Jah\u0101ng\u012br's time are those of Muq\u012bm the Waziru-l-mulk and his wife. See T\u016bzuk, pp. 6 and 64.\n\n2 Khwurd, lit. 'devoured.' Apparently he refers to the fact of the birth as a misfortune. I.O. MS. 181 has sar-i-m\u0101dar u pidar r\u0101 khwurd, and the A.S. 124 has sh\u012br-i-m\u0101dar u pidar-i-kh\u016bd, 'the milk of his own mother and father.'\n\n3 This is given as a quotation in No. 181.\nthe 18th, I halted at Delhi and alighted at the residence which Salim Kh\u0101n, the Afghan, had made in the days of his rule in the middle of the river Jumna and called Salingad\u0101h. My revered father had given the place to Murtaz\u0101 Khan, who was originally an inhabitant of Delhi. The aforesaid Khan had built on the margin of the river a terrace of stone excessively pleasant and bright. Below that building near the water there was made a square chaukand\u012b with glazed tiles by the order of H.M. Hum\u0101y\u016bn, and there are few places with such air. In the days when the late king Hum\u0101y\u016bn honoured Delhi with his presence, he often sat there with his intimates, and associated with the members of his assemblies. I passed four days in that place, and with my courtiers and intimates enjoyed myself with wine parties. Mu'azzam Kh\u0101n, who was governor of Delhi, presented offerings. The jagirdars and citizens also made offerings and presents, each according to his circumstances. I was desirous to employ some days in a qamargah hunt in the parganah of P\u0101lam, which is one of the places near the aforesaid city and one of the fixed hunting-grounds. As it was represented to me that the (fortunate) hour for approaching Agra had come very near, and another proper hour was not to be obtained at all near that time, I gave up the intention, and embarking on board a boat went on by water. On the 20th of the month of Z\u012bl-qa'da four boys and three girls, children of Mirz\u0101 Sh\u0101hrukhl, whom he had not mentioned to my father, were brought. I placed the boys among my confidential servants, and made over the girls to the attendants of the ladies of the harem in order that they might look after them. On the 21st of the same month R\u0101j\u0101 M\u0101n Singh came and waited on me.\n\n1 This should be the 17th if Monday was the 14th.\n2 The MSS. seem to have muta\u1e63\u1e63il-i-m\u0101b-i-chaukand\u012b, 'in shape like a chaukand\u012b (?). It was from the roof of this building that Hum\u0101y\u016bn fell.\nfrom the fort of Rohtas, which is in the province of Patna and Behar, after orders had been sent to him six or seven times. He also, like Kh\u0101n A\u02bf\u1e93am, is one of the hypocrites and old wolves of this State. What they have done to me, and what has happened to them from me, God the knower of secrets knows; possibly no one could mention such another case (?). The aforesaid Raja produced as offerings 100 elephants, male and female, not one of which was fit to be included among my private elephants. As he was one of those who had been favoured by my father, I did not parade his offences before his face, but with royal condescension promoted him.\n\nOn this day they brought a talking jal (lark) which distinctly said \u201cMiyan Tuti.\u201d It was very strange and wonderful. In Turki they call this bird turghai.\u00b9\n\nThe Third New Year\u2019s Feast from my Accession.\n\nOn Thursday, the 2nd Zi-l-hijja, corresponding with the 1st Farwardin (19th March, 1608), the Sun, which enlightens and heats the world with its splendour, changed from the constellation of Pisces to the joyful mansion of Aries, the abode of pleasure and rejoicing. It gave the world fresh brightness, and being aided by the Spring clothed those who had been plundered by the cold season, and tyrannised over by the Autumn, with the robes of honour of the New Year and the garments of emerald green, and gave them compensation and recuperation.\n\n\u201cAgain to Not-Being came the world\u2019s lord\u2019s order,\n\u2018Restore what thou hast devoured.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u00b9 Turghai or turghei is a thrush according to Vamb\u00e9ry, and was the name of Timur\u2019s father. Perhaps the bird was the large maina, the Bhimraj or Bhringraj (?) of the \u0100yin, Jarrett, ii, p. 125 and note. In Scully\u2019s Glossary, turghai is said to be the lark. The text arranges the words differently from the MSS. They have mushakhkhas Miyan Tuti gufta, and Erskine translates \u2018which said clearly Miyan Tuti.\u2019 But possibly Jah\u0101ng\u012br meant that it spoke clearly like a parrot.\nThe feast of the New Year was held in the village of Rankatta,\\(^1\\) which is five kos off (from Agra), and at the time of transit (of the sun) I seated myself on the throne with glory and gladness. The nobles and courtiers and all the servants came forward with their congratulations. In the same assembly I bestowed on Kh\u0101njah\u0101n the rank of 5,000 personal and horse. I selected Khw\u0101ja Jah\u0101n for the post of bakhshi. Dismissing Waz\u012br Kh\u0101n from the Viziership of the province of Bengal, I sent in his place Ab\u016b-l-hasan Shih\u0101bkh\u0101n\u012b; and N\u016bru-d-d\u012bn Quli became kotwal of Agra. As the glorious mausoleum of the late king Akbar was on the road, it entered my mind that if in passing by I should have the good fortune of a pilgrimage to it, it might occur to those who were short-sighted that I visited it because it was the place where my road crossed. I accordingly had determined that this time I would enter Agra, and after that would go on foot on this pilgrimage to the shrine, which is two and a half kos off, in the same way that the Hazrat (my father), on account of my birth, had gone from Agra to Ajmir. Would that I might also traverse the same on my head! When two watches of day had passed of Saturday, the 5th\\(^2\\) of the month, at an auspicious hour, I returned towards Agra, and scattering with two hands 5000 rupees in small coins on the way, entered the august palace which was inside the fort. On this day R\u0101ja Bir Singh Deo brought a white cheeta to show me. Although other sorts\n\n\\(^1\\) Blochmann, p. 332. Sikandra, Akbar\u2019s tomb, lies half-way between Rankattah and Agra. Tiefenthaler, i, 206, gives the name as Runcta, and says it is a famous place, as R\u0101m there took the figure of Paras R\u0101m. Jarrett, ii, 180, has Rangtah, and it is there described as a village on the Junna, near the city, and a much frequented place of worship. The Agra volume of the N.W.P. Gazetteer, p. 764, spells it Runkutta, and says it is 9 miles north-west of Agra. See also Ma\u2019\u0101\u1e63ir, ii, 407, art. Sa\u02bf\u012bd Kh\u0101n, where mention is made of Rankatta and Hil\u0101l\u0101b\u0101d, and Blochmann, p. 332.\n\n\\(^2\\) If Thursday was the 2nd, Saturday would be the 4th. He went first to Agra from Rangta, apparently.\nof creatures, both birds and beasts, have white varieties, which they call *\u1e6d\u016bygh\u0101n*,\u00b9 I had never seen a white cheeta. Its spots, which are (usually) black, were of a blue colour, and the whiteness of the body was also inclined to bluishness. Of the albino animals that I have seen there are falcons, sparrow-hawks, hawks (*shikara*) that they call *big\u016b*\u00b2 in the Persian language, sparrows, crows, partridges, florican, *podna*\u00b3 (*Sylvia olivacea*), and peacocks. Many hawks in aviaries are albinos. I have also seen white flying mice (flying squirrels) and some albinos among the black antelope, which is a species found only in Hindustan. Among the *chik\u0101ra* (gazelle), which they call *saf\u012bda* in Persia, I have frequently seen albinos. At this time Ratan, son of Bhoj-h\u0101ra, who is one of the chief Rajput nobles, came to the camp and waited on me, bringing three elephants as an offering. One of these was much approved, and they valued it in the office at 15,000 rupees. It was entered among my private elephants, and I gave it the name of Ratangaj. The value of elephants of the former great Rajas of India was not more than 25,000 rupees, but they have now become very dear. I dignified Ratan with the title of Sarbuland R\u0101y. I promoted Mir\u0101n \u1e62adr Jah\u0101n to the rank of 5,000 personal and 1,500 horse and Mu\u02bfazzam Kh\u0101n to 4,000 personal and 2,000 horse. \u2018Abdu-llah Kh\u0101n was promoted to 3,000 and 500 horse. Mu\u1e93affar Kh\u0101n and Bh\u0101o Singh each obtained the rank of 2,000 personal and 1,000 horse. Ab\u016b-l-hasan diwan had 1,000 and 500 horse. I\u02bftim\u0101du-d-daulah that of 1,000 personal and 250 horse. On the 25th R\u0101ja S\u016braj Singh, the maternal uncle of my son Khurr\u0101m, came and paid his respects to me. He brought with him Shy\u0101m, the cousin of the turbulent\n\n\u00b9 *\u1e6c\u016byghun* or *\u1e6d\u016bygh\u0101n* is given in Zenker as Turk\u012b for the white falcon. See Elliot, vi, 317.\n\u00b2 *Big\u016b*, which is given in Zenker, is Turk\u012b. The text has *l\u016bf\u016b*. The I.O. MSS. have *big\u016b*.\n\u00b3 Should be *b\u016bdana*, \u2018quail.\u2019\nUmra. In truth he possesses some skill and understands well how to ride elephants. R\u0101ja Suraj Singh had brought with him a poet who wrote verse in the Hindi tongue. He laid before me a poem in my praise to the purport that if the Sun had a son it would be always day and never would be night, because after his setting that son would sit in his place and keep the world in light. Praise and thanksgiving to God that God gave your father such a son that after his death men should not wear mourning which is like the night. The Sun had envy on this account, saying, \"Would I might also have a son who, taking my place, should not allow night to approach the world, for from the light of your rising and the illumination of your justice, notwithstanding such a misfortune, the spheres are so bright that one might say 'night had neither name nor sign.'\" Few Hindi verses of such freshness of purport have ever reached my ear. As a reward for this eulogy I gave him an elephant. The Rajputs call a poet Ch\u0101ran (name of a caste who are many of them poets). One of the poets of the age has turned these sentiments into (Persian) verse\u2014\n\n\"If the world-illuminator had a son,\nThere would be no night; it would be always day;\nFor when his gold-crowned head was hidden\nHis son would display his tiara peak.\nThanks that after such a father\nSuch a son sits in his place.\nFor from the demise of that king\nNo one made black robes for mourning.\"\n\nOn Thursday, the 8th Muharram, 1017 (24th April, 1608), Jal\u0101lu-d-din Mas\u02bf\u016bd, who held the rank of 400 personal and was not wanting in bravery, and who in several battles had done great deeds, died at about the age of 50 or 60 years of diarrhoea. He was an opium-eater, and used to eat opium after breaking it in pieces, like\n\n1 Apparently this is a translation from the Hindi.\n2 Text wrongly has 1014.\ncheese, and it is notorious that he frequently ate opium from the hand of his own mother. When his disease became violent and there was a prospect of his death, his mother from excessive love for him ate more opium than was right out of that which she used to give her son, and two or three hours after his death she also died. I have never heard of such affection on the part of a mother for her son. It is the custom among the Hindus that after the death of their husbands women burn themselves, whether from love, or to save the honour of their fathers, or from being ashamed before their sons-in-law, but nothing like this was ever manifested on the part of mothers, Musulman or Hindu. On the 15th of the same month I presented my best horse by way of favour to R\u0101ja M\u0101n Singh. Sh\u0101h \u2018Abb\u0101s had sent this horse with some other horses and fitting gifts by Min\u016bchihr, one of his confidential slaves, to the late king Akbar. From being presented with this horse the Raja was so delighted that if I had given him a kingdom I do not think he would have shown such joy. At the time they brought the horse it was three or four years old. It grew up in Hindustan. The whole of the servants of the Court, Moghul and Rajput together, represented that no horse like this had ever come from Iraq to Hindustan. When my revered father gave the province of Khandesh and the Subah of the Deccan to my brother D\u0101niy\u0101l, and was returning to Agra, he by way of kindness told D\u0101niy\u0101l to ask of him whatever he desired. Seizing the opportunity, he asked for this horse, and he accordingly gave it to him. On Tuesday, the 20th, a report came from Isl\u0101m Kh\u0101n with the news of the death of Jah\u0101ng\u012br Quli Kh\u0101n, the governor of the Subah of Bengal, who was my special slave. On account of his natural excellence and innate merit he had been enrolled in the list of the great Amirs. I was much grieved at his death. I bestowed the rule of Bengal and the tutorship\nto Prince Jah\u0101nd\u0101r on my farzand\\(^1\\) Isl\u0101m Kh\u0101n, and in his place gave the government of the Subah of Behar to Afzal Kh\u0101n (son of Ab\u016b-l-fa\u017cl). The son of \u1e24ak\u012bm \u2018Al\u012b, whom I had sent on some duties to Burh\u0101npur, came and brought with him some Karnatic jugglers who had no rivals or equals; for instance, one of them played with ten balls, each of which was equal to an orange and one to a citron, and one to a surkh,\\(^2\\) in such a way that notwithstanding some were small and some large lie never missed one, and did so many kinds of tricks that one\u2019s wits became bewildered. At the same time a dervish from Ceylon came and brought a strange animal called a deonak\\(^3\\) (or devang). Its face was exactly like a large bat, and the whole shape was like that of a monkey, but it had no tail. Its movements were like those of the black tailless monkey which they call ban m\u0101nush (jungle man) in the Hindi language. Its body was like that of a young monkey two or three months old. It had been with the dervish for five years.\\(^4\\) It appeared that the animal would never grow larger. Its food is milk and it also eats plantains. As the creature appeared very strange, I ordered the artists to take a likeness of it in various kinds of movement. It looked very ugly.\n\nOn the same day Mirz\u0101 Far\u012bd\u016bn Barl\u0101s was promoted to the rank of 1,500 personal and 1,300 horse. An order was given that P\u0101yanda\\(^5\\) Kh\u0101n Moghul, as he had reached old age after exerting himself as a soldier, should receive a jagir equal to 2,000 personal. Ilf Kh\u0101n was promoted to the rank of 700 personal and 500 horse.

The guardianship of the fort of Rohtas was bestowed on Kishwar Kh\u0101n, son of Qu\u1e6dbu-d-d\u012bn Kh\u0101n Koka. Ihtim\u0101m Kh\u0101n was raised to the rank of 1,000 personal and 300 horse, and made m\u012br bahr (admiral) and was appointed to the charge of the naw\u0101ra (fleet) of Bengal. On the 1st \u1e62afar Shamsu-d-d\u012bn Kh\u0101n, son of Kh\u0101n A\u02bf\u1e93am, made an offering of ten elephants, and, receiving the rank of 2,000 personal and 1,500 horse, was selected for the title of Jah\u0101ng\u012br Qul\u012b Kh\u0101n, and Zafar Kh\u0101n received the rank of 2,000 personal and 1,000 horse. As I had demanded in marriage the daughter of Jagat Singh, eldest son of R\u0101ja M\u0101n Singh, I on the 16th sent 80,000 rupees for the s\u0101ch\u0101q (a marriage present) to the house of the aforesaid Raja in order to dignify him. Muqarrab Kh\u0101n sent from the port of Cambay a European curtain (tapestry), the like of which in beauty no other work of the Frank painters had ever been seen. On the same day my aunt, Najibu-n-nis\u0101 Begam, died in the 61st year of her age of the disease of consumption and hectic fever. I promoted her son, Mirz\u0101 W\u0101li, to the rank of 1,000 personal and 200 horse. A man of M\u0101war\u0101\u02bea-n-nahr, of the name of Aqam H\u0101ji, who for a long time had been in Turkey and was not without reasonableness and religious knowledge, and who called himself the ambassador of the Turkish Emperor, waited upon me at Agra. He had an unknown writing (?illegible letter). Looking to his circumstances and his proceedings none of the servants of the Court believed in his being an ambassador. When Tim\u016br conquered Turkey, and Yildir\u012bm B\u0101yaz\u012bd, the ruler\n\n---\n\n1 Sister of Mirz\u0101 Hak\u012bm, also known as Fakhru-n-nis\u0101 (Blochmann, p. 322). The MSS. have Bakhtu-n-nis\u0101, and it would seem that the Najibu-n-nis\u0101 of the text is a wrong reading. See Gulbadan Begam\u2019s Memoirs, p. 214.\nof that place, fell alive into his hands, he, after levying tribute and taking one year's revenue, determined to hand back into his possession the whole of the country of Turkey. Just at that time Yildirim B\u0101yazid died, and (T\u012bm\u016br), having handed over the kingdom to his son M\u016bs\u0101 Chelebi, returned. From that time until now, notwithstanding such favours, no one had come on the part of the emperors, nor has any ambassador been sent: how, then, can it now be believed that this person from M\u0101war\u0101'a-n-nahr should have been sent by the emperor? I could in no way understand the affair, and no one could bear witness to the accuracy of his claim: I therefore told him to go wherever he might wish. On the 4th Rab\u012b'u-l-awwal the daughter of Jagat Singh entered the harem, and the marriage ceremony was performed in the house of Her Highness Maryam-zam\u0101ni. Amongst the things sent with her by R\u0101ja M\u0101n Singh were 60 elephants.\n\nAs I had determined to conquer the R\u0101n\u0101, it occurred to me that I should send Mah\u0101bat Kh\u0101n. I appointed 12,000 fully armed cavalry under able officers to go with him, and in addition 500 ahadis, 2,000 musketeers on foot, with artillery made up of 70 to 80 guns mounted on elephants and camels; 60 elephants were appointed to this duty. Two million rupees of treasure were ordered to be sent with this army. On the 16th of the said month Mir Khalilu-llah, grandson of Mir Ni'matu-llah Yazd\u012b, the whole of whose circumstances and family history has already been written, died of diarrhoea. In his appearance the traces of sincerity and dervishhood were manifest. If he had lived and passed a long time in my service he would have risen to high rank. The bakhshi of Burhanpur had sent some mangoes, one of which I ordered to be weighed; it came to $52\\frac{1}{2}$ tolas. On Wednesday, the 18th, in the house of Maryam-zam\u0101ni, the feast of the lunar weighing of my 40th year\nwas held. I ordered the money used in weighing to be divided amongst women and needy persons. On Thursday, the 4th Rab\u012b\u2018u-l-\u0101khir, T\u0101hir Beg, the bakhshi of the Ahadis, was given the title of Mukhl\u012bs Kh\u0101n, and Mull\u0101-i-Taqiyy\u0101 Sh\u016bst\u0101r\u012b, who was adorned with excellencies and perfections, and was well acquainted with the science of history and genealogy, that of Mu\u2018arrikh Kh\u0101n. On the 10th of the same month, having given Barkh\u016brd\u0101r, the brother of \u2018Abdu-llah Kh\u0101n, the title of Bah\u0101dur Kh\u0101n, I dignified him among his fellows. M\u016bnis Kh\u0101n, son of Mihtar Kh\u0101n, presented me with a jug of jasper (jade), which had been made in the reign of Mirz\u0101 Ulugh Beg G\u016brg\u0101n, in the honoured name of that prince. It was a very delicate rarity and of a beautiful shape. Its stone was exceedingly white and pure. Around the neck of the jar they had carved the auspicious name of the Mirz\u0101 and the Hijra year in \u1e0diq\u0101\u2018 characters. I ordered them to inscribe my name and the auspicious name of Akbar on the edge of the lip of the jar. Mihtar Kh\u0101n was one of the ancient slaves of this State. He had the honour of serving the late king Hum\u0101y\u016bn, and during the reign of my revered father had attained the rank of nobility. He regarded him as one of his confidential servants. On the 16th a firman was issued that the country of Sangr\u0101m, which had been given for a year by way of reward to my son (farzand) Isl\u0101m Kh\u0101n, should be handed over for the same purpose for a year to Af\u1e93al Kh\u0101n, the governor of the Subah of Behar. On this day I promoted Mah\u0101bat Kh\u0101n to the rank of 3,000 personal and 2,500 horse, and Y\u016bsuf Kh\u0101n, son of Husain Kh\u0101n Tukriyah, obtained that of 2,000\n\n---\n\n1 Text wrongly has Shamsh\u012br\u012b.

On the 24th I gave leave to Mah\u0101bat Kh\u0101n and the Amirs and men who had been appointed to subdue the R\u0101n\u0101. The aforesaid Khan was honoured with a robe of honour, a horse, a special elephant, and a jewelled sword. \u0179afar Kh\u0101n, having been honoured with a standard, was presented with a private robe of honour and a jewelled dagger. Shaj\u0101\u02bfat Kh\u0101n also was presented with a standard, and I gave him a robe of honour and a special elephant. R\u0101ja Bir Singh Deo received a robe of honour and a special horse, and Mangli Kh\u0101n a horse and jewelled dagger. Nar\u0101yan D\u0101s Kachhw\u0101hah, \u2018Al\u012b Quli Darman, and Hizabr Kh\u0101n Tahamtan obtained leave. On Bah\u0101dur Kh\u0101n and Mu\u02bfizzu-l-mulk the bakhshi jewelled daggers were conferred, and in the same manner all the Amirs and leaders, each one according to his degree, were honoured with royal gifts. A watch of the day had passed when the Khankhanan, who had been selected for the high honour of my \u0100t\u0101l\u012bq (guardian), came from Burhanpur and waited on me. Delight and happiness had so overpowered him that he did not know whether he came on his head or his feet. He threw himself bewildered at my feet. By way of favour and kindness I lifted up his head and held it in an embrace of kindliness and affection, and kissed his face. He brought me as offerings two strings of pearls and some rubies and emeralds. The value of the jewels was 300,000 rupees. Besides these he laid before me many valuable things.\n\nOn the 17th Jum\u0101d\u0101-l-awwal Waz\u012br Kh\u0101n, the Diwan of Bengal, came and waited on me, and offered 60 elephants, male and female, and one Egyptian\\(^1\\) ruby. As he was one of the old servants and he performed every duty, I ordered him to remain in attendance on me. As Q\u0101sim Kh\u0101n and his elder brother, Isl\u0101m Kh\u0101n, could in no way\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Text Qu\u1e6db\u012b, but I think the word is Qib\u1e6d\u012b, \u2018Egyptian.\u2019\nkeep the peace together, I had sent for the former to my own presence; and he yesterday came and waited on me. On the 22nd, \u0100\u1e63af Kh\u0101n, made me an offering of a ruby of the weight of seven t\u0101nk, which Ab\u016b-l-q\u0101sim, his brother, had bought in the port of Cambay for 75,000 rupees. It is of a beautiful colour and well-shaped, but to my belief is not worth more than 60,000 rupees. Great faults had been committed by Dulip R\u0101y, son of R\u0101y R\u0101y Singh, but as he took refuge with my farzand Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n his offences were pardoned, and I knowingly and purposely passed over his delinquencies. On the 24th the sons of Kh\u0101nkh\u0101n\u0101n, who had followed after him, arrived and waited on me and produced as an offering the sum of 25,000 rupees. On the same day the said Khan offered 90 elephants. On Thursday, the 1st Jum\u0101d\u0101-s-s\u0101ni, the feast of my solar year was celebrated in the house of Maryam-zam\u0101n\u012b. Some of the money I divided among the women, and an order was given that the balance should be distributed to the poor of the hereditary kingdoms. On the 4th of the month I ordered the Diwans to give a jagir, according to his rank, of 7,000 rupees to Kh\u0101n A\u02bfzam.\n\nOn this day a female antelope in milk was brought that allowed itself to be milked with ease, and gave every day four seers of milk. I had never seen or heard of anything of the kind before. The milk of the antelope, of the cow, and the buffalo in no way differs. They say it is of great use in asthma. On the 11th of the month R\u0101ja M\u0101n Singh asked for leave to complete the army of the Deccan to which he had been appointed, as well as to visit Amber, his native place. I gave him a male elephant of my own called Hushy\u0101r-mast, and gave him leave. On Monday, the 12th, as it was the anniversary of the death of the late king Akbar, in addition to the expenses of that entertainment, which are fixed separately, I sent 4,000 rupees more to be divided among the faqirs and\ndervishes who are present in the enlightened mausoleum of the venerated one. On that day I exalted 'Abdu-llah, the son of Kh\u0101n A\u02bf\u1e93am, with the title of Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n, and 'Abdu-r-Rah\u012bm, son of Q\u0101sim Kh\u0101n, with that of Tarbiyat Kh\u0101n. On Tuesday, the 13th, I sent for Khusrau's daughter, and saw a child so like her father as no one can remember to have seen. The astrologers used to say that her advent would not be auspicious to her father, but would be auspicious to me. At last it became known that they had augured rightly. They said that I should see her after three years. I saw her when she had passed this age. On the 21st of the month Kh\u0101nkhan\u0101n determined to clear out the province of the Niz\u0101mu-l-mulk, into which, after the death of the late king Akbar, some disturbances had found their way, and stated in writing that \"If I do not complete this service in the course of two years, I shall be guilty (of a fault), on the condition that in addition to the force that had been allotted to that Subah 12,000 more horse with 1,000,000 rupees should be sent with me.\" I ordered that materials for the army and the treasure should be quickly prepared, and he should be despatched. On the 26th Mukhli\u1e63 Kh\u0101n, bakhshi of the ahadis, was appointed bakhshi of the Subah of the Deccan, and I bestowed his place on Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Husain Kh\u0101n, the Mir Bahr. On the 1st Rajab, Pishrau Kh\u0101n and Kam\u0101l Kh\u0101n, who belonged to the servants who were in constant attendance on me (r\u016b-shin\u0101s), died. Sh\u0101h Tahm\u0101sp had given Pishrau Kh\u0101n as a slave to my grandfather, and he was called Sa\u02bf\u0101dat. When he was promoted in the service of the late king Akbar to the daroghahship and superintendence of the farr\u0101shkh\u0101na (carpet department), he obtained the title of Pishrau. He was so well acquainted with this service that one might say it was a garment they had sewn on the stature of his capacity. When he was 90 years old he was quicker than lads of 14. He had the good fortune\nto serve my grandfather, my father, and me. Until he breathed his last he was never for a moment without the intoxication of wine.\n\n\"Besmeared with wine Figh\u0101n\u012b\\(^1\\) went to the dust.\nAlas! if the angels\\(^2\\) smelt his fresh shroud!\"\n\nHe left 1,500,000 rupees. He has one very stupid son, called Ri'ayat. On account of his father's claims for services performed, I gave the superintendence of half the farrashkhana to him and the other half to Tukhm\u0101q Kh\u0101n. Kam\u0101l Kh\u0101n was one of the slaves sincerely devoted to my service; he is of the caste of the Kal\u0101ls of Delhi. On account of the great honesty and trustworthiness that he had shown I made him bak\u0101wal-beg\u012b (chief of the kitchen). Few such servants are ever met with. He had two sons, to both of whom I showed great kindness, but where are there others like him? On the 2nd of the said month La'l\\(^3\\) Kal\u0101want, who from his childhood had grown up in my father's service, who had taught him every breathing and sound that appertains to the Hindi language, died in the 65th or 70th year of his age. One of his girls (concubines) ate opium on this event and killed herself. Few women among the Musulmans have ever shown such fidelity.\n\nIn Hindustan, especially in the province of Sylhet,\\(^4\\) which is a dependency of Bengal, it was the custom for the people of those parts to make eunuchs of some of their sons and give them to the governor in place of revenue (\\(m\u0101l-w\u0101jib\u012b\\)). This custom by degrees has been adopted in other provinces, and every year some children are thus\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Figh\u0101n\u012b was a famous poet and also a drunkard. See Rieu, ii, p. 651, and Sprenger, Oude Cat., p. 403. Figh\u0101n\u012b also means lamentation, and there is a play in the couplet on the double meaning.\n\n\\(^2\\) In the Elliot MSS., B.M., the second line is translated \"Alas! if the angels made his shroud of another kind of odour!\" The angels meant are Nak\u012br and Munkar.\n\n\\(^3\\) Blochmann, p. 612.\n\n\\(^4\\) Cf. Jarrett, ii, p. 122.\nruined and cut off from procreation. This practice has become common. At this time I issued an order that hereafter no one should follow this abominable custom, and that the traffic in young eunuchs should be completely done away with. Isl\u0101m Kh\u0101n and the other governors of the Subah of Bengal received firmans that whoever should commit such acts should be capitally punished, and that they should seize eunuchs of tender years who might be in anyone's possession. No one of the former kings had obtained this success. Please Almighty God, in a short time this objectionable practice will be completely done away with, and the traffic in eunuchs being forbidden, no one shall venture on this unpleasant and unprofitable proceeding. I presented the Kh\u0101nkhan\u0101n with a bay horse out of those sent me by Sh\u0101h \u2018Abb\u0101s; it was the head of the stable of my private horses. He was so rejoiced over it that it would be difficult to describe. In truth a horse of this great size and beauty has hardly come to Hindustan. I also gave him the elephant Fut\u016bl, that is unrivalled in fighting, with twenty other elephants. As Kishan Singh, who was accompanying Mah\u0101bat Kh\u0101n, performed laudable service, and was wounded in the leg by a spear in the fight with the R\u0101n\u0101's men, so that about twenty noblemen of his were killed and about 3,000 made captive, he was promoted to the rank of 2,000 personal and 1,000 horse. On the 14th of the same month I gave an order for Mirz\u0101 Gh\u0101zi to betake himself to Qandahar.\n\nA strange occurrence was that as soon as the aforesaid Mirz\u0101 started from Bakhar for that province the news of the death of Sard\u0101r Kh\u0101n, the governor of that place, came. Sard\u0101r Kh\u0101n was one of the permanent and intimate attendants of my uncle Muhammad \u1e24ak\u012bm, and was known as Tukht\u0101 Beg. I gave half his rank (the pay of it) to his sons. On Monday, the 17th, I went on\n\n---\n\n1 Blochmann, p. 469.\nfoot on my pilgrimage to the enlightened mausoleum of the late king. If it had been possible, I would have traversed this road with my eyelashes and head. My revered father, on account of my birth, had gone on foot on a pilgrimage to the shrine of Khw\u0101ja Mu\u2018inu-d-d\u012bn Sanjar\u012b Chisht\u012b, from Fathp\u016br to Ajmir, a distance of 120 kos: if I should traverse this road with my head and eyes, what should I have done? When I was dignified with the good fortune of making this pilgrimage, I saw the building that had been erected in the cemetery. It did not come up to my idea of what it ought to be, for that would be approved which the wayfarers of the world should point to as one the like of which was not in the inhabited world. Inasmuch as at the time of erecting the aforesaid building the affair of the ill-starred Khusrau took place, I started for Lahore, and the architects had built it after a design of their own. At last a certain expenditure was made until a large sum was expended, and work went on for three or four years. I ordered that experienced architects should again lay the foundations, in agreement with men of experience, in several places, on a settled plan. By degrees a lofty building was erected, and a very bright garden was arranged round the building of the shrine, and a large and lofty gateway with minarets of white stone was built. On the whole they told me the cost of this lofty edifice was 1,500,000 rupees, equivalent to 50,000 current tumans of Persia and 4,500,000 khanis, according to the currency of T\u016br\u0101n.\n\nOn Sunday, the 23rd, I went with a band of courtiers who had not seen it to look at the reservoir in the house of \u1e24ak\u012bm \u2018Al\u012b, like one that had been made at Lahore in the time of my father. The reservoir is 6 gaz by 6 gaz. At its side has been erected a well-lighted room, the entrance to which is through the water, but the water does not get into it. Ten or twelve people could meet in it. He made an offering of some\nof the cash and jewels that had accumulated in his time. After looking at the room, and the entering of a number of courtiers therein, I raised him to the rank of 2,000, and returned to the palace. On Sunday, the 14th Sha'b\u0101n, the Kh\u0101nkh\u0101n\u0101n was honoured with a jewelled sword for the waist, a robe of honour, and a special elephant, and was given leave to go to his duty in the Deccan. R\u0101ja S\u016braj Singh, who was attached to him in that service, was raised to the rank of 3,000 personal and 2,000 horse. As it was again represented to me that oppression was being committed by the brethren and attendants of Murta\u1e93\u0101 Kh\u0101n on the ryots and people of Ahmadabad in Gujarat, and that he was unable properly to restrain his relations and people about him, I transferred the Subah from him and gave it to A\u02bf\u1e93am Kh\u0101n, and it was settled that the latter should attend at court, and that his eldest son Jah\u0101ng\u012br Quli Kh\u0101n should go to Gujarat as his deputy. The rank of Jah\u0101ng\u012br Quli Kh\u0101n was fixed at 3,000 personal and 2,500 horse. An order was given that in company with Mohan D\u0101s d\u012bw\u0101n and Mas\u02bf\u016bd Beg Hamaz\u0101n\u012b bakhsh\u012b he should carry on the business of the province. Mohan D\u0101s was promoted to the rank of 800 with 500 horse, and Mas\u02bf\u016bd Beg to 300 with 150 horse. Tarbiyat Kh\u0101n, one of the personal servants, was given the rank of 700 with 400 horse, and Na\u1e63ru-llah the same. Mihtar Kh\u0101n, whose circumstances have been related, died at this time, and I promoted his son M\u016bnis Kh\u0101n to the rank of 500 personal and 130 horse. On Wednesday, the 4th Z\u012b-l-hijja, Khusrau had a son born to him by the daughter of the Kh\u0101n A\u02bf\u1e93am, and I gave him the name of Buland-akhtiar. On the 6th of the same month Muqarrab Kh\u0101n sent a picture (with a report) that the\n\n1 \u201cWhat money and articles he could produce at the time\u201d (Elliot, vi, 320).\nbelief of the Franks was this, that the picture was that of T\u012bm\u016br. At the time when Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m B\u0101yaz\u012bd was taken prisoner by his victorious army, a Nazarene, who at that time was ruler\\(^1\\) of Constantinople, had sent an ambassador with gifts and presents in token of submission and service, and an artist who had been sent with the ambassador took his likeness and brought it away. If this story were true, no better gift could be presented to me. But as the picture had no resemblance to any of his descendants I was not satisfied of the truth of the statement.\n\n**The Fourth New Year's Feast after the Auspicious Accession.**\n\nThe passing of the great star that illumines the world into the constellation of Aries took place on the night of Saturday, the 14th Zi-l-l\u012bjja, in Hijra 1017 (21st March, 1609), and New Year's Day that made brilliant the world began with good auspices and rejoicing. On Friday, the 5th Muharram, in the year 1018, \u1e24ak\u012bm \u2018Al\u012b died. He was an unrivalled physician; he had derived much profit from Arabic sciences. He had written a commentary on the Canon (of Avicenna) in the time of my revered father. He had greater diligence than understanding, just as his appearance was better than his disposition, and his acquirements better than his talents; on the whole he was bad-hearted, and of an evil spirit. On the 20th \u0160afar I dignified M\u012brz\u0101 Barkh\u016brd\u0101r with the title of Kh\u0101n \u2018\u0100lam. They brought from the neighbourhood of Fathp\u016br a watermelon, greater than any I had ever seen. I ordered them to weigh it, and it came to 33 seers. On Monday, the 19th Rab\u012b\u2018u-l-awwal, the feast of my annual lunar weighing\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Apparently the person spoken of as a Nazarene (Christian) was the Emperor of Constantinople. Can this picture be the original of that prefixed to White & Davey's translation of T\u012bm\u016br's Institutes?\nwas arranged in the palace of my revered mother; a part of the money was divided among the women who had assembled there on that day.\n\nAs it had been evident that in order to carry on the affairs of the State in the Subah of the Deccan it was necessary to send one of the princes there, it came into my mind to send my son Parwiz there. I ordered them to send his equipments and fix the hour for his departure. I summoned to Court Mah\u0101bat Kh\u0101n, who had been nominated to the command of the army against the rebel R\u0101n\u0101 to arrange certain matters at headquarters, and appointed in his place \u2018Abdu-llah Kh\u0101n, whom I exalted with the title of Fir\u016bz-jang. I sent \u2018Abdu-r-Razz\u0101q bakhsh\u012b to carry an order to all the mansabdars of that army not to depart from the orders of the aforesaid Kh\u0101n, and to pay every heed to his thanks and blame.\n\nOn the 4th Jum\u0101d\u0101-l-awwal one of the goatherds, who are a particular tribe, brought before me a gelded goat that had teats like a female, and gave every day sufficient milk to take with a cup of coffee.\u00b9 As milk is one of the favours of Allah, and the source which nourishes many animals, I looked on this strange affair as an omen for good. On the 6th of the same month, having given him the rank of 2,000 personal and 1,500 horse, I sent Khurr\u0101m, son of Kh\u0101n A\u2019zam, to the government of the province of Sorath, which is known as J\u016bnagadh (in Kat\u1e25iyaw\u0101\u1e0d). I honoured\u00b2 \u1e24ak\u012bm \u1e62adr\u0101 with the title of Mas\u012bhu-z-zam\u0101n, and gave him the rank of 500 personal and 30 horse. On the 16th a jewelled waist-sword was sent to R\u0101ja M\u0101n Singh. On the 22nd, having handed over 2,000,000 rupees for the expenses of the army of the Deccan, which had been ordered for Parwiz, to a separate treasurer, 500,000 rupees more were given for\n\n\u00b9 Perhaps the meaning is enough milk to fill a coffee-cup.\n\u00b2 According to the contemporary, but anonymous, author quoted in Elliot, vi, 448, this was in reward for restoring the sight of Khusrau.\nthe private expenses of Parwiz. On the 25th, Wednesday, Jahandar (his son), who previously to this had been appointed, together with Qu\u1e6db-u-d-d\u012bn Kh\u0101n Koka, to Bengal, came and waited on me. In reality it became known to me that he was a born devotee.\\footnote{Majz\u016bb-i-m\u0101dar-z\u0101d. Probably the meaning is that he was a born idiot.} As my mind was taken up with the preparations for the Deccan, on the 1st Jum\u0101d\u0101-l-akh\u012br I nominated the Am\u012bru-l-umar\u0101 as well to that duty. He was honoured with the favour of a robe of honour and a horse. Having promoted Karam Chand, son of Jagann\u0101th, to the rank of 2,000 personal and 1,500 horse, I sent him in company with Parwiz. On the 4th of the month 370 ahadi horse were appointed with \u2018Abdu-l-lah Kh\u0101n to the assistance of the army employed against the R\u0101n\u0101. One hundred horses were also despatched from the government stables to be given as he thought proper to the mansabdars and ahadis. On the 17th I gave a ruby of the value of 60,000 rupees to Parwiz, and another ruby with two single pearls, worth about 40,000 rupees, to Khurr\u0101m. On Monday, the 28th, Jagann\u0101th was promoted to the rank of 5,000 personal and 3,000 horse, and on the 8th of Rajab, R\u0101y J\u0101y Singh was promoted to that of 4,000 personal and 3,000 horse, and was dismissed for service in the Deccan. On Thursday, the 9th, Prince Shahriy\u0101r from Gujarat came and waited on me. On Tuesday, the 4th, I despatched my son Parwiz on the service of conquering the country of the Deccan. He was presented with a robe of honour, a special horse, a special elephant, a sword, and a jewelled dagger. The Sardars and Amirs who were appointed with him each according to his condition received and were made happy with the favour of a horse, a robe of honour, an elephant, a sword, and a jewelled dagger. I appointed 1,000 ahadis to be in\nattendance on Parwiz for the service of the Deccan. On the same day a representation came from 'Abdu-llah Kh\u0101n that having pursued the rebel R\u0101n\u0101 into the hill country into rough places, he had captured several of his elephants and horses. When night came on he had escaped with difficulty with his life. As he had made things go hard with him, he would soon be taken prisoner or killed. I promoted the said Kh\u0101n to the rank of 5,000 personal, and a rosary of pearls, worth 10,000 rupees, was given to Parwiz. As I had given the province of Khandesh and Berar to the said son, I also conferred on him the fort of \u0100sir, and 300 horses were sent with him to be given to ahadis, mansabdars, and whomever else he might consider worthy of favour. On the 26th, Saif Kh\u0101n B\u0101rha was given the rank of 2,500 personal and 1,350 horse, and appointed to the faujdarship of the Sarkar of Hisar. On Monday, the 4th Sha'b\u0101n, an elephant was given to Waz\u012br Kh\u0101n. On Friday, the 22nd, I gave an order that as bang and b\u016bza (rice spirit) were injurious, they should not be sold in the bazars, and that gambling should be abolished, and on this subject I issued stringent orders. On the 25th they brought a tiger from my private menagerie to fight with a bull. Many people gathered together to see the show, and a band of Jogis (religious mendicants) with them. One of the Jogis was naked, and the tiger, by way of sport, and not with the idea of rage, turned towards him. It threw him on the ground and began to behave to him as it would to its own female. The next day and on several occasions the same thing took place. As no such thing had ever been seen before and was exceedingly strange, this has been recorded.\u00b9 On the 2nd of the month of Ramaz\u0101n, at the request of Isl\u0101m\n\n\u00b9 The story is also told in the Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, p. 37, where it is said that the tiger was one brought by a calendar as a present. It had the name of La'l Kh\u0101n and was very tame. It is added that the tiger did no injury to the jogi with his claws or teeth.\nKh\u0101n, Ghiy\u0101\u1e63 Kh\u0101n was promoted to the rank of 1,500 personal and 800 horse. Far\u012bd\u016bn Kh\u0101n Barl\u0101s was promoted to the rank of 2,500 with 2,000 horse. One thousand tolcha of gold and silver and 1,000 rupees were given in alms on the day of the procession of the sun into the constellation of the Scorpion, which, according to the general acceptation of the Hindoos, is called the Sankr\u0101nt. On the 10th of that month an elephant was presented to Sh\u0101h Beg Y\u016bzi (? the panther-keeper), and Sal\u0101mu-l-lah, the Arab, who is a distinguished young man and a relative (son-in-law?) of Mub\u0101rak, the ruler of Darful. On account of some suspicion that Sh\u0101h \u2018Abb\u0101s had entertained against him, he came to wait upon me. I patronised him, and gave him the rank of 400 personal and 200 horse. Again, another force, containing 193 mansabdars and 46 ahadis, I sent after Parwiz for service in the Deccan. Fifty horses were also entrusted to one of the servants of the Court to convoy to Parwiz.\n\nOn Friday, the 13th, a certain idea came into my mind, and this rhymed ghazal was produced:\n\n\u201cWhat shall I do, for the arrow of loss of thee has pierced my liver!\nSo that the (evil) eye not reaching me again may reach another?\nThou movest as if frenzied, and the world is frenzied for thee.\nI burn rue lest thy eye should reach me.\u201d\n\n---\n\n1 The MSS. have \u2018In\u0101yat.\n2 I.O. MS. No. 181, Sh\u0101h Beg Kh\u0101n.\n3 Sal\u0101mu-l-lah is mentioned later on (p. 78), and is described as brother\u2019s son of Mub\u0101rak, who held the country of Jotra (?) and Darful. He is also mentioned in the Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, p. 38, where Mub\u0101rak is described as ruler (\u1e25\u0101kim) of J\u016byza and Saf\u016bl (?). But a MS. of the Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma in my possession only mentions J\u016byza or J\u016byna. I think J\u016byza must be Juina or Juanny, which, according to Sir William Jones, is one of the names of the island of Johanna or Hinzuan (one of the Comorro Islands), and that Saf\u016bl must be Sofala, a town on the east coast of Africa. Sir W. Jones was landed on Johanna, and has a long account of the island (see his works). The Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma says that Sal\u0101mu-l-lah killed himself with drink. There is a short notice of him in the Ma\u2019\u0101\u0161ir, ii, 641, where he is called by his title of Shaj\u0101\u2018at Kh\u0101n.\nI am frenzied at union with my friend, and in despair at her absence.\nAlas for the grief that has o'erwhelmed me!\nI've grown mad that I may rush on the pathway of meeting:\nWoe for the time that brought me the news!\nJah\u0101ng\u012br, the time for humility and prayer is every morning;\u00b9\nI hope that some spark of light may take effect.\"\n\nOn Sunday, the 15th, I sent 50,000 rupees as s\u0101chaq\nto the house of the daughter of Mu\u1e93affar \u1e24usain Mirz\u0101,\nson of Sult\u0101n \u1e24usain Mirz\u0101, son of Bahr\u0101m Mirz\u0101, son of\nSh\u0101h Isma\u2018il \u1e62afaw\u012b, who had been demanded in marriage\nfor my son Khurr\u0101m. On the 17th of the month Mub\u0101rak\nKh\u0101n Sarw\u0101n\u012b was honoured with the rank of 1,000\npersonal and 300 horse. Five thousand rupees were also\ngiven to him, and 4,000 rupees to \u1e24\u0101ji B\u012b \u016azbeg. On\nthe 22nd a ruby and a pearl were given to Shahriy\u0101r.\nOne hundred thousand rupees were given for the sub-\nsistence of the \u016aym\u0101qs (special cavalry) who had been\nappointed for service in the Deccan. Two thousand\nrupees were given to Farrukh Beg, the painter, who is\nunrivalled in the age. Four thousand rupees were sent\nfor expenditure on B\u0101b\u0101 \u1e24asan Abd\u0101l. One thousand\nrupees were handed to Mull\u0101 \u2018Al\u012b Al\u012bn\u0101d Muhrkan\n(engraver) and Mull\u0101 R\u016bzbih\u0101n Sh\u012br\u0101z\u012b to expend on\nthe anniversary festival of \u1e24\u0101zrat Shaikh Sal\u012bm at his\nmausoleum. An elephant was given to Mul\u1e25ammad\n\u1e24usain, the writer, and 1,000 rupees to Khw\u0101ja \u2018Abdu-l-\nHaqq An\u1e63\u0101r\u012b. I gave orders to the Diwans that having\nraised the rank of Mur\u1e6d\u0101z\u0101 Kh\u0101n to 5,000 personal and\nhorse they should give him a jagir. I ordered Bih\u0101r\u012b\nChand Q\u0101n\u016bng\u016b, of the Sarkar of Agra, to take 1,000\nfootmen and equipment from the Zamindars of Agra,\nand, fixing their monthly pay, to send them to Parw\u012bz\nin the Deccan, and 500,000 rupees more were fixed for\nthe expenses of Parw\u012bz. On Thursday, the 4th Shaww\u0101l,\n\n\u00b9 The I.O. MSS. have a different reading here. Instead of 'every morning' they have 'renew (humility).' The word n\u016br, 'light,' in the last line probably refers to Jah\u0101ng\u012br's name of N\u016bru-d-d\u012bn.\nIsl\u0101m Kh\u0101n was promoted to the rank of 5,000 personal and 5,000 horse, Ab\u016b-l-wal\u012b Beg \u016azbeg to that of 1,500 and Zafar Kh\u0101n to that of 2,500. Two thousand rupees were given to Badi\u02bfu-z-zam\u0101n, son of Mirz\u0101 Sh\u0101hrukh, and 1,000 rupees to Path\u0101n Mi\u1e63r. I ordered that drums should be given to all of them as their rank had been raised to 3,000 and higher. Five thousand rupees more of the money from my weighing were entrusted for the construction of a bridge at B\u0101b\u0101 \u1e24asan Abd\u0101l and the building that is there to Ab\u016b-l-waf\u0101, son of \u1e24akim Ab\u016b-l-fath, in order that he might exert himself and put the bridge and the aforesaid building in perfect order. On Saturday, the 13th, when four gharis of day were left, the moon began to be eclipsed. By degrees the whole of its body was obscured, and it continued till five gharis of night had passed. In order to avert the bad omen of this I had myself weighed against gold, silver, cloth, and grain, and gave away in alms all kinds of animals, such as elephants, horses, etc., the cost of all of which was 15,000 rupees. I ordered them to be distributed among the deserving and the poor. On the 25th, at the request of her father, I took the daughter of R\u0101m Chand Bandilah into my service (i.e. married her). I gave an elephant to Mir F\u0101\u017cil, nephew of Mir Shar\u012bf, who had been appointed to the faujdarship of Qab\u016blah and those regions. \u2018In\u0101yat-ullah was dignified with the title of \u2018In\u0101yat Kh\u0101n. On Wednesday, the 1st Zi-l-qa\u02bfda, Bih\u0101r\u012b Chand was granted the rank of 500 personal and 300 horse. A khapwa (dagger), adorned with jewels, was given to my son B\u0101b\u0101 Khurr\u0101m. Mull\u0101 \u1e24ay\u0101t\u012b, by whom I had sent a message to the Kh\u0101nkh\u0101n\u0101n, with a verbal message containing (expressions of) all kinds of condescension and affection, came and brought before me a ruby and two pearls of the value of about 20,000 rupees, which the Kh\u0101nkh\u0101n\u0101n had sent by him. Mir Jam\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn Husain, who was in Burhanpur and whom\nI had sent for, came and waited on me. I presented Shaj\u0101'at Kh\u0101n Dakhan\u012b with 2,000 rupees. On the 6th of the aforesaid month, before Parwiz arrived at Burhanpur, a petition came from the Khankhanan and the Amirs that the Dakhanis had assembled together and were making disturbances. When I discovered that, notwithstanding the nomination of Parwiz and the army that had proceeded with him and been appointed to his service, they were still in need of support and assistance, it occurred to me that I should go myself, and by Allah's favour satisfy myself with regard to that affair. In the meanwhile a petition came also from A\u1e63af Kh\u0101n that my coming there would be for the advantage of the daily-increasing State. A petition from \u2018\u0100dil Kh\u0101n, from Bijapur, also came, that if one of the trusted ones of the Court could be appointed there to whom he could tell his desires and claims, so that the envoy might convey them to me, he hoped that it might become the means of affording profit to these slaves (i.e. himself). On this account I consulted with the Amirs and loyal men, and told them to represent whatever entered into anyone's mind. My son Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n represented that inasmuch as so many Amirs had been despatched for the conquest of the Deccan, it was not necessary for me to go in person. If he were ordered, he himself would go and attend on the prince and would, please God, perform this duty while serving him. Those words were approved of by all those who were loyal. I had never contemplated separation from him, but as the affair was an important one I necessarily gave him permission, and ordered that as soon as matters had been arranged he should return without delay, and should not remain more than a year in those regions. On Tuesday, the 17th Z\u012bl-qa\u1e0d\u0101', he was free to go. I presented him with a special gold-embroidered robe of honour, a special horse with a jewelled saddle, a jewelled sword, and a special elephant.\nI also gave him a yak-tail standard (t\u016bm\u0101n \u1e6d\u016bgh). I appointed Fid\u0101 Kh\u0101n, who was one of my faithful servants, and to whom I gave a robe of honour and a horse and his expenses, promoting him to the rank of 1,000 personal and 400 horse, original and extra, to go with Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n, in order that if it were necessary to send anyone to \u2018\u0100dil Kh\u0101n according to his request, he might despatch him. Lank\u016b Pandit, who in the time of the late king Akbar had come with offerings from \u2018\u0100dil Kh\u0101n, I also gave leave to go with Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n, bestowing on him a horse, a robe of honour, and money. Of the Amirs and soldiers who had been appointed with \u2018Abdu-llah Kh\u0101n to the duty of beating back the R\u0101n\u0101, men such as R\u0101ja B\u012br Singh Deo, Shaj\u0101\u2018at Kh\u0101n, R\u0101ja Bikram\u0101jit, and others, with 4,000 or 5,000 horse, were nominated to support Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n. I sent Mu\u2019tamad Kh\u0101n with the announcement that I had made him a saz\u0101wal (i.e. one who urges on others), and that he was to act along with Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n in Ujjain. Out of the men of the palace, I sent 6,000 or 7,000 horse with him, such as Saif Kh\u0101n B\u0101rha, H\u0101ji Bi \u016azbeg, Sal\u0101mu-llah \u2018Arab, brother\u2019s son of Mub\u0101rak \u2018Arab, who had in his possession the province of J\u016btra (?) and Darf\u016bl (?) and that neighbourhood, and other mansabdars and courtiers. At the time of giving them leave I gave each one an increase of rank and robe of honour and money for their expenses. Making Mu\u1e25ammad Beg pay-master of the army, I provided him with 1,000,000 rupees to take with him. I sent to Parwiz a special horse, and to the Khankhanan and other Amirs and officers who were appointed to that Subah dresses of honour.\n\nAfter carrying out these matters I left the city for the purpose of hunting. One thousand rupees were given to\n\n---\n\n1 See note above. J\u016btra or Jotra is probably a mistake for the island of Johanna, i.e. Hinzu\u0101n. Darf\u016bl is Dazf\u016bl in I.O. MS. No. 181.\nMir 'Ali Akbar. As the Rab\u012b' Fa\u1e63l (Spring season) had arrived, for fear any damage should happen to the cultivation of the ryots from the passage of the army, and notwithstanding that I had appointed a q\u016br\u012bs\u0101wul\u00b9 (Erskine has Kor, the Yasawal) (probably a kind of provost marshal) with the band of ahadis for the purpose of guarding the fields, I ordered certain men to see what damage had been done to the crops from stage to stage and pay compensation to the ryots. I gave 10,000 rupees to the daughter of the Khankhanan, the wife of D\u0101niy\u0101l, 1,000 rupees to 'Abdu-r-Ra\u1e25\u012bm Khar (i.e. ass) for expenses, and 1,000 to Q\u0101ch\u0101 the Dakhani. On the 12th, Kh\u0101njar Kh\u0101n, brother of 'Abdu-llah Kh\u0101n, received the rank of 1,000 personal and 500 horse, original and extra, and Bah\u0101dur Kh\u0101n, another brother, that of 600 personal and 300 horse. On this day two antelopes with horns and one doe were taken. On the 13th I bestowed on and sent to Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n a special horse. Having promoted Badi'u-z-zam\u0101n, son of Mirz\u0101 Sh\u0101hrukh, to the rank of 1,000 and 500 horse, I gave him 5,000 rupees for expenses, and he was sent off with Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n for service in the Deccan. On this day two male and three female antelope were killed. On Wednesday, the 10th, I killed a female nilg\u0101w and a black antelope with a gun, and on the 15th a female nilgaw and a chik\u0101ra (gazelle). On the 17th of the month two rubies and a pearl were brought to me by Jah\u0101ngir Quli Kh\u0101n from Gujarat, as well as a jewelled opium box, which Muqarrab Kh\u0101n had sent from the port of Cambay. On the 20th I killed with a gun a tigress and a nilgaw. There were two cubs with the tigress, but they disappeared from view in consequence of the thickness of the jungle and the number of trees. An order was given that they should search for and bring them. When I reached the\n\n\u00b9 Possibly Q\u016br Yas\u0101wul is right, but most probably it was a yas\u0101wul attached to the Q\u016br, for which see Blochmann, p. 50.\nhalting-place my son Khurr\u0101m brought me one of the cubs, and the next day Mah\u0101bat Kh\u0101n caught the other and brought it. On the 22nd, when I had got within shot of a nilgaw, suddenly a groom (jilaud\u0101r) and two kah\u0101r (bearers) appeared, and the nilgaw escaped. In a great rage I ordered them to kill the groom on the spot, and to hamstring\\(^1\\) the kahars and mount them on asses and parade them through the camp, so that no one should again have the boldness to do such a thing. After this I mounted a horse and continued hunting with hawks and falcons, and came to the halting-place.\n\nNext day, under the guidance of Iskandar Mu\u02bf\u012bn, I shot a large nilgaw, and promoted him to the rank of 600 personal and 500 horse. On Friday, the 24th, \u1e62afdar Kh\u0101n, who had come from the Subah of Behar, had the good fortune to perform his obeisance to me. He presented as offerings a hundred muhrs, a sword, and five female and one male elephant. The male elephant was accepted. On the same day Y\u0101dg\u0101r Khw\u0101ja of Samarkand came from Balkh and paid his respects. He made offerings of an album, some horses, and other presents, and was dignified with a robe of honour. On Wednesday, 6th Zi-l-hijja, Mu\u02bfizzu-l-mulk, who had been removed from the paymastership of the army against the rebel R\u0101n\u0101, ill and miserable, waited on me. On the 14th of the said month, having pardoned all the faults of \u2018Abdu-r-Ra\u1e25\u012bm Khar,\\(^2\\) I promoted him to the rank of y\u016bzb\u0101sh\u012b (centurion) and 20 horse, and ordered him to go to Kashmir, and in\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u2019s conduct was sufficiently brutal, but the text has made it worse than it was by omitting the word pay before pay. The back tendons of the bearers\u2019 feet were cut. Their feet were not cut off. Erskine translates the passage rightly, and the I.O. MSS. agree with him.\n\n\\(^2\\) This was the same \u2018Abdu-r-Ra\u1e25\u012bm who was a companion of Khusrau, and after his capture was sweated in a skin. As he had life left in him he escaped from that destruction, and, on being released, became one of the personal servants, and served His Majesty till by degrees the latter became gracious to him. (Note of Sayyid Ahmad.)\ncompany with the bakhshi of that place hold a muster of the troops of Qilij Kh\u0101n and all the jagirdars and Uymaks in the service or not, and to bring the list. Kishwar Kh\u0101n, son of Qu\u1e6dbu-d-d\u012bn Kh\u0101n, came from the fort of Rohtas and had the good fortune to pay his respects to me.\n\nThe Fifth New Year's Feast from the Auspicious Accession.\n\nOn Sunday, the 24th Zi-l-hijja (20th March, 1610), after two watches and three gharis the sun entered into the constellation of Aries, which is the house of honour and good fortune, and at this auspicious hour the New Year's feast was arranged at B\u0101k Bhal, one of the villages of the parganah of B\u0101r\u012b, and according to the rules of my revered father I mounted the throne. On that morning, which was the New Year's Day that lighted up the world, and coincided with the 1st of Farwardin of the 5th year from my accession, I held a public reception, and all the nobles and servants of the Court had the good fortune to pay their respects. Some of the nobles' offerings were laid before me. Kh\u0101n A\u02bf\u1e93am gave a pearl worth 4,000 rupees; M\u012br\u0101n \u1e62adr Jah\u0101n, twenty-eight hawks and falcons, and other gifts; Mah\u0101bat Kh\u0101n, two European boxes, the sides of which were made with slabs of glass, so that whatever was placed inside could be seen from outside in a way that you might say there was nothing between them; Kishwar Kh\u0101n, twenty-two male and female elephants. In the same way each of the servants of the Court laid before me the presents and offerings that they had. Na\u1e63ru-llah, son of Fa\u1e6dhu-llah sharbatchi (in charge of the sharbat), was placed in charge of the offerings. By S\u0101rang Deo, who had been appointed to carry orders to the victorious army of the Deccan, I sent souvenirs (tabarruk) to\nParwiz and to each of the officers. I presented Hus\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn, son of Gh\u0101z\u012b Kh\u0101n\u00b9 Badakhsh\u012b, who had taken to the ways of a dervish and seclusion, with 1,000 rupees and a farj\u012b shawl. The day after the New Year\u2019s Day I mounted and started for a tiger-hunt. Two males and a female were killed. I gave rewards to the ahadis who had shown bravery and gone in to the tigers, and increased their monthly pay. On the 26th of the same month I went and busied myself mostly with hunting nilgaw. As the air was hot and the (propitious) hour for re-entering Agra had nearly arrived, I went to R\u016bpb\u0101s, and hunted antelope in that neighbourhood for some days. On Saturday, the 1st Muharram, 1019, R\u016bp Khaw\u0101\u1e63\u1e63, who was the founder of R\u016bpb\u0101s, presented the offering that he had prepared. That which pleased was accepted and what remained was given him back as a reward. At the same time B\u0101yazid Mankali and his brothers, who had come from the Subah of Bengal, were honoured with paying their respects. Sayyid \u0100dam, son of Sayyid Q\u0101sim B\u0101rha, who had come from Ahmadabad, also had the same good fortune. He presented an elephant as an offering. The faujdarship of the Subah of Multan was given to Wali Bi \u016azbeg in place of T\u0101j Kh\u0101n.\n\nOn Monday, the 3rd Muharram of the 5th year, I halted at the Mand\u0101kar Garden, which is in the neighbourhood of the city. On the morning on which was the auspicious hour of entry into the city, after a watch and two gharis had passed I mounted and rode on a horse to the beginning of the inhabited part, and when I came to the immediate neighbourhood mounted on an elephant, so that the people from far and near might see, and scattering money on both sides of the road, at the hour\n\n\u00b9 Gh\u0101z\u012b Kh\u0101n was one of the famous officers of Akbar. Hus\u0101m his son was married to Ab\u016b-l-fa\u1e93l\u2019s sister. See Blochmann, p. 440.\nthat the astrologers had chosen, after midday had passed, entered with congratulation and happiness the royal palace. In accordance with the usual custom of the New Year I had ordered them to decorate the palace, which is like the courts of heaven. After seeing the decorations, Khw\u0101ja Jah\u0101n laid before me the offering that he had prepared. Having accepted out of the ornaments and jewels, dresses and goods, whatever I approved of, I gave the rest as a reward to him. I had ordered the clerks of the hunting department to write out (a list of) all the animals that had been killed from the time of my leaving until I re-entered the city. At this time they represented that in 56 days 1,362 animals, quadrupeds, and birds had been killed; the tigers were 7 in number; nilgaw, male and female, 70; black buck, 51; does and mountain goats and antelope (rojh), etc., 82; kulang (cranes), peacocks, surkh\u0101b,\\(^1\\) and other birds, 129; fish, 1,023. On Friday, the 7th, Muqarrab Kh\u0101n came from the ports of Cambay and Surat, and had the honour of waiting on me. He had brought jewels and jewelled things, and vessels of gold and silver made in Europe, and other beautiful and uncommon presents, male and female Abyssinian slaves, Arab horses, and things of all kinds that came into his mind. Thus his presents were laid before me for two and a half months, and most of them were pleasing to me. On this day \u0160afdar Kh\u0101n, who held the rank of 1,000 personal and 500 horse, had an increase of 500 personal and 200 horse, and was presented with a standard, and given leave to return to his former jagir. Standards were also given to Kishwar Kh\u0101n and Farid\u016bn\\(^2\\) Kh\u0101n Barl\u0101s. A fighting elephant for Afzal Kh\u0101n (Ab\u016b-l-fa\u017cl\u2019s son) was handed over to his son Bish\u016btan, to take to his father. I bestowed\n\n\\(^1\\) Brahmini ducks.\n\n\\(^2\\) A son of Akbar\u2019s officer, Mu\u1e25ammad Quli Barl\u0101s (Blochmann, pp. 342 and 478).\n1,000 rupees on Khw\u0101ja \u1e24usain, a descendant of Khw\u0101ja Mu\u2018\u012bnu-d-d\u012bn Chisht\u012b, as was usual for the half-year. The Khankhanan had sent as an offering a \u201cY\u016bsuf and Zulaikh\u0101\u201d in the handwriting of Mull\u0101 M\u012br \u2018Al\u012b,\u00b9 with illustrations and in a beautiful gilt binding, worth 1,000 muhrs. This Ma\u2018\u0161\u016bm, his Wakil, brought and submitted. Up to the day of culmination, which is the conclusion of the New Year\u2019s feast, every day many offerings were laid before me by the Amirs and servants of the Court. Whichever of the rarities was approved of by me I accepted, and gave back what was left. On Thursday, the 13th, corresponding to the 19th Farward\u012bn, which is the day of culmination of the sun and of gladness and pleasure, I ordered them to prepare an entertainment of different kinds of intoxicating drinks, and an order was given to the Amirs and servants of the Court that everyone might choose the kind of drink he affected. Many took wine and some mufarrih (exhilarating drinks), whilst some ate what they wished of the preparations of opium. The assembly was successfully held. Jah\u0101ng\u012br Quli Kh\u0101n from Gujarat had sent as an offering a throne of silver, inlaid and painted, of a new fashion and shape, which was presented to me. A standard was also conferred on Mah\u0101 Singh. In the commencement of my reign I had repeatedly given orders that no one should make eunuchs or buy or sell them, and whoever did so would be answerable as a criminal. At this time Afzal Kh\u0101n sent some of these evildoers to Court from the Subah of Behar, who were continually perpetrating this vile offence. I ordered these unthinking ones (b\u012b-\u2018\u016bqibat\u0101n) to be imprisoned for life.\n\n\u00b9 M\u012br \u2018Al\u012b was a famous calligrapher. See Rieu, Cat., ii, 531. Can the copy mentioned by Jah\u0101ng\u012br be that in the Bodleian Library, which Sir W. Jones praised so highly? A writer in the Journal of the Moslem Institute for January\u2013March, 1907, p. 186, suggests that the copy is in the Bankipur Library.\nOn the night of the 12th an uncommon and strange event took place. Some Delhi singers (Qaww\u0101l\u0101n, see Jarrett, ii, 236) were singing songs in my presence, and Sayyidi Sh\u0101h was, by way of buffoonery, mimicking a religious dance. This verse of Am\u012br Khusrau was the refrain (miy\u0101n-kh\u0101na) of the song\u2014\n\n\"Each nation has its right road of faith and its shrine (qibla-g\u0101h\u012b).\nI've set up my shrine (qibla) on the path of him with the cocked cap.\"\n\nI asked what was the real meaning of the (last) hemistich. Mull\u0101 \u2018Al\u012b Al\u1e25mad,\u00b2 the seal engraver, who in his own craft was one of the first of the age, and had the title of Khalifa, and was an old servant, and with whose father I had learned when I was little, came forward and said, \"I have heard from my father that one day Shaikh Niz\u0101mu-d-din Auliya had put his cap on the side of his head, and was sitting on a terraced roof by the bank of the Jumna and watching the devotions\u00b3 of the Hindus. Just then Am\u012br Khusrau appeared, and the Shaikh turned to him and said, 'Do you see this crowd,' and then he recited this line:\n\n'Each race has its right road of faith and its shrine' (qibla-g\u0101h\u012b).\n\nThe Am\u012br, without hesitating, respectfully did homage to the Shaikh, and addressing him said\u2014\n\n'I've set up my shrine in the direction of him with the cocked cap.'\"\u2074\n\nThe aforesaid Mull\u0101, when these words were uttered, and the last words of the second hemistich passed over his tongue, became senseless and fell down. Conceiving\n\n\u00b9 The Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, p. 41, has Shayy\u0101d\u012b, 'a dervish, a hypocrite,' and the R.A.S. MS. has Sayyidi Shayy\u0101d. Shayy\u0101d is used at p. 60 to mean an impostor. Here, perhaps, it would mean a buffoon.\n\n\u00b2 \u2018Al\u012b Al\u1e25mad's father was Shaikh \u1e24usain. See Blochmann, p. 53.\n\n\u00b3 It was the bathing of the Hindus that the saint was watching.\n\n\u2074 The point of Am\u012br Khusrau's hemistich is that kaj-kul\u0101h literally means 'the awry cap,' and so refers to the saint, who had his cap on his ear or on the side of his head. But it also means one who is presumptuous, and has left the true path of religion. It also means, according to Steingass, a beloved person.\na great fear from his falling down, I went to his head. Most of those who were present doubted whether he had not had an epileptic fit. The physicians who were present distractedly made inquiry and felt his pulse and brought medicine. However much they beat their hands and feet and exerted themselves, he did not come to. Immediately he fell he had delivered his soul to the Creator. As his body was quite warm, they thought that possibly some life might be left in him. After a short time it became evident that the thing was all over and he was dead. They carried him away dead to his own house. I had never seen this kind of death, and sent money to his sons for his shroud and burial, and the next morning they sent him to Delhi and buried him in the burial-place of his ancestors.\n\nOn Friday, the 21st, Kishwar Kh\u0101n, who held the rank of 1,500, was promoted to 2,000 personal and horse, and, having been presented with an Iraq horse out of my private stable, a robe of honour and a private elephant, named Bakht-jit,\\(^1\\) and the Faujdarship of the country of Uch, was dismissed with a view to the punishment of the rebels of that region. B\u0101yazid Mankali, having been honoured with a robe and a horse, was sent off together with his brothers in the company of Kishwar Kh\u0101n. An elephant from my private stud, by name \u2018\u0100lam-gum\u0101n, was entrusted\\(^2\\) to \u1e24ab\u012bbu-llah for Raja M\u0101n Singh and sent. A special horse was sent to Bengal for Kesho D\u0101s M\u0101r\u016b,\\(^3\\) and a female elephant was now given to \u2018Arab Kh\u0101n, the jagirdar of Jalalabad. At this time Iftikh\u0101r Kh\u0101n had sent an offering of a rare elephant from Bengal. As I approved of it, it was entered among my private elephants. I raised the rank of Ahmad\\(^4\\) Beg Kh\u0101n, who\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) I.O. MS. 181 has Takht-i-bakht (Throne of fortune).\n\n\\(^2\\) Kesho D\u0101s was perhaps the father of Karams\u012b, one of Akbar\u2019s wives. See Blochmann, p. 310.\n\n\\(^3\\) Blochmann, p. 465.\nhad been nominated to the command of the army of Bangash on account of his good service and that of his sons, from his original rank of 2,000 personal and 1,500 horse by 500 more personal. I sent a gold throne\\(^1\\) of jewelled work for Parwiz, and a sarpich, which was of rubies and pearls, and made at a cost of 2,000 rupees, was sent for Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n by the hand of Habib, son of Sarbar\u0101h Kh\u0101n, to Burhanpur. At this time it became known that Kaukab, son of Qamar Kh\u0101n, had become intimate with a Sanyasi, and by degrees his words, which were all blasphemous and impious, made an impression on that foolish fellow. He had made \u2018Abdu-l-La\u1e6d\u012bf, son of Naqib Kh\u0101n, and Shar\u012bf, his cousins, partners in that error. When this affair was discovered, with only a slight frightening they revealed certain circumstances with regard to themselves, the relation of which would be extremely disgusting. Considering their punishment advisable, I imprisoned Kaukab\\(^2\\) and Shar\u012bf after giving them a whipping, and ordered \u2018Abdu-l-La\u1e6d\u012bf a hundred lashes in my presence. This special chastisement (was given) for the purpose of carrying out the Divine law in order that other ignorant persons might not be disposed towards the same actions. On Monday, the 24th, Mu\u2019azzam Kh\u0101n was despatched to Delhi to punish the rebels and disaffected of that neighbourhood. Two thousand rupees were given to Shaj\u0101\u2019at Kh\u0101n Dakhan\u012b. I had ordered Shaikh \u1e24usain Darsh\u0101n\u012b to proceed with certain firmans to Bengal and presents to each of the Amirs of that Subah. I now gave him his orders and despatched him. With an eye on his actions and his approved services, I promoted Isl\u0101m Kh\u0101n to the rank of 5,000 personal and horse, and bestowed on him a special dress of honour.\n\n\\(^1\\) Takht\u012b, qu. a signet?\n\n\\(^2\\) Kaukab is mentioned again at the end of the twelfth year. For notice of his father see Blochmann, p. 485.\nI gave a special dress of honour also to Kishwar Kh\u0101n, and presented R\u0101ja Kaly\u0101n with an Iraq horse, and similarly to the other Amirs there were given robes of honour or horses. Far\u012bd\u016bn Barl\u0101s, who held the rank of 1,500 personal and 1,300 horse, I promoted to 2,000 personal and 1,500 horse.\n\nOn the night of Monday, the 1st \u1e62afar, through the carelessness of the servants, a great fire occurred in the house of Khw\u0101ja Ab\u016b-l-\u1e25asan, and before they became aware of it and the fire could be put out many of his properties were burnt. In order to afford consolation to the mind of the Khw\u0101ja and to make up for the loss he had sustained, I gave him 40,000 rupees. On Saif Kh\u0101n B\u0101rha, who had been cherished and brought up by me, I bestowed a standard. I increased the rank of Mu'izzu-l-mulk, who had been appointed to the Diwanship of Kabul, from his original of 1,000 personal and 225 horse by 200 personal and 275 horse, and dismissed him. The next day I sent a ph\u016bl-kat\u0101ra (dagger) studded with valuable jewels to Burhanpur to Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n.\n\nA widow woman complained that Muqarrab Kh\u0101n had taken her daughter by force in the port of Cambay, and after some while, during which he had kept her in his own house, when she enquired for the girl had said that she had died by an unavoidable death. I ordered an enquiry to be made into the affair. After much search I discovered that one of his attendants had been guilty of this outrage, and had him put to death, and reduced Muqarrab Kh\u0101n's mansab by one half, and made an allowance to the woman who had been thus injured.\n\nAs on Sunday, the 7th of the month, a q\u012br\u0101n-i-nahs\u012bn (an unlucky conjunction) had occurred, I gave alms of gold and silver and other metals, and different kinds of cereals, to faqirs and indigent people to be divided in most parts of the dominion. On the night of Monday, the 8th, having sent for Shaikh \u1e24usain Sirhindi and\nShaikh Mu\u1e63\u1e6daf\u0101, who were celebrated for the adoption of the ways of dervishdom and the state of poverty, a party was held, and by degrees the assembly engaged warmly in *sama\u02bf* and *wajd* (dervish dancing and ecstasy). Hilarity and frenzy were not wanting. After the meeting was over I gave money to each and gave him leave. As Mirz\u0101 Gh\u0101zi Beg Tarkh\u0101n repeatedly made representations with regard to provisions for Qandahar and the monthly pay of the musketeers of the said fort, I ordered 200,000 rupees to be sent there from the treasury of Lahore.\\(^1\\)\n\nOn the 19th Urdibihisht, in the fifth year of my reign, corresponding with the 4th \u1e62afar, there occurred a strange affair at Patna, which is the seat of government of the province of Behar. Af\u1e93al Kh\u0101n, the governor of the Subah, went off to the jagir to which he had just been appointed, and which was at a distance of 60 kos from Patna, and handed over the fort and the city to the charge of Shaikh Ban\u0101ras\u012b and Ghiy\u0101\u1e63 Zain-kh\u0101n\u012b, the Diwan of the Subah, and to a number of other mansabdars. With the idea that there were no enemies in that region he did not satisfy himself as he should have with regard to the protection of the fort and city. By chance, at that time an unknown man of the name of Qutb belonging to the people of Uch, who was a mischievous and seditious fellow, came to the province of Ujjainiyya,\\(^2\\) which is in the neighbourhood of Patna, with the look of a dervish and the clothes of a beggar, and having made acquaintance with men of that part, who were always seditious, represented to them that he was Khusrau, who had escaped from prison and conveyed himself there; saying that if they would accompany and assist him, after the affair had been completed they would be the ministers of his State. In\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Elliot, vi, 321.\n\n\\(^2\\) Ujjainiyya here means Bhojp\u016br.\nshort, deceiving those simpletons with foolish words he brought them over to him and persuaded them that he was Khusrau. He showed those deceived ones the parts about his eyes, where at some time he had produced scars, of which the marks were still apparent, and told them that in the prison they had fastened cups (kator\u012b) on them and those were the marks.\\(^1\\) Through these falsehoods and deceit a number of foot- and horsemen had collected round him, and had obtained information that Af\u1e93al Kh\u0101n was not at Patna. Considering this a great opportunity, they made a raid, and when two or three hours of the day had passed on Sunday came to the city, and being hindered by nothing went for the fort. Shaikh Ban\u0101ras\u012b, who was in the fort, obtaining news of this, went in a disturbed state to the gate of the fort. The enemy, who came on with speed, did not give him time to close the gate of the fort. Together with Ghiy\u0101\u1e63, he betook himself to the side of the river by a wicket gate, and procuring a boat proposed to go to Af\u1e93al Kh\u0101n. Those rebels came with ease into the fort and took possession of Af\u1e93al Kh\u0101n\u2019s property and the royal treasury; and some of those wretched creatures who wait on events, who were in the city and its neighbourhood,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Apparently we may infer from this that Jah\u0101ng\u012br did blind or attempt to blind his son Khusrau, though he says nothing about it. Else why should this impostor pretend that he had marks of the blinding? Tavernier says Khusrau was blinded. Du Jarric also tells us that Jah\u0101ng\u012br blinded Khusrau on his way back from Kabul, when he came to the place where Khusrau had fought the battle. He was blinded by some juice of a plant being poured into his eyes. The juice resembled milk (qu. *Euphorbia*). One of his captains, who was also a judge, was likewise blinded there along with his son. W. Finch, too, speaks of this outbreak. He also says that Khusrau was reported to have been blinded on the battlefield with a glass. Another story was that Jah\u0101ng\u012br merely caused a handkerchief to be tied over his eyes and had it sealed with his own seal. It is mentioned in Whiteway\u2019s \u201cRise of the Portuguese Power in India,\u201d p. 163, note, that fifteen relatives of the King of Ormuz had been blinded by red-hot bowls having been passed close to their eyes.\njoined them. This news reached Afzal Kh\u0101n at Gorakhpur (Kharakp\u016br),\u00b9 and Shaikh Ban\u0101ras\u012b and Ghiy\u0101\u1e63 also came to him there by way of the river. Letters came from the city that this wretch, who called himself Khusrau, was in reality not Khusrau. Afzal Kh\u0101n, placing his trust on the grace and mercy of Allah, and through my good fortune, started without delay against those rebels. In five days he reached the neighbourhood of Patna. When the news of Afzal Kh\u0101n\u2019s coming reached those scoundrels, they entrusted the fort to one of those whom they had confidence in, and the horse and foot arraying themselves went out for four kos to meet Afzal Kh\u0101n. A fight took place on the bank of the river P\u016bn P\u016bn, and after a slight skirmish the array of those ill-fated ones was broken and they became scattered. In great bewilderment a second time that wretch was coming into the fort with a few men. Afzal Kh\u0101n followed him, and did not allow them to close the gate of the fort. Going to Afzal Kh\u0101n\u2019s house in a state of confusion, they fortified the house and remained there for three watches, and fought. They wounded about thirty people with arrows. After his companions had gone to jahannam (hell) he himself became helpless, and asked for quarter, and waited upon Afzal Kh\u0101n. In order to put a stop to this affair, Afzal Kh\u0101n executed him on the same day, and imprisoned some of his companions who had fallen alive into his hand. These items of news one after another reached the royal ear. I summoned to Agra Shaikh Ban\u0101ras\u012b and Ghiy\u0101\u1e63 Zain-kh\u0101n\u012b and the other mansabdars who had made default in holding the fort and protecting the city, and ordered their hair and beards\n\n\u00b9 Kharakp\u016br. The word is written Gorakhpur in some MSS., but I think it is clear that Kharakp\u016br is the place meant, for \u2018Abdu-r-Rahm\u0101n had lately got Sangr\u0101m\u2019s estate of Kharakp\u016br in jagir. The fact, too, that he fought with the impostor at the P\u016bn P\u016bn to the east of Patna shows that he was coming back from down the Ganges.\nto be cut off, and that they should be clothed in women's clothes, seated on asses, and paraded round the city of Agra and in the bazars, as a warning and example to others.\n\nAt this time representations succeeded each other from Parwiz and the Amirs appointed to the Deccan and those who were well-wishers of the State, that '\u0100dil Kh\u0101n Bij\u0101p\u016br\u012b prayed that they would send to him Mir Jam\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn \u1e24usain Inj\u016b, on whose words and acts all the rulers of the Deccan had great reliance, that he might associate himself with them and dispel the fear in their minds, and the affairs of that place might be arranged as it might seem proper to '\u0100dil Kh\u0101n, who had chosen the way of loyalty and service. In any case, he might drive out of their minds the fear that was in them, and soothing them might give him hopes of the royal favour. In order to obtain this end, on the 16th of the same month I despatched the above-mentioned Mir, giving him a present of 10,000 rupees. I increased the former rank of Q\u0101sim Kh\u0101n, which was 1,000 personal and 500 horse, by 500 personal and horse, in order that he might go to the support of his brother Isl\u0101m Kh\u0101n in Bengal. At the same time, in order to punish Bikram\u0101jit, Zamindar of the province B\u0101ndh\u016b,\u00b9 who had withdrawn his foot from the circle of obedience and service, I appointed Mah\u0101 Singh, grandson of R\u0101ja M\u0101n Singh, to proceed to put down the disaffection in that region and at the same time administer the estate of the jagir of the Raja, which was in that neighbourhood.\n\nOn the 20th of the month I gave an elephant to Shaj\u0101'at Kh\u0101n Dakh\u0101n\u012b. As the governor of Jalalabad had written and represented the ruinous state of the fort of that place, I ordered what might be required for the repair of the said fort to be taken from the treasury of\n\n\u00b9 Text wrongly has M\u0101ndh\u016b.\nLahore. *Iftikh\u0101r Kh\u0101n* had done approved service in Bengal. On the request of the governor of that Subah I increased his original rank, which was 1,500, by 500. On the 28th a representation came from \u2018Abdu-llah Kh\u0101n Fir\u016bz-jang, containing recommendations in favour of some of the zealous servants who had been sent with him to subdue the rebel Rana. As Ghaznin Kh\u0101n J\u0101lwari had shown the greatest zeal of all in this service, I increased by 500 personal and 400 horse his former rank, which was 1,500 personal and 300 horse. In the same manner each one of those persons was promoted according to his services.\n\nDaulat Kh\u0101n, who had been sent to Allahabad to bring the throne of black stone, came on Wednesday, the 4th of the month of Mihr (15th September, 1610), and had an audience and brought the stone safe and sound. In truth it was a wonderful slab, very black and shining. Many say it is of a species of touchstone; in length it was one-eighth less than four cubits, and in breadth $2\\frac{1}{2}$ cubits and one *tas\u016b*,\u00b9 whilst its thickness may be three *tas\u016b*. I ordered stone-cutters to carve suitable couplets on the sides of it. They had attached feet to it of the same kind of stone. I often sat on that throne.\n\nAs the brothers of Kh\u0101n \u2018\u0100lam became security for him, I brought out of prison \u2018Abdu-s-Subh\u0101n Kh\u0101n, who was in confinement for certain offences, and promoted him to the rank of 1,000 personal and 400 horse, and appointed him to the faujdarship of the Subah of Allahabad, and gave him the jagir of Q\u0101sim Kh\u0101n, the brother of Isl\u0101m\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 A *tas\u016b*, or *tas\u016b*, is said in Wilson\u2019s Glossary to be the 24th part of a gaz or about a third of an inch. I.O. MS. makes the breadth $3\\frac{1}{2}$ cubits 1 *tas\u016b*. The slab is described in Keene\u2019s Guide and in the N.W.P. Gazetteer, Agra volume. One inscription has the date 1011, or 1602. Archaeological Report, lv, pp. 132\u20135, says it is 10 ft. 7\u00bd ins. long, 9 ft. 10 ins. broad, and 6 inches thick. It is supported on octagonal pedestals. See also Beale\u2019s Mift\u0101\u1e25u-t-taw\u0101r\u012bkh, pp. 300, 301, where a representation of the stone and copies of the inscriptions are given.\nKh\u0101n. I sent Tarbiyat Kh\u0101n to the faujdarship of the Sarkar of Alwar. On the 12th of the same month a representation arrived from Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n that the Khan-khanan, according to my order, had started for the Court in company with Mah\u0101bat Kh\u0101n, and that M\u012br Jam\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn \u1e24usain, who had been nominated by the Court to go to Bijapur, had also gone from Burhanpur, together with the wakils of \u2018\u0100dil Kh\u0101n, to Bijapur. On the 21st of the same month I promoted Murta\u1e93\u0101 Kh\u0101n to the subadarship of the Panjab, which is one of the largest charges in my dominions, and gave him a special shawl. Having appointed Taj Kh\u0101n, who was in the Subah of Multan, to the governorship of Kabul, I added 500 horse to the rank of 3,000 personal and 1,500 horse already held by him. At the request of \u2018Abdu-llah Kh\u0101n Fir\u016bz-jang, the son of R\u0101n\u0101 Shankar was also promoted in rank. When Mah\u0101bat Kh\u0101n, who had been sent to Burhanpur to ascertain the numbers of the forces of the Amirs appointed to the Deccan, and to bring the Khankhanan, arrived in the neighbourhood of Agra, he left the Khan-khanan some stages off the city and came on in front himself, and was honoured with the good fortune of paying his respects and kissing the threshold. After a few days, on the 12th \u0100b\u0101n, the Khankhanan came and waited on me. As many of those who were loyal had represented the state of his affairs, whether true or false, according to their ideas, and I was displeased with him, because the degree of favour and regard that I previously had observed in his case and that I had seen in my revered father had not produced its effect, I did justice in the matter, for previously to this a letter of appointment to the service of the Deccan for a certain time had been given to him, and he had proceeded there in attendance on Sult\u0101n Parw\u012bz with other nobles for that important matter. After he arrived at Burhanpur he had not looked to the opportuneness of the time, and at an\nimproper season for moving, and when forage and other necessaries had not been laid in, he had taken Sult\u0101n Parwiz and his forces above the Ghats, and by degrees, in consequence of want of concert among the Sardars and his treachery, and of conflicting opinions, things had come to such a pass that grain was obtained with difficulty, and not a m\u0101n was to be got for large sums of money. The affairs of the army became so confused that nothing went on properly, and horses, camels, and other four-footed beasts died. In consequence of the exigency of the time he had patched up a kind of peace with the enemy and withdrawn Sult\u0101n Parwiz and the army to Burhanpur. As this business did not turn out well, all the well-wishers of the State knew that this division (of counsels) and confusion had arisen from treachery and want of arrangement of the Khankhanan, and represented this to the Court. Although this appeared altogether incredible, at last this impression was left upon my mind, and a representation came from Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n to the effect that all this mischief and confusion had arisen through the treachery of the Khankhanan; either this service should be left entirely in his control, or, summoning him to Court, I should appoint to this duty this man whom I had myself cherished and brought up, and appoint 30,000 horse to support this slave (Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n himself), in order that in the space of two years, having freed the whole of the royal province, now in the possession of the enemy, and having brought the fort of Qandahar\\(^1\\) and other forts on the border into the occupation of the servants of the Court, he should include in the royal dominions the province of Bijapur. If he did not complete this service in that time, he might be debarred from the good fortune of paying his respects (to me) and would not show his face to the servants of\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) A fort in the Deccan \"sixty miles north of Bidar\" (Elliot, vi, 70).\nthe Court. When the relations between the Sardars and the Khankhanan reached this point, I did not consider it advisable for him to be there any longer, and handed over the command to Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n and sent for him to Court. In reality the cause of my disinclination and want of favour to him was this. The degree of inclination and disinclination towards him in future will be in accordance with whatever may become clear.\n\nI favoured and promoted Sayyid \u2018Al\u012b B\u0101rha, who is one of our distinguished young men, with an increase of 500 personal and 200 horse beyond his previous rank, which was 1,000 personal and 500 horse, and gave D\u0101r\u0101b Kh\u0101n, son of the Khankhanan, the rank of 1,000 personal and 500 horse, with the Sarkar of Ghazipur as his jagir. Previously to this I had had the daughter of Mirz\u0101 Muzaffar \u1e24usain, son of Sul\u1e6d\u0101n \u1e24usain Mirz\u0101 \u0160afawi, ruler of Qandahar, betrothed to my son Sul\u1e6d\u0101n Khurr\u0101m, and on this date, the 17th \u0100b\u0101n, as the marriage meeting had been arranged, I went to the house of B\u0101b\u0101 Khurr\u0101m and passed the night there. I presented most of the Amirs with robes of honour. Some of those confined in the fort of Gwalior I released, and especially \u1e24\u0101ji M\u012brak. Isl\u0101m Kh\u0101n had collected 100,000 rupees from the kh\u0101l\u012bsa (directly managed) parganahs. As he was at the head of the army and the service, I handed this over to him as a present. Giving a little gold and silver and some of every kind of jewellery and grain to trustworthy men, I determined that they should distribute them to the poor of Agra. On the same day a report came from Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n that \u012araj, the son of the Khankhanan, had obtained leave from the prince, and according to orders he had despatched him to Court. With regard to what had been ordered in the case of Ab\u016b-l-fath, of Bijapur, as the above-mentioned was an experienced man, and his being sent would cause despair to the other Sardars of the Deccan to whom promises had been made, he\nhad (therefore) kept him under surveillance. An order had been sent that as Kesho D\u0101s, the son of R\u0101y Kalah (?), was in the service of Parwiz, if any impediment should occur in sending him, he (Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n) should despatch him whether he wished it or not. Immediately on this becoming known to Parwiz, he gave him leave and said to Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n: \u201cThese few words from my mouth thou wilt represent, that as I would give my existence and life for the service of my visible God (Jah\u0101ng\u012br), what is there in the being or annihilation of Kesho D\u0101s that I should show any resistance in sending him? When they (i.e. the king) send for my confidential servants for any reason it produces a feeling of hopelessness and disquietude of mind in the rest, and becoming known in these regions gives an idea of disfavour on the part of our lord and Qibla (place looked towards in worship). As for the rest, it is His Majesty\u2019s order.\u201d From the date on which the fort of Ahmadnagar, by the efforts of my deceased brother D\u0101niy\u0101l, came into the possession of the heads of the victorious State, up till now, the guardianship and preservation of that place had been entrusted to Khw\u0101ja Beg Mirz\u0101 \u1e62afaw\u012b, who was a relative of the asylum of pardon Sh\u0101h Tahm\u0101sp. After the disturbance of the rebel Deccanis went to a great length, and they besieged the said fort, he had committed no fault in the duties of devotedness and holding of the fort. When the Khan-khanan and the Amirs and other leaders who had assembled at Burhanpur in waiting on Parwiz devoted themselves to the driving back and defeat of the rebels, and from the differences of opinion and quarrels of the Amirs, and the absence of provision of forage and grain,\n\n1 So in MSS. Apparently Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n\u2019s meaning was that if this Deccani man were sent to Agra (as if to be punished) the other Deccani leaders would be discouraged.\n\n2 The text seems corrupt. Apparently I.O. MS. has Sargala, and this may have been Kesho D\u0101s\u2019s title.\nthose who looked after matters of importance brought this large army into improper roads and among hills and difficult passes, they in a short space of time rendered it wretched and impotent, and matters had come to such a pass and the difficulty with regard to grain was such that they were giving a life for a loaf. They then turned back helplessly with their objects unfulfilled. The garrison of the fort, who were expecting aid from this army, on hearing this news, lost heart and stability, and tumultuously wished to vacate the fort at once. When Khw\u0101ja Beg M\u012brz\u0101 became aware of this he endeavoured to soothe and quiet the men, but though he did his best it had no good result. At last, under an agreement, he vacated the fort, and proceeded to Burhanpur, and on the day mentioned waited on the prince. Representations with regard to his coming reached me, and, as it was clear that he had not been wanting in bravery and loyalty, I ordered his rank of 5,000 personal and horse to be confirmed and a jagir to be given him. On the 9th a petition came from some of the Amirs in the Deccan that on the 22nd Sha'b\u0101n Mir Jam\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn \u1e24usain had gone to Bijapur. \u2018\u0100dil Kh\u0101n sent his wakil forward for 20 kos, and himself received him at a distance of 3 kos, and took the Mir by the same road to his own residence.\n\nAs the desire to hunt overcame me, at a propitious hour determined by the astrologers, when a watch and six gharis had passed on the night of Friday, the 15th Ramaz\u0101n, corresponding with the 10th \u0100zar in the 5th year (of my reign), I started to hunt, and made my first halt in the Dahrah Garden, which is near the city. At this stage I gave Mir \u2018Al\u012b Akbar leave to go into the city after bestowing on him 2,000 rupees and a special warm wrapper (fargul). In order that the grain and cultivation should not be trodden down by my men I ordered that all should remain in the city but the men who were actually wanted and my personal servants.\nHaving entrusted the charge of the city to Khw\u0101ja Jah\u0101n I gave him his leave. On the 14th Sa\u2019du-llah Kh\u0101n, son of Sa\u2019\u012bd Kh\u0101n, was given an elephant. On the 28th, corresponding with the 21st Ramaz\u0101n, forty-four elephants, which H\u0101shim Kh\u0101n, son of Q\u0101sim Kh\u0101n, had sent as an offering from Orissa, were produced before me. Of these one was very good and tame; this one I put in my private stud. On the 28th an eclipse (of the sun, kus\u016bf) took place, in order to do away with the unluckiness of which I weighed myself against gold and silver; it came to 1,800 tolas of gold and 4,900 rupees. This, along with several kinds of vegetables and sorts of animals such as elephants and horses and cattle, I ordered to be divided among deserving people who were unprovided for and helpless poor of the city of Agra and other cities in the neighbourhood.\n\nAs the affairs of the army which had been nominated for the subjugation of the Deccan under the command of Parwiz, and leadership of the Khankhanan and other high Amirs such as R\u0101ja M\u0101n Singh, Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n, \u0100\u1e63af Kh\u0101n, the Am\u012bru-l-umar\u0101, and other mansabdars, and other leaders of every tribe and condition, had ended in this, that they had turned back from half-way and returned to Burhanpur, and all the confidential servants and news-writers who spoke the truth had sent in reports to the Court, that although there were many causes for the ruin of this army, yet the chief reason was the disagreement of the Amirs, especially the treachery of the Khankhanan, it came into my mind that I must send Kh\u0101n A\u02bf\u1e93am with another fresh and powerful army to make amends for and set to rights some of the improper proceedings that had arisen from the disagreement of the Amirs that has been described. On the 11th of Day he (Kh\u0101n A\u02bf\u1e93am) was honoured with the charge of this duty, and an order was given to the Diwans to make preparations and send him off quickly. I appointed Kh\u0101n \u2018\u0100lam, Far\u012bd\u016bn Kh\u0101n\nBarl\u0101s, Y\u016bsuf Kh\u0101n, son of \u1e24usain Kh\u0101n Tukriyah, \u2018Al\u012b Kh\u0101n Niy\u0101z\u012b, B\u0101z Bah\u0101dur Qalm\u0101q, and other mansabdars, near to the number of 10,000 horse, to accompany him. It was settled that in addition to the ahadis who were appointed to this duty 2,000 others should accompany him, making altogether 12,000 horse. Having sent with him thirty lakhs of rupees and several elephants, I gave him his leave and presented him with a magnificent dress of honour, a jewelled sword-belt, a horse with a jewelled saddle, a private elephant, and 500,000 rupees for expenses. An order was given that the chiefs of the civil department should recover this from his jagir. The Amirs who were under his orders were honoured with robes of honour, horses, and presents. I increased by 500 more horse the rank held by Mah\u0101bat Kh\u0101n, of 4,000 personal and 3,000 horse, and ordered him to conduct Kh\u0101n A\u02bf\u1e93am and this army to Burhanpur, and having enquired into (the circumstances of) the destruction of the army, should give the order of the appointment of the Kh\u0101n A\u02bf\u1e93am to the Amirs of those regions and make them of one purpose and counsel with him. He was to see the state of preparation of the army of those parts, and after arranging all matters should bring the Khankhanan with him to Court. On Sunday, the 4th Shawwal, when near the end of the day, I engaged in a cheetah hunt. I had determined that on this day and Thursdays no animals should be killed and I would eat no meat, on Sunday especially because of the respect my revered father had for that day in not being inclined to eat flesh on it, and in forbidding the killing of any animals for the reason that on the night of Sunday his own honoured birth had taken place. He used to say it was better on that day that all animals should be free from the calamity of those of a butcherly disposition. Thursday is the day of my accession. On that day also I ordered that animals should not be killed, so that whilst sporting\nI should not shoot an arrow or a gun at wild animals. In hunting with cheetahs An\u016bp R\u0101y, who is one of my close attendants, was heading the men who were with him in the hunt at a little distance\\(^1\\) from me and came to a tree on which some kites were sitting. When his sight fell on those kites he took a bow and some pointless arrows (tukk\u0101) and went towards them. By chance in the neighbourhood of that tree he saw a half-eaten bullock. Near it a huge, powerful tiger got up out of a clump that was near and went off. Though not more than two gharis of day remained, as he knew my liking for tiger-hunting, he and some of those who were with him surrounded the tiger and sent some one to me to give me the news. When it reached me I rode there at once in a state of excitement and at full speed, and B\u0101b\u0101 Khurr\u0101m, R\u0101m D\u0101s, I\u2019tim\u0101d R\u0101y, \u1e24ay\u0101t Kh\u0101n, and one or two others went with me. On arriving I saw the tiger standing in the shade of a tree, and wished to fire at him from horseback, but found that my horse was unsteady, and dismounted and aimed and fired my gun. As I was standing on a height and the tiger below, I did not know whether it had struck him or not. In a moment of excitement I fired the gun again, and I think that this time I hit him. The tiger rose and charged, and wounding the chief huntsman, who had a falcon on his wrist and happened to be in front of him, sat down again in his own place. In this state of affairs, placing another gun on a tripod,\\(^2\\) I took aim (majr\u0101\\(^3\\)\n\n---\n\n1 P\u0101ra d\u016brtar, but it would seem from the Ma\u2019\u0101\u0161ir, ii, 231, five lines from foot, that p\u0101ra, or b\u0101ra, is a word meaning a body of men. Perhaps it is b\u0101rah, \u2018twelve.\u2019\n\n2 At p. 256 we have the phrase majr\u0101 gir\u0101nd applied to the directing of cannon against the buildings of Fort Ranthambhore. I confess that I do not know whether Jah\u0101ng\u012br fired the gun that was on the stand or the one that Kam\u0101l loaded.\n\n3 Majr\u0101 giriftam seems rather to mean here \u2018adjusted the tripod,\u2019 for from what follows it appears that the gun was not then loaded. The Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, p. 47, has m\u0101sha r\u0101 z\u012br kard, \u2018applied the match\u2019(?).\ngiriftam). An\u016bp R\u0101y stood holding the rest, and had a sword in his belt and a baton (kutaku) in his hand. B\u0101b\u0101 Khurr\u0101m was a short distance off to my left, and R\u0101m D\u0101s and other servants behind him. Kam\u0101l the huntsman (qar\u0101wul) loaded the gun and placed it in my hand. When I was about to fire, the tiger came roaring towards us and charged. I immediately fired. The ball passed through the tiger\u2019s mouth and teeth. The noise of the gun made him very savage, and the servants who had crowded together could not stand his charge and fell over one another, so that I, through their pushing and shock, was moved a couple of paces from my place and fell down. In fact, I am sure that two or three of them placed their feet on my chest and passed over me. I\u2019tim\u0101d R\u0101y and the huntsman Kam\u0101l assisting me, I stood up. At this moment the tiger made for those who were on the left-hand side. An\u016bp R\u0101y let the rest slip out of his hand and turned towards the tiger. The tiger, with the same activity with which he had charged, turned on him, and he manfully faced him, and struck him twice with both hands on the head with the stick he had in his hand. The tiger, opening his mouth, seized both of An\u016bp R\u0101y\u2019s arms with it, and bit them so that his teeth passed through both, but the stick and the bracelets on his arms were helpful, and did not allow his arms to be destroyed. From the attack and pushing of the tiger An\u016bp R\u0101y fell down between the tiger\u2019s fore-feet, so that his head and face were opposite the tiger\u2019s chest. At this moment B\u0101b\u0101 Khurr\u0101m and R\u0101m D\u0101s came up to the assistance of An\u016bp R\u0101y. The prince struck the tiger on the loins with his sword, and R\u0101m D\u0101s also struck him twice with his sword, once on the shoulder-blade. On the whole it was very warm work, and \u1e24ay\u0101t Kh\u0101n struck the tiger several blows over the head with a stick he had in his hand. An\u016bp R\u0101y with force dragged his arms out of the tiger\u2019s mouth\nand struck him two or three times on the cheek with his fist, and rolling over on his side stood up by the force of his knees. At the time of withdrawing his arms from the tiger's mouth, as his teeth had passed through them, they were partly torn, and both his paws passed over his shoulders. When he stood up, the tiger also stood up and wounded him on the chest with his claws, so that those wounds troubled him for some days. As the ground was uneven, they rolled over each other, holding on like two wrestlers. In the place where I was standing the ground was quite level. An\u016bp R\u0101y says that God Almighty gave him so much intelligence that he bore the tiger over deliberately to\\(^1\\) one side (in the original, that side), and that he knew no more. At this time the tiger left him and was making off. He in that state of bewilderment raised up his sword and followed him and struck him on the head. When the tiger turned his face round, he struck him another blow on the face, so that both his eyes were cut, and the skin of the eyebrows, which had been severed by the sword, fell over his eyes. In this state of affairs, a lamp-man of the name of \u0160\u0101li\u1e25, as it was time to light the lamps, came in a hurry and by a blind chance\\(^2\\) came across the tiger. The tiger struck him one blow with his paw and knocked him down. To fall and give up his life were the same thing. Other people came in and finished the tiger's business. As An\u016bp R\u0101y had done this service to me and I had witnessed the way in which he offered his life, after he had recovered from the pain of his wounds and had the honour of waiting on me, I bestowed on him the title of An\u012bra'\u012b\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Apparently the meaning is that he rolled the tiger over to the side furthest from Jah\u0101ng\u012br.\n\n\\(^2\\) K\u016brag\u012b. The Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, p. 48, says the night was dark, and so the lamplighter blindly (az k\u016brag\u012b) fell upon the tiger and was killed. This tiger hunt and Jah\u0101ng\u012br's danger, etc., are described by William Finch (Purchas, i, 430).\nSingh-dalan. Anir\u0101'i\\(^1\\) they call in the Hindi language the leader of an army, and the meaning of Singh-dalan is a tiger-slayer. Giving him a special sword of my own, I increased his mansab. I gave Khurr\u0101m, son of Kh\u0101n A\u02bfz\u0101m, who had been appointed to the governorship of the province of Junagadh, the title of K\u0101mil Kh\u0101n.\n\nOn Sunday, the 3rd Z\u012bl-qa\u02bfda, I employed myself in fishing, and 766 fish were caught; these were divided in my presence among the Amirs, Ib\u0101chkiy\u0101n (?),\\(^2\\) and most of the servants. I eat no fish but those that have scales, but not because the professors of the Shia faith look on those without scales as unlawful, but the cause of my aversion is this, that I have heard from old men, and it has become known to me by experience as well, that fish without scales eat the flesh of dead animals and fish with scales do not eat it. From this cause, to eat them is contrary to my disposition. The Shiahs know\\(^3\\) why they do not eat them and for what reason they consider them unlawful. One of my home-bred camels that was with me in the hunt carried five nilgaws that weighed 42 Hindustani maunds. I had before this sent for Naz\u012br\u012b of N\u012bsh\u0101p\u016br, who excelled other men in the art of poetry, and passed his time in Gujarat as a merchant. At this time he came and waited on me, and imitating a poem of Anw\u0101r\u012b,\n\n\u201cAgain, what youth and beauty this is for the world!\u201d\n\nlaid before me a poem that he had composed on me. I presented him with 1,000 rupees, a horse, and a robe of honour as a gift for this poem. I had also sent for \u1e24ak\u012bm \u1e24am\u012bd Gujar\u0101t\u012b, whom Murta\u1e93\u0101 Kh\u0101n greatly\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Anikini means an army in Sanskrit and Rai is a title meaning leadership.\n\n\\(^2\\) Text, Zangchiy\u0101n (?). I.O. 181 has Ib\u0101chkiy\u0101n, i.e. people of the Ib\u0101chki-kh\u0101na or closet. See \u0100yin, Persian text, i, 42, and Blochmann, i, 46.\n\n\\(^3\\) This is said ironically.\npraised, and he came and waited on me. His good qualities and purity were better than his doctoring. He waited on me for some time. When it became known that there was no physician but himself in Gujarat, and I found he himself desired leave to go, I gave him and his sons 1,000 rupees and some shawls, and set aside a whole village for his maintenance; he went off to his native place quite happy. Y\u016bsuf Kh\u0101n, son of \u1e24usain Kh\u0101n Tukriyah, came from his jagir and waited on me. On Thursday, the 10th Z\u012bl-hijja, was the festival of the Qurb\u0101n (the sacrifice of Ishmael). As it is forbidden to take life on that day (Thursday), I ordered that on the Friday they should kill the sacrificial animals. Having sacrificed three sheep with my own hand, I mounted to go hunting, and returned when six gharis of night had passed. On this day was killed a nilgaw (commonly called blue bull) of the weight of 9 maunds and 35 seers. The story of this nilgaw is written because it is not devoid of strangeness. In the two past years, during which I had come to this same place to wander about and hunt, I had shot at him each time with a gun. As the wounds were not in a fatal place, he had not fallen, but gone off. This time again I saw that nilgaw in the hunting-ground (shik\u0101rg\u0101h), and the watchman recognized that in the two previous years he had gone away wounded. In short, I fired at him again three times on that day. It was in vain. I pursued him rapidly on foot for three kos, but however much I exerted myself I could not catch him. At last I made a vow that if this nilgaw fell I would have his flesh cooked, and for the soul of Khw\u0101ja Mu\u2018\u012bnu-d-d\u012bn would give it to eat to poor people. I also vowed a muhr and one rupee to my revered father. Soon after this the nilgaw became worn out with moving, and I ran to his head and ordered them to make it lawful (cut its throat in the name of Allah) on the spot, and having brought it to the camp I fulfilled my vow as I had proposed. They cooked\nthe nilgaw, and expending the muhr and rupee on sweets, I assembled poor and hungry people and divided them among them in my own presence. Two or three days afterwards I saw another nilgaw. However much I exerted myself and wished he would stand still in one place, so that I might fire at him, I could get no chance. With my gun on my shoulder I followed him till near evening until it was sunset, and despaired of killing him. Suddenly it came across my tongue, \"Khw\u0101ja, this nilgaw also is vowed to you.\" My speaking and his sitting down were at one and the same moment. I fired at and hit him, and ordered him, like the first nilgaw, to be cooked and given to the poor to eat. On Saturday, the 19th Zi-l-hijja, I fished again. This time about 330 fish were caught. On the night of Wednesday, the 28th\\(^1\\) of the same month, I encamped at R\u016bpb\u0101s. As this was one of my fixed hunting-places and there was an order that no one should hunt in the neighbourhood, a great number of antelope had come together in the desert there, so much so that they came into the inhabited parts and were not subject to any kind of molestation. I hunted for two or three days in those desert plains, and shot, and hunted with cheetahs many antelopes. As the hour for entering the city was near, making two halts on the way, I alighted on the night of Thursday, the 2nd Muharram, in the year 1020 (17th March, 1611), at the garden of 'Abdu-r-Razz\u0101q Ma'm\u016br\u012b, which is near, in fact close to, the city. On this night many of the servants of the Court, such as Khw\u0101ja Jah\u0101n, Daulat Kh\u0101n, and a number who had remained in the city, came and waited on me. \u012araj also, whom I had sent for from the Subah of the Deccan, had the honour of kissing the threshold. I stayed in that garden also on the Friday. On that day 'Abdu-r-Razz\u0101q presented his own offerings. As this was the last day for hunting, an order was given\n\n\\(^1\\) The text has 14th night, but I follow the I.O. MS. 181.\nthat the duration of the hunt and the number of animals killed should be counted up to me. The time of the hunt was from the 9th of the month of \u0100zar to the 29th Isfand\u0101rmuz of the 5th year, or three months and twenty days. In this time tigers 12, deer (g\u0101wz\u0101n) 1, chik\u0101rah (gazelle) 44, k\u016bt\u0101h-p\u0101cha (hog-deer) 1 head, fawns 2 head, black buck 68 head, does 31 head, foxes 4, k\u016br\u0101ra deer 8, p\u0101tal (?) 1, bears 5, hyenas 3, hares 6, nilgaw 108, fish 1,096, eagle 1, bustard 1, peafowl 5, herons 5, partridges 5, brahm\u012bn\u012b ducks (surkh\u0101b) 1, s\u0101ras 5, dh\u016bk (?) 1; total, 1,414.\n\nOn Saturday, the 29th Isfand\u0101rmuz, corresponding to the 4th Mu\u1e25arram, I mounted an elephant and went to the city. From the garden of \u2018Abdu-r-Razz\u0101q to the palace the distance is a kos and 20 tan\u0101b. I scattered 1,500 rupees to the crowd. At the fixed hour I entered the palace. The bazars had been decorated with cloths after the manner of the New Year\u2019s feast. As at the hunting-time an order had been given to Khw\u0101ja Jah\u0101n to prepare in the Ma\u1e25all (Zenanah) a building fit for me to sit in, the said Khw\u0101ja had in the space of three months prepared and brought to perfection this kind of lofty building, and with folded hands (in humility) had done exceedingly active work. Coming off the dust of the road I entered that Paradise-like building and went to look round that abode, and it was very much to my taste. Khw\u0101ja Jah\u0101n was dignified with much praise and commendation. The offerings he had prepared were displayed to me in the same building. Some of these were approved and accepted and the remainder presented to him.\n\nThe Sixth New Year\u2019s Feast After My Auspicious Accession.\n\nTwo gharis and forty seconds of day had passed on the Monday when the sun (lit. his honour the greatest star) entered his tower of honour, which is in the constellation of\nAries. That day was the 1st Farwardin, corresponding with the 6th Mu\u1e25arram\u00b9 (21st March, 1611). The feast of the New Year having been prepared, I seated myself on the throne of good fortune. The Amirs and all the servants of the Court enjoyed the good fortune of waiting on me, and gave their congratulations. The offerings of the servants of the Court, M\u012br\u0101n Sadr Jah\u0101n, \u2018Abdu-l-lah Kh\u0101n Fir\u016bzjang, and Jah\u0101ng\u012br Qul\u012b Kh\u0101n, were laid before me. On Wednesday, the 8th Mu\u1e25arram, the offering of R\u0101ja Kaly\u0101n, who had sent it from Bengal, was laid before me. On Thursday, the 9th of the same month, Shaj\u0101\u2019at Kh\u0101n and some of the mansabdars, who had come on summons from the Deccan, waited on me. I gave a jewelled waist-dagger to Razz\u0101q-wird\u012b \u016azbeg. On the same day the New Year\u2019s offering of Murta\u1e93\u0101 Kh\u0101n was laid before me. He had prepared all kinds of things. Having inspected all these, I took what I approved in the shape of valuable jewels, fine cloths, elephants, and horses, and gave back the rest. I presented a jewelled dagger to Ab\u016b-l-fath Dakh\u0101n\u012b, 3,000 rupees to M\u012br \u2018Abdu-l-lah, and an Iraq horse to Muq\u012bm Kh\u0101n. I increased the rank of Shaj\u0101\u2019at Kh\u0101n, which was 1,500 personal and 100 horse, by 500 personal and horse. I had summoned him from the Deccan for the purpose of sending him to Bengal to Isl\u0101m Kh\u0101n, in reality to take his place permanently, and I entrusted him with the charge of that Subah. Khw\u0101ja Ab\u016b-l-\u1e25asan laid before me (as offerings) two rubies, one royal pearl, and ten rings. I gave \u012araj, the son of Kh\u0101nkh\u0101n\u0101n, a jewelled dagger. The rank of Khurr\u0101m was 8,000 personal and 5,000 horse; I increased his personal allowance by 2,000, and\n\n\u00b9 Jah\u0101ng\u012br does not mention that it was in this year that he married N\u016br-Jah\u0101n. He saw her on New Year\u2019s Day (Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, p. 56), and it appears from a note of Jah\u0101ng\u012br on p. 132 of B.M. MS. Or. 3276 that he married her on 14th Khurd\u0101d (end of May, 1611). It was in the 11th year that she got the title of N\u016br-Jah\u0101n. Before that she was known as N\u016br-Mahall. It would seem that Jah\u0101ng\u012br married N\u016br-Jah\u0101n four years and a few days after her first husband\u2019s death.\nincreased that of Khw\u0101ja Jah\u0101n, which was 1,500 personal, 1,000 horse by 500 personal, 200 horse. On 24th Mu\u1e25arram, 18th Farvard\u012bn, the day of the ascendant, Y\u0101dg\u0101r \u2018Al\u012b Sult\u0101n, ambassador of Sh\u0101h \u2018Abb\u0101s, ruler of Persia, who had come on a visit of condolence on the death of the late king and with congratulations on my accession, had the honour of waiting on me, and laid before me the gifts Sh\u0101h \u2018Abb\u0101s, my brother, had sent. He had brought good horses, cloth stuffs, and every kind of fitting present. After he had presented the gifts, on the same day I gave him a superb robe of honour and 30,000 rupees, which were equivalent to 1,000 Persian tumans. He handed me a letter in which were mingled congratulations and condolences for the death of my revered father. As in the letter of congratulation he expressed the greatest friendship, and omitted no point of regard and concord, it has pleased me to enter here an exact copy of it.\n\n*Copy of the letter of Sh\u0101h \u2018Abb\u0101s.*\n\n\u201cMay the sprinklings of the cloud of the grace of God and the dropping of the favour of the Almighty impart freshness to the gardens of wonderful men and inventors (of new things)! May the flower-bed of sovereignty and rule and the mead of magnificence and exalted happiness of his Honour of heavenly dignity, of sun-like grandeur, the king whose fortune is young, of Saturn-like majesty, the renowned prince, possessing the authority of the spheres, the Khedive, the world-gripper (Jah\u0101ng\u012br) and country-conquering sovereign, the prince of the exaltedness of Sikandar, with the banner of Darius, he who sits on the throne of the pavilion of greatness and glory, the possessor of the (seven) climes, the increaser of the joys of good fortune and prosperity, adorer of the gardens of happiness, decorator of the rose-parterre, lord of the happy conjunction (of the planets), the opener of the countenance,\nthe perfection of kinghood, expounder of the mysteries of the sky, the adornment of the face of learning and insight, index of the book of creation, compendium of human perfections, mirror of the glory of God, elevator of the lofty soul, increaser of good fortune and of the beneficent ascension, sun of the grandeur of the skies, the shadow of the benignity of the Creator, he who has the dignity of Jamsh\u012bd among the stars of the host of heaven, lord of conjunction, refuge of the world, river of the favours of Allah, and fountain of unending mercy, verdure of the plain of purity, may his land (lit. surface) be guarded from the calamity of the evil eye; may his fountain of perfection be preserved in truth, his desire and love; the tale of his good qualities and benevolence cannot be written.\n\n\"'The pen has not the tongue to express the secret of love.'\n\nAlthough outwardly the distance (between us) prevents my attaining to the ka'bah of desire, yet he is the qiblah of my keen longing for spiritual intercourse. Thank God that by virtue of essential oneness this humble supplicant and that pure nursling of glory have in reality been united to one another. The distance of space and outward separation of the body not having prevented nearness of soul and spiritual union, my face is still towards friendship, and accordingly the dust of sorrow has not settled on the sunlike mirror of my mind, but it has received the reflection of the beauty of that exhibitor of perfection, and the olfactory of my soul has been ever scented with the sweet savour of friendship and love and the ambergris-perfumed breezes of affection and concord, and spiritual fellowship and perpetual union have rubbed off the rust from friendship.\n\n\"'I sit beside thee in thought, and my heart is at ease,\nFor this is an union not followed by separation's pain.'\n\n\"Praise be given to the most mighty and pure God that the plant of the desire of true friends hath borne the fruit\nof fruition. Success (maq\u1e63\u016bd), that beauty who for years was hidden behind the veil, has by dint of humility and supplication at the throne of the Almighty, come forth and manifested herself from the hidden bridal chamber, and a ray of perfection has been thrown on the plain of the hopes of the expectants; she has ascended the auspicious throne and seated herself beside the king who adorns the assembly and enhances the glory of the tribune of the king of kings. The world-opening standard of the Caliphate and rule, and the sky-scraping umbrella of justice and world-sway of that creator of the diadem and throne, and that opener of the knots of knowledge and wisdom have cast the shade of equity and sovereignty and mercy over the heads of the inhabitants of the world. My hope is that the chief of desire-granters may make the auspicious ascension of that blessed rising of fortune brighten the crown and illuminate the throne, making it of good omen and prosperous to all, and may the things that appertain to kingship and rule of the world and the causes of dignity and prosperity be ever on the increase! For long past the customs of amity and the ways of intimacy, which have been in existence between our ancestors, and now freshly have been re-established between this one who is bent on friendship and him who is intent on equity, demanded that when the good news of the accession of him who sits on the G\u016brg\u0101n\u012b throne and is the heir of the crown of Tim\u016br reached this country, one of the confidants of the royal palace should be quickly nominated to convey congratulations, but inasmuch as the business of \u0100zarbij\u0101n and the conquest of the province of Shirw\u0101n just then occurred, and until my loving mind was satisfied as to the affairs of that province, I could not return to my capital, some delay took place in the accomplishment of this important duty. Although outward ceremonial observances and politenesses have not much weight with people of knowledge and discernment, yet the observance of them is the observance\nof the dues of friendship. Of necessity, therefore, at this auspicious time when the attention of the servants of holy angels (?) has been withdrawn from the affairs of that province, which have been arranged in accordance with the desires of my well-wishers, and I am at ease in that quarter, I have returned and settled down in my capital of Isfahan, which is the permanent seat of rule. Therefore I have despatched Kam\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn Y\u0101dg\u0101r \u2018Al\u012b, who possesses the attributes of nobility, is perfect in sincerity and fully reliable, who is moreover of the number of devoted servants and S\u016bfis of pure design of our family, to the most exalted Court, that after he has obtained the good fortune to salute you, to console with you, and kissed the carpet of honour, and performed the dues of inquiry (after health, etc.) and congratulations, he may obtain leave to return, and may convey to the sincere mind of your well-wisher the good tidings of the safety of your angelic person and the health of your temperament that is of the brightness of the sun and increases joy. It is hoped that the tree of hereditary friendship and assiduousness, and the garden of intimacy and regard, both apparent and spiritual, which by the irrigation of the rivers of affection and the brooks of sincere regard acquire great splendour and greenness, not casting their leaves, may set in motion the cord of intimacy and drive away the misfortune of estrangement by the arrival of correspondence, which is the communication of the soul, and may connect by spiritual chains our visible friendship, and may favour the course and accomplishment of business.\n\n\u201cMay God Almighty give the assistance of the secret powers to that living family of dignity and glory and that household of grandeur and good fortune.\u201d\n\nUp to this is the copy of the letter of my brother Sh\u0101h \u2018Abb\u0101s.\n\nMy brothers Sul\u1e6d\u0101n Mur\u0101d and D\u0101niy\u0101l, who had died in the lifetime of my revered father, people had called\nby several names. I ordered that one of them should be called Sh\u0101hz\u0101da maghf\u016br (the pardoned prince), and the other Sh\u0101hz\u0101da marh\u016bm (the prince admitted to mercy). I promoted \u012atim\u0101du-d-daulah and \u2018Abdu-r-Razz\u0101q Ma\u2019m\u016bri, who each held the rank of 1,500, to that of 1,800, and increased the horse-rank of Q\u0101sim Kh\u0101n, brother of Isl\u0101m Kkankhanan, by 250. I dignified \u012araj, eldest son of the Khankhanan, with the title of Sh\u0101h-naw\u0101z Kh\u0101n, and Sa\u2019du-llah, son of Sa\u2019\u012bd Kh\u0101n, with the appellation of Naw\u0101zish Kh\u0101n.\n\nAt the time of my accession I had increased weights and measures (lit. gaz), viz. to the extent of three ratis (small weight equal to eight barleycorns), in the weight of muhrs and rupees. At this time it was represented to me that in mercantile transactions it would be for the convenience of the people that muhrs and rupees should be of the same weight as previously. As in all affairs the contentment and ease of the people are to be looked to, I gave an order that from the present day, that is, the 11th Urdibihisht in the 6th year of my reign, they should strike muhrs and rupees of the former weight in all the mints of my dominions. As before this, on Saturday, the 2nd of the month of Safar, in the year 1020, the evil-dispositioned Ahd\u0101d had heard that Kabul was deprived of an eminent leader, that Kh\u0101n Daur\u0101n\u00b9 was in the interior, and only Mu\u2019izzu-l-mulk with a few servants of the aforesaid was in Kabul, thinking it a good opportunity he (Ahd\u0101d) betook himself unexpectedly to Kabul with a large number of horsemen and foot-soldiers. Mu\u2019izzu-l-mulk, according to the measure of his ability, displayed activity, and the Kabulis and other inhabitants, especially the Farmuli\u00b2 tribe, barricaded up the streets and fortified their houses. The Afghans with some guns came in to the streets and bazars\n\n\u00b9 Kh\u0101n Daur\u0101n was away in the district of Ningnahar (Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, p. 53).\n\u00b2 Text wrongly has Qizilb\u0101shes.\nfrom different directions. The people from the shelter of their terraces and houses killed many of these wretches with arrows and guns, and Bargi,\\(^1\\) one of the confidential leaders of Ahd\u0101d, was killed. From the occurrence of this affair, for fear that the people from all sides and quarters should assemble and block the road for them to get out, giving up their hearts and feet (in a state of distraction), in fear and confusion they turned back. About 800 of those dogs went to jahannam (hell), and 200, having caught horses, hastily escaped with their lives from that deadly place. N\u0101d \u2018Al\u012b Maid\u0101n\u012b, who was in Lah\u016bgar, at last on the same day arrived there, and pursued them for a short distance. As the distance (between them) was too great and his band small, he turned back. For the energy he had shown in coming quickly, and for the activity displayed by Mu\u2018izzu-l-mulk, they were both promoted in rank; N\u0101d \u2018Al\u012b, who held that of 1,000 personal to that of 1,500, and Mu\u2018izzu-l-mulk, who held the rank of 1,500, to 1,800. As it transpired that Kh\u0101n Daur\u0101n and the Kabulis were in the habit of passing their days in carelessness, and the repelling of the evil disposition of Ahd\u0101d had taken a long time, it occurred to me that as the Khankhanan was without employment I might appoint him and his sons to this duty. Soon after this idea occurred Qilij Kh\u0101n, to summon whom a firman had already been issued, came from the Panjab and obtained the honour of an audience. It became evident from the forehead of his circumstances (his manner) that he was annoyed at the duty of driving back the ill-dispositioned Ahd\u0101d being assigned to Kh\u0101nkh\u0101n\u0101n. As he faithfully promised to take up this duty, it was settled that the governorship of the Subah of the Panjab should belong to Murta\u1e93\u0101 Kh\u0101n, and that the Khankhanan should remain at home, and that Qilij Kh\u0101n should be promoted to the rank of 6,000 personal and 5,000 horse, and be appointed\n\n\\(^1\\) Or B\u0101rk\u012b.\nto Kabul to drive back A\u1e25d\u0101d and the up-country robbers. I ordered the Khankhanan to have a jagir in the Subah of Agra in the Sarkars of Qanauj and Kalpi, that he might inflict condign punishment on the rebels of that region and exterminate them (pull them out by the roots). When I dismissed them I gave each of them special robes of honour and horses and elephants, and having received the robes of exaltation they started off. At the same time, on account of the sincerity of his friendship and his old services, I bestowed on I'tim\u0101du-d-daulah the rank of 2,000 personal and 500 horse, and presented him with a sum of 5,000 rupees by way of gift. Mah\u0101bat Kh\u0101n, whom I had sent to make the necessary preparations for war for the victorious army of the Deccan and point out to the Amirs the desirability of concord and unanimity, paid his respects to me at the capital of Agra on the 12th of the month of T\u012br, the 21st of Rab\u012b'u-s-sani. It was brought to notice in a letter from Isl\u0101m Kh\u0101n that 'In\u0101yat Kh\u0101n had performed approved service in the Subah of Bengal; on this account I increased by 500 personal the rank he already held of 2,000. I also increased by 500 personal and 300 horse, so as to make it up altogether to 1,500 personal and 800 horse, the rank of R\u0101ja Kaly\u0101n, who was one of the officials of that Subah. I appointed H\u0101shim Kh\u0101n, who was in Orissa, to the government of Kashmir, and sent his uncle, Khw\u0101ja Mu\u1e25ammad \u1e24usain, there to look after the affairs of that country until his arrival. In the time of my revered father his father, Mu\u1e25ammad Q\u0101sim, had conquered Kashmir. Chin Qilij, who was the eldest son of Qilij Kh\u0101n, came from the Subah of Kabul and waited on me. As in addition to his natural excellence he was a kh\u0101naz\u0101l (houseborn one), he was honoured with the title of Khan, and according\n\n---\n\n1 The text has here the word gh\u0101yatan, which does not seem to have much meaning. Erskine has 'without his knowledge,' so he probably had gh\u0101'ib\u0101na in his MS.\nto the prayer of his father, and on condition of his undertaking service in Tirah, I increased his rank by 500 personal and 300 horse. On the 14th Amard\u0101d, on account of the previous service and great sincerity and ability of I'tim\u0101du-d-daulah, I bestowed on him the high rank of the viziership of the kingdom, and on the same day presented a belt with a jewelled dagger to Y\u0101dg\u0101r 'Al\u012b, ambassador of the ruler of Iran. As 'Abdu-llah Kh\u0101n, who had been appointed to command the army against the rebel R\u0101n\u0101, promised to enter the province of the Deccan from the direction of Gujarat, I promoted him to be Subahdar of that province, and at his request appointed R\u0101ja B\u0101so to the command of the army against the R\u0101n\u0101, increasing his rank by 500 horse. In place of Gujarat I conferred the Subah of Malwa on Kh\u0101n A'zam and sent 400,000 rupees to provide for the army and warlike materials for the force that had been appointed to accompany 'Abdu-llah Kh\u0101n by way of N\u0101sik, which is near the province of the Deccan. \u1e62afdar Kh\u0101n, with his brothers, came from the Subah of Behar, and had the honour of kissing the threshold.\n\nOne of the royal slaves who was serving in the seal-cutting departments prepared and laid before me a design such as I had never seen or heard of before. As it is exceedingly strange, a detailed\\(^1\\) description of it is given. In the shell of a filbert four compartments had been carved out of ivory. The first compartment was one of wrestlers, in which two men were engaged in wrestling, a third was standing with a spear in his hand, a fourth with a hard stone.\\(^2\\) Another was sitting with his hands placed on the ground, while in front of him were laid a piece of wood, a bow and a pot. In the second a throne had been made\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Compare Elliot, vi, 324.\n\n\\(^2\\) Sang-i-durush\u1e6di. Elliot had the same reading and translates \u2018a heavy stone.\u2019 But both MSS. have sang u rasant, \u2018a stone and a cord,\u2019 query a sling, and this is certainly the right reading. See Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, p. 57.\nabove which a shamiy\u0101na (a tent-fly or canopy) was depicted, and a man of wealth (a prince) was seated on the throne with one leg placed over the other and a pillow at his back. Five servants were standing around and before him, and tree-boughs threw a shade over the throne. In the third compartment is a company of rope-dancers, who have raised upright a pole with three ropes fastened to it. A rope-dancer upon it (qu. on the ropes?) has taken hold of his own right foot with his left hand behind his head, and standing on one foot has placed a goat on the top of the pole. Another person has thrown a drum on his neck and is beating it, whilst another man is standing with his hands lifted up and looking at the rope-dancer. Five other men are also standing, of whom one has a stick in his hand. In the fourth compartment there is a tree, below which the figure of the revered (ha\u1e93rat) Jesus is shown. One person has placed his head at Jesus\u2019 feet, and an old man is conversing with Jesus and four others are standing by. As he had made such a masterpiece, I honoured him with a present and with increased salary.\n\nOn the 30th Shahriwar, Mirz\u0101 Sult\u0101n, who had been sent for from the Deccan, came and waited on me. \u0160afdar Kh\u0101n had an increase of rank conferred on him, and was appointed to go to the assistance of the army against the rebel R\u0101n\u0101. As \u2018Abdu-llah Kh\u0101n Bah\u0101dur Fir\u016bz-jang had proposed to enter the neighbouring province of the Deccan by way of N\u0101sik, it occurred to me to appoint R\u0101m D\u0101s Kachhw\u0101ha, who was one of the sincere servants of my\n\n---\n\n1 Text bar p\u0101y, but the I.O. MS. and Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, p. 58, have bar b\u0101zi (\u2018on the rope\u2019? or perhaps \u2018is doing gymnastics\u2019).\n\n2 Note of Sayyid A\u1e25mad (to the fourth compartment).\u2014\u201cEvidently this masterpiece was not the work of a slave in the seal department, for no reason appears why the portrait of Jesus should be introduced into the fourth compartment. Probably this masterpiece was the work of Frank artists and had fallen into the hands of the slave, and he had ascribed it to his own workmanship. (Perhaps the scene depicted was the Transfiguration.)\u201d\nrevered father, to accompany him in order that he might in every place look after him, and not allow him to be too rash and hasty. For this purpose I bestowed on him great favours, as well as the title of Raja, which he had not thought of for himself. I also gave him drums and the fort of Ranthanb\u00fbr, which is one of the noted castles in Hindustan, and honouring him with a superb robe of honour and an elephant and horse I dismissed him. I appointed Khw\u00e2ja Ab\u00fb-l-\u1e25asan, who had been transferred from the chief Diwanship, to the duty of the Subahdarship of the Deccan, as he had been for a long time in those regions in the service of my deceased brother (D\u00e2niy\u00e2l). I honoured Ab\u00fb-l-\u1e25asan, son of I\u2019tim\u00e2du-d-daulah, with the title of I\u2019tiq\u00e2d Kh\u00e2n, and having promoted the sons of Mu\u2019azzam Kh\u00e2n to fitting ranks sent them to Bengal to Isl\u00e2m Kh\u00e2n. At the request of Isl\u00e2m Kh\u00e2n, R\u00e2ja Kaly\u00e2n was appointed to the government of the Sarkar of Orissa and had an increase in rank of 200 personal and horse. I presented Shaj\u00e2\u2019at Kh\u00e2n Dakhani with 4,000 rupees. On the 7th \u00c2b\u00e2n Badi\u2018u-z-zam\u00e2n, son of Mirz\u00e2 Sh\u00e2hrukh, came from the Deccan and waited on me.\n\nAbout this time, in consequence of the disturbances that had occurred in the country of M\u00e2war\u00e2\u2019a-n-nahr, many of the Amirs and \u00dczbeg soldiers, such as \u1e24usain Bi, Pahluw\u00e2n B\u00e2b\u00e2, and Nauras Bi Darman, and Baram Bi and others came to Court and waited on me. They were all honoured with robes of honour, horses, cash, mansabs, and jagirs. On the 2nd \u00c2zar H\u00e2sh\u00eem Kh\u00e2n came from Bengal and had the honour of kissing my threshold. I sent 500,000 rupees for the expenses of the victorious army of the Deccan, of which the leader was \u2018Abdu-llah Kh\u00e2n, to Ahmadabad in Gujarat by the hands of R\u00fbp Khaw\u00e2\u015f\u015f and Shaikh Anbiy\u00e2. On the 1st day I went to the village of Samonagar, which is one of my fixed hunting-places, to hunt. Twenty-two antelope were killed, of which I myself killed sixteen and Khurran the other six. Remaining\nthere two days and two nights, on the night of Sunday I returned to the city in health and safety, and one night this couplet threw its brilliance on my mind:\n\n\"As long as there's in heaven light for the sun,\nBe not the reflection far from the Shah's umbrella.\"\n\nI ordered the lamplighters and the relators of stories that at the time of their salutations and telling stories they should commence with this couplet, and it is still in use. On Saturday, the 3rd day, a letter came from Kh\u0101n A\u02bf\u1e93am that \u2018\u0100dil Kh\u0101n Bij\u0101p\u016br\u012b had given up his evil ways and become penitent, and in the rank of servants was now more loyal than ever. On the 14th day, corresponding with the last day of Sh\u0101ww\u0101l, leave was given to H\u0101\u0161im Kh\u0101n to go to Kashmir. I gave a special wrapper (fargal) to Y\u0101dg\u0101r \u2018Al\u012b, ambassador of Persia. I presented I\u2019tiq\u0101d Kh\u0101n with one of my special swords called Sar-and\u0101z (thrower of heads). Having honoured Sh\u0101dm\u0101n, son of Kh\u0101n A\u02bf\u1e93am, with the title of Sh\u0101dm\u0101n Kh\u0101n, I increased his rank to 1,700 personal and 500 horse. He was also honoured with a standard. Sard\u0101r Kh\u0101n, brother of \u2018Abdu-llah Kh\u0101n F\u012br\u016bz-jang, and Arsl\u0101n B\u012b \u016azbeg, who had been appointed to the charge of S\u012bvist\u0101n, were also presented with standards. I ordered that j\u0101\u02bei-nam\u0101z (prayer carpets) should be made of the skins of the antelopes I had myself killed, and be kept in the public audience hall for people to use in saying their prayers. By way of special respect to the Law I ordered that the M\u012br-i-\u2018Adl and Q\u0101\u1e93\u012b, who are the pivot of affairs of the divine law, should not kiss the ground (before me), which is a kind of sijd\u0101. On Thursday, the 22nd day, I went again to Samonagar to hunt. As many antelope had collected together in that neighbourhood I had this time sent off Khw\u0101ja Jah\u0101n to prepare a qamargah and drive in the antelope into a broad place from all sides, to place canvas-\n\n---\n\n1 See Blochmann, p. 89, note. It came from Europe.\n2 In Scinde; it is the same as Sahwan, and is on the Indus.\nwalls (sar\u0101-parda) and a gul\u0101l-b\u0101r\\(^1\\) round it. They enclosed a kos and half of ground with sarapardas. When news came that the hunting-place had been prepared and a great deal of game had been confined, I went there and began to hunt on the Friday. Until the next Thursday I went every day to the qamargah with the ladies and hunted as much as I liked. Some of the deer were taken alive and some killed with arrows and guns. On the Sunday and Thursday, on which I do not fire guns at animals, they took them alive in nets. In these seven days 917 head, male and female, were caught, and of these 641 deer were caught alive. Four hundred and four head were sent to Fathpur to be let loose on the plain there, and with regard to 84 I ordered them to put silver rings in their noses and set them free in the same place. The 276 other antelope that had been killed with guns and arrows and by cheetahs were divided from day to day among the Begams and the slaves of the palace, and Amirs and servants of the palace. As I became very tired (dilg\u012br) of hunting, I gave orders to the Amirs to go to the shik\u0101rg\u0101h (hunting-place) and hunt all that were left over, and myself returned in safety to the city. On the 1st Bahman, corresponding with the 17th Z\u012b-l-q\u0101\u02bfda, I ordered that in the large cities of my dominions, like Ahmadabad, Allahabad, Lahore, Delhi, Agra, etc., they should arrange bulghur-khanas (places for the distribution of cooked food) for the poor; thirty mahalls (districts) had been ordered. Six had already been established, and twenty-four other districts were now ordered. On the 4th Bahman I increased the rank of R\u0101ja Bir Singh Deo by 1,000 personal; it was previously 4,000 personal and 2,000 horse: I gave him a jewelled sword. Another sword out of my special ones, that was called Sh\u0101h-bacha (king\u2019s child), was presented to Sh\u0101h-naw\u0101z Kh\u0101n. On the 16th Isfand\u0101rmuz, Bad\u012b\u02bfu-z-zam\u0101n, son of Mirz\u0101 Sh\u0101hr\u016bkh,\n\n\\(^1\\) Blochmann, p. 45.\nwas appointed to the army against the rebel R\u0101n\u0101 and a sword sent by his hand for R\u0101ja B\u0101so. Having again heard that the Amirs on the borders interfere with authority in matters that do not concern them, and do not observe laws and regulations, I ordered\\(^1\\) that the Bakhshis should circulate orders, to be obeyed amongst the Amirs of the borders, that hereafter they should not interfere in such things, which are the private affair of kings. The first thing is this, that they should not sit in the *jharokha* (private window), and should not trouble their officers and captains of the auxiliaries with keeping guard or saluting them, and should not have elephant fights, and should not inflict the punishment of blinding, and should not cut off ears and noses, and should not force Islam on anyone, and should not confer titles on their servants, and should not order the royal servants to do *k\u016brnish* or prostration, and should not force singers to remain on duty in the manner customary in (royal) darbars, and should not beat drums when they go out, and when they give a horse or elephant to anyone, whether to the king's attendants or to their own servants, they should not place reins or elephant's goads on their backs and make them perform obeisance. In going in procession they should not take with them on foot in their retinue the royal attendants. If they write anything to them they should not put a seal on it.\\(^2\\) The regulations which have been styled the rules of Jah\u0101ng\u012br (\u0100yin-i-Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u012b) are now in force.\\(^3\\)\n\n---\n\n1 Elliot, vi, 325.\n2 Both MSS. have *bar r\u016b* instead of *bar \u016b*, 'in front' or 'in the face' of the letter, and this is no doubt the correct reading. See Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, p. 59. See Blochmann, p. 263, for the different places where seals are to be put. Jah\u0101ng\u012br's order apparently was that the provincial governors were not to impress their seals on the face of their letters or other documents.\n3 The reference seems to be, not to these subsidiary regulations, but to the code of twelve rules promulgated by him at the commencement of his reign.\nThe Seventh New Year's Festival after the Auspicious Accession.\n\nOn Tuesday, the 1st Farwardin of the seventh year from my accession on the 16th Mu\u1e25arram u-l-\u1e25ar\u0101m (19th March, 1612) in the year 1021, the New Year's assembly that illuminates the world, and the festival that brings joy, were held in the capital of Agra. After four gharis of the night had passed on Thursday, the 3rd of the aforesaid month, the hour that the astrologers had chosen, I sat on the throne. I had ordered that, according to annual custom, the bazars should be decorated and the assembly should be kept up until the day of culmination (r\u016bz-i-sharaf). Khusrau Bi \u016azbeg, who was known among the Uzbegs as Khusrau Qimch\u012b, came on these days and had the honour of waiting on me. As he was one of the influential men of Mawara'a-n-nahr, I bestowed many favours on him, and gave him a fine robe of honour. I gave 15,000 rupees to Y\u0101dg\u0101r \u2018Al\u012b, ambassador of the ruler of Iran, for his expenses. On the same day the offering of Af\u1e93al Kh\u0101n, which he had sent from the Subah of Behar, was laid before me. There were 30 elephants and 18 ponies (g\u016bnth), and pieces of Bengal cloth, sandalwood, some pods of musk, aloes-wood (Agallochum), and all kinds of things. The offering of Kh\u0101n Daur\u0101n was also produced before me. He had sent 45 head of horse and two strings of camels, porcelain from China, dressing-gowns (p\u016bst\u012bnh\u0101) of sable (samm\u016br), and other valuable presents procurable in Kabul and its neighbourhood. The officers of the palace had taken trouble about their offerings, and according to the yearly custom from day to day of the festival the offerings of the servants were laid before me. Having looked at them\n\n---\n\n1 Q\u016bruqch\u012b in L.O. MS. and in Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, p. 60.

MS. has p\u016bst\u012bnh\u0101.\nin detail, I took what I approved and gave them the remainder. On the 13th Farwardin, corresponding with the 29th Muharram, a representation from Isl\u0101m Kh\u0101n arrived to the effect that through the blessing of Allah\u2019s favour and through the benign influence of the royal grace, Bengal had been freed from the disturbance of \u2018U\u1e63m\u0101n, the Afghan. Before the circumstances of this war are written down, some particulars with regard to Bengal will be recorded.\\(^1\\) Bengal is a country of great extent, and in the second cline its length, from the port of Chittagong to Gar\u012b, is 450 kos; and its breadth, from the Northern hills to the boundary of Sarkar Mad\u0101ran, 220 kos. Its revenue is about 60 krores of dams.\\(^2\\) The former rulers of this place always had 20,000 horse, a lakh of foot-soldiers, 1,000 elephants, and 4,000 or 5,000 war-boats. From the time of Sh\u012br Kh\u0101n and his son Salim Kh\u0101n, this country was in the possession of the Afghans. When the throne of sovereignty of Hindustan in the hands of my revered father acquired beauty and splendour, he ordered the victorious forces (of the empire) into it, and for a long time made the conquest of it his object, until the aforesaid province, through the great efforts of the chiefs of the victorious State, passed from the possession of Da\u02bf\u016bd Kar\u0101n\u012b, who was the last of its rulers. That wretch was killed in the fight with Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n, and his army became scattered and in desperate condition. From that date until now the province is in the possession of the servants of the State. In the end a few of the remaining Afghans had remained in the corners and sides of the country, and kept a few distant places in their possession, until, by degrees, most of that body became despised and helpless,\n\n\\(^1\\) Copied from \u0100yin. See Jarrett, ii, 115. See also Elliot, vi, 326.\n\n\\(^2\\) This is equal to one crore, fifty lakhs of rupees. The Sarkar of Orissa was included in Bengal, and its revenue is included in this. (Note of Sayyid Ahmad.)\nand were captured by the chiefs of the State in the places of which they had still possession. When the arrangement of the affairs of rule and empire, simply through the grace of God, became entrusted to this humble servant of the throne of Allah, in the first year after my accession I sent for R\u0101ja M\u0101n Singh, who had been appointed to the rule and government of that place, to Court, and sent Qutbu-d-d\u012bn Kh\u0101n, who, out of all the officials, was distinguished as my foster-brother, in his place. As he entered the province he attained to martyrdom at the hand of one of those mischievous ones who had been appointed to that country, and that man, who had not thought of the consequences, also obtained the reward of his deeds, and was slain. I promoted Jah\u0101ng\u012br Qul\u012b Kh\u0101n, who was governor and a Jagirdar in the province of Behar, on account of his nearness to that neighbourhood, to the rank of 5,000 personal and horse, and ordered him to go to Bengal and take possession of the province. I sent an order to Isl\u0101m Kh\u0101n, who was at the capital of Agra, to go to Behar and consider that province his jagir. When a short time had passed under the rule of Jah\u0101ng\u012br Qul\u012b Kh\u0101n, he contracted a severe illness, in consequence of the bad water and air of that place, and by degrees the power of the disease and his weakness became so great as to end in his destruction. When the news of his death came to my hearing at Lahore, an order was issued in the name of Isl\u0101m Kh\u0101n to proceed as soon as possible to Bengal. When I appointed him to this important duty, most of the servants of the State made remarks on his youth and want of experience. As the excellence of his disposition and his natural capacity had been noticed by my judicious eye, I myself chose him for this duty. As it happened, the affairs of this province were carried on by him in such a manner as from the time when it first entered into the possession of the Chiefs of the everlasting State until this day has never been attained to by any of the servants of\nthe Court. One of his noteworthy deeds was the driving away of the rebel \u2018U\u1e63m\u0101n, the Afghan. He frequently in the time of the late king encountered the royal forces, but his expulsion was not accomplished. When Isl\u0101m Kh\u0101n made Dhaka (Dacca) his place of abode and made the subjection of the Zamindars of that neighbourhood his chief object, it occurred to him that he should send an army against the rebel \u2018U\u1e63m\u0101n and his province. If he agreed to serve loyally, well and good, but if not, they should punish and annihilate him like other seditious people. At that time Shaj\u0101tat Kh\u0101n joined Isl\u0101m Khan, and the lot of leading in this service fell on his name. Several others of the State servants were also appointed to go with him, such as Kishwar Kh\u0101n, Iftikh\u0101r Kh\u0101n, Sayyid \u0100dam B\u0101rha, Shaikh Achhay, nephew of Muqarrab Kh\u0101n, Mu\u2019tamad Kh\u0101n, the sons of Mu\u2019azzam Kh\u0101n, Ihtim\u0101n Kh\u0101n, and others. He took with him also some of his own men. At the hour when Mushtar\u012b (Jupiter) was propitious, he started off this band, and appointed M\u012br Q\u0101sin, son of M\u012brz\u0101 Mur\u0101d, its chief paymaster and news-writer. He took also some of the Zamindars with him to show the road. The victorious armies started. When they reached the neighbourhood of \u2018U\u1e63m\u0101n\u2019s fort and land, they sent some eloquent men to admonish him and point out to him the way of loyalty, and bring him back from the road of rebellion to the right path. As much pride had seated itself in his brain-cup, and he had in his head a desire to seize the country, beside other fancies, he turned a deaf ear to their words and\n\n1 Also called Shaikh Kab\u012br Chisht\u012b (Blochmann, p. 519; Ma\u02bf\u0101\u0161iru-l-umara, ii, 630).\n2 Perhaps this is only rhetoric, but Ab\u016b-l-fa\u017cl describes how lots were cast between him and R\u0101ja Birbal as to who should go on the Y\u016bsufzai expedition.\n3 Ich\u012b means a hawk, but the meaning may be a Shaikh of Uch. Acha is given in Zenker as meaning a father in Turki. The Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma has Ajha.\nprepared himself for conflict and fight. The battlefield happened to be on the bank of a nullah in a place which was a complete bog. On Sunday (12th March, 1612), the 9th Mu\u1e25arram, Shaj\u0101\u02bfat Kh\u0101n, choosing the hour for the fight, arrayed the victorious forces, so that everyone should go to his place and be prepared for the battle. \u2018U\u1e63m\u0101n had not settled the battle for that day with himself. When he heard that the royal army had come prepared for battle, having no remedy he himself mounted and came to the bank of the nullah, and arrayed his own horse and foot opposite the victorious army. When the affair grew hot, and the two forces opposed each other, that foolish, obstinate man at the first onset threw his own fighting raging elephant against the advanced guard. After much fighting many of the leaders of the advanced guard, as Sayyid \u0100dam\u00b9 B\u0101rha and Shaikh Achhay, attained the dignity of martyrdom. Iftikh\u0101r Kh\u0101n, the leader of the right wing, was in no way remiss in attacking, and sacrificed his own life. The band that was with him fought to such a degree that they were all cut to pieces. In the same way Kishwar\u00b2 Kh\u0101n and his band of the left wing bravely sacrificed themselves in the affair of their master, but many of the enemy (lit. those of dark fortune) were also wounded and killed. That evil one (\u2018U\u1e63m\u0101n) took account of the combatants and ascertained that the leaders of the advanced guard and right and left wings were killed. The centre alone remained. He took no account of the killed and wounded on his own side, but attacked the centre (of the royal army) with the same energy. On this side the son and brothers and sons-in-law of Shaj\u0101\u02bfat Kh\u0101n, as well as other officers, stopped the advance of those lost ones, and attacked them like tigers and leopards armed with claws and teeth. Some of them attained the dignity of\n\n\u00b9 Text wrongly has A\u02bf\u1e93am. See Blochmann, p. 521, note.\n\u00b2 Kishwar was the son of Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u2019s foster-brother Q\u016b\u1e6dbu-d-d\u012bn, who was killed by Sh\u012br-afgan.\nmartyrdom, and those that remained alive bore away fatal wounds. At this time ('U\u1e63m\u0101n) drove a raging elephant of the name of Gajpat,\\(^1\\) which was his premier elephant, at Shaj\u0101'at Kh\u0101n, who laid hold of his spear and struck the elephant. What does a raging elephant care for a javelin! He then seized his sword and struck him two blows one after another. How did he regard these either! He then drew his dagger and struck him twice with it, but for this, too, he did not turn back, but overthrew Shaj\u0101'at Kh\u0101n with his horse. Immediately he was separated from his horse; calling out \"Jah\u0101ng\u012br Sh\u0101h,\" he leapt up, and his equerry struck the elephant on both front legs a blow with a two-handed sword. As the elephant fell on his knees, the equerry pulled the elephant driver down off the elephant, and Shaj\u0101'at with the dagger he had in his hand, and while on foot, struck such blows on the trunk and forehead of the elephant that the elephant roared out at the pain and turned round. As he was severely wounded, he went to his own army and fell down. Shaj\u0101'at Kh\u0101n's horse got up safely. As he was mounting his horse those vile ones drove another elephant at his standard-bearer, and overthrew his horse and standard. Shaj\u0101'at Kh\u0101n gave a manly shout and roused the standard-bearer, saying: \"Be bold: I'm alive and the standard is at my feet (?).\" \\(^2\\) At this critical moment all the servants of the State who were present seized their arrows and daggers and swords, and smote the elephant. Shaj\u0101'at himself came up and shouted to the standard-bearer to rise, and got another horse for the standard-bearer and mounted him on it. The standard-bearer unfurled the standard and maintained his ground. At the time of this struggle\n\n\\(^1\\) The Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma and the B.M. MSS. call it Bakhla.\n\n\\(^2\\) These last words seem to be part of Shaj\u0101'at's speech, but see Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, p. 63. See also Elliot, vi, 329, and the translation of the Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma account in Appendix L, Stewart's Cat. of Tippo Sultan's MSS., p. 275. The Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma says that 'U\u1e63m\u0101n's corpulence compelled him to ride on an elephant.\na (ball from a) gun struck that rebel on his forehead. However much they enquired for the man who fired it, he could not be found. When this struck him, he recognized that he was a dead man. Yet for two watches, notwithstanding this fatal wound, he urged on his men to the fight, and the battlefield was still deadly and the struggle warm. Afterwards the enemy turned their faces, and the victorious army pursued them, and continually striking them drove back those vile ones into the place where they had encamped. With arrows and guns those wretches would not allow the royal troops to enter the place where they were. When Wali, the brother of \u2018U\u1e63m\u0101n, and Mamrez, his (\u2018U\u1e63m\u0101n\u2019s) son and other relations and followers became aware of \u2018U\u1e63m\u0101n\u2019s wound, they made up their minds that he would not recover from it, and that if they, defeated and put to flight, should go towards their fort none would reach it alive. They thought it best to remain for the night in the place where they had encamped, and towards the end of the night seek an opportunity and get to their fort. Two watches of night had passed when \u2018U\u1e63m\u0101n went to hell. In the third watch they raised his lifeless body, and leaving his tent and the things they had with them in the camp, proceeded to their fortress. The scouts of the victorious army, having obtained news of this, informed Shaj\u0101\u2019at Kh\u0101n. On the morning of Monday the loyalists assembled and decided to follow them, and not allow breathing-time to those of dark fortune. In the end, in consequence of the tired state of the soldiers, and in order to bury the martyrs and out of sympathy for the wounded, they were perplexed in their minds as to going or settling down (where they were). Just at this time \u2018Abdu-s-Sal\u0101m, son of Mu\u2019azzam Kh\u0101n, arrived with a body of servants of the State, altogether 300 horse and 400 musketeers (t\u016bpch\u012b). When this fresh body of men arrived it was determined to pursue, and they accordingly went on.\nWhen Wali, who after Usman was the stock of the disturbance, learned that Shajarat Khan with the victorious army had come together with another fresh force, he saw no resource for himself but to go to Shajarat Khan on the straight line of faith and loyalty. In the end he sent a message that he who had been the cause of the disturbance had gone, and that the body of those who were left were servants and Musulmans. If he would give his word they would wait upon him and would agree to serve the State, giving their elephants as an offering. Shajarat Khan and Mutaqid Khan, who had arrived on the day of the battle and had done approved service, and all those who were loyal, in accordance with the necessity of the time and with what was best for the State, gave their word and encouraged them. On the next day, Wali and the sons, brothers, and sons-in-law of Usman all came and waited upon Shajarat Khan and the other servants of the State. They brought forty-nine elephants as an offering. After the completion of this work Shajarat Khan, leaving some of the royal servants in Adhar\u00b9 and the neighbourhood which was in the\n\n\u00b9 The text has dar adhar u tarf kih dar tusarruf-i-an tira-ruzgar b\u016bd. I do not know if adhar is the name of a place or what its meaning is. The I.O. MSS., Nos. 181 and 305, have arh\u0101d. Blochmann, p. 520, on the authority of the Makhzan-i-Agh\u0101n\u012b, says the fight took place 100 kos from Dacca and in a place called Nek Ujy\u0101l, and he points out in a note that there are several Ujy\u0101ls in Eastern Bengal. Possibly Adhar is Udhar or Uz\u0101r, and a corruption of Ujy\u0101l. The 'hills of Dacca,' referred to by Blochmann, might be Ran Bhawal or the Madhupur jungle. The Riy\u0101zu-s-sal\u0101\u1e6din does not mention the site of the battle, and the translator, Maulaw\u012b \u2018Abdu-s-Sal\u0101m, has in his note at p. 175 confounded two \u2018\u012as\u0101 Kh\u0101ns, and so drawn groundless inferences. Blochmann points out, p. 520, that the Ma\u2018\u0101\u015firu-l-um\u0101r\u0101 says the prisoners were afterwards put to death. The passage is at vol. ii, p. 632. It says they were put to death by Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u2019s orders by \u2018Abdu-llah (who certainly was brute enough for anything). Jah\u0101ng\u012br, T\u016bzuk, p. 112, mentions the arrival of Usman\u2019s sons and brothers at Court, so that Blochmann\u2019s statement at p. 520 about their being executed on the road is not correct. It appears, too, they came to Court after Shajarat\u2019s death. Jah\u0101ng\u012br says (T\u016bzuk, p. 112) he made over the prisoners to responsible servants of government. \u2018Abdu-llah may have been one of these, and\npossession of that one of evil fortune, took with him Wali and the other Afghans, and on Monday, the 6th of the month of Safar, came to Jah\u0101ngirnagar (Dacca) and joined Isl\u0101m Kh\u0101n. When the joyful news reached in Agra this supplicant at the throne of Allah, he performed the prostrations of gratitude, and recognized that the driving away of this description of enemy was brought about simply through the unstinted mercy of the Almighty Giver. As a reward for this good service I promoted Isl\u0101m Kh\u0101n to the rank of 6,000 personal, and honoured Shaj\u0101'at Kh\u0101n with the title of \u201cRustam of the age\u201d (Rustam-zam\u0101n), as well as increased his rank by 1,000 personal and horse. I also increased the rank of other servants according to the measure of their services, and they were selected for other honours.\n\nWhen this news first came of the killing of \u2018U\u1e63m\u0101n it appeared to be a joke, but by way of ascertaining the truth or falsehood of the words I took an omen from the div\u0101n of the tongue of the unseen world, Khw\u0101ja H\u0101fi\u1e93 of Shiraz, and this ghazal turned up:\n\n\u201cI make my eyes red and throw patience to the wilds,\nAnd in such a case throw my heart into the sea.\nI\u2019m wounded by the shaft of heaven:\nGive wine, so that intoxicated I may cast a knot in the girdle of the Twins.\u201d\n\nhave got rid of his prisoners by killing them. It would appear that the battle with \u2018U\u1e63m\u0101n took place to the east or south-east of Dacca, and not near Orissa, as Stewart supposed.\n\n1 The lines occur in H\u0101fi\u1e93\u2019 div\u0101n, under the letter M, Brockhaus\u2019 ed., No. 396, but Jah\u0101ngir has missed out two lines in his quotation. An Indian lithograph has rakht in the first line instead of sabr, but the latter reading occurs in Brockhaus. In the fourth line nargis is a mistake for tirk\u0101sh. T\u012br-i-falak, \u2018the arrow of the spheres,\u2019 is also a name for the planet Mercury. Tirk\u0101sh-i-Jauz\u0101 means both a particular constellation in the sign Gemini, which is supposed to resemble a quiver in appearance, and also the strings of a musical instrument. The meaning of the lines seems to be, \u201cI have been wounded by the shaft of heaven: give me wine that I may become intoxicated and be able to tie a knot in the quiver-girdle of the Gemini.\u201d The appositeness of the fal is not very apparent, but the mention of an arrow was taken to be an allusion to the death of \u2018U\u1e63m\u0101n by a shot from an unknown hand.\nAs this couplet was very appropriate to the occasion, I drew an omen from it. After some days news came again that the arrow of Fate, or rather of God, had struck \u2018U\u1e63m\u0101n, for however much they enquired for him, he who fired the shot was not made manifest. This has been recorded on account of its strange nature.\n\nOn the 16th Farvard\u012bn, Muqarrab Kh\u0101n, who is one of my chief retainers and the old confidants of the Jahangiri service, who had attained the rank of 3,000 personal and 2,000 horse, came from the fort of Cambay and had the honour of waiting on me. I had ordered him, on account of certain business, to go to the port of Goa\\(^1\\) and buy for the private use of the government certain rareties procurable there. According to orders he went with diligence to Goa, and remaining there for some time, took at the price the Franks asked for them the rareties he met with at that port, without looking at the face of the money at all (i.e. regardless of cost). When he returned from the aforesaid port to the Court, he produced before me one by one the things and rareties he had brought. Among these were some animals that were very strange and wonderful, such as I had never seen, and up to this time no one had known their names. Although King B\u0101bar has described in his Memoirs the appearance and shapes of several animals, he had never ordered the painters to make pictures of them. As these animals appeared to me to be very strange, I both described them and ordered that painters should draw them in the Jah\u0101ng\u012br-n\u0101ma, so that the amazement that arose from hearing of them might be increased. One of these animals in body is larger than a peahen and smaller than a peacock.\\(^2\\)\n\n\\(^1\\) Elliot, vi, 331.\n\n\\(^2\\) They call this in the English language a turkey, and the people of India call it p\u012br\u016b; Persian-knowing Indians call it in Persian f\u012blmurgh.\\(^1\\) They are now plentiful in India. (Note of Sayyid Al\u012bmad.)\nit is in heat and displays itself, it spreads out its feathers like the peacock and dances about. Its beak and legs are like those of a cock. Its head and neck and the part under the throat are every minute of a different colour. When it is in heat it is quite red\u2014one might say it had adorned itself with red coral\u2014and after a while it becomes white in the same places, and looks like cotton. It sometimes looks of a turquoise colour. Like a chameleon it constantly changes colour. Two pieces of flesh it has on its head look like the comb of a cock. A strange thing is this, that when it is in heat the aforesaid piece of flesh hangs down to the length of a span from the top of its head like an elephant's trunk, and again when he raises it up it appears on its head like the horn of a rhinoceros, to the extent of two finger-breadths. Round its eyes it is always of a turquoise colour, and does not change. Its feathers appear to be of various colours, differing from the colours of the peacock's feathers. He also brought a monkey of a strange and wonderful form. Its hands, feet, ears, and head are like those of a monkey, and its face like that of a fox. The colour of its eyes is like that of a hawk's eye, but the eyes are larger than those of a hawk. From its head to the end of its tail it is an ordinary cubit in length. It is lower than a monkey and taller than a fox. Its hair is like the wool of a sheep and its colour like that of ashes. From the lobe of its ear to its chin it is red and of the colour of wine. Its tail is two or three finger-breadths longer than half a cubit, quite different from that of other monkeys. The tail of this animal hangs down like the tail of a cat. Sometimes it makes a sound like a young antelope. On the whole it is a very strange beast. Of the wild birds which they call *tadr\u016b* (pheasant) till now it has never been heard that they breed in captivity. In the time of my revered father they made great efforts to obtain eggs and young ones but it was\nnot managed. I ordered them to keep some of them, male and female, in one place, and by degrees they bred. I ordered them to place the eggs under hens, and in a space of two years sixty or seventy young were produced and fifty or sixty grew up. Whoever heard of this matter was astonished. It was said that in the Wil\u0101yat (Persia?) the people there had made great efforts, but no eggs were produced and no young were obtained.\n\nIn these days I increased the mansab of Mah\u0101bat Kh\u0101n by 1,000 personal and 500 horse, which thus became 4,000 personal and 3,500 horse. The mansab of I'tim\u0101du-d-daulah, original and increased, was fixed at 4,000 personal and 1,000 horse. To the mansab of Mah\u0101 Singh also an increase of 500 personal and horse was given: it was originally and with increase 3,000 personal and 2,000 horse. The mansab of I'tiq\u0101d Kh\u0101n was increased by 500 personal and 200 horse, and made up to 1,000 personal and 300 horse. Khw\u0101ja Ab\u016b-l-\u1e25asan in these days came from the Deccan and waited on me. Daulat Kh\u0101n, who had been appointed to the faujdarship of Allahabad and of the Sarkar of Jaunpur, came and paid his respects: an increase of 500 was made to his mansab, which was 1,000. On the day of culmination (r\u016bz-i-sharaf), which was the 19th Farward\u012bn, I raised the mansab of Sult\u0101n Khurr\u0101m, which was 10,000, to 12,000, and made that of I'tib\u0101r Kh\u0101n, which was 3,000 personal and 1,000 horse, up to 4,000. I raised the mansab of Muqarrab Kh\u0101n from 2,000 personal and 1,000 horse by 500 personal and horse; and increased that of Khw\u0101ja Jah\u0101n, which was 2,000 personal and 1,200 horse, by 500. As these were the days of the New Year, many of the servants (of the State) obtained an increase of their mansabs. On the same day Dulip came from the Deccan and waited on me. As his father R\u0101y R\u0101y Singh had died, I honoured him with the title of R\u0101y and clothed him in a dress of honour. R\u0101y R\u0101y Singh had another son, by\nname S\u016braj Singh. Although Dul\u012bp was his \u1e6d\u012bk\u0101 (marked with the \u1e6d\u012bk\u0101) son, he wished S\u016braj Singh to succeed him, in consequence of the love that he bore to his mother. When the circumstances of his death were reported to me, S\u016braj Singh, in consequence of his want of intelligence and tender years, represented to me: \u201cMy father has made me his successor and given me the \u1e6d\u012bk\u0101.\u201d This remark was not to my liking, and I said: \u201cIf thy father has given the \u1e6d\u012bk\u0101 to thee, we shall give it to Dul\u012bp.\u201d Then marking the \u1e6d\u012bk\u0101 with my own hand, I presented the latter with his father\u2019s jagir and hereditary possessions. I bestowed on I\u2019tim\u0101du-d-daulah an inkstand and jewelled pen.\n\nR\u016bdar, the father of Lakhm\u012b Chand, Raja of Kumaon, who is one of the considerable Rajas of the hill country, had come in the time of the late King Akbar,\u00b9 and when he came had petitioned\u00b2 that the son of R\u0101ja Todar Mal might take him by the hand and bring him to wait on him. In consequence, the Raja\u2019s (Todar Mal\u2019s) son had been appointed to bring him. Lakhm\u012b Chand now similarly asked that the son of I\u2019tim\u0101du-d-daulah might bring him to pay his respects. I sent Sh\u0101pur\u00b3 to bring him to wait on me. He laid before me rare things from his own hill country, such as g\u0101nth ponies, and birds of prey, such as hawks, jurra (falcons), royal falcons, qat\u0101s (yaks), navels of musk, and skins of the musk antelope with the musk-bags on them, swords which in their language they call kh\u0101nd\u0101, and daggers which they call kat\u0101r, and all kinds of things. Amongst the Rajas of this hill country this Raja is well known for the large quantities of gold he has. They say there is a gold-mine in his territory.\u2074\n\n\u00b9 Akbar-n\u0101ma, iii, 533. It was in the 33rd year.\n\u00b2 He asked Todar Mal\u2019s protection, but the son was sent (Akbar-n\u0101ma, iii, 533).\n\u00b3 This name is not in all the MSS. It is another name for I\u2019tiq\u0101d, son of I\u2019tim\u0101du-d-daulah.\n\u2074 Blochmann, p. 508.\nIn order to lay the foundation of a palace at Lahore, I sent there Khw\u0101ja Jah\u0101n Khw\u0101ja D\u016bst Mu\u1e25ammad, who is well skilled in this kind of business.\n\nAs the affairs of the Deccan, in consequence of the disagreements among the Sardars and the carelessness of Kh\u0101n A'\u1e93am, did not look well, and the defeat of \u2018Abdu-llah Kh\u0101n had taken place, I had sent for Khw\u0101ja Abu-l-hasan to make enquiries into the real state of these quarrels. After much enquiry and investigation it became clear that the defeat of \u2018Abdu-llah Kh\u0101n had been caused by his pride and his sharp temper, and not listening to words (of advice), and partly by the quarrels and want of agreement between the Amirs. Briefly, it had been determined that \u2018Abdu-llah Kh\u0101n should start from the direction of N\u0101sik and Trimbak with the Gujarat army and the Amirs who had been appointed to accompany him. This army had been brought into proper order by trustworthy leaders and zealous Amirs, such as R\u0101ja R\u0101m D\u0101s, Kh\u0101n A'lam, Saif Kh\u0101n, \u2018Al\u012b Mard\u0101n Bah\u0101dur, \u017bafar Kh\u0101n, and other servants of the State. The number of the army had passed 10,000 and come up to near 14,000. On the side of Berar it was settled that R\u0101ja M\u0101n Singh, Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n, the Amiru-l-umar\u0101, and many other leaders should proceed. These two armies should be aware of each other\u2019s marches and halts, so that on an appointed day they might catch the enemy between the two. If this rule had been observed and their hearts had been in unison, and self-interest had not come between, it is most probable that Almighty God would have given them the victory of the day. When \u2018Abdu-llah Kh\u0101n passed the Ghats, and entered the enemy\u2019s country, he did not take care to send runners (q\u0101\u1e63id\u0101n) to bring intelligence from the other army, nor did he, in accordance with the arrangements, make his movements harmonise with theirs, so that on an appointed day they might take the enemy between two armies. Rather he relied on his own strength,\nand considered that if he could gain the victory alone it would be better. This idea fixed itself in his mind, and however much R\u0101m D\u0101s desired him to promise to go forward with due deliberation, it was of no use. The enemy, who were observing him closely, had sent a large number of leaders and Bargis (Mahrattas) against him, and encounters took place with them every day. They did not fail to throw rockets and different fireworks at night. At last the enemy drew near, and yet he obtained no intelligence about the other army, though he had approached Daulatabad, which was the place of assembly of the Dakhanis. \u2018Ambar, the black-faced, had raised to sovereignty a child who, in his opinion, bore relationship to the family of Niz\u0101mu-l-mulk. In order that men might fully accept his (the child\u2019s) sovereignty, he raised him up and took him by the hand, and made himself the Peshwa and leader. He sent men again and again (against \u2018Abdu-llah), and the number of the enemy was continually increasing till at last they made an attack, and by throwing rockets and other fireworks made matters hot for him.\\(^1\\) At length the loyalists thought it best, as no assistance had come to them from the other army and all the Dakhanis had turned against them, to retreat at once and try some other arrangement. All agreed, and with one consent started off before dawn. The Dakhanis followed them to the boundaries of their own country, and the two armies, meeting every day, did not fail in fighting. In these days several of the ambitious and zealous young men were killed. \u2018Al\u012b Mard\u0101n Kh\u0101n Bah\u0101dur, behaving like a brave man, carried away terrible wounds and fell into the hands of the enemy, and showed his companions an example of fidelity to his salt and of life-sacrifice. Z\u016b-l-faq\u0101r Beg also displayed manly actions, and a rocket struck him on\n\n\\(^1\\) Elliot, vi, 333.\nthe leg, and two days afterwards he died. When they entered the country of R\u0101ja Bharj\u016b,\u00b9 who was one of those loyal to the throne, that body (the enemy) turned back, and \u2018Abdu-llah Kh\u0101n proceeded towards Gujarat. The real truth is this, that if in going he had drawn his rein (gone slowly) and allowed the other army to have come up to him, the matter would have turned out according to the wish of the chief men of the victorious State.\u00b2 As soon as the news of the retreat of \u2018Abdu-llah Kh\u0101n reached the leaders of the army that was advancing from Berar, not seeing any advantage from further stay, they also retired, and joined the camp of Parwiz at \u2018\u0100dil\u0101b\u0101d in the neighbourhood of Burhanpur. When this intelligence reached me at Agra I was greatly agitated, and proposed to go there myself and destroy root and branch those servants who had become masters. The Amirs and other devoted ones would in no way consent to this. Khw\u0101ja Ab\u016b-l-\u1e25asan represented that as no one understood the business of that region as the Khankhanan did I ought to send him, and that he should again arrange matters that had fallen into disorder, and according to the exigencies of the time should compose differences so that affairs might return to their original condition. Other well-wishers being consulted, all their opinions were at one in this, that the Khankhanan must be sent and that Khw\u0101ja Ab\u016b-l-\u1e25asan should accompany him. Agreeing with this determination, those who had charge of the affairs of the Khankhanan and his companions obtained leave to go on Sunday, the 17th Urdibihisht, in the 7th year. Sh\u0101h-naw\u0101z Kh\u0101n, Khw\u0101ja Ab\u016b-l-\u1e25asan, Razz\u0101q-bird\u012b \u00dczbeg, and several others of his associates paid their parting salutations on the same day. The Khankhanan was promoted to the rank of 6,000 personal, Sh\u0101h-naw\u0101z Kh\u0101n\n\n\u00b9 R\u0101ja of Bagl\u0101na.\n\u00b2 A periphrasis for Jah\u0101ng\u012br himself.\nto that of 3,000 and horse, that of D\u0101r\u0101b Kh\u0101n increased by 500 personal and 300 horse (altogether 2,000 personal and 1,500 horse), and to Rahman-d\u0101d, his (the Khankhanan\u2019s) younger son, I also gave a fitting mansab. I presented the Khankhanan with a grand dress of honour, a jewelled dagger, a special elephant with tal\u0101yir (accoutrements), and an Iraq horse. In the same way I bestowed on his sons and companions dresses of honour and horses. In the same month Mu\u2019izzu-l-mulk came from Kabul with his sons, and had the good fortune to kiss the threshold. Shy\u0101m Singh and R\u0101y Mangat Bhadauriya, who belonged to the army of Bangash, according to the request of Qilij Kh\u0101n, were promoted to higher mansabs. Shy\u0101m Singh had 1,500 personal and was increased by 500, and R\u0101y Mangat was also raised to a higher rank.\n\nFor a long time past news had come of the illness of \u0100\u1e63af Kh\u0101n; sometimes the disease was got under and sometimes recurred, until he died at Burhanpur in the 63rd year of his age. His understanding and capacity were very good. He was very quick-witted. He also wrote poetry. He composed \u201cKhusrau and Sh\u012br\u012bn,\u201d dedicating it to me, and called it the \u201cN\u016br-n\u0101ma\u201d (the writing of light).\u00b9 He had been ennobled in the time of my revered father and made Vizier. In the days when I was a prince he had several times done foolish things, and most men, and indeed Khusrau himself, were of opinion that after my accession I would do unpleasant things (with regard to him). In a manner contrary to what had entered the minds of himself and others, I favoured him and promoted him to the rank of 5,000 personal and horse, and after he had for some time been Vizier with full authority, neglected no point in increasing favour towards him. After his death I gave mansabs to his sons and bestowed kindnesses on them. At last\n\n\u00b9 The history of N\u016br, i.e. the history of N\u016bru-d-d\u012bn Jah\u0101ng\u012br.\nit was clear that his disposition and sincerity were not as they should be, and, considering his own evil deeds, he had always been suspicious with regard to me. They say he was aware of the conspiracy and disturbance that took place on the Kabul expedition, and had given support to the wretches. Indeed, I had no confidence that notwithstanding my favour and kindness to him he was not disloyal and of perverse fortune.\n\nAfter a short space of time, on the 25th of the same month of Urdibihisht, the news of Mirz\u0101 Gh\u0101zi\u2019s death arrived. The said Mirz\u0101 was of the ruling family of Thatta (Tatta), of the tribe of Tarkh\u0101n\u012b. His father, Mirz\u0101 J\u0101n\u012b, in the time of my revered father became loyal, and with the Khankhanan, who had been appointed to his province, he had the good fortune to have the honour of waiting on Akbar near Lahore. By the royal favour he was given his own province, and, choosing himself to serve at Court, he sent his men to the charge and administration of Thatta, and remained in the service while he lived. At last he died at Burhanpur. Mirz\u0101 Gh\u0101zi Kh\u0101n, his son, who was at Thatta, in accordance with the firman of the late king obtained the government of that country. Sa\u2018id Kh\u0101n, who was at Bhakar (Bukkur), received an order to console him and bring him to Court. The aforesaid Khan sent men to him to recommend loyalty to him. At last, having brought him to Agra, he procured him the honour of kissing the feet of my revered father. He was at Agra when my father died and I ascended the throne. After I arrived at Lahore for the pursuit of Khusrau news came that the Amirs on the borders of Khurasan had assembled together and proceeded against Qandahar, and that Sh\u0101h Beg, the governor of that place, was shut up in the fort and looking out for assistance. Of necessity an army was appointed for the relief of Qandahar under the leadership of Mirz\u0101 Gh\u0101zi and other Amirs and generals. When this army reached the\nneighbourhood of Qandahar, the army of Khurasan, not seeing in themselves the power to await it, returned. Mirz\u0101 Gh\u0101zi, having entered Qandahar, handed over the country and the fort to Sard\u0101r Kh\u0101n, who had been appointed to the government of the place, and Sh\u0101h Beg went to his own jagir. Mirz\u0101 Gh\u0101zi started for Lahore by way of Bhakar. Sard\u0101r Kh\u0101n was only a short time at Qandahar before he died, and that province was again in need of a leader and master. This time I added Qandahar to Thatta and handed it over to Mirz\u0101 Gh\u0101zi. From that time till his death he remained there continuously in performance of the duties of its protection and government. His conduct towards the disaffected was excellent. As it was necessary to send a leader to Qandahar in the place of Mirz\u0101 Gh\u0101zi, I appointed Ab\u016b-l-b\u012b \u016azbeg,\\(^1\\) who was at Multan and in that neighbourhood, to that post. I promoted him in rank from 1,500 personal and 1,000 horse to 3,000 personal and horse, and honoured him with the title of Bah\u0101dur Kh\u0101n and a standard. The governorship of Delhi and the protection and administration of that province was conferred on Muqarrab Kh\u0101n. I dignified R\u016bp Khaw\u0101\u1e63\u1e63, who was one of the personal servants of my revered father, with the title of Khaw\u0101\u1e63\u1e63 Kh\u0101n, and, giving him the rank of 1,000 personal and 500 horse, bestowed on him the faujdarship of the Sarkar of Qanuj. As I had sought the daughter\\(^2\\) of Itiq\u0101d Kh\u0101n, son of Itim\u0101du-d-daulah, in marriage for Khurr\u0101m, and the marriage\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Should be Ab\u016b-n-nab\u012b. See infra.\n\n\\(^2\\) This was Arjumand B\u0101n\u016b or Mumt\u0101z-mahall, the favourite wife of Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n and the mother of fourteen of his children. She was the niece of N\u016br-Jah\u0101n, her father being N\u016br-Jah\u0101n\u2019s brother, the \u0100\u1e63af Kh\u0101n IV and Ab\u016b-l-\u1e25asan of Beale, who also had the names of Itiq\u0101d Kh\u0101n and Yaminu-d-daulah. There is an account of the betrothal and wedding in the P\u0101dsh\u0101h-n\u0101ma, i, 388. It seems that the betrothal took place five years and three months before the marriage, and when Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n was 15 years old. At the time of the marriage Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n was\nfestival had been arranged for, I went on Thursday, 18th Kh\u016brd\u0101d, to his house, and stayed there one day and one night. He (Khurram) presented offerings (to me) and he gave jewels\\(^1\\) to the Begams, and to his mothers (including stepmothers) and to the female servants of the harem, and dresses of honour to the Amirs.\n\nI sent \u2018Abdu-r-Razz\u0101q, the bakhshi of the palace (darkh\u0101na), to settle the country of Thatta (Sind) until a Sardar should be appointed who could conciliate the soldiery and the cultivators, and so bring the province into order. I increased his rank and presented him with an elephant and a shawl (parmnarm), and sent him off. I made Mu\u2018izzu-l-mulk bakhshi in his room. Khw\u0101ja Jah\u0101n; who had been sent to inspect the buildings in Lahore and to arrange about them, came in the end of this month and waited on me. Mirz\u0101 \u012as\u0101 Tarkh\u0101n, one of the relations of Mirz\u0101 Gh\u0101zi, had been appointed to the army of the Deccan. I sent for him to arrange about the business of Thatta, and on the same day he had the good fortune to pay his respects. As he was deserving of favour, he was given the rank of 1,000 personal and 500 horse. The disease\n\n20 years and 3 months old and Arjumand B\u0101n\u016b was 19 years and 1 month. 18th Kh\u016brd\u0101d, 1021, would correspond to about the end of May, 1612, but the P\u0101dsh\u0101h-n\u0101ma gives the eve of Friday, 9th Rab\u012b\u2018-u-l-awwal of 1021, corresponding to 22nd Urdibihisht, as the day of the marriage. This would correspond to 30th April, 1612, so that apparently Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u2019s visit to the house (apparently I\u2018tim\u0101du-d-daulah\u2019s, but possibly Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n\u2019s) took place about a month after the marriage. Arjumand B\u0101n\u016b died in childbirth at Burhanpur in 1040, or July, 1631, the chronogram being one word, viz. gham, \u2018grief.\u2019 She must have been born in 1591, and was in her 40th year when she died. She was not Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n\u2019s first wife, for he was married to the daughter of Muzaffar Husain \u015eafawi, a descendant of Sh\u0101h Isma\u2018il of Persia, in September, 1610 (Rajab, 1019), but the betrothal to Arjumand was earlier than this. It was in Arjumand\u2019s honour that the T\u0101j was built.\n\n\\(^1\\) T\u00fcrh\u0101. The corresponding passage in the Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, p. 67, last line, shows that jewels are meant. The text omits the preposition ba before Begam\u0101n.\nof kh\u016bn-p\u0101ra had affected my health. By the advice of the physicians on Wednesday, the (date not given) of the said month, I drew about a sir (\u0101s\u0101r) of blood from my left arm. As great lightness resulted, it occurred to me that if they were to call blood-letting 'lightening' it would be well. Nowadays this expression is made use of. To Muqarrab Kh\u0101n, who had bled me, I gave a jewelled khaqwa (dagger). Kishan D\u0101s, accountant of the elephant department and stable, who from the time of the late king until now has been the clerk in charge of two departments, and for ages had been hopeful of the title of Raja and the rank of 1,000 personal, and before this had been gratified with a title, now had the rank of 1,000 conferred on him. Mirz\u0101 Rustam, son of Sult\u0101n Husain Mirz\u0101 Safaw\u012b, who had been appointed to the army of the Deccan, I sent for at his request. On Saturday, the 9th of the month of Tir, he came with his sons and waited on me. He made an offering of a ruby and forty-six royal pearls. I increased the rank of T\u0101j Kh\u0101n, the governor of Bhakar, who was one of the old Amirs of this State, by 500 personal and horse.\n\nThe tale of the death of Shaj\u0101'at Kh\u0101n is a very strange affair. After he had performed such services and Isl\u0101m Kh\u0101n had given him leave to go to the Sarkar of Orissa, one night on the road he was riding on a female elephant chaukand\u012b-d\u0101r (?in a square howdah or four-pillared canopy), and had given a young eunuch a place behind him. When he left his camp they had\n\n---\n\n1 Kh\u016bn-p\u0101ra, 'congestion of blood'; p\u0101ra or b\u0101ra is used to mean a collection or gathering. See Ma'\u0101\u0161iru-l-um\u0101r\u012b, ii, 221, where we have b\u0101ra ya'ni jam'i. Erskine, in spite of his MS., reads ch\u016bn p\u0101ra and translates 'as quicksilver.'\n\n2 \u0100s\u0101r, which, according to Forbes, is a sir weight.\n\n3 Perhaps it was only what is called a ch\u0101r-j\u0101ma and not an enclosed howdah.\nfastened up an elephant that was in heat on the road. From the noise of the horses' hoofs and the movement of the horsemen he attempted to break his chain. On this account a great noise and confusion took place. When this noise reached the ear of the eunuch, he in a state of bewilderment awoke Shaj\u0101\u2018at Kh\u0101n, who was asleep or in the insensibility of wine, and said: \"An elephant in heat has got loose and is coming in this direction.\" As soon as he heard this he became confused and threw himself down from the front of the chaukandi. When he threw himself off his toe struck against a stone and was torn open, and he died in two or three days of that same wound. In short, from hearing this affair I was completely bewildered. That a brave man on the mere hearing of a cry or a word coming from a child should become so confused and throw himself down without control from the top of an elephant is in truth a matter of amazement. The news of this event reached me on the 19th of the month of Tir. I consoled his sons with kindnesses and the conferring of offices. If this accident had not happened to him, as he had done notable service, he would have obtained exaltation with greater favours and kindnesses.\n\n\"One cannot strive against destiny.\"\n\nIsl\u0101m Kh\u0101n had sent 160 male and female elephants from Bengal; they were brought before me and placed in my private elephant stables. R\u0101ja Tekchand, the Raja of Kumaon, asked for leave to depart. As in the time of my father there had been given to his father 100 horses, I gave him the same number as well as an elephant, and while he was at Court bestowed on him dresses of honour and a jewelled dagger. Also to his brothers I gave dresses of honour and horses. I presented him with his territory according to previous arrangements, and he went back to his home happy and successful.\nIt happened incidentally that this verse of the Am\u012bru-l-um\u0101r\u0101 was quoted:\n\n\"Pass, O Messiah, o'er the heads of us slain by love;\nThy restoring one life is worth a hundred murders.\"  \n\nAs I have a poetical disposition I sometimes intentionally and sometimes involuntarily compose couplets and quatrains. So the following couplet came into my head:\n\n\"Turn not thy cheek, without thee I cannot live a moment;\nFor thee to break one heart is equal a hundred murders.\"\n\nWhen I had recited this, everyone who had a poetical vein composed a couplet in the same mode. Mull\u0101 \u2018Al\u012b Al\u1e25mad,\u00b2 the seal-engraver, of whom an account has been given previously, had not said badly\u2014\n\n\"O Censor, fear the weeping of the old vintner;\nThy breaking one jar is equal to a hundred murders.\"\n\nAb\u016b-l-fa\u1e6d\u1e25 Dakh\u0101n\u012b,\u00b3 who was one of the most considerable of \u2018\u0100dil Kh\u0101n\u2019s Amirs, and had two years previously taken to being loyal and had entered himself among the leaders of the victorious army, on the 10th\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 The reference is to the Messiah as the restorer to life by His breath. For bayuzar, \u2018pass by,\u2019 Erskine had in his MS. maguzar, \u2018pass not.\u2019 Apparently the verse means that it is more meritorious for the Messiah to restore one man to life than it is for another to slay a hundred infidels.\n\n\u00b2 \u2018Al\u012b Al\u1e25mad died suddenly two years before this, unless indeed the passage at p. 169 refers to the mimic and not to \u2018Al\u012b Al\u1e25mad. Probably the meaning is that \u2018Al\u012b Al\u1e25mad had made this couplet on some previous occasion, and that one of the courtiers now quoted it. His verse about the hundred murders may contain a play on the word kh\u016bn, \u2018blood,\u2019 and refer to the spilling of the blood-like wine. It is difficult to understand how Jah\u0101ng\u012br came to introduce the verse into his Memoirs here. It does not seem to have any connection with the account of the Raja of Kumaon. Jah\u0101ng\u012br says it was quoted \u2018incidentally,\u2019 b\u0101 taqarrub\u012b. Perhaps the word here means \u2018by way of parody,\u2019 or \u2018by way of paraphrase.\u2019 In the MS. used by Erskine the words of the first line seem to be Maq\u016bz\u0101r Mas\u012bh bar sar-i-m\u0101, and so Erskine translates \u201cPass not, O Messiah, over the heads of us victims of love.\u201d Perhaps maguzar means \u2018do not pass by.\u2019\n\n\u00b3 This is the Dakh\u0101n\u012b chief mentioned previously at p. 192.\nof Amurd\u0101d waited on me, and being accepted by my grace and favour had bestowed on him a special sword and a robe of honour, and after some days I also gave him a special horse. Khw\u0101jag\u012b Muhammad \u1e24usain, who had gone to Kashmir as the deputy for his brother's son, when he was satisfied in his mind with the state of affairs of that place, came on the same day and waited on me. As a Sardar was needed to be sent for the governorship of Patna and the rule of that place, it occurred to me to send Mirz\u0101 Rustam. Having raised his rank from 5,000 personal and 1,500 horse to 5,000 personal and horse, on the 26th Jum\u0101d\u0101-s-s\u0101n\u012b, corresponding to the 2nd Shahriwar, I gave him the government of Patna, and bestowing on him a special elephant, a horse with a jewelled saddle, a jewelled sword, and a superb dress of honour, I dismissed him. His sons and the sons of his brother Mu\u1e93affar \u1e24usain Kh\u0101n Mirz\u0101\u02bei were exalted with increased rank, elephants, horses, and dresses of honour, and sent off with him. I appointed R\u0101y Dulip to support Mirz\u0101 Rustam. As his residence was near that place, he collected a good body of men for that service. I increased his rank by 500 personal and horse, so that it became 2,000 with 1,000 horse, and also gave him an elephant. Ab\u016b-l-fa\u1e6d\u1e25 Dakh\u0101n\u012b had obtained a jagir in the Sarkar of Nagpur and that neighbourhood. He was dismissed in order that he might administer his jagir and look to the guarding and government of that country as well. Khusrau Bi \u016azbeg was appointed to the faujdarship of the Sarkar of Mewar. His rank of 800 personal and 300 horse was now increased to 1,000 personal and 500 horse, and I also presented him with a horse. As I had my eye on the old service of Muqarrab Kh\u0101n, it occurred to me that I must not pass by the desire of his heart. I had\n\n---\n\n1 Blochmann, p. 485. He acted in Kashmir for his brother H\u0101shim.\nincreased his rank and he had obtained good jagirs, but he longed for a standard and drums, and he was now honoured with these as well. \u0160\u0101l\u012bh, the adopted son of Khw\u0101ja Beg-M\u012brz\u0101 \u0160afaw\u012b, was a youth of great bravery and zeal. I gave him the title of Khanjar Kh\u0101n, and made him eager in the service.\n\nOn Thursday, the 22nd Shahr\u012bwar, corresponding with 17th Rajab, 1021, the feast of my solar weighing took place in the house of Maryam-zam\u0101n\u012b. It is an approved custom with me to weigh myself in this manner. The late king Akbar, who was the place of manifestation of kindness and grace, also approved of the custom, and twice in every year weighed himself against several sorts of metals, gold, silver, and many precious articles, once according to the solar and once according to the lunar year, and divided their total value, which was worth about a lakh of rupees, among faqirs and needy people. I also observe this annual custom and weigh myself in the same manner, and give those valuables to faqirs. Mu\u2019taqid Kh\u0101n, Diwan of Bengal, who had been relieved from that service, produced before me the sons and brothers and some of the servants of \u2018U\u1e63m\u0101n, whom Isl\u0101m Kh\u0101n had sent with him to the Court. The charge of each one of the Afghans was entrusted to a responsible servant. Then he (Mu\u2019taqid) produced his own offering, which consisted of twenty-five elephants, two rubies, a jewelled ph\u016bl kat\u0101ra\u00b9 (a kind of dagger), trustworthy eunuchs, Bengal stuffs, etc. Mir Mir\u0101n, son of Sult\u0101n Khw\u0101ja, who was in the Deccan army, obtained the honour of kissing the threshold and gave a ruby as an offering. As between Qil\u012bj Kh\u0101n, leader of the army of Bangash\n\n\u00b9 The kat\u0101ra was a long, narrow dagger. See Blochmann\u2019s \u0100y\u012bn, pl. xli, fig. 9. But the word ph\u016bl (flower) is obscure. Perhaps it means the knot or crochet of jewels called by Chardin, iv, 164, ed. Rouen, \u201cune enseigne ronde de pierreries,\u201d and which, he says, the Persians called \u2018rose de Poignard.\u2019\non the borders of Kabul, and the Amirs of that Subah; who had been sent as companions to him under his leadership, there were quarrels, especially with Kh\u0101n Daur\u0101n, I sent Khw\u0101ja Jah\u0101n to make enquiry as to which side was in fault. On the 11th of the month of Mihr, Mu\u2019taqid Kh\u0101n was appointed to the high dignity of bakhshi, and his mansab was raised to 1,000 personal and 300 horse. Raising for the second time the mansabs of Muqarrab Kh\u0101n a little, I made it 2,500 personal and 1,500 horse by an increase of 500. On the representation of the Khankhanan, Far\u012bd\u016bn Kh\u0101n Barl\u0101s was raised to the mansab, original and increase, of 2,500 personal and 2,000 horse. R\u0101y Manohar received that of 1,000 personal and 800 horse, and R\u0101ja B\u012br Singh Deo that of 4,000 personal and 2,200 horse. Bh\u0101rat, grandson of R\u0101mchand Bandilah, I, after the latter\u2019s death, honoured with the title of Raja. On the 28th \u0100b\u0101n, Zafar Kh\u0101n, having come according to summons from the Subah of Gujarat, waited on me. He brought as offerings a ruby and three pearls. On the 6th \u0100zar, corresponding with the 3rd Shaww\u0101l, news came from Burhanpur that the Amiru-l-umar\u0101 had died on Sunday, the 27th \u0100b\u0101n, in the parganah of Nih\u0101lp\u016br. After the illness he had at Lahore his intelligence appeared to be less, and a great loss of memory happened to him. He was very sincere. It is sad that he left no son capable of patronage and favour. Chin Qilij Kh\u0101n came from his father, who was at Peshawar, on the 20th \u0100zar, and offered (on his father\u2019s behalf) 100 muhrs and 100 rupees, and also presented the offerings he had of his own in the shape of a horse and cloth stuffs and other things. To the government of Behar I promoted Zafar Kh\u0101n, who is one of the trustworthy house-born ones and foster-children, and increasing his mansab by 500 personal and horse, I made it up to 3,000 personal and 2,000 horse, and also honouring his brothers with robes of honour and horses,\nallowed them to go off to that province. He had always hoped that he might obtain some separate service in order that he might show his natural ability. I also desired to prove him and make this service the touchstone by which to try him. As it was the season for travelling and hunting, on Tuesday, the 2nd Zi-l-qa\u2019d\u0101 (25th December, 1612), corresponding with the 4th Day, I left Agra with the intention of hunting and encamped in the Dahrah garden, remaining there four days. On the 10th of the same month the news came of the death of Salima Sul\u1e6d\u0101n Begam, who had been ill in the city. Her mother was Gul-rukh Begam, daughter of King B\u0101bar, and her father Mirz\u0101 N\u016bru-d-din Mu\u1e25ammad, of the Naqshbandi Khw\u0101jas. She was adorned with all good qualities. In women this degree of skill and capacity is seldom found. H.M. Hum\u0101y\u016bn, by way of kindness (to Bair\u0101m), had betrothed her who was his sister\u2019s daughter to Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n. After his death, in the beginning of the reign of the late king Akbar, the marriage took place. After the said Khan had been killed, my revered father married her himself. She received mercy (died) in the 60th year of her age.\n\nOn the same day I marched from the Dahrah garden and sent I\u2019tim\u0101du-d-daulah to bury her (lit. lift her up), and ordered him to place her in the building in the Mand\u0101kar\n\n---\n\n1 He must have remained more than four days, for he got the news of Salima\u2019s death while in the garden. See infra. Perhaps the date 10th refers to Day and not to Zi-l-qa\u2019d\u0101. The Dahrah garden was in the environs of Agra.\n\n2 This statement is wrong. Salima was 76 when she died, she having been born on 4th Shaww\u0101l, 945, or 23rd February, 1539. She died on or about 10th Zi-l-qa\u2019d\u0101, 1021 (2nd January, 1613), so that she was 73 solar years old. See note in B.M. MS. Or. 171, Rieu, 257a, and an article in J.A.S.B. for 1906. The note is by the author of the T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-Mu\u1e25ammadi and is at 72a of the B.M. MS. Or. 171, and the corresponding passage appears in M.S. Or. 182, on p. 140. The chronogram of Salima\u2019s birth was Kh\u016bsh-h\u0101l, which yields 945. She was about 3\u00bd years older than Akbar.\ngarden which she herself had made. On the 17th of the month of Day, Mirz\u0101 \u2018Ali Beg Akbarsh\u0101hi came from the army of the Deccan and waited on me. Khw\u0101ja Jah\u0101n, whom I had despatched to the Subah of Kabul, returned on the 21st of the same month and waited on me. The time for his going and coming had extended to three months and eleven days. He brought twelve muhrs and twelve rupees as an offering. On the same day R\u0101ja R\u0101m D\u0101s also came from the victorious army of the Deccan and paid his respects, and made an offering of 101 muhrs. As robes of honour for the winter season had not been sent to the Amirs of the Deccan, they were forwarded by the hand of \u1e24ay\u0101t Kh\u0101n. As the port of Surat had been assigned in jagir to Qilij Kh\u0101n, he prayed that Chin Qilij (his son) might be despatched for its guardianship and administration. On the 27th Day he had a dress of honour, and being honoured with a dress of honour and the title of Kh\u0101n, and a standard, obtained leave to go. For the purpose of advising the Amirs of Kabul, and on account of the disagreements that had sprung up between them and Qilij Kh\u0101n, I sent R\u0101ja R\u0101m D\u0101s, and bestowed on him a horse and robe of honour and 30,000 rupees for expenses. On the 6th Bahman, when my camp was in the parganah of B\u0101r\u012b, there came the news of the death of Khw\u0101jagi Mu\u1e25ammad Husain, who was of the ancient servants of this State. His elder brother, Mu\u1e25ammad Q\u0101sim Kh\u0101n, in the time of my revered father, found great favour, and Khw\u0101ja Mu\u1e25ammad Husain as well was one of his confidential servants, and held employments such as that of superintendent of the kitchen (bak\u0101wul) and such like. He left no son and was beardless, and not a single hair of moustache or whiskers appeared on him. At the time of speaking he spoke very shrilly, and was looked upon as an eunuch. Sh\u0101h-naw\u0101z Kh\u0101n, whom the Khankhanan had sent from Burhanpur to make certain representations,\ncame on the 15th of the same month and waited on me. He presented 100 muhrs and 100 rupees. As the affairs of the Deccan, in consequence of the hasty proceedings of 'Abdu-llah Kh\u0101n and the treachery of the Amirs, did not present a good prospect, the Dakhonis obtained an opportunity for speaking and began to talk of peace to the Amirs and well-wishers there. '\u0100dil Kh\u0101n embraced the robe of loyalty, and prayed that if the affairs of the Deccan were entrusted to him he would so arrange that some of the districts which had been taken out of the possession of the officers of the State should be restored. The loyal ones, looking to the necessities of the time, represented this, and a settlement of some kind was arrived at, and the Khankhanan undertook to settle matters. The Kh\u0101n A'\u1e93am was also desirous of putting down the rebel R\u0101n\u0101, and begged for this service by way of obtaining merit (as a gh\u0101zi). He was ordered to go to Malwa, which was his jagir, and after arranging matters there to take up this duty. The mansab of Ab\u016b-l-bi \u00dczbeg\\(^1\\) was increased by 1,000 personal and 500 horse to 4,000 personal and 3,500 horse. My hunting went on for 2 months and 20 days, and during that time I went out every day to hunt. As not more than 50 or 60 days remained before the world-illumining New Year, I returned, and on the 24th Isfandiy\u0101r encamped in the Dahrah garden. The courtiers and some of the mansabdars, who by order had remained in the city, came on that day and waited on me. Muqarrab Kh\u0101n presented a decorated jar, Frank hats, and a jewelled sparrow (?). I remained three days in the garden, and on the 27th Isfandiy\u0101r entered the city. During this time\\(^2\\) 223 head of deer, etc., 95 nilgaw, 2 boars, 36 cranes (or herons), etc., and 1,457 fish were killed.\n\n\\(^1\\) The real name appears to be Ab\u016b-n-nab\u012b. He had the title of Bah\u0101dur Kh\u0101n. See Ma'\u0101\u0161iru-l-umar\u0101, i, 400. In the Akbar-n\u0101ma, iii, 820 and 839, he is called Ab\u016b-l-baq\u0101.\n\n\\(^2\\) This must refer to the 2 months and 20 days of hunting.\nThe Eighth New Year after the Auspicious Accession.\n\nThe eighth year after my accession, corresponding with Muharram, 1022. On the night of Thursday, the 27th Muharram, corresponding with the 1st Farwardin in the eighth year after my accession, after $3\\frac{1}{2}$ gharis of day had elapsed, his honour the sun passed from the constellation of Pisces to that of Aries, which is his abode of rejoicing and victory. Early in the morning of the New Year's Day the feast was prepared and adorned after the custom of every year. At the end of that day I sat on the throne of State, and the Amirs and ministers of the State and the courtiers of the palace came to salute and congratulate me. On these days of happy augury I sat the whole day in the public audience hall. Those who had anything to ask or claim presented their petitions, and the offerings of the servants of the palace were laid before me. Ab\u016b-l-b\u012b, governor of Qandahar, had sent for an offering Iraq horses and hunting dogs, and they were brought before me. On the 9th of the same month Af\u1e93al Kh\u0101n came from the Subah of Behar, and in waiting on me presented 100 muhrs and 100 rupees, as well as an elephant. On the 12th the offering of I\u02bftim\u0101du-d-daulah was laid before me, consisting of jewels, cloths, and other things. That which pleased me attained to the dignity of acceptance. Of the elephants of Af\u1e93al Kh\u0101n's offering ten others were inspected on this day. On the 13th the offerings of Tarbiyat Kh\u0101n were laid before me. Mu\u02bftaqid Kh\u0101n bought a house at Agra, and passed some days in that place. Misfortunes happened to him one after another. We have heard that prosperity and bad luck depend on four things: first, upon your wife; second, upon your slave; third, upon your house; fourth, upon your horse. In order to know the prosperity or ill-luck of a house a rule has been established, indeed they\nsay it is infallible. One must clear a small piece of the site from earth, and again strew the earth upon the same ground. If it cover it, one may call it middling good fortune for that house, neither prosperity nor misfortune; if it become less (i.e. does not cover it exactly) it points to ill-luck, and if it does more (than cover it) it is fortunate and auspicious. On the 14th the mansab of I'tib\u0101r Kh\u0101n was raised from 1,000 and 300 horse to 2,000 personal and 500 horse. I increased the mansab of Tarbiyat Kh\u0101n by 500 personal and 50 horse, so that it became 2,000 personal and 850 horse. H\u016bshang, son of Isl\u0101m Kh\u0101n, who was in Bengal with his father, came at this time and paid his respects. He brought with him some Maghs, whose country is near Pegu and Arracan, and the country is still in their possession. I made some enquiries as to their customs and religion. Briefly they are animals in the form of men. They eat everything there is either on land or in the sea, and nothing is forbidden by their religion. They eat with anyone. They take into their possession (marry) their sisters by another mother. In face they are like the Qar\u0101 Qalm\u0101qs, but their language is that of Tibet and quite unlike Turki. There is a range of mountains, one end of which touches the province of K\u0101shghar and the other the country of Pegu. They have no proper religion or any customs that can be interpreted as religion. They are far from the Musulman faith and separated from that of the Hindus.\n\nTwo or three days before the Sharaf (the sun's highest point) my son Khurram desired me to go to his house that he might present his New Year's offerings from that place. I agreed to his request, and remained for one day and one night at his house. He presented his offerings. I took what I approved of and gave him back the rest. The next day Murta\u1e93\u0101 Kh\u0101n presented his offerings. Every day until the day of culmination (r\u016bz-i-sharaf) the offerings of one or of two or three of the Amirs were laid before me.\nOn Monday, the 19th Farwardin, the assembly of the Sharaf was held. On that auspicious day I sat on the throne of State, and an order was given that they should produce all sorts of intoxicating things, such as wine, etc., so that every one according to his desire might take what he liked. Many took wine. The offerings of Mah\u0101bat Kh\u0101n were on this day brought to me. I gave one gold muhr of 1,000 tolas, which is called the star of destiny (kaukab-i-t\u0101li'), to Y\u0101dg\u0101r \u2018Al\u012b Kh\u0101n, the ambassador of the ruler of Iran. The feast went off well. After the assembly broke up I ordered that they might carry off the furniture and decorations. The offering of the Muqarrab Kh\u0101n had not been arranged on New Year\u2019s Day. All sorts of rareties and excellent presents were now produced which he had collected together. Amongst others, twelve Iraq and Arab horses that had been brought in a ship, and jewelled saddles of Frank workmanship\\(^1\\) were produced before me. To the mansab of Naw\u0101zish Kh\u0101n 500 horse were added so as to make it one of 2,000 personal and horse. An elephant called Bansibadan, which Isl\u0101m Kh\u0101n had sent from Bengal, was brought to me and put among my special elephants. On the 3rd Urdibihisht, Khwaja Y\u0101dg\u0101r, brother of \u2018Abdu-llah Kh\u0101n, came from Gujarat and waited on me; he offered 100 Jah\u0101ngiri muhrs. After he had been in attendance a few days he was honoured with the title of Sard\u0101r Kh\u0101n. As a competent bakhshi had to be sent to the army of Bangash and those regions, I chose Mu\u2019taqid Kh\u0101n for this duty, and increased his mansab by 300 personal and 50 horse so that it became 1,500 with 350 horse, and dismissed him. It was settled that he must go quickly. I sent off Muhammad \u1e24usain Chelebi, who understood the purchase of jewels and collecting curiosities, with money to go by\n\n\\(^1\\) Z\u012bn-i-mura\u1e63\u1e63a\u02bf k\u0101r\u012b-i-Farangi. The MSS. in the B.M. seem to have zaram instead of z\u012bn.\nway of Iraq to Constantinople and buy and bring for the Sarkar curiosities and rareties. For this purpose it was necessary that he should pay his respects to the ruler of Iran. I had given him a letter and a memorandum (of what he was to procure). Briefly, he saw my brother, Sh\u0101h \u2018Abb\u0101s, in Mashhad, and the king enquired from him what kind of things should be brought for his master\u2019s Sarkar. As he was urgent, Chelebi showed the list he had brought with him. In that list there were entered good turquoise and m\u016bm\u012by\u0101 (bitumen) from the mine of Ispahan. He told him that these two articles were not to be bought, but he would send them for me. He authorized Uwais\u012b T\u00fcpch\u012b (gunner), who was one of his private servants, to hand over to him six bags (amb\u0101ncha) of turquoise earth holding about 30 seers, with 14 tolas of mumiya and four Iraq horses, one of which was a piebald, and he wrote a letter containing many, many expressions of friendship. With regard to the inferior quality of the turquoise dust (kh\u0101ka) and the small quantity of mumiya he made many apologies. The khaka appeared very inferior. Although the jewellers and makers of rings made every endeavour, no stone that was fit to be made into a finger ring could be produced. Probably in these days turquoise dust is not procurable from the mines such as it was in the time of the late king Tahm\u0101sp. He mentioned all this in the letter. With regard to the effect of mumiya I had heard much from scientists, but when I tried it no result was apparent. I do not know whether physicians have exaggerated its effect, or whether its efficacy had been lessened by its being stale. At any rate, I gave it to a fowl with a broken leg to drink in larger quantity than they said and in the manner laid down by the physicians, and rubbed some on the place where it was broken, and kept it there for three days, though it was said to be sufficient to keep it from morning till evening. But after I had examined it, no effect was produced, and\nthe broken place remained as it was.\\footnote{Jah\u0101ng\u012br's words seem to imply that he caused the fowl's leg to be broken in order to try the experiment. Manucci, i, 55, has a good deal to say about m\u016bmiy\u0101, though he admits that he had not himself witnessed its effects. I do not find that H\u0101ji B\u0101b\u0101 descants on its virtues, though at the end of the first chapter he says that his mother gave him an unguent which she said would cure all fractures. The Persian translator, no doubt rightly, has rendered the word 'unguent' by m\u016bmiy\u0101. With regard to the derivation of the word, may it not be connected with mom, 'wax'? Vullers has a long article on the word.} In a separate letter the Shah had written a recommendation of Sal\u0101mu-llah, the Arab. I immediately increased his mansab and his jagir.\n\nI sent one of my private elephants with trappings to \u2018Abdu-llah Kh\u0101n and gave another to Qilij Kh\u0101n. I ordered that assignments (tankhw\u0101h) should be made to 12,000 horse on the establishment\\footnote{The text has bir\u0101d\u0101r\u012b, 'brotherhood,' but the true reading, as shown by the B.M. MSS., is bar \u0101wardi, \u0628\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0648\u0648\u0631\u062f\u06cc, and this means either the establishment of \u2018Abdu-llah or a list submitted by him. Perhaps 'list' is a better translation, the word \u0101wardi being connected with the \u0101warda-nawts of Wilson's Glossary.} of \u2018Abdu-llah Kh\u0101n at the rate of three horses and two horses for each trooper. As previously with a view to service in Junagarh I had increased the mansab of his brother Sard\u0101r Kh\u0101n by 500 personal and 300 horse, and had afterwards assigned the duty to K\u0101mil Kh\u0101n, I ordered that he should retain his increase and that it should be counted (permanently) in his mansab. I increased the rank of Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n, which was that of 1,500 personal and 500 horse, by 200 horse more. On the 27th Urdibihisht, corresponding with the 26th Rab\u012b\u2018u-l-awwal, in the eighth year of my reign, in the year 1022 of the Hijra era, on Thursday, the meeting for my lunar weighing took place in the house of Maryam-zam\u0101n\u012b (his mother). Some of the money that was weighed I ordered to be given to the women and the deserving ones who had assembled in my mother's house. On the same day I increased by 1,000 the mansab of Murtaz\u0101 Kh\u0101n, so that it came to 6,000 personal and 5,000\nhorse. Khusrau Beg, a slave of Mirz\u0101 Kh\u0101n, came from Patna in the company of \u2018Abdu-r-Razz\u0101q Ma\u2019m\u016br\u012b and waited on me, and Sard\u0101r Kh\u0101n, brother of \u2018Abdu-llah Kh\u0101n, obtained leave to go to Ahmadabad. An Afghan had brought from the Carnatic two goats that had p\u0101zahar (bezoar stones, an antidote against poison). I had always heard that an animal that has pazahar is very thin and miserable, but these goats were very fat and fresh. I ordered them to kill one of them, which was a female. Four pazahar stones became apparent, and this caused great astonishment.\n\nIt is an established fact that cheetahs in unaccustomed places do not pair off with a female, for my revered father once collected together 1,000 cheetahs. He was very desirous that they should pair, but this in no way came off. He had many times coupled male and female cheetahs together in gardens, but there, too, it did not come off. At this time a male cheetah, having slipped its collar, went to a female and paired with it, and after two and a half months three young ones were born and grew up. This has been recorded because it appeared strange. As cheetahs did not pair with cheetahs, (still less) had it ever been heard in former times (?) that tigers mated in captivity. As in the time of my reign wild beasts have abandoned their savagery, tigers have become so tame that troops of them without chains or restraint go about amongst the people, and they neither harm men nor have any wildness or alarm. It happened that a tigress became pregnant and after three months bore three cubs; it had never happened that a wild tiger after its capture had paired. It had been heard from philosophers that the milk of a tigress was of great use for brightening eyes. Although we made every effort that the moisture of milk should appear in her breasts, we could not accomplish it. It occurs to me that as it is a raging creature, and milk appears in the breasts of mothers by reason of the affection they have for their\nyoung, as milk\\(^1\\) comes into their breasts in connection with their young ones drinking and sucking at the time of their taking (the milk), their (the mothers') rage increases and the milk in their breasts is dried up.\n\nAt the end of Urdibihisht, Khw\u0101ja Q\u0101sim, brother of Khw\u0101ja \u2018Abdu-l-\u2018Aziz, who is of the Naqshband\u012b Khw\u0101jas, came from M\u0101war\u0101-a-n-nahr and waited on me. After a few days 12,000 rupees were given to him as a present. As Khw\u0101ja Jah\u0101n had made a melon-bed in the neighbourhood of the city, when two watches of day had passed on Thursday, the 10th Kh\u016brd\u0101d, I got into a boat and went to inspect the melon-bed, and took the ladies with me. We reached there when two or three gharis of day were left, and passed the evening in walking among the beds. A wonderfully sharp wind and whirlwind sprang up, so that the tents and screens fell down. I got into the boat and passed the night in it. I also passed part of the Friday in walking about the melon-bed, and returned to the city. Afzal Kh\u0101n, who for a long time had been afflicted with boils and other sores, died on the 10th Kh\u016brd\u0101d. I transferred the jagir and hereditary land of R\u0101ja Jagman, who had failed in his service in the Deccan, to Mah\u0101bat Kh\u0101n. Shaikh P\u012br, who is one of the emancipated ones who hold aloof from the attachments of the age, and who on account of the pure friendship that he bears towards me has chosen to be my companion and servant, had before this founded a mosque in the parganah of Mairtha, which is his native place. At this time he took occasion to mention the circumstance. As I found his mind bent on the completion of this building I gave him 4,000 rupees, so that he himself might go and expend it, and also gave him a valuable\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The sentence is very obscure. MS. No. 181 I.O. has kh\u0101n, 'blood,' instead of ch\u0101n, 'as,' and perhaps the meaning is blood in the breasts turns to milk on account of love for their cubs, and then the sucking by the latter increases the mother's natural ferocity and the milk dries up.\nshawl and dismissed him. In the public audience hall there were two railings (mahjar) of wood. Inside the first, Amirs, ambassadors, and people of honour sat, and no one entered this circle without an order. Within the second railing, which is broader than the first, the mansabdars of inferior rank, ahadis, and those who had work to do are admitted. Outside this railing stand the servants of the Amirs and all the people who may enter the Diwankhana. As there was no difference between the first and second railings, it occurred to me that I should decorate the first with silver. I ordered this railing and the staircase that led from this railing to the balcony of the Jharokha, as well as the two elephants placed on the two sides of the seat of the Jharokha, which skilful people had made of wood, to be decorated with silver. After this was completed it was reported to me that 125 maunds of silver in Hindustani weight, equal to 880 maunds of Persia, had been used up; indeed, it now assumed a worthy appearance.\n\nOn the 3rd of the month of Tir, Mu\u1e93affar Kh\u0101n came from Thatta and waited on me. He made an offering of twelve muhrs and a Koran with a jewelled cover, and two jewelled roses (?) (d\u016b gul). On the 14th of the same month \u1e62afdar Kh\u0101n came from the Subah of Behar and waited on me, offering 101 muhrs. After Mu\u1e93affar Kh\u0101n had been some days in attendance, I increased his former mansab by 500 personal, and giving him a standard and a private shawl dismissed him to Thatta.\n\nI knew that every animal or living thing bitten by a mad dog died, but this had not been ascertained in\n\n---\n\n1 In the B.M. MSS. the words are man\u1e63abd\u0101r\u0101n-i-riz\u0101-man\u1e63ab. These last two words are wanting in the text.\n2 Text Patna, but B.M. MSS. have Thatta.\n3 Text has Patna.\nthe case of an elephant. In my time it so happened that one night a mad dog came into the place where was tied one of my private elephants, Gajpati\\(^1\\) by name, and bit the foot of a female elephant that was with mine. She at once cried out. The elephant-keepers at once ran in, and the dog fled away into a thorn-brake that is there. After a little while it came in again and bit my private elephant\u2019s fore-foot as well. The elephant killed it. When a month and five days had passed after this event, one day when it was cloudy the growling of thunder came to the ear of the female elephant, that was in the act of eating, and it of a sudden raised a cry and its limbs began to tremble. It threw itself on the ground, but rose again. For seven days water ran out of its mouth, then suddenly it uttered a cry and showed distress. The remedies the drivers gave it had no effect, and on the eighth day it fell and died. A month after the death of the female elephant they took the large elephant to the edge of the river in the plain. It was cloudy and thundery in the same way. The said elephant in the height of excitement all at once began to tremble and sat down on the ground. With a thousand difficulties the drivers took it to its own place. After the same interval and in the same way that had happened to the female elephant this elephant also died. Great amazement was caused by this affair, and in truth it is a matter to be wondered at that an animal of such size and bulk should be so much affected by a little wound inflicted on it by such a weak creature.\n\nAs Kh\u0101nkhan\u0101n had repeatedly begged for leave to be given to his son Sh\u0101h-naw\u0101z Kh\u0101n, on the 4th Amurd\u0101d I gave him a horse and a robe of honour and dismissed him to the Deccan. I promoted Ya\u2019q\u016bb Badakhsh\u012b, whose\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Text Kachhi, but it is Gajpati in B.M. MSS.\nmansab was 150, to 1,500 personal and 1,000 horse, on account of the bravery he had displayed, and gave him the title of Khan as well as a standard.\n\nThe Hindus are in four divisions, and each of these acts according to its own rules and ways. In every year they keep a fixed day. The first is the caste of the Brahmins,\\(^1\\) that is, those who know the Incomparable God. Their duties are of six kinds\u2014(1) to acquire religious knowledge, (2) to give instructions to others, (3) to worship fire, (4) to lead men to the worship of fire, (5) giving something to the needy, (6) taking gifts. There is for this caste an appointed day, and that is the last day of the month of S\u0101wan, the second month of the rainy season.\\(^2\\) They consider this an auspicious day, and the worshippers go on that day to the banks of rivers and tanks, and recite enchantments, breathe upon cords and coloured threads; on another day, which is the first of the New Year, they fasten them on the hands of the Rajas and great men of the time, and look on them as (good) omens. They call this thread r\u0101khi,\\(^3\\) that is, preservation (\\textit{nig\u0101h-d\u0101sht}). This day occurs in the month of Tir, when the world-heating sun is in the constellation of Cancer. The second caste is that of the Chhatri, which is known as Khatr\u012b. Their duty is to protect the oppressed from the evil of the oppressors. The customs of this caste are three\n\n\\(^1\\) This seems taken from Ab\u016b-l-fa\u1e93l. See Jarrett, iii, 115. The third duty, which Jah\u0101ng\u012br calls \u201cworshipping fire,\u201d is by Ab\u016b-l-fa\u1e93l termed Y\u0101g, i.e. sacrifice.\n\n\\(^2\\) It is the day of the full moon in S\u0101wan that is holy.\n\n\\(^3\\) Blochmann, p. 184, and Wilson\u2019s Glossary. Baday\u016bn\u012b (Lowe, p. 269) speaks of Akbar\u2019s wearing the r\u0101khi on the 8th day of Virgo. I do not know why Jah\u0101ng\u012br calls the day after the last day of S\u0101wan the first day of the New Year. Perhaps r\u016bz-i-duyam here means \u2018another day,\u2019 and not \u2018the next day\u2019; but then, if so, why is it the rakhi day, for that is in S\u0101wan? The Hindu New Year begins in Baisakh (April). It will be observed from Jarrett, ii, 17, that S\u0101wan is also the name of a month of a particular length. Perhaps Jah\u0101ng\u012br has confused the two things.\nthings\u2014(1) that they study religious science themselves but do not teach others; (2) that they worship fire, but do not teach others to do so; (3) that they give to the needy, but although they are needy take nothing themselves. The day of this caste is the Bijay dasamin, 'the victorious tenth.' On this day with them it is lucky to mount and go against one's enemy with an army. R\u0101m Chand, whom they worship as their god, leading his army on that day against his enemy won a victory, and they consider this a great day, and, decorating their elephants and horses, perform worship. This day falls in the month of Shahriwar, when the Sun is in the mansion of Virgo, and on it they give presents to those who look after their horses and elephants. The third caste is that of Baish (Vaishya). Its custom is this, that they serve the other two castes of which mention has been made. They practise agriculture and buying and selling, and are employed in the business of profit and interest. This caste has also a fixed day which they call the Dew\u0101li; this day occurs in the month of Mihr when the sun is in the constellation of Libra, the 28th day of the lunar month. On the night of that day they light lamps, and friends and those who are dear assemble in each other's houses and pass their time busily in gambling. As the eyes of this caste are on profit and interest, they consider carrying over and opening new accounts on that day auspicious. The fourth caste is the Sudras, who are the lowest caste of the Hindus. They are the servants of all, and derive no profit from those things which are the specialities of every (other) caste. Thursday is the Holi, which in their belief is the last day of the year. This day occurs in the month of Isfand\u0101rmuz, when the sun is in the constellation of Pisces. On the night of\n\n1 It is the 10th of Aswin (September).\n2 The text wrongly has dar har m\u0101h instead of only dar m\u0101h.\nthis day they light fires at the head of the streets and ways, and when it becomes day they for one watch scatter the ashes on each other's heads and faces, and make a wonderful noise and disturbance, and after this wash themselves, put on their apparel, and walk about in the gardens and on the plains. As it is an established custom of the Hindus to burn the dead, to light fires on this night, which is the last night of the year that has passed, signifies that they burn the last year, which has gone to the abode of the dead. In the time of my revered father the Hindu Amirs and others in imitation of them performed the ceremony of rakhi in adorning him, making strings of rubies and royal pearls and flowers jewelled with gems of great value and binding them on his auspicious arms. This custom was carried on for some years. As they carried this extravagance to excess, and he disliked it, he forbade it. The brahmans by way of auguries used to tie these strings and (pieces of) silk according to their custom. I also in this year carried out this laudable religious practice, and ordered that the Hindu Amirs and the heads of the caste\u00b9 should fasten rakhis on my arms. On the day of the rakhi, which was the 9th Amurd\u0101d, they performed the same rites, and other castes by way of imitation did not give up this bigotry; this year I agreed to it, and ordered that the brahmans should bind strings (of cotton) and silk after the ancient manner. On this day, by chance fell the anniversary of the death of the late king.\u00b2 The commemoration of such an anniversary is one of the standing rules and customs in Hindustan. Every year on the day of the death of their fathers and those who\n\n\u00b9 The negative in text is wrong apparently. It does not occur in MS. No. 181 I.O. nor in the B.M. MSS., which have ba instead of na.\n\n\u00b2 That is, 9th Amurd\u0101d corresponded with the \u1e24ijra date of Akbar\u2019s death, viz. 13th Jum\u0101d\u0101-\u1e63-\u1e63\u0101n\u012b, which this year, 1022, occurred in July. According to the solar calendar Akbar\u2019s death was in October.\nare dear to them, each according to his circumstances and ability prepares food and all kinds of perfumes, and the learned men, the respectable and other men assemble, and these assemblies sometimes last a week. On this day I sent B\u0101b\u0101 Khurr\u0101m to the venerated tomb to arrange the assemblage, and 10,000 rupees were given to ten trustworthy servants to divide among fakirs and those who were in want.\n\nOn the 15th of the month of Amurd\u0101d the offering of Isl\u0101m Kh\u0101n was laid before me. He had sent 28 elephants, 40 horses of that part of the country which are known as \u1e6d\u0101nghan, 50 eunuchs, 500 parg\u0101la naf\u012bs sit\u0101rk\u0101n\u012b.\u00b9\n\nIt had been made a rule that the events of the Subahs should be reported according to the boundaries of each, and news-writers from the Court had been appointed for this duty. This being the rule that my revered father had laid down, I also observe it, and much gain and great advantage are to be brought about by it, and information is acquired about the world and its inhabitants. If the advantages of this were to be written down it would become a long affair. At this time the news-writer of Lahore reported that at the end of the month of T\u012br ten men had gone from the city to Am\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d, which lies at a distance of 12 kos. As the air was very hot, they took shelter under a tree. Soon afterwards wind and a dust-storm (chakr\u012b) sprang up, and when it blew on that band of men they trembled, and nine of them died under the tree, and only one remained alive; he was ill for a long time, and recovered with great difficulty. In that neighbourhood such bad\n\n\u00b9 Parg\u0101las seem to be clothes of some sort. Perhaps the word is another form of the farg\u016bl of Blochmann, p. 89. The text has sit\u0101rk\u0101ni. Sit\u0101r means a veil, but probably we should read Sonarg\u0101oni, \u2018of Sonargaon.\u2019 Both the MSS. give the number of elephants as 68 instead of 28 as in text.\nair was created that numerous birds who had their nests in that tree all fell down and died, and that the wild beasts (beasts of the plain, perhaps cattle) came and threw themselves on to the cultivated fields, and, rolling about on the grass, gave up their lives. In short, many animals perished. On Thursday, the 13th Amurd\u0101d, having said my prayers (lit. counted my rosary), I embarked on board a boat for the purpose of hunting in the village of Samonagar, which is one of my fixed hunting-places. On the 3rd Shahr\u012bwar, Kh\u0101n \u2018\u0100lam, whom I had sent for from the Deccan in order to despatch him to Iraq in company with the ambassador of the ruler of Iran, came and waited on me at this place. He offered 100 muhrs. As Samonagar was in Mah\u0101bat Kh\u0101n\u2019s jagir, he had prepared a delightful halting-place there on the bank of the river, and it pleased me greatly. He presented offerings of an elephant and an emerald ring. The former was put into my private stud. Up to the 6th Shahr\u012bwar I was employed in hunting. In these few days 47 head of antelope, male and female, and other animals were killed. At this time Dil\u0101war Kh\u0101n sent as an offering a ruby, which was accepted. I sent a special sword for Isl\u0101m Kh\u0101n. I increased the mansab of \u1e24asan \u2018Al\u012b Turkum\u0101n, which was 1,000 personal and 700 horse, by 500 personal and 100 horse. At the end of Thursday, the 20th of the same month, in the house of Maryam-zam\u0101n\u012b, my solar weighing took place. I weighed myself according to the usual custom against metals and other things. I had this year attained to the age of 44 solar years. On the same day Y\u0101dg\u0101r \u2018Al\u012b, ambassador of the ruler of Iran, and Kh\u0101n \u2018\u0100lam, who had been nominated to accompany him from this side, received their leave to go. On Y\u0101dg\u0101r \u2018Al\u012b there were bestowed a horse with a jewelled saddle, a jewelled sword, a vest without sleeves with gold embroidery, an aigrette with feathers and a j\u016bgha (turban ornament), and 30,000\nrupees in cash, altogether 40,000 rupees, and on Kh\u0101n \u2018\u0100lam a jewelled khapwa or ph\u016bl ka\u1e6d\u0101ra (a sort of dagger) with a pendant of royal pearls. On the 22nd of the same month I visited the venerated mausoleum of my revered father at Bihisht\u0101b\u0101d, riding on an elephant. On the way 5,000 rupees in small coin were scattered round, and I gave other 5,000 rupees to Khw\u0101ja Jah\u0101n to divide among the dervishes. Having said my evening prayers, I went back to the city in a boat. As the house of Itim\u0101du-d-daulah was on the bank of the river Jumna, I alighted there until the end of the next day. Having accepted what pleased me of his offerings, I went towards the palace; Itiq\u0101d Kh\u0101n\u2019s house was also on the bank of the river Jumna; at his request I disembarked there with the ladies, and walked round the houses he had lately built there. This delightful place pleased me greatly. He had produced suitable offerings of cloth stuffs and jewels and other things; these were all laid before me and most of them were approved. When it was near evening I entered the auspicious palace. As the astrologers had fixed an hour in this night for starting for Ajmir, when seven gharis of the night of Monday, the 2nd Sha\u2018b\u0101n, corresponding with the 24th Shahriwar, had passed, I started in happiness and prosperity with intent to go there from the capital of Agra. In this undertaking two things were agreeable to me, one a pilgrimage to the splendid mausoleum of Khw\u0101ja Mu\u2018\u012bnu-d-din Chisht\u012b, from the blessing of whose illustrious soul great advantages had been derived by this dignified family, and whose venerable shrine I had not visited after my accession to the throne. The second was the defeat and beating back of the rebel R\u0101n\u0101 Amar Singh, who is one of the most considerable of the Zamindars and Rajas of Hindustan, and whose headship and leadership and those of his ancestors all the Rajas and Rays of this province agree to. The administration has for long been in the\nhands of this family, and they have long borne rule towards the East, that is the P\u016brab. They became in that time well known under the title of Rajas. After this they fell on the Deccan\\(^1\\) and took possession of many of the countries of that region. In the place of Raja they have taken the title of R\u0101wal. After this they came into the hill country of Mew\u0101t, and by degrees got into their possession the fort of Chitor. From that date until this day, which is in the eighth year after my accession, 1,471 years have passed.\\(^2\\)\n\nThere are twenty-six others of this caste who have ruled for 1,010 years. They have the title of R\u0101wal, and from the R\u0101wal who was first known as R\u0101wal down to R\u0101n\u0101 Amar Singh, the present R\u0101n\u0101, there are twenty-six individuals who have ruled for the space of 461 years. During this long time they have never bent their necks in obedience to any of the kings of the country of Hindustan, and have for most of the time been rebellious and troublesome, so much so that in the reign of the late king B\u0101bar, R\u0101n\u0101 S\u0101ng\u0101 collected together all the Rajas, Rays, and Zamindars of this province, and fought a battle in the neighbourhood of Biy\u0101na with 180,000 horse and several lakhs of foot-soldiers. By the aid of Almighty God and the assistance of fortune the victorious army of Isl\u0101m prevailed against the infidel forces, and a great defeat happened to them. The details of this battle have been given in the Memoirs of King B\u0101bar. My revered father (may his bright tomb be the abode of unending Grace) exerted himself greatly\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) See Jarrett, ii, 268, where it is said that an ancestor of B\u0101ppa came to Berar.\n\n\\(^2\\) According to Tod, B\u0101ppa, the ancestor of the R\u0101n\u0101, acquired Chitor in A.D. 728. Jah\u0101ng\u012br makes twenty-six princes rule for 1,010 years and twenty-six others only reign for 461 years! Tod says the legendary ancestor Kenek Sen, the sixty-third from Loh, the son of R\u0101m, emigrated from the Panjab to Gujarat in 145 A.D. Perhaps the Mew\u0101t of the T\u016bzuk is a mistake for Mew\u0101r.\nto put down these rebels, and several times sent armies against them. In the twelfth year after his accession he set himself to capture the fort of Chitor, which is one of the strongest forts of the inhabited world, and to overthrow the kingdom of the R\u0101n\u0101, and after four months and ten days of siege took it by force from the men of Amar Singh\u2019s father, after much fighting, and returned after destroying the fort. Every time the victorious forces pressed him hard in order to capture him or make him a fugitive, but it so happened that this was not effected. In the end of his reign, on the same day and hour that he proceeded to the conquest of the Deccan, he sent me with a large army and reliable Sardars against the R\u0101n\u0101. By chance these two affairs, for reasons which it would take too long to recount, did not succeed. At last I came to the throne, and as this matter was only half done, the first army I sent to the borders was this one. Making my son Parwiz its leader, the leading nobles who were at the capital were appointed to this duty. I sent abundant treasure and artillery with him. As every matter depends on its own season, at this juncture the unhappy affair of Khusrau occurred, and I had to pursue him to the Panjab. The province and the capital of Agra remained void. I had necessarily to write that Parwiz should return with some of the Amirs and take charge of Agra and the neighbourhood. In short, this time again the matter of the R\u0101n\u0101 did not go off as it should. When by the favour of Allah my mind was at rest from Khusrau\u2019s disturbance, and Agra became again the alighting place of the royal standards, a victorious army was appointed under the leadership of Mah\u0101bat Kh\u0101n, \u2018Abdu-l-lah Kh\u0101n, and other leaders, and from that date up to the time when the royal standards started for Ajmir his country was trodden under foot by the victorious forces. As finally the affair did not assume\nan approved form, it occurred to me that, as I had nothing to do at Agra, and I was convinced that until I myself went there the affair would not be set to rights, I left the fort of Agra and alighted at the Dahrah garden. On the next day the festival of the Dasahr\u0101 took place. According to the usual custom they decorated the elephants and horses, and I had them before me. As the mothers and sisters of Khusrau repeatedly represented to me that he was very repentant of his deeds, the feelings (lit. sweat) of fatherly affection having come into movement, I sent for him and determined that he should come every day to pay his respects to me. I remained for eight days in that garden. On the 28th news arrived that R\u0101ja R\u0101m D\u0101s, who was doing service in Bangash and the neighbourhood of Kabul with Qilij Kh\u0101n, had died. On the 1st of the month of Mihr I marched from the garden, and dismissed Khw\u0101ja Jah\u0101n to look after the capital of Agra and guard the treasure and the palace, and gave him an elephant and a special robe (furgul). On the 2nd Mihr news arrived that R\u0101ja B\u0101so had died in the thanah of Shahabad,\\(^1\\) which is on the border of the territory of Amar. On the 10th of the same month I halted at R\u016bp B\u0101s, which has now been named Am\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d. Formerly this district had been given as jagir to R\u016bp Khaw\u0101\u1e63\u1e63. Afterwards, bestowing it on Am\u0101nu-llah, son of Mah\u0101bat Kh\u0101n,\\(^*\\) I ordered it to be called by his name. Eleven days were passed at this halting-place. As it is a fixed hunting-place, I every day mounted to go hunting, and in these few days 158 antelopes, male and female, and other animals were killed. On the 25th of the month I marched from Am\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d. On the 31st, corresponding with the 8th Ramaz\u0101n, Khw\u0101ja Ab\u016b-l-hasan, whom I had sent for from Burhanpur, came and waited on me,\n\n\\(^1\\) Probably the town of that name in the Rajputana State of Jhal\u0101war. See \"Rajputana Gazetteer,\" ii, 211.\nand presented as offerings 50 muhrs, 15 jewelled vessels, and an elephant, which I placed in my private stud. On the 2nd \u0100b\u0101n, corresponding with the 10th Ramaz\u0101n, news came of the death of Qil\u012bj Kh\u0101n. He was one of the ancient servants of the State, and obtained the mercy of God in the 80th year of his age. He was employed at Peshawar in the duty of keeping in order the Afghans full of darkness. His rank was 6,000 personal and 5,000 horse. Murtaz\u0101 Kh\u0101n Dakhan\u012b was unrivalled in the art of p\u016blta-b\u0101z\u012b, which in the language of the Dakhanis they call yag\u0101nag\u012b, and the Moguls shamsh\u012br-b\u0101z\u012b, \u2018sword-play\u2019 (fencing). For some time I studied it with him. At this time I exalted him with the title of Warzish Kh\u0101n (Exercise-Kh\u0101n). I had established a custom that deserving people and dervishes should be brought before me every night, so that I might bestow on them, after personal enquiry into their condition, land, or gold, or clothes. Amongst these was a man who represented to me that the name Jah\u0101ng\u012br, according to the science of abjad (numerals reckoned by letters), corresponded to the great name \u201cAllah Akbar.\u201d Considering this a good omen, I gave him who discovered (this coincidence) land, a horse, cash, and clothing. On Monday, the 5th Shaww\u0101l, corresponding to the 26th \u0100b\u0101n, the hour for entering Ajmir was fixed. On the morning of the said day I went towards it. When the fort and the buildings of the shrine of the revered Khw\u0101ja appeared in sight, I traversed on foot the remainder of the road, about a kos. I placed trustworthy men on both sides of the road, who went along giving money to fakirs and the necessitous. When four gharis of day had passed, I entered the city and its inhabited portion, and in the fifth ghari had the honour of visiting the venerated mausoleum. After visiting it I proceeded to.\n\n---\n\n2 The Raushan\u012bs, called by their enemies the T\u0101rik\u012bs.\n2 Both Jah\u0101ng\u012br and Allah Akbar yield 288.\nthe auspicious palace, and the next day ordered all those present in this honoured resting-place, both small and great, belonging to the city, and travellers, to be brought before me, that they might be made happy with numerous gifts according to their real circumstances. On the 7th \u0100zar I went to see and shoot on the tank of Pushkar, which is one of the established praying-places of the Hindus, with regard to the perfection of which they give (excellent) accounts that are incredible to any intelligence, and which is situated at a distance of three kos from Ajmir. For two or three days I shot water-fowl on that tank, and returned to Ajmir. Old and new temples which, in the language of the infidels, they call Deohara\u00b9 are to be seen around this tank. Among them R\u0101n\u0101 Shankar, who is the uncle of the rebel Amar, and in my kingdom is among the high nobles, had built a Deohara of great magnificence, on which 100,000 rupees had been spent. I went to see that temple. I found a form cut out of black stone, which from the neck above was in the shape of a pig\u2019s head, and the rest of the body was like that of a man. The worthless religion of the Hindus is this, that once on a time for some particular object the Supreme Ruler thought it necessary to show himself in this shape; on this account they hold it dear and worship it.\u00b2 I ordered them to break that hideous form and throw it into the tank. After looking at this building there appeared a white dome on the top of a hill, to which men were coming from all quarters. When I asked about this they said that a Jogi lived there, and when the simpletons come to see him he places in their hands a handful\u00b3 of flour, which they put into their mouths and imitate the cry\n\n\u00b9 Sanskrit Devahar\u0101, \u2018an idol temple.\u2019\n\u00b2 \u201cRajputana Gazetteer,\u201d ii, 69.\n\u00b3 Instead of kaff \u0101rdi, \u2018a handful of flour,\u2019 the R.A.S. MS. has kaf az way, \u2018his spittle,\u2019 and this seems more likely.\nof an animal which these fools have at some time injured, in order that by this act their sins may be blotted out. I ordered them to break down that place and turn the Jogi out of it, as well as to destroy the form of an idol there was in the dome. Another belief they have is that there is no bottom to this tank. After enquiry it appeared that it is nowhere deeper than 12 cubits. I also measured it round and it was about $1\\frac{1}{2}$ kos.\n\nOn the 16th \u0100zar news came that the watchmen had marked down a tigress. I immediately went there and killed it with a gun and returned. After a few days a nilgaw (blue bull) was killed, of which I ordered them to take off the skin in my presence and cook it as food for the poor. Over 200 people assembled and ate it, and I gave money with my own hand to each of them. In the same month news came that the Franks of Goa had, contrary to treaty, plundered four cargo vessels\\(^1\\) that frequented the port of Surat in the neighbourhood of that port; and, making prisoners a large number of Musulmans, had taken possession of the goods and chattels that were in those ships. This being very disagreeable to my mind, I despatched Muqarrab Kh\u0101n, who is in charge of the port, on the 18th \u0100zar, giving him a horse and elephant and a dress of honour, to obtain compensation for this affair. On account of the great activity and good services of Y\u016bsuf Kh\u0101n and Bah\u0101durul-mulk in the Subah of the Deccan, I sent standards for them.\n\nIt has been written that my chief object, after my visit to the Khw\u0101ja, was to put a stop to the affair of the rebel R\u0101n\u0101. On this account I determined to remain myself at\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Text ajnab\u012b, \u2018foreign\u2019 or \u2018strange,\u2019 and Dowson had the same reading, for at vi, 337, we have the translation \u2018ships engaged in the foreign trade of Surat.\u2019 But I adopt the reading of I.O. MS. 181, which is ajn\u0101st\u012b, as it does not seem likely that Jah\u0101ng\u012br would interest himself about \u2018foreign\u2019 ships.\nAjmir and send on B\u0101b\u0101 Khurram, my fortunate son. This idea was a very good one, and on this account, on the 6th of Day, at the hour fixed upon, I despatched him in happiness and triumph. I presented him with a qab\u0101 (outer coat) of gold brocade with jewelled flowers and pearls round the flowers, a brocaded turban with strings of pearls, a gold woven sash with chains of pearls, one of my private elephants called Fath Gaj, with trappings, a special horse, a jewelled sword, and a jewelled khapwa, with a ph\u016bl kat\u0101ra. In addition to the men first appointed to this duty under the leadership of Kh\u0101n A\u02bfzam, I sent 12,000 more horse with my son, and honoured their leaders, each according to his condition, with special horses and elephants and robes of honour, and dismissed them. Fid\u0101\u02bei Kh\u0101n was nominated to the paymastership of this army. At the same time \u1e62afdar Kh\u0101n was despatched to the government of Kashmir in place of H\u0101shim Kh\u0101n. He received a horse and robe of honour. On Wednesday, the 11th, Khw\u0101ja Ab\u016b-l-\u1e25asan was made general pay-master (baksh\u012b-kul), and received a dress of honour. I had ordered them to make a large caldron\u00b9 at Agra for the revered mausoleum of the Khw\u0101ja. On this day it was brought, and I ordered them to cook food for the poor in that pot, and collect together the poor of Ajmir to feed them whilst I was there. Five thousand people assembled, and all ate of this food to their fill. After the food I gave money to each of the dervishes with my own hand. At this time Isl\u0101m Kh\u0101n, governor of Bengal, was promoted to the mansab of 6,000 personal and horse, and a flag was given to Mukarram Kh\u0101n, son of Mu\u02bfazzam Kh\u0101n.\n\nOn the 1st of Isfand\u0101rmuz, corresponding with the 10th Muharram, 1023 (20th February, 1614), I left\n\n\u00b9 \u201cRajputana Gazetteer,\u201d ii, 63. There are now two large caldrons (d\u012bg) inside the darg\u0101h enclosure.\nAjmir to hunt nilgaw, and returned on the 9th. I halted at the fountain of \u1e24\u0101fi\u1e93 Jam\u0101l,\\(^1\\) two kos from the city, and passed the night of Friday\\(^2\\) there. At the end of the day I entered the city. In these twenty days ten nilgaw had been killed. As the good service of Khw\u0101ja Jah\u0101n and the smallness of his force for the defence and government of Agra and that neighbourhood were brought to my notice, I increased his mansab by 500 personal and 100 horse. On the same day Ab\u016b-l-fa\u1e6d\u1e25 Dakhan\u012b came from his jagir and waited on me. On the 3rd of the same month news came of the death of Isl\u0101m Kh\u0101n; he had died on Thursday, the 5th Rajab, in the year 1022 (21st August, 1613). In one day, without any previous illness, this inevitable event occurred. He was one of those born and brought up in the house (house-born). The naturally good disposition and knowledge of affairs that showed themselves in him were seen in no one else. He ruled Bengal with entire authority, and brought within the civil jurisdiction of the province countries that had never previously come under the sway of any of the jagirdars or into the possession of any of the Chiefs of the State. If death had not overtaken him he would have done perfect service.\n\nThe Kh\u0101n A\u02bf\u1e93am had himself prayed that the illustrious prince should be appointed to the campaign against the R\u0101n\u0101, yet, notwithstanding all kinds of encouragement and gratification on the part of my son (Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n), he would not apply himself to the task, but proceeded to act in his own unworthy manner. When this was heard by me, I sent Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Husain, who was one of my most trusty attendants, to him, and sent affectionate\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) \u1e24\u0101fi\u1e93 Jam\u0101l was the name of the saint Mu\u02bf\u012bnu-d-d\u012bn\u2019s daughter (\u201cRajputana Gazetteer,\u201d ii, 62). It lies at the back of the Taragarh hill, and is now commonly called N\u016br-ch\u0101shma. The fountains, etc., are in a ruined state. Sir Thomas Roe visited this place (id., p. 123).\n\n\\(^2\\) Shab-i-jum\u02bfa, which is Friday eve according to Blochmann.\nmessages to him to say that when he was at Burhanpur he had daily begged this duty of me, as he considered it equivalent to the happiness of both worlds, and had said in meetings and assemblies that if he should be killed in this enterprise he would be a martyr, and if he prevailed, a gh\u0101zi. I had given him whatever support and assistance of artillery he had asked for. After this he had written that without the movement of the royal standards to those regions the completion of the affair was not free of difficulty. By his counsel I had come to Ajmir, and this neighbourhood had been thus honoured and dignified. Now that he had himself prayed for the prince, and everything had been carried out according to his counsel, why did he withdraw his foot from the field of battle and enter the place of disagreement? To B\u0101b\u0101 Khurram, from whom up till now I had never parted, and whom I sent in pure reliance on his (Kh\u0101n A\u2018zam\u2019s) knowledge of affairs, he should show loyalty and approved good-will, and never be neglectful day or night of his duty to my son. If, contrariwise, he should draw back his foot from what he had agreed to, he must know that there would be mischief. Ibr\u0101him \u1e24usain went, and impressed these words on his mind in the same detailed way. It was of no avail, as he would not go back from his folly and determination. When B\u0101b\u0101 Khurram saw that his being in the affair was a cause of disturbance, he kept him under observation and represented that his being there was in no way fitting, and he was acting thus and spoiling matters simply on account of the connection he had with Khusrau.\u00b9 I then ordered Mah\u0101bat Kh\u0101n to go and bring him from Udaipur, and told Mu\u1e25ammad Taq\u012b, the diwan of buildings, to go to Mandes\u016br and bring his children and dependants to Ajmir.\n\nOn the 11th of the month news came that Dulip, son\n\n\u00b9 Khusrau was married to his daughter.\nof R\u0101y Singh, who was of a seditious and rebellious disposition, had been heavily defeated by his younger brother, R\u0101o S\u016braj Singh, who had been sent against him, and that he was making disturbance in one of the districts of the Sarkar of \u1e24issar. About this time H\u0101shim of Khost, the faujdar, and the jagirdars of that neighbourhood seized him, and sent him as a prisoner to Court. As he had misbehaved repeatedly, he was capitally punished, and this was a warning to many of the seditious. In reward for this service an increase of 500 personal and 200 horse was made to the mansab of R\u0101o S\u016braj Singh. On the 14th of the month a representation came from my son B\u0101b\u0101 Khurr\u0101m that the elephant \u2018\u0100lam-gum\u0101n, of which the R\u0101n\u0101 was very fond, together with seventeen other elephants, had fallen into the hands of the warriors of the victorious army, and that his master would also soon be captured.\n\nThe Ninth New Year\u2019s Feast after my Auspicious Accession.\n\nThe commencement of the ninth year after my auspicious accession, corresponding with the Hijra year 1023 (1614).\n\nTwo watches and one ghari had passed on the night of Friday, the 9th \u1e62afar (21st March, 1614), when the world-warming sun shed his rays on the constellation of Aries, which is his house of dignity and honour; it was the first morning of the month of Farward\u012bn. The assembly for the New Year\u2019s festival took place in the pleasant regions of Ajmir, and at the time of entry (of the sun into Aries), which was the propitious hour, I seated myself on the throne of good fortune. They had in the usual manner decorated the palace with rare cloth-stuffs and jewels and gem-decked things. At this\nauspicious moment the elephant \u2018\u0100lam-gum\u0101n,\\(^1\\) which was fit to be entered in the private stud, with the seventeen other male and female elephants which my son B\u0101b\u0101 Khurr\u0101m had sent of the R\u0101n\u0101\u2019s elephants, were presented before me, and the hearts of the loyal rejoiced. On the 2nd day of the New Year, knowing it to be propitious for a ride, I mounted it and scattered about much money. On the 3rd I conferred on I\u2019ti\u1e33\u0101d Kh\u0101n a mansab of 3,000 personal and 1,000 horse, increasing thus that which he had already, which was of 2,000 personal and 500 horse, and I distinguished him with the title of \u0100\u1e63af Kh\u0101n, with which title two of his family had been previously honoured. I also increased the mansab of Day\u0101nat Kh\u0101n by 500 personal and 200 horse. At the same time I promoted I\u2019tim\u0101du-d-daulah to the mansab of 5,000 personal and 2,000 horse. At the request of B\u0101b\u0101 Khurr\u0101m I increased the mansab of Saif Kh\u0101n B\u0101rha by 500 personal and 200 horse, that of Dil\u0101war Kh\u0101n by the same number, that of Kishan Singh by 500 horse, and that of Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n by 500 personal and 300 horse. On Sunday, the 10th, the offering of \u0100\u1e63af Kh\u0101n was produced before me, and on the 14th I\u2019tim\u0101du-d-daulah produced his own offering. From these two offerings I took what pleased me and gave back the rest. Ch\u012bn Qil\u012bj Kh\u0101n, with his brothers, relations, and the army and retinue of his father, came from Kabul\\(^2\\) and waited on me. Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Kh\u0101n, who had a mansab of 700 personal and 300 horse, having been promoted to that of 1,500 personal and 600 horse, was appointed jointly with Khw\u0101ja Ab\u016b-l-\u1e25asan to the exalted dignity of paymaster of the household. On the 15th of this month Mah\u0101bat Kh\u0101n, who had been appointed to bring Kh\u0101n A\u2019\u1e93am and his son \u2018Abdu-l-lah, came and waited\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The \u201cArrogant of the Earth\u201d (Tod).\n\n\\(^2\\) Perhaps this means Peshawar, for apparently Qil\u012bj was there when he died.\non me. On the 19th the assembly of honour was held. On that day the offering of Mah\u0101bat Kh\u0101n was laid before me, and I sent a private elephant called R\u016bp Sundar for my son Parwiz. When that day had passed I ordered them to deliver Kh\u0101n A\u02bf\u1e93am into the charge of \u0100\u1e63af Kh\u0101n, that he might keep him in the fort of Gwalior. As my object in sending him to the fort was in case some disagreement and disturbance should occur in the matter of the R\u0101n\u0101 in consequence of the attachment that he had to Khusrau, I ordered him not to be kept in the fort like a prisoner, but that they should provide everything necessary for his comfort and convenience in the way of eating and clothing. On the same day I promoted Chin Qilij Kh\u0101n to a mansab of 2,500 personal and 700 horse. To the rank of T\u0101j Kh\u0101n, who had been appointed to the charge of the province of Bhakar, I added 500 personal and horse. On the 18th Urdibihisht I forbade Khusrau to pay his respects. The reason was this, that through the affection and fatherly love (I bore him) and the prayers of his mother and sisters, I had ordered again that he should come every day to pay his respects (k\u016brnish). As his appearance showed no signs of openness and happiness, and he was always mournful and dejected in mind, I accordingly ordered that he should not come to pay his respects.\n\nIn the time of my revered father, Mu\u1e93affar \u1e24usain Mirz\u0101 and Rustam Mirz\u0101, sons of Sul\u1e6d\u0101n \u1e24usain Mirz\u0101, nephews of Sh\u0101h Tahm\u0101sp \u0160afawi, who had in their possession Qandahar and Zamind\u0101war and that neighbourhood, sent petitions to the effect that in consequence of the nearness to Khurasan and the coming of \u2018Abdu-llah Kh\u0101n \u016azbeg to that country, they could not leave the charge of looking after the country and come (to pay their respects), but that if he (Akbar) would send one of the servants of the palace they would hand over the country to him, and themselves come to pay their respects.\nAs they repeatedly made this request, he sent Sh\u0101h Beg Kh\u0101n, who is now honoured with the title of Kh\u0101n Daur\u0101n, to the governorship of Qandahar and Zam\u012bnd\u0101war and that neighbourhood, and wrote firmans full of favour to the M\u012brz\u0101s summoning them to the Court. After their arrival favours appropriate to the case of each were bestowed on them, and he gave them a territory equal to two or three times the collections of Qandahar. In the end, the management expected from them was not achieved, and by degrees the territory deteriorated.\n\nMuzaffar Husain M\u012brz\u0101 died during the lifetime of my revered father, and he sent M\u012brz\u0101 Rustam with the Khankhanan to the Subah of the Deccan, where he had a small jagir. When the throne was honoured by my succession, I sent for him from the Deccan with the intention of showing him favour and sending him to one of the border territories. About the time he came M\u012brz\u0101 Gh\u0101zi Tarkh\u0101n, who held the governorship of Thatta and Qandahar and that neighbourhood, died. It occurred to me to send him to Thatta, so that he might show there his natural good qualities and administer that country in an approved manner. I promoted him to a mansab of 5,000 personal and horse, 200,000 rupees were given to him for expenses, and I despatched him to the Subah of Thatta. My belief was that he would do good service\\(^1\\) on those borders. In opposition to my expectation he did no service, and committed so much oppression that many people complained of his wickedness. Such news of him was heard that it was considered necessary to recall him.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) According to the Ma'\u0101\u1e63ir, iii, 486, in the biography of \u2018\u012as\u0101 Kh\u0101n, Rustam was sent to put down the Tarkh\u0101ns, and succeeded in doing so. See also ibid., p. 438, in the biography of Rustam, where it is said that Jah\u0101ng\u012br told him to send away the Arghuns. Perhaps the passage in Ma'\u0101\u1e63ir, p. 438, which according to Blochmann, p. 314, means that Rustam ill-treated the Arghuns, rather means that he intrigued with them but oppressed the peasantry.\nOne of the servants of the Court was appointed to summon him, and I sent for him to Court. On the 26th Urdibihisht they brought him. As he had committed great oppression on the people of God, and inquiry into this was due according to the requirements of justice, I handed him over to An\u012br\u0101\u2019i Singh-dalan that he might enquire into the facts, and that if guilty he might receive prompt punishment and be a warning to others. In those days the news also came of the defeat of A\u1e25d\u0101d, the Afghan. The facts are that Mu\u2019taqid Kh\u0101n came to P\u016blam\u00b9 Guzar (ferry ?), in the district of Peshawar, with an army, and Kh\u0101n Daur\u0101n with another force in Afghanistan and blocked the path of that rascal (lit. black-faced one). Meanwhile a letter came to Mu\u2019taqid Kh\u0101n from Pish Bulagh that A\u1e25d\u0101d had gone to Ko\u1e6d T\u012br\u0101h, which is 8 kos from Jalalabad, with a large number of horse and foot, and had killed a few of those who had chosen to be loyal and obey, and made prisoners of others, and was about to send them to T\u012br\u0101h, and intended to make a raid on Jalalabad and Pish Bulagh. Immediately on hearing this news Mu\u2019taqid Kh\u0101n started in great haste with the troops he had with him. When he arrived at Pish Bulagh he sent out spies to ascertain about the enemy. On the morning of Wednesday, the 6th, news reached him that A\u1e25d\u0101d was in the same place. Placing his trust on the favour of God, which is on the side of this suppliant at the throne of Allah, he divided the royal army into two, and went towards the enemy, who, with 4,000 or 5,000 experienced men, had seated themselves haughtily in complete carelessness,\n\n\u00b9 Though the text has P\u016blam, the real word seems to be \u012alam or Ailam. Ailam Guzar appears to be a pass in a range of hills. It may, however, be a ferry on the Kabul River. That river seems to be also known as the Sh\u0101h \u2018\u0100lam, and there is a ferry on it of that name. The text speaks of Ko\u1e6d T\u012br\u0101h as 8 kos from Jalalabad, but T\u012br\u0101h is much further away. The B.M. MSS. have Kotal-i-T\u012br\u0101h, \u2018the T\u012br\u0101h defile.\u2019\nand did not suspect that besides Kh\u0101n Daur\u0101n\u2019s there was an army in the neighbourhood that could oppose itself to them. When news came that the royal forces were coming against that ill-fortuned man, and the signs of an army were becoming manifest, in a state of bewilderment he distributed his men into four bodies, and seating himself on an eminence a gunshot away, to get to which was a difficult matter, he sent his men to fight. The musketeers of the victorious army assailed the rebel with bullets, and sent a large number to hell. Mu\u2019taqid Kh\u0101n took the centre of his army to his advanced guard, and, not giving the enemy more than time to shoot off their arrows two or three times, swept them clean away, and pursuing them for 3 or 4 kos, killed nearly 1,500 of them, horse and foot. Those left of the sword took to flight, most of them wounded and with their arms thrown away. The victorious army remained for the night in the same place on the battlefield, and in the morning proceeded with 600 decapitated heads\\(^1\\) towards Peshawar and made pillars of the heads there. Five hundred horses and innumerable cattle and property and many weapons fell into their hands. The prisoners of Tir\u0101h were released, and on this side no well-known men were killed. On the night of Thursday, the 1st of Kh\u016brd\u0101d, I proceeded towards Pushkar to shoot tigers, and on Friday killed two of them with a gun. On the same day it was represented to me that Naq\u012bb Kh\u0101n had died. The aforesaid Kh\u0101n was one of the Saifi Sayyids, and was originally from Qazwin. The tomb of his father, Mir \u2018Abdu-l-La\u1e6d\u012bf, is at Ajmir. Two months before his death his wife,\\(^2\\) between whom and her husband there was\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Compare Price\u2019s Jah\u0101ng\u012br, p. 94. It appears from that account that Mu\u2019taqid alias Lashkar Kh\u0101n was originally called Ab\u016b-l-husain. According to the account there, the prisoners were brought to Jah\u0101ng\u012br with the decapitated heads of 17,000 (!) suspended from their necks!\n\n\\(^2\\) She was a daughter of M\u012br Mahm\u016bd, Akbar\u2019s secretary (Blochmann, p. 449).\na great affection, and who for twelve days was ill with fever, drank the unpleasant draught of death. I ordered them to bury him by the side of his wife, whom they had placed in the Khw\u0101ja's venerated mausoleum. As Mu'taqid Kh\u0101n had done approved service in the fight with A\u1e25d\u0101d, in reward he was exalted with the title of Lashkar Kh\u0101n. Day\u0101nat Kh\u0101n, who had been sent to Udaipur in the service of B\u0101b\u0101 Khurr\u0101m and to convey certain orders, came on the 7th Kh\u016brd\u0101d and gave good account of the rules and regulations made by B\u0101b\u0101 Khurr\u0101m. Fid\u0101'\u012b Kh\u0101n, who in the days of my princedom was my servant, and whom after my accession I had made bakhshi in this army, and who had obtained favour, gave up the deposit of his life on the 12th of the same month. M\u012brz\u0101 Rustam, as he showed signs of repentance and regret for his misdeeds, and generosity demanded that his faults should be pardoned, was, in the end of the month, summoned to my presence, and I satisfied his mind, and having given him a dress of honour, ordered him to pay his respects to me. On the night of Sunday, the 11th of the month of Tir, a female elephant in the private elephant stud gave birth to a young one in my presence. I had repeatedly ordered them to ascertain the period of their gestation; at last it became evident that for a female young one it was 18 months and for a male 19 months. In opposition to the birth of a human being, which is in most cases by a head delivery, young elephants are born with their feet first. When the young one was born, the mother scattered dust upon it with her foot, and began to be kind and to pet it. The young one for an instant remained fallen, and then rising, made towards its mother's breasts. On the 14th the assembly of Gul\u0101b-p\u0101shi (sprinkling of rose-water) took place; from former times this has been known as \u0101b-p\u0101shi (water-sprinkling), and has become established from amongst customs of former\ndays. On the 5th Amurd\u0101d (middle July, 1614) came news of the death of R\u0101ja M\u0101n Singh.\\(^1\\) The aforesaid Raja was one of the chief officers of my revered father. As I had sent many servants of the State to serve in the Deccan, I also appointed him. After his death in that service, I sent for M\u012brz\u0101 Bh\u0101o Singh, who was his legitimate heir. As from the time when I was prince he had done much service with me, although the chiefship and headship of their family, according to the Hindu custom, should go to Mah\u0101 Singh, son\\(^2\\) of Jagat Singh, the Raja\u2019s eldest son, who had died in the latter\u2019s lifetime, I did not accept him, but I dignified Bh\u0101o Singh with the title of M\u012brz\u0101 R\u0101ja, and raised him to the mansab of 4,000 personal and 3,000 horse. I also gave him Amber, the native place of his ancestors, and, soothing and consoling the mind of Mah\u0101 Singh, increased his former mansab by 500, and gave him as an \u012bn\u2019\u0101m the territory of Garha.\\(^3\\) I also sent him a jewelled dagger belt, a horse, and dress of honour. On the 8th of this month of Amurd\u0101d I found a change in my health, and by degrees was seized with fever and headache. For fear that some injury might occur to the country and the servants of God, I kept this secret from most of those familiar with and near to me, and did not inform the physicians and hakims. A few days passed in this manner, and I only imparted this to N\u016br-Jah\u0101n Begam, than whom I did not think anyone was fonder of me; I abstained from eating heavy foods, and, contenting myself with a little light food, went every day, according to my rule, to the public Diw\u0101n-kh\u0101na (hall of audience), and entered the Jharokha and ghusal-kh\u0101na (parlour).\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) M\u0101n Singh died in the Deccan in 1614, and apparently in the month of June.\n\n\\(^2\\) Text pidar by mistake for pisar.\n\n\\(^3\\) Garha, described as B\u0101ndh\u016b in Ma\u2019\u0101\u015fir, ii, 175. It is Garha-Katanga, i.e. Jabalpur.\nin my usual manner, until signs of weakness showed themselves in my skin.\\(^1\\) Some of the nobles\\(^2\\) became aware of this, and informed one or two of my physicians who were trustworthy, such as Hakim Mas\u012blu-z-zam\u0101n, Hak\u012bm Ab\u016b-l-q\u0101sim, and Hak\u012bm \u2018Abdu-sh-Shak\u016br. As the fever did not change, and for three nights I took my usual wine, it brought on greater weakness. In the time of disquietude, and when weakness prevailed over me, I went to the mausoleum of the revered Khw\u0101ja, and in that blessed abode prayed to God Almighty for recovery, and agreed to give alms and charity. God Almighty, in His pure grace and mercy, bestowed on me the robe of honour of health, and by degrees I recovered. The headache, which had been very severe, subsided under the remedies of Hak\u012bm \u2018Abdu-sh-Shak\u016br, and in the space of twenty-two days my state returned to what it was before. The servants of the palace, and indeed the whole of the people, made offerings for this great bounty. I accepted the alms of no one, and ordered that everyone in his own house should distribute what he wished among the poor. On the 10th Shahriwar news came that T\u0101j Kh\u0101n, the Afghan, governor of Thatta,\\(^3\\) had died; he was one of the old nobles of the State.\n\nDuring my illness it had occurred to me that when I completely recovered, inasmuch as I was inwardly an ear-bored slave of the Khw\u0101ja (Mu\u2018\u012bnu-d-d\u012bn) and was indebted to him for my existence, I should openly make holes in my ears and be enrolled among his ear-marked slaves. On Thursday, 12th Shahriwar,\\(^4\\) corresponding to the month of Rajab, I made holes in my ears and drew into each a shining pearl. When the servants of the palace and my loyal friends saw this, both those who\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Perhaps the meaning is that there was an eruption.\n\n\\(^2\\) Buzury\u0101n, which perhaps here means elder ladies of the harem.\n\n\\(^3\\) This is T\u0101sh Beg (Blochmann, p. 457). The text wrongly has Patna.\n\n\\(^4\\) Jah\u0101ng\u012br was born in this month, which then corresponded to Rajab.\nwere in the presence and some who were in the distant borders diligently and eagerly made holes in their ears, and adorned the beauty of sincerity with pearls and rubies which were in the private treasury, and were bestowed on them, until by degrees the infection caught the Ahadis and others. At the end of the day of Thursday, the 22nd of the said month, corresponding with the 10th Sha'ban, the meeting for my solar weighing was arranged in my private audience hall, and the usual observances were carried out. On the same day Mirz\u0101 R\u0101ja Bh\u0101o Singh, gratified and prosperous, returned to his native country with the promise that he would not delay (there) more than two or three months. On the 27th of the month of Mihr news came that Farid\u016bn Kh\u0101n Barl\u0101s had died at Udaipur. In the clan of Barl\u0101s no leader remained but he. As his tribe had many claims on this State and endless connection with it, I patronised his son Mihr \u2018Ali, and raised him to the mansab of 1,000 personal and horse. On account of the approved services of Kh\u0101n Daur\u0101n, I increased by 1,000 his mansab, which became 6,000 personal and 5,000 horse, original and increase. On the 6th \u0100b\u0101n the qar\u0101wuls (shik\u0101ris) reported that three tigers had been met at a distance of 6 kos. Starting after midday, I killed all three of them with a gun. On the 8th of the month the festival of the Dew\u0101li came on. I ordered the attendants of the palace to have games with each other for two or three nights in my presence; winnings and losings took place. On the 8th of this month they brought to Ajmir the body of Sikandar Mu\u2018\u012bn Qar\u0101wul (Shik\u0101ri), who was one of my old attendants and had done much service for me when I was prince, from Udaipur, which was the place where my son Sult\u0101n Khurr\u0101m was staying. I ordered the qarawuls and his fellow-tribesmen to take his body and bury it on the bank of R\u0101n\u0101 Shankar\u2019s tank. He was a good servant to me. On the 12th \u0100zar two daughters whom\nIsl\u0101m Kh\u0101n in his lifetime had taken from the Zamindar of K\u016bch (Behar), whose country is on the boundary of the eastern provinces, together with his son and 94 elephants, were brought before me. Some of the elephants were placed in my private stud. On the same day, H\u016bshang, Isl\u0101m Kh\u0101n\u2019s son, came from Bengal, and had the good fortune to kiss the threshold, and presented as offerings two elephants, 100 muhrs, and 100 rupees. On one particular night in Day I dreamt that the late king (Akbar) said to me: \u201cB\u0101b\u0101, forgive for my sake the fault of \u2018Az\u012bz Kh\u0101n, who is the Kh\u0101n A\u02bf\u1e93am.\u201d After this dream, I decided to summon him from the fort (of Gwalior).\n\nThere is a ravine in the neighbourhood of Ajmir that is very beautiful. At the end of this ravine a spring appears which is collected in a long and broad tank, and is the best water in Ajmir. This valley and spring are well known as H\u0101fiz Jam\u0101l. When I crossed over to this place I ordered a suitable building to be made there, as the place was good and fit for developing. In the course of a year a house and grounds were made there, the like of which those who travel round the world cannot point out. They made a basin 40 gaz by 40, and made the water of the spring rise up in the basin by a fountain. The fountain leaps up 10 or 12 gaz. Buildings are laid on the edge of this basin, and in the same way above, where the tank and fountain are, they have made agreeable places and enchanting halls and resting-rooms pleasant to the senses. These have been constructed and finished off in a masterly style by skilled painters and clever artists. As I desired that it should be called by a name\n\n---\n\n1 Is this an allusion to some complimentary remark of Sir Thomas Roe? Sir Thomas did not come to Ajmir till December, 1615, but Jah\u0101ng\u012br is here apparently writing of what happened a year after his visit to H\u0101fiz Jam\u0101l. The chronogram was 1024 (1615).\nconnected with my august name, I gave it the name of Chashma-i-N\u016br, or 'the fountain of light.' In short, the one fault it has is this, that it ought to have been in a large city, or at a place by which men frequently pass. From the day on which it was completed I have often passed Thursdays and Fridays there. I ordered that they should think out a chronogram for its completion. Sa'id\u0101 Gil\u0101n\u012b, the head of the goldsmiths, discovered it in this clever hemistich:\n\n\"The palace\\(^1\\) of Sh\u0101h N\u016bru-d-d\u012bn Jah\u0101ng\u012br\" (1024).\n\nI ordered them to put a stone with this carved upon it on the top of the portico of the building.\n\nIn the beginning of the month of Day, merchants came from Persia and brought pomegranates of Yazd and melons from K\u0101riz, which are the best of Khurasan melons, so many that all the servants of the Court and the Amirs of the frontiers obtained a portion of them and were very grateful to the True Giver (God) for them. I had never had such melons and pomegranates. It seemed as if I had never had a pomegranate or a melon before. Every year I had had melons from Badakhshan and pomegranates from Kabul, but they bore no comparison with the Yazd pomegranates and the K\u0101riz melons. As my revered father (may God's light be his witness!) had a great liking for fruit, I was very grieved that such fruits had not come to Hindustan from Persia in his victorious time, that he might have enjoyed and profited by them. I have the same regret for the Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u012b 'itr (so-called otto of roses), that his nostrils were not gratified with such essences. This 'itr is a discovery which was made during my reign through the efforts of the mother of N\u016br-Jah\u0101n Begam. When she was making rose-water\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Mahall-i-Sh\u0101h N\u016bru-d-d\u012bn Jah\u0101ng\u012br, 1024 (1615). See Proceedings A.S.B. for August, 1873, pp. 159\u201360.\na scum formed on the surface of the dishes into which the hot rose-water was poured from the jugs. She collected this scum little by little; when much rose-water was obtained a sensible portion of the scum was collected. It is of such strength in perfume that if one drop be rubbed on the palm of the hand it scents a whole assembly, and it appears as if many red rosebuds had bloomed at once. There is no other scent of equal excellence to it. It restores hearts that have gone and brings back withered souls. In reward for that invention I presented a string of pearls to the inventress. Salima\u00b9 Sult\u00e2n Begam (may the lights of God be on her tomb) was present, and she gave this oil the name of \u2018itr-i-Jahangiri.\u2019\n\nGreat difference appeared in the climates of India. In this month of Day, in Lahore, which is between Persia and Hindustan, the mulberry-tree bore fruit of as much sweetness and fine flavour as in its ordinary season. For some days people were delighted by eating it. The news-writers of that place wrote this. In the same days Bakhtar Kh\u00e2n Kal\u00e2want, who was closely connected with \u2018\u0100dil Kh\u00e2n, inasmuch as he (\u2018\u0100dil) married his own brother\u2019s daughter to him, and made him his preceptor in singing and durpat\u00b2 guftan, appeared in the habit of a dervish. Summoning him and enquiring into his circumstances, I endeavoured to honour him. In the first assembly I gave him 10,000 rupees in cash and 50 pieces of cloth of all sorts and a string of pearls, and having made him a guest of \u0100\u1e63af Kh\u00e2n, ordered him to enquire into his circumstances. It did not appear whether he had come without \u2018\u0100dil Kh\u00e2n\u2019s permission, or the latter\n\n\u00b9 Salima died in the 7th year, so that the discovery must have occurred some time before this mention of it.\n\u00b2 Hindustani, dhurpad, \u201cpetit po\u00ebme ordinairement compos\u00e9 de cinq h\u00e9mistiches sur une m\u00eame rime.\u201d \u201cIt was invented by R\u0101ja M\u0101n of Gwalior\u201d (Gar\u00e7in de Tassy, Hist. Litt. Hindouie, i, 12).\nhad sent him in this guise in order that he might find out the designs of this Court and bring him news about them. Considering his relationship to \u2018\u0100dil Kh\u0101n, it is most probable that he has not come without \u2018\u0100dil Kh\u0101n\u2019s knowledge. A report by M\u012br Jam\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn Husain, who at this time was (our) ambassador at Bijapur, corroborates this idea, for he writes that \u2018\u0100dil Kh\u0101n has, on account of the kindness which has been shown by H.M. (Jah\u0101ng\u012br) to Bakht\u0101r Kh\u0101n, been very gracious to him (Jam\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn). Every day he has shown him more and more favour, keeps him beside him at nights, and recites to him durpats, which he (\u2018\u0100dil Kh\u0101n) has composed, and which he calls nauaras\u00b9 (Juvenilia). \u201cThe remainder of the facts will be written on the day when I get my dismissal.\u201d\n\nIn these days they brought a bird from the country of Z\u012brb\u0101d (Sumatra, etc., Blochmann, p. 616) which was coloured like a parrot, but had a smaller body. One of its peculiarities is that it lays hold with its feet of the branch or perch on which they may have placed it and then makes a somersault, and remains in this position all night and whispers to itself. When day comes it seats itself on the top of the branch. Though they say that animals also have worship, yet it is most likely that this practice is instinctive. It never drinks water, and water acts like poison upon it, though other birds subsist on water.\n\nIn the month\u00b2 of Bahman there came pieces of good\n\n\u00b9 See Rieu, 741b, who calls the nauaras a treatise on music composed by Ibr\u0101h\u012bm \u2018\u0100dil Sh\u0101h II. This \u2018\u0100dil Sh\u0101h was Fir\u012bshta\u2019s patron, and reigned till 1626. Jam\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn is the dictionary-maker and friend of Sir T. Roe. The sentence about reporting the remainder of the facts seems to be an extract from his report. Mu\u1e25ammad W\u0101ris, in his continuation of the P\u0101dsh\u0101h-n\u0101ma, B.M. MS. Add. 6556, p. 438, mentions, with reprobation, that \u2018\u0100dil Sh\u0101h had given his niece in marriage to a singer.\n\n\u00b2 Translated Elliot, vi, 339.\nnews one after the other. The first was that the R\u0101n\u0101 Amar Singh had elected for obedience and service to the Court. The circumstances of this affair are these. My son of lofty fortune, Sult\u0101n Khurr\u0101m, by dint of placing a great many posts, especially in some places where most people said it was impossible to place them on account of the badness of the air and water and the wild nature of the localities, and by dint of moving the royal forces one after another in pursuit, without regard to the heat or excessive rain, and making prisoners of the families of the inhabitants of that region, brought matters with the R\u0101n\u0101 to such a pass that it became clear to him that if this should happen to him again he must either fly the country or be made prisoner. Being without remedy, he chose obedience and loyalty, and sent to my fortunate son his maternal uncle, Subh Karan, with Harid\u0101s Jh\u0101l\u0101, who was one of the men in his confidence, and petitioned that if that fortunate son would ask forgiveness for his offences and tranquillise his mind, and obtain for him the auspicious sign-manual,\\(^1\\) he would himself come and wait on my son, and would send his son and successor Karan to Court, or he, after the manner of other Rajas, would be enrolled amongst the servants of the Court and do service. He also begged that he himself might be excused from coming to Court on account of his old age. Accordingly my son sent them in company with his own Diwan Mull\u0101 Shukru-llah, whom after the conclusion of this business I dignified with the title of Af\u1e93al Kh\u0101n, and Sundar D\u0101s, his major-domo, who, after this matter was settled, was honoured with the title of R\u0101y R\u0101y\u0101n, to the exalted Court, and represented the circumstances. My lofty\n\n\\(^1\\) Lit. procure for him the sign of the blessed panja (five fingers). The sign-manual was that of Jah\u0101ng\u012br. See below. See also Tod\u2019s Rajasthan, reprint, i, 411, for a representation of the panja; also p. 383, note id.\nmind was always desirous, as far as possible, not to destroy the old families. The real point was that as R\u0101n\u0101 Amar Singh and his fathers, proud in the strength of their hilly country and their abodes, had never seen or obeyed any of the kings of Hindustan, this should be brought about in my reign. At the request of my son I forgave the R\u0101n\u0101\u2019s offences, and gave a gracious farman that should satisfy him, and impressed on it the mark of my auspicious palm.\\(^1\\) I also wrote a farman of kindness to my son that if he could arrange to settle the matter I should be much pleased. My son also sent them\\(^2\\) with Mull\u0101 Shukru-llah and Sundar D\u0101s to the R\u0101n\u0101 to console him and make him hopeful of the royal favour. They gave him the gracious farman with the sign-manual of the auspicious hand, and it was settled that on Sunday, the 26th of the month of Bahman, he and his sons should come and pay their respects to my son. The second piece of good news was the death of Bah\u0101dur, who was descended from the rulers of Gujarat, and was the leaven of disturbance and mischief (there). Almighty God had annihilated him in His mercy: he died of a natural illness. The third piece of news was the defeat of the Warz\u0101 (Portuguese Viceroy), who had done his best to take the castle and port of Surat. In the roadstead\\(^3\\) of the port of Surat a fight took place between the English, who had taken shelter there, and the Viceroy. Most of his ships were burnt by the English fire. Being helpless he had not\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) *Panja mub\u0101rak* (Tod\u2019s Rajasthan, i, 383 and 411).\n\n\\(^2\\) Perhaps the uncle and Harid\u0101s, or the \u012bnh\u0101, \u2018them,\u2019 may mean the farman. See Elliot, vi, 340, which has \u2018my letters.\u2019 Tod has translated this part of the T\u016bzuk, i, 382.\n\n\\(^3\\) The text has *khaurmiy\u0101n*, and I.O. 181 has *khaur-i-bandar*. *Khaur* means a bay or gulf in Arabic. The battle is that between Captain Downton and the Portuguese, which took place in January, 1615, and is described in Orme\u2019s Hist., Fragments, p. 351, etc. See also Danvers\u2019 \u201cPortuguese in India,\u201d ii, 170. The engagement was in the Swally channel.\nthe power to fight any more, and took to flight. He sent some one to Muqarrab Kh\u0101n, who was the governor of the ports of Gujarat, and knocked at the door of peace, and said that he had come to make peace and not to make war. It was the English who had stirred up the war. Another piece of news was that some of the Rajputs, who had determined to attack and kill \u2018Ambar (misprinted Gh\u012br), had made an ambush, and finding a good opportunity had gained access to him, when a slight wound had been inflicted on him by one of them. The men who were round \u2018Ambar (again misprinted Gh\u012br) had killed the Rajputs and taken \u2018Ambar to his quarters. A very little\\(^1\\) more would have made an end of him. In the end of this month, when I was employed in hunting in the environs of Ajmir, Mu\u1e25ammad Beg,\\(^2\\) an attendant on my fortunate son Sult\u0101n Khurr\u0101m, came and brought a report from that son, and stated that the R\u0101n\u0101 had come with his sons and paid his respects to the prince; \u201cthe details would be made known by the report.\u201d I immediately turned the face of supplication to the Divine Court, and prostrated myself in thanksgiving. I presented a horse, an elephant, and a jewelled dagger to the aforesaid Mu\u1e25ammad Beg, and honoured him with the title of Z\u016b-l-faq\u0101r Kh\u0101n.\\(^2\\) From the report it appeared that on Sunday, the 26th Bahman, the R\u0101n\u0101 paid his respects to my fortunate son with the politeness and ritual that servants pay their respects, and produced as offerings a famous large ruby that was in his house, with some decorated articles and seven elephants, some of them fit for the private stud, and which had not fallen into\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Elliot, vi, 340. As Mr. Rogers remarks, the sentence is not easily intelligible. Probably the translation should be, \u201cNo one remained (all the Rajputs having been killed) who could finish off Malik \u2018Ambar.\u201d\n\n\\(^2\\) Probably the father or grandfather of the Mu\u1e25ammad Beg Z\u016b-l-faq\u0101r who was a servant of Aurangz\u012bb (Ma\u2019\u0101\u0161\u012bru-l-umar\u0101, ii, 89).\nour hands and were the only ones left him, and nine horses.\n\nMy son also behaved to him with perfect kindness. When the R\u0101n\u0101 clasped his feet and asked forgiveness for his faults, he took his head and placed it on his breast, and consoled him in such a manner as to comfort him. He presented him with a superb dress of honour, a jewelled sword, a horse with a jewelled saddle, and a private elephant with silver housings, and, as there were not more than 100 men with him who were worthy of complete robes of honour (sar u p\u0101), he gave 100 sarupa and 50 horses and 12 jewelled khapwa (daggers). As it is the custom of the Zamindars that the son who is the heir-apparent should not go with his father to pay his respects to a king or prince, the R\u0101n\u0101 observed this custom, and did not bring with him Karan, the son who had received the \u1e6dik\u0101. As the hour (fixed by astrology) of the departure of that son of lofty fortune from that place was the end of that same day, he gave him leave, so that, having himself gone, he might send Karan to pay his respects. After he had gone, Karan also came and did so. To him also he gave a superb dress of honour, a jewelled sword and dagger, a horse with a gold saddle, and a special elephant, and on the same day, taking Karan in attendance, he proceeded towards the illustrious Court. On the 3rd Isfand\u0101rmuz my return to Ajmir from hunting took place. From the 17th Bahman up to that date, during which I was hunting, one tigress with three cubs and thirteen nilgaw had been killed. The fortunate prince encamped on Saturday, the 10th of the same month, at the village of Devr\u0101ni, which is near the city of Ajmir, and an order was given that all the Amirs should go to meet him, and that each should present an offering according to his standing and condition, and on the next day, Sunday, the 11th, he should have the good fortune to wait upon me. The next\nday the prince, with great magnificence, with all the victorious forces that had been appointed to accompany him on that service, entered the public palace. The hour for him to wait on me was when two watches and two gharis of the day had passed, and he had the good fortune to pay his respects, and performed his prostrations and salutations. He presented 1,000 ashrafis and 1,000 rupees by way of offering, 1,000 muhrs and 1,000 rupees by way of charity. I called that son forward and embraced him, and having kissed his head and face, favoured him with special kindnesses and greetings. When he had finished the dues of service and had presented his offerings and charities, he petitioned that Karan might be exalted with the good fortune of prostrating himself and paying his respects. I ordered them to bring him, and the Bakhshis with the usual ceremonies of respect produced him. After prostration and salutation were completed, at the request of my son Khurram, I ordered them to place him in front on the right hand of the circle. After this I ordered Khurram to go and wait on his mothers, and gave him a special dress of honour, consisting of a jewelled ch\u0101rqab (sleeveless vest), a coat of gold brocade, and a rosary of pearls. After he had made his salutation, there were presented to him a special dress of honour, a special horse with a jewelled saddle, and a special elephant. I also honoured Karan with a superb robe of honour and a jewelled sword, and the Amirs and mansabdars had the honour of prostrating themselves and paying their respects, and presented their offerings. Each of these, according to his service and rank, was honoured with favours. As it was necessary to win the heart of Karan, who was of a wild nature and had never seen assemblies and had lived among the hills, I every day showed him some fresh favour, so that on the second day of his attendance a jewelled dagger, and on the next day a special Iraqi horse with jewelled saddle, were given\nto him. On the day when he went to the darbar in the female apartments, there were given to him on the part of N\u016br-Jah\u0101n Begam a rich dress of honour, a jewelled sword, a horse and saddle, and an elephant. After this I presented him with a rosary of pearls of great value. On the next day a special elephant with trappings (tal\u0101yir) were given. As it was in my mind to give him something of every kind, I presented him with three hawks and three falcons, a special sword, a coat of mail, a special cuirass, and two rings, one with a ruby and one with an emerald. At the end of the month I ordered that all sorts of cloth stuffs, with carpets and cushions (named takiya) and all kinds of perfumes, with vessels of gold, two Gujrati carts, and cloths, should be placed in a hundred trays. The Ahadis carried them in their arms and on their shoulders to the public audience hall, where they were bestowed on him.\n\n\u1e62\u0101bit Kh\u0101n\u00b9 at the paradise-resembling assemblies was always addressing unbecoming speeches and making palpable allusions to I\u2019tim\u0101du-d-daulah and his son \u0100\u1e63af Kh\u0101n. Once or twice, showing my dislike of this, I had forbidden him to do so, but this was not enough for him. As I held very dear I\u2019tim\u0101du-d-daulah\u2019s goodwill towards me, and was very closely connected with his family, this matter became very irksome to me. As one night without reason and without motive he began to speak unpleasant words to him, and said them to such an extent that signs of vexation and annoyance became evident in I\u2019tim\u0101du-d-daulah\u2019s face, I sent him next morning, in the custody of a servant of the Court, to \u0100\u1e63af Kh\u0101n to say that as on the previous evening he had spoken unpleasant words to his father, I handed him over to him, and he might shut him up either there or in the fort of Gwalior, as he pleased; until he\n\n\u00b9 R.A.S. MS. has Day\u0101nat Kh\u0101n, and so has I.O. MS. 181.\nmade amends to his father I would never forgive his fault. According to the order \u0100\u1e63af Kh\u0101n sent him to Gwalior fort. In the same month Jah\u0101ng\u012br Quli Kh\u0101n was promoted to an increased mansab, and was given that of 2,500 personal and 2,000 horse. A\u1e25mad Beg Kh\u0101n, who is one of the old retainers of the State, committed some faults on the journey to the Subah of Kabul, and Qilij Kh\u0101n, who was the commander of the army, had repeatedly complained of his making himself disagreeable. Necessarily I summoned him to Court, and in order to punish him handed him over to Mah\u0101bat Kh\u0101n to confine him in the fort of Ran\u1e6dambhor. Q\u0101sim Kh\u0101n, governor of Bengal, had sent two rubies as an offering, and they were laid before me. As I had made a rule that they should bring before me after two watches of the night had passed the dervishes and necessitous people who had collected in the illustrious palace, this year also after the same manner I bestowed on the dervishes with my own hand and in my own presence 55,000 rupees and 190,000 bighas of land, with fourteen entire villages, and twenty-six ploughs,\\(^1\\) and 11,000 kharw\u0101r\\(^2\\) (ass-loads) of rice; I presented as well 732 pearls, of the value of 36,000 rupees, to the servants who by way of loyalty had bored their ears.\n\nAt the end of the aforesaid month news came that when four and a half gharis of night had passed on Sunday, the 11th of the month, in the city of Burhanpur, God Almighty had bestowed on Sult\u0101n Parwiz a son by the daughter of Prince Mur\u0101d. I gave him the name of Sult\u0101n D\u016br-andish\\(^3\\) (long-thoughted).\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) *Qulba.* It does not appear that this is a land-measure.\n\n\\(^2\\) *Kharw\u0101r.* It is a weight. See Jarrett, ii, 394, where a kharwar is said to be equal to ten Hindustani maunds.\n\n\\(^3\\) Probably this was the son who died in the 14th year (T\u016bzuk, p. 282).\nThe Tenth New Year's Festival after my Auspicious Accession.\n\nWhen 55 seconds had passed on Saturday, 1st Farwardin, in my 10th year, corresponding with the 8th\\(^1\\) of the month of \u015eafar (March, 1615), 1024 Hijra, the sun from the constellation of Pisces entered the house of honour of Aries. When three gharis had passed on the night of Sunday I seated myself on the throne of State. The New Year's feast and ceremonials were prepared in the usual manner. The illustrious princes, the great Khans, the chief officers and Ministers of State made their salutations of congratulation. On the 1st of the month the mansab of I'tim\u0101du-d-daulah was increased from 5,000 personal and 2,000 horse by 1,000 personal and horse. Special horses were given to the Kunwar Karan, Jah\u0101ng\u012br Quli Kh\u0101n, and R\u0101ja B\u012br Singh Deo. On the 2nd the offering of \u0100\u1e63af Kh\u0101n was laid before me; it was an approved offering of jewels and jewelled ornaments and things of gold, of cloth stuffs of all kinds and descriptions, and was looked over in detail. That which I approved was worth 85,000 rupees. On this day a jewelled sword with a belt and band (?) (band u b\u0101r) was given to Karan, and an elephant to Jah\u0101ng\u012br Quli Kh\u0101n. As I had made up my mind to proceed to the Deccan, I gave an order to 'Abdu-l-Kar\u012bm Ma'm\u016bri, to go to Mandu and prepare a new building for my private residence, and repair the buildings of the old kings. On the 3rd day the offerings of R\u0101ja B\u012br Singh Deo were laid before me, and one ruby, some pearls, and one elephant had the honour of being accepted. On the 4th day the mansab of Mu\u1e63\u1e6daf\u0101 Kh\u0101n was increased by 500 personal and 200 horse to 2,000 personal\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Should be 18th. See Elliot, vi, 341. I.O. 181 has 20th, and this is probably correct, bistam and hashtam being often mistaken for one another by the copyists. B.M. MS. Add. 26215 has d\u016bshamba, Monday, instead of shamba, Saturday.\nand 250 horse. On the 5th I gave a standard and drums to I'tim\u0101du-d-daulah, and an order was given him to beat his drums. The mansab of \u0100\u1e63af Kh\u0101n was increased by 1,000 personal and horse to 4,000 personal and 2,000 horse, and having increased the mansab of R\u0101ja Bir Singh Deo by 700 horse, I dismissed him to his own country, directing that he should present himself at Court at stated periods. On the same day the offering of Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Kh\u0101n was laid before me. Some of all the kinds of things pleased me. Kishan Chand, of the sons of the Rajas of Nagarkot, was honoured with the title of Raja. On Thursday, the 6th, the offerings of I'tim\u0101du-d-daulah were laid before me at Chashma-i-N\u016br; a large meeting had been arranged, and by way of favour the whole of his offerings were inspected. Of the jewels and jewelled things and choice cloth stuffs the value of 100,000 rupees was accepted, and the remainder given back. On the 7th day I increased by 1,000 personal the mansab of Kishan Singh, which had been 2,000 personal and 1,500 horse. On this day a tiger was killed in the neighbourhood of Chashma-i-N\u016br. On the 8th I gave Karan the mansab of 5,000 personal and horse, and gave him a small rosary of pearls and emeralds with a ruby in the centre, which in the language of the Hindus is called smaran (Sanskrit for 'remembrance'). I increased the mansab of Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Kh\u0101n by 1,000 personal and 400 horse, so as to make it 2,000 personal and 1,000 horse, original and increase. The mansab of H\u0101ji B\u012b \u016azbeg was increased by 300 horse, and that of R\u0101ja Shy\u0101m Singh by 500 personal, so as to make it 2,500 personal and 1,400 horse. On Sunday, the 9th, there was an eclipse of the sun, when twelve gharis of the day had passed. It began from the west, and four out of five parts of the sun were eclipsed in the knot of the dragon. From the commencement of the seizure until it became light eight gharis elapsed.\nAlms of all kinds, and things in the shape of metals, animals, and vegetables, were given to fakirs and the poor and people in need. On this day the offering of R\u0101ja S\u016braj Singh was laid before me; what was taken was of the value of 43,000 rupees. The offering of Bah\u0101dur Kh\u0101n, the governor of Qandahar, was also laid before me on this day; its total value came to 14,000 rupees. Two watches of the night had passed on the night of Monday, the 29th \u1e62afar (30th March, 1615), in the ascension of Sagittarius, when a boy was born to B\u0101b\u0101 Khurram by the daughter of \u0100\u1e63af Kh\u0101n; I gave him the name of D\u0101r\u0101 Shuk\u016bh. I hope that his coming will be propitious to this State conjoined with eternity, and to his fortunate father. The mansab of Sayyid \u2018Ali B\u0101rha was increased by 500 personal and 300 horse, so as to bring it to 1,500 personal and 1,000 horse. On the 10th the offering of Itib\u0101r Kh\u0101n was laid before me, and what was of the value of 40,000 rupees was accepted. On this day the mansab of Khusrau B\u012b \u016azbeg was raised by 300 horse, and that of Mangli Kh\u0101n by 500 personal and 200 horse. On the 11th the offering of Murta\u1e93\u0101 Kh\u0101n was laid before me. Of it seven rubies, one rosary of pearls, and 270 other pearls were accepted, and their value was 145,000 rupees. On the 12th the offerings of Mirz\u0101 R\u0101ja Bh\u0101o Singh and R\u0101wat Shankar were laid before me. On the 13th, out of the offering of Khw\u0101ja Ab\u016b-l-hasan, one qu\u1e6db\u012b (Egyptian?) ruby, one diamond, one string of pearls, five rings, four pearls, and some cloths, altogether the value of 32,000 rupees, were accepted. On the 14th the mansab of Khw\u0101ja Ab\u016b-l-hasan, which was 3,000 personal and 700 horse, was increased by 1,000 personal and 500 horse, and that of Waf\u0101d\u0101r Kh\u0101n, of 750 personal and 200 horse, by 2,000 personal and 1,200 horse. On the same day Mu\u1e63\u1e6daf\u0101 Beg, the ambassador of the ruler of Iran, had the good fortune to wait upon me. After\ncompleting the matter of Gurjistan (Georgia), my exalted brother sent him with a letter consisting of expressions of friendship and assurances of sincerity, with several horses, camels, and some stuffs from Aleppo, which had come for that fortunate brother from the direction of R\u016bm. Nine large European hunting dogs, for which a request had gone, were also sent by him.\n\nMurta\u1e93\u0101 Kh\u0101n, on this day, obtained leave to go for the capture of the fort of K\u0101ngra, the equal of which for strength they cannot point to in the hill country of the Panjab or even all the habitable world. From the time when the sound of Islam reached the country of Hindustan up to this auspicious time when the throne of rule has been adorned by this suppliant at the throne of Allah, none of the rulers or kings has obtained possession of it. Once in the time of my revered father, the army of the Panjab was sent against this fort, and besieged it for a long time. At length they came to the conclusion that the fort was not to be taken, and the army was sent off to some more necessary business. When he was dismissed, I gave Murta\u1e93\u0101 Kh\u0101n a private elephant with trappings. R\u0101ja S\u016braj Mal, son of R\u0101ja B\u0101so, as his country was near that fort, was also appointed, and his previous mansab was increased by 500 personal and horse. R\u0101ja S\u016braj Singh also came from his place and jagir and waited on me, and presented an offering of 100 ashrafis. On the 17th the offering of Mirz\u0101 Rustam was laid before me. Two jewelled daggers, one rosary of pearls, some pieces of cloth, an elephant, and four Iraq horses were accepted, and the rest returned; their value was 15,000 rupees. On the same date the offering of I\u2019tiq\u0101d Kh\u0101n, of the value of 18,000 rupees, was laid before me. On the 18th the offering of Jah\u0101ng\u012br Quli Kh\u0101n was inspected. Of jewels and cloth stuffs the value of 15,000 rupees was accepted. The mansab of I\u2019tiq\u0101d Kh\u0101n, which was 700 personal and 200 horse, I increased\nby 800 personal and 300 horse, so that with original and increase it came to 1,500 personal and 500 horse. Khusrau Bi \u016azbeg, who was one of the distinguished soldiers, died of the disease of dysentery. On the 8th day, which was Thursday, after two watches and four and a half gharis had passed, the sharaf (highest point of the sun's ascension) began. On this auspicious day I ascended the throne in happiness and prosperity, and the people saluted and congratulated me. When one watch of the day remained I went to the Chashma-i-N\u016br. According to agreement the offering of Mah\u0101bat Kh\u0101n was laid before me at that place. He had arranged beautiful jewels and jewellery, with cloth stuff and articles of all kinds that were pleasing to me. Among these, a jewelled khapwa (dagger), which at his request the royal artificers had made, and the like of which in value there did not exist in my private treasury, was worth 100,000 rupees. In addition to this, jewels and other things of the value of 138,000 rupees were taken. Indeed, it was a splendid offering. To Mu\u1e63\u1e6daf\u0101 Beg, the ambassador of the ruler of Iran, I gave 20,000 darab, or 10,000 rupees. On the 21st I sent robes of honour by the hand of \u2018Abdu-l-Ghaf\u016br to fifteen of the Amirs of the Deccan. R\u0101ja Bikramajit obtained leave to go to his jagir, and a special shawl (parm narm\\(^1\\)) was given to him. On the same day I gave a jewelled waist-dagger to Mu\u1e63\u1e6daf\u0101 Beg, the ambassador. I increased the mansab of Hushang, the son of Isl\u0101m Kh\u0101n, which was 1,000 personal and 500 horse, by 500 personal and 200 horse. On the 23rd, Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Kh\u0101n was promoted to the Subah of Behar. Zafar Kh\u0101n was ordered to present himself at Court. To the mansab of Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Khan, which was 2,000 personal and 1,000 horse, I added 500 personal and 1,000 horse. Saif Kh\u0101n on the same day was dismissed to his jagir, as well as\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Akbar used the word parm narm, 'very soft,' as a substitute for 'shawl' (Blochmann, p. 90).\nH\u0101ji B\u012b \u016azbeg, who was honoured with the title of \u016azbeg Kh\u0101n. Bah\u0101durul-mulk, who belonged to the army of the Deccan, and held the mansab of 2,500 personal and 2,100 horse, received an increase of 500 personal and 200 horse. An increase of 200 was made in the mansab of Khw\u0101ja Taq\u012b, which was 800 personal and 180 horse. On the 25th an increase of 200 horse was made in the rank of Sal\u0101mu-llah, the Arab, so that it became 1,500 personal and 1,000 horse. I presented Mah\u0101bat Kh\u0101n with the black piebald horse out of my special horses which the ruler of Iran had sent me. At the end of the day of Thursday I went to the house of B\u0101b\u0101 Khurr\u0101m and remained there till a watch of the night had passed. His second offering was laid before me on that day. On the first day he paid his respects he laid before me a celebrated ruby of the R\u0101n\u0101, which, on the day of his paying his respects, he had made an offering of to my son, and which the jewellers valued at 60,000 rupees. It was not worthy of the praise they had given it. The weight of this ruby was eight t\u0101nk,\\(^1\\) and it was formerly in the possession of R\u0101y Maldeo, who was the chief of the tribe of the R\u0101\u1e6dhors and one of the chief rulers (or Rays) of Hindustan. From him it was transferred to his son Chandar Sen, who, in the days of his wretchedness and hopelessness, sold it to R\u0101n\u0101 Uday Singh. From him it went to R\u0101n\u0101 Part\u0101p, and afterwards to this R\u0101n\u0101 Amar Singh. As they had no more valuable gift in their family, he presented it on the day that he paid his respects to my fortunate son B\u0101b\u0101 Khurr\u0101m, together with the whole of his stud of elephants, which, according to the Indian idiom, they call gheta ch\u0101r.\\(^2\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) According to Gladwin, 96 tanks = one sir. Four mashas make a tank, and a masha is about 18 grains troy.\n\n\\(^2\\) Text \u062e\u062a\u06cc\u0627\u060c kheta ch\u0101r. But the two B.M. MSS. which I have consulted have no y\u0101, and have khatta or ghatta ch\u0101r. I think that the word must be \u0918\u091f\u093e, ghata, which in Sanskrit means a troop\nI ordered them to engrave on the ruby that at the time of paying his respects R\u0101n\u0101 Amar Singh had presented it as an offering to Sult\u0101n Khurram. On that day certain other things from among the offerings of B\u0101b\u0101 Khurram were accepted. Among them was a little crystal box of Frank work, made with great taste, with some emeralds, three rings, four Iraq horses, and various other things, the value of which was 80,000 rupees. On the day on which I went to his house he had prepared a great offering, in fact there were laid before me things and rarities worth about four or five lakhs of rupees. Of these the equivalent of 100,000 rupees was taken away and the balance given to him.\n\nOn the 28th the mansab of Khw\u0101ja Jah\u0101n, which was 3,000 personal and 1,800 horse, was increased by 500 personal and 400 horse. In the end of the month I presented Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Kh\u0101n with a horse, a robe of honour, a jewelled dagger, a standard and drums, and dismissed him to the province of Behar. The office of \u2018ar\u1e93-mukarrir (reviser of petitions), that belonged to Khw\u0101jag\u012b H\u0101ji Mu\u1e25ammad, as he had died, I gave to Mukhlis Kh\u0101n, who was in my confidence. Three hundred horse were increased in the mansab of Dil\u0101war Kh\u0101n, who now had 1,000 personal and horse. As the hour of the leave-taking of Kunwar Karan was at hand, I was desirous of showing him my skill in shooting with a gun. Just at this time the qar\u0101wul\u0101n (shikaris) brought in news of a tigress. Though it is an established custom of mine only to hunt male tigers, yet, in consideration that no other tiger might be obtained before his departure, I went for the tigress. I took with me Karan, and said to him that I would hit it wherever he wished me to do so. After this arrangement I went to the place where they had\n\nof elephants assembled for war. I am not sure what the word ch\u0101r means, but perhaps it is only an affix. According to Ab\u016b-l-fa\u1e93l a herd of (wild) elephants is called sahn (Blochmann, p. 122).\nmarked down the tiger. By chance there was a wind and disturbance in the air, and the female elephant on which I was mounted was terrified of the tigress and would not stand still. Notwithstanding these two great obstacles to shooting, I shot straight towards her eye. God Almighty did not allow me to be ashamed before that prince, and, as I had agreed, I shot her in the eye. On the same day Karan petitioned me for a special gun, and I gave him a special Turkish one.\n\nAs on the day for his departure I had not given Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Kh\u0101n an elephant, I now gave him a special elephant, and I also sent an elephant to Bah\u0101dur\u016b-l-mulk and one to Waf\u0101d\u0101r Kh\u0101n. On the 8th Urdibihisht the assemblage for my lunar weighing was held, and I weighed myself against silver and other things, distributing them amongst the deserving and needy. Naw\u0101zish Kh\u0101n took leave to go to his jagir, which was in Malwa. On the same day I gave an elephant to Khw\u0101ja Ab\u016b-l-\u1e25asan. On the 9th they brought Kh\u0101n A\u02bf\u1e93am, who had come to Agra from the fort of Gwalior, and who had been sent for. Though he had been guilty of many offences, and in all that I had done to him I was right, yet when they brought him into my presence and my eye fell on him, I perceived more shame in myself than in him. Having pardoned all his offences, I gave him the shawl I had round my waist. I gave Kunwar Karan 100,000 darab. On the same day R\u0101ja S\u016braj Singh brought a large elephant of the name of Ran-r\u0101wat, which was a celebrated elephant of his, as an offering. In fact, it was such a rare elephant that I put it into my private stud. On the 10th the offering of Khw\u0101ja Jah\u0101n, which he sent me from Agra by the hand of his son, was laid before me. It was of all kinds of things, of the value of 40,000 rupees. On the 12th the offering of Kh\u0101n Daur\u0101n, which consisted of forty-five\\(^1\\) horse,\n\n\\(^1\\) Panj tuq\u016bz, i.e. 9 by 5. The text has \u062a\u0627\u0642\u0648\u0631, t\u0101q\u016br.\ntwo strings of camels, Arabian dogs (greyhounds), and hunting animals (hawks ?), was brought before me. On the same day seven other elephants from R\u0101ja S\u016braj Singh were also brought to me as an offering, and were placed in my private stud. Tahayyur Kh\u0101n, after he had been in attendance on me for four months, to-day got leave to go. A message was sent to \u2018\u0100dil Kh\u0101n. I impressed on him the profit and loss of friendship and enmity, and made an agreement (with Tahayyur Kh\u0101n) that all these words should be repeated to \u2018\u0100dil Kh\u0101n, and he should bring him back to the path of loyalty and obedience. At the time of his taking leave I also bestowed on him certain things. On the whole, in this short time, what with the gifts bestowed on him by me privately, by the princes, and those given him by the Amirs according to order, the account mounted up to about 100,000 rupees that he had received. On the 14th the rank and reward of my son Khurr\u0101m were fixed. His mansab had been one of 12,000 personal and 6,000 horse, and that of his brother (Parwiz) 15,000 personal and 8,000 horse. I ordered his mansab to be made equal with that of Parwiz, besides other rewards. I gave him a private elephant of the name of Panch\u012b Gaj,\u00b9 with accoutrements of the value of 12,000 rupees. On the 16th an elephant was given to Mah\u0101bat Kh\u0101n. On the 17th the mansab of R\u0101ja S\u016braj Singh, which was 4,000 personal and 3,000 horse, was increased by 1,000, and it was raised to 5,000. At the request of \u2018Abdu-llah Kh\u0101n the mansab of Khw\u0101ja \u2018Abdu-l-La\u1e6d\u012bf, which was 500 personal and 200 horse, was raised by 200, and it was ordered to be 1,000 personal and 400 horse. \u2018Abdu-llah, the son of Kh\u0101n A\u1e93am, who was imprisoned in the fort of Ran\u1e6dambhor, was sent for at the request of his father. He came to the Court, and\n\n\u00b9 The B.M. MSS. seem to have panch kunjar, \u2018five elephants,\u2019 i.e. equal to five elephants (?).\nI took the chains off his legs and sent him to his father's house. On the 24th, R\u0101ja S\u016braj Singh presented me with another elephant, called Fauj-sang\u0101r ('ornament of the army'), by way of offering. Although this is also a good elephant, and has been placed in my private stud, it is not to be compared with the first elephant (he sent), which is one of the wonders of the age, and is worth 20,000 rupees. On the 26th, 200 personal were added to the mansab of Badi\u2018u-z-zam\u0101n, son of Mirz\u0101 Sh\u0101hrukh; it was 700 personal and 500 horse. On the same day Khw\u0101ja Zainu-d-d\u012bn, who is of the Naqshbandi Khw\u0101jas, came from M\u0101war\u0101\u2019a-n-nahr and waited on me, bringing as an offering eighteen horses. Qizilb\u0101sh Kh\u0101n, who was one of the auxiliaries of the province of Gujarat, had come to Court without the leave of the governor. I ordered that an ahadi should put him into confinement, and that he be sent back to the governor of Gujarat, so that others might not desire to do the same.\n\nThe mansab of Mub\u0101rak Kh\u0101n Saz\u0101wal I raised 500 personal, so that it should be 1,500 personal and 700 horse. On the 29th I gave Kh\u0101n A\u2019\u1e93am 100,000 rupees, and ordered that the parganahs of D\u0101sna\\(^1\\) and K\u0101sna,\\(^1\\) which are equivalent to 5,000 personal, should be made his jagir. At the end of the same month I gave leave to Jah\u0101ng\u012br Qul\u012b Kh\u0101n, with his brothers and other relatives, to go to Allahabad, which had been appropriated to them as jagir. At this meeting twenty horse, a qab\u0101 (parm narm) of Cashmere cloth, twelve deer, and ten Arabian dogs were given to Karan. The next day, which was the 1st Kh\u016brd\u0101d, forty horse, the next day forty-one horse, and the third day twenty, amounting in the space of three days to 101 head, were given as a present to Kunwar Karan. In return for the elephant Fauj-sang\u0101r, an elephant worth 10,000 rupees out of\n\n\\(^1\\) In Sark\u0101r Delhi (Jarrett, ii, 287).\nmy private stud was presented to R\u0101ja S\u016braj Singh. On the 5th of the month ten turbans (ch\u012bra), ten coats (gaba), and ten waist-bands were given to Karan. On the 20th I gave him another elephant.\n\nIn these days the news-writer of Kashmir had written that a Mull\u0101 of the name of Gad\u0101'\u012b, a disciplined dervish, who for forty years had lived in one of the monasteries of the city, had prayed the inheritors of that monastery two years before he was to deliver over the pledge of his life that he might select a corner in that monastery as a place for his burial. They said, \"Let it be so.\" In short, he selected a place. When the time for his delivery came he informed his friends and relations and those who were dear to him that an order had reached him that, delivering over the pledge (of life) he had, he should turn towards the last world. Those who were present wondered at his words, and said that the prophets had no such information, and how could they believe such words? He said, \"Such an order has been given to me.\" He then turned to one of his confidants, who was of the sons of the Q\u0101z\u012bs of the country, and said: \"You will expend the price of my Koran, which is worth 700 tankas, in carrying me (to the grave).\" When you hear the call to Friday's prayer you will enquire for me.\" This conversation took place on the Thursday, and he divided all the goods in his room among his acquaintance and disciples, and went, and at end of the day bathed at the baths. The Q\u0101z\u012b-z\u0101da aforesaid came before the call for prayer, and enquired as to the health of the Mull\u0101. When he came to the door of the cell\n\n1 The text does not expressly say that the dervish foretold two years before his death the period of his death, but apparently Jah\u0101ng\u012br means this, for he goes on to speak of the time mentioned for his delivery. See also Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, p. 81, where the dervish is called H\u0101f\u012bz, and where it is added that the whole population of Srinagar followed the bier.\n\n2 Lit. give it, for the Koran cannot be directly sold.\nhe found the door closed and a servant sitting there. He asked the slave what had happened, and the servant said, \"The Mull\u0101 has enjoined me that until the door of the cell open of its own accord I must not go in.\" Shortly after these words were said the door of the cell opened. The Q\u0101\u1e93i-z\u0101da entered the cell with that servant and saw that the Mull\u0101 was on his knees with his face turned toward the qibla, and had given up his soul to God. Happy the state of the freed who can fly away from this place of the snares of dependence with such ease!\n\nBy the increase of 200 personal and 50 horse in the mansab of Karam Sen R\u0101\u1e6dhor, I raised it to 1,000 personal and 300 horse. On the 11th of this month the offering of Lashkar Kh\u0101n, which consisted of three strings of Persian camels and twenty cups and plates from Khi\u1e6d\u0101 (China) and twenty Arabian dogs, was brought before me. On the 12th a jewelled dagger was bestowed on Itib\u0101r Kh\u0101n, and to Karan I gave a plume (kalg\u016b) worth 2,000 rupees. On the 14th I gave a dress of honour to Sar-1 buland R\u0101y, and gave him leave to go to the Deccan.\n\nOn the night of Friday, the 15th, a strange affair occurred. By chance on that night I was at Pushkar. To be brief, Kishan, own brother to R\u0101ja S\u016braj Singh, was in great perturbation through Gobind D\u0101s, the Vakil of the said Raja having some time ago killed his nephew, a youth of the name of Gop\u0101l D\u0101s. The cause of the quarrel it would take too long to tell. Kishan Singh expected that, as Gop\u0101l D\u0101s was also the nephew of the Raja (S\u016braj Singh), the latter would kill Gobind D\u0101s. But the Raja, on account of the experience and ability of Gobind D\u0101s, relinquished the idea of seeking revenge for his nephew's death. When Kishan saw this neglect on the part of the Raja, he resolved himself to take\n\n1 Text pisar, 'son of Buland R\u0101y,' but from the B.M. MSS. it appears that pisar is a mistake for Sar.\nrevenge for his nephew, and not allow his blood to pass away unnoticed. For a long time he kept this matter in his mind, until on that night he assembled his brothers, friends, and servants, and told them that he would go that night to take Gobind D\u0101s\u2019s life, whatever might happen, and that he did not care what injury might happen to the Raja. The Raja was in ignorance of what was happening, and when it was near dawn Kishan came with Karan, his brother\u2019s son, and other companions. When he arrived at the gate of the Raja\u2019s dwelling he sent some of the experienced men on foot to the house of Gobind D\u0101s, which was near the Raja\u2019s. He himself (Kishan) was on horseback, and stationed himself near the gate. The men on foot entered Gobind D\u0101s\u2019s house, and killed some of those who were there on guard. Whilst this fight was going on Gobind D\u0101s awoke, and seizing his sword in a state of bewilderment was coming out from one side of the house to join the outside watchmen. When the men on foot had finished killing some of the people, they came out of the tent to endeavour to find out Gobind D\u0101s, and, meeting him, they finished his affair (killed him). Before the news of the killing of Gobind D\u0101s reached Kishan, he, unable to bear it any more, dismounted and came inside the dwelling. Although his men protested in a disturbed state that it was not right to be on foot, he would in no way listen to them. If he had remained a little longer and the news of his enemy having been killed had reached him, it is possible that he would have escaped safe and sound, mounted as he was. As the pen of destiny had gone forth after another fashion, as soon as he alighted and went in, the Raja, who was in his mahall (female apartment), awoke at the uproar among the people, and stood at the gate of his house with his sword drawn. People from all sides were aroused and came in against the men who were on foot. They saw what the number\nof men on foot was, and came out in great numbers and faced Kishan Singh\u2019s men, who were about ten in number. In short, Kishan Singh and his nephew Karan, when they reached the Raja\u2019s house, were attacked by these men and both of them killed. Kishan Singh had seven and Karan nine wounds. Altogether in this fight 66 men on the two sides were killed, on the Raja\u2019s side 30 and on Kishan Singh\u2019s 36. When the sun rose and illumined the world with its light, this business was revealed, and the Raja saw that his brother, his nephew, and some of his servants, whom he considered dearer than himself, were killed, and the whole of the rest had dispersed to their own places. The news reached me in Pushkar, and I ordered them to burn those who were killed, according to their rites, and inform me of the true circumstances of the affair. In the end it became clear that the affair had happened in the manner in which it has been written here, and that no further enquiry was necessary.\n\nOn the 8th Mir\u0101n \u0160adr Jah\u0101n came from his native place and waited on me with an offering of 100 muhrs. R\u0101y S\u016braj Singh was dismissed to his duty in the Deccan. I presented him with a couple of pearls for his ears and a special Kashmir shawl (parm narm). A pair of pearls were also sent to Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n. On the 25th I increased the mansab of Itib\u0101r Kh\u0101n by 600 horse, so as to bring it to 5,000 personal and 2,000 horse. On the same day Karan obtained leave to go to his jagir. He received a present of a horse, a special elephant, a dress of honour, a string of pearls of the value of 50,000 rupees, and a jewelled dagger which had been completed for 2,000 rupees. From the time of his waiting on me till he obtained leave, what he had had in the shape of cash, jewellery, jewels, and jewelled things was of the value of 200,000 rupees, with 110 horses, five elephants, in addition to what my son Khurram bestowed on him\nat various times. I gave Mub\u0101rak Kh\u0101n Saz\u0101wal a horse and an elephant, and appointed him to accompany him. I sent several verbal messages to the R\u0101n\u0101. R\u0101ja S\u016braj Singh also obtained leave to go to his native country, with a promise to return in two months. On the 27th, P\u0101yanda Kh\u0101n Moghul, who was one of the old Amirs of the State, gave up the deposit of his life.\n\nAt the end of this month news came that the ruler of Iran had executed his eldest son \u1e62afi Mirz\u0101. This was a cause of great bewilderment. When I enquired into it they said that at Darash, which is one of the noted cities of Gil\u0101n, he ordered a slave of the name of Bihb\u016bd to kill \u1e62afi Mirz\u0101. The slave found an opportunity, early in the morning on the 5th of Mu\u1e25arram, in the year 1024 (25th January, 1615), when the Mirz\u0101 was returning from the baths towards his house, and finished his affair for him with two wounds from a sword (sikhaki). After a great part of the day had passed, while his body lay between the water and the mud, Shaikh Bah\u0101\u2019u-d-din Mu\u1e25ammad, who was the best known man in the country for learning and holiness, and on whom the Shah had full reliance, reported the affair, and, obtaining leave to lift him up, took his corpse and sent it to Ardabil, where was the burial-ground of his ancestors. Although much enquiry was made of travellers from Iran, no one would say a word of this affair that satisfied my mind with regard to it. The killing of a son must have some powerful motive in order to do away with the disgrace of it.\n\n1 Blochmann, p. 387. Possibly he was the part author of a translation of B\u0101bar\u2019s Commentaries.\n2 The name is wrong. The Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, p. 84, has Rasht (Rashd), which is a well-known town on the Caspian.\n3 According to the Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma the true reading is sanjak\u012b (see p. 84). But Olearius, who gives a full account of the murder (p. 352 of English translation, ed. 1662), says Bihb\u016bd gave him two stabs with a chentze, which is a kind of poniard.\nOn the 1st of the month of Tir I gave an elephant of the name of Ranjit with its trappings to Mirz\u0101 Rustam and another to Sayyid \u2018Al\u012b B\u0101rha. Mirak Husain, a relation of Khw\u0101ja Shamsu-d-din, was appointed bakhshi and news-writer of the Subah of Behar, and took leave to go. I gave Khw\u0101ja \u2018Abdu-l-Lat\u012bf Q\u016bsh-begi (the falconer) an elephant and a dress of honour, and dismissed him to his jagir. On the 9th of the same month I gave a jewelled sword to Kh\u0101n Daur\u0101n, and a jewelled dagger was sent for Allahd\u0101d, the son of Jal\u0101l\u0101 the Afghan, who had become loyal. On the 13th took place the meeting for the festival of the \u0100b-p\u0101sh\u0101n\\(^1\\) (rose-water scattering), and the servants of the Court amused themselves with sprinkling rose-water over each other. On the 17th, Am\u0101nat Kh\u0101n was appointed to the port of Cambay. As Muqarrab Kh\u0101n proposed to come to Court, the (charge of the) aforesaid port was changed. On the same day I sent a jewelled waist-dagger to my son Parwiz. On the 18th the offering of Kh\u0101nkh\u0101n\u0101n was laid before me. He had prepared all kinds of jewellery and other things, jewels with jewelled things, such as three rubies and 103 pearls, 100 rubies (y\u0101q\u016bt), two jewelled daggers and an aigrette adorned with rubies and pearls, a jewelled water-jar, a jewelled sword, a quiver bound with velvet, and a diamond ring, altogether of the value of about 100,000 rupees, in addition to jewels and jewelled things, cloth from the Deccan and Carnatic, and all kinds of gilt and plain things, with fifteen elephants and a horse whose mane reached the ground. The offering of Sh\u0101h-naw\u0101z Kh\u0101n (his son) also, consisting of five elephants, 300 pieces of all kinds of cloth, was brought before me. On the 8th I honoured H\u016bshang with the title of Ikr\u0101m Kh\u0101n. R\u016bz-afz\u016bn, who was one of the princes of the Subah of Behar, and who had\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) A Persian festival in memory of a rain which fell on the 13th Tir and put an end to a famine (Bah\u0101r-i-\u2018ajam).\nbeen from his youth one of the permanent servants of the Court, having been honoured by admission into Islam, was made Raja of the province of his father, R\u0101ja Sangr\u0101m.\\(^1\\) Though the latter had been killed in opposing the leaders of the State, I gave him an elephant and leave to go to his native place. An elephant was presented to Jah\u0101ng\u012br Quli Kh\u0101n. On the 24th, Jagat Singh, son of Kunwar Karan, who was in his 12th year, came and waited on me, and presented petitions from his grandfather, the R\u0101n\u0101 Amar Singh, and from his father. The signs of nobility and high birth were evident on his face. I pleased him with a dress of honour and kindness. To the mansab of M\u012brz\u0101 \u2018\u012as\u0101 Tarkh\u0101n an addition of 200 personal was made, so that it attained to 1,200 personal and 300 horse. In the end of the month, having honoured Shaikh Husain Rohila with the title of Mub\u0101riz Kh\u0101n, I dismissed him to his jagir. Ten thousand darabs (5,000 rupees) were given to the relations of M\u012brz\u0101 Sharafu-d-din Husain K\u0101shgh\u0101ri, who at this time had come and had the honour of kissing the threshold. On the 5th Amurd\u0101d, to the mansab of R\u0101ja Nathmal, which was 1,500 personal and 1,100 horse, an addition of 500 personal and 100 horse was made. On the 7th, Kesho (D\u0101s) M\u0101r\u016b, who had a jagir in the Sarkar of Orissa, and who had been sent for to Court on account of a complaint\\(^2\\) against the governor of the Subah of that place, came and paid his respects. He produced as an offering four elephants. As I had a great desire to see my farzand (son) Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n (Lodi), and for the purpose of enquiring into important matters connected with the Deccan, it was necessary for him to come at once, I sent for him. On Tuesday, the 8th of the same\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Sangr\u0101m was Raja of Kharkpur in Behar, and was killed in battle with Jah\u0101ng\u012br Quli Kh\u0101n (Blochmann, p. 446, note).\n\n\\(^2\\) Shakw\u0101\u2019i-s\u0101\u1e25ib-i-S\u016bba. I presume it means a complaint against the governor, and perhaps one made by Kesho.\nmonth, he waited on me, and presented as an offering 1,000 muhrs, 1,000 rupees, 4 rubies, 20 pearls, 1 emerald, and a jewelled ph\u016bl kat\u0101ra, the total value being 50,000 rupees. On the night of Sunday, as it was the anniversary of the great Khw\u0101ja (Mu\u2018\u012bnu-d-d\u012bn), I went to his revered mausoleum, and remained there till midnight. The attendants and Sufis exhibited ecstatic states, and I gave the fakirs and attendants money with my own hand; altogether there were expended 6,000 rupees in cash, 100 saub-kurta (a robe down to the ankles), 70 rosaries of pearls, coral and amber, etc. Mah\u0101 Singh, grandson of R\u0101ja M\u0101n Singh, was honoured with the title of Raja, and a standard and drums given him. On the 16th an Iraq horse out of my private stable and another horse were presented to Mah\u0101bat Kh\u0101n. On the 19th an elephant was given to Kh\u0101n A\u2018\u1e93am. On the 20th, 200 horse were added to the mansab of Kesho (D\u0101s) M\u0101r\u016b, which was 2,000 personal and 1,000 horse, and he was dignified with a dress of honour. An increase of 200 personal and horse was made to the mansab of Khw\u0101ja \u2018\u0100qil, which was 1,200 personal and 600 horse. On the 22nd, Mirz\u0101 R\u0101ja Bh\u0101o Singh took leave to go to Amber, which was his ancient native place, and had given him a special Kashmir ph\u016bp (?) robe. On the 25th, Ahmad Beg Kh\u0101n, who was imprisoned at Ran\u1e6dambhor, paid his respects to me, and his offences were pardoned on account of his former services. On the 28th, Muqarrab Kh\u0101n came from the Subah of Gujarat and waited on me, and offered an aigrette and a jewelled throne. An increase of 500 personal and horse was made to the mansab of Sal\u0101mu-llah, the Arab, and it was brought to 2,000 personal and 1,100 horse. On the 1st of the month of Shahriwar the following increases were made\n\n---\n\n1 The pearls are omitted in the MSS.\n2 It is ph\u016bl in MS. No. 181.\n3 Takht\u012b, qu. a signet? No. 181 has a l\u0101l takht\u012b.\nin the rank of a number of men who were going on service to the Deccan:\u2014To Mub\u0101riz Kh\u0101n 300 horse, making 1,000 personal and horse. N\u0101hir Kh\u0101n was also raised to 1,000 personal and horse. Dil\u0101war Kh\u0101n was raised by 300 horse to 2,500 personal and horse. Mangli Kh\u0101n\u2019s rank was increased by 200 horse to 1,500 personal and 1,000 horse. Girdhar, the son of Ray S\u0101l, had the rank of 800 personal and horse bestowed on him, and Ilf Kh\u0101n Qiy\u0101m Kh\u0101n the same mansab, original and increase. Y\u0101dg\u0101r \u1e24usain was raised to 700 personal and 500 horse, and Kam\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn, son of Sh\u012br Kh\u0101n, to the same mansab. One hundred and fifty horse were added to the rank of Sayyid \u2018Abdu-llah B\u0101rha, which then came to 700 personal and 300 horse, original and increase.\n\nOn the 8th of the said month I bestowed one N\u016br-jah\u0101n\u012b muhr, which is equal to 6,400 rupees, on Mu\u1e63\u1e6daf\u0101 Beg, the ambassador of the ruler of Iran, and presented five cheetahs to Q\u0101sim Kh\u0101n, governor of Bengal. Mirz\u0101 Mur\u0101d, eldest son of Mirz\u0101 Rustam, on the 12th of the same month was honoured with the title of Iltif\u0101t Kh\u0101n.\n\nOn the night of the 16th, corresponding with the Shab-i-bar\u0101t (consecrated to the memory of forefathers), I ordered them to light lamps on the hills round the \u0100n\u0101 S\u0101gar tank and on its banks, and went myself to look at them. The reflection of the lamps fell on the water and had a wonderful appearance. I passed the most of that night with the ladies of the mahall on the bank of that tank.\n\nOn the 17th, Mirz\u0101 Jam\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn \u1e24usain,\u00b9 who had gone as an ambassador to Bijapur, came and waited on me, and presented three rings, the stone of one of which was a cornelian from Yemen, of great beauty and pureness of water, the like of which is seldom seen among the cornelians of Yemen. \u2018\u0100dil Kh\u0101n sent a person of the name of Sayyid Kab\u012br Kh\u0101n on his own part with the said\n\n\u00b9 Sir Thomas Roe\u2019s friend.\nMir, and forwarded as offerings elephants with gold and silver fittings, Arab horses, jewels and jewelled things, and all kinds of cloth made in that country. On the 24th of this month they were brought before me with a letter he had brought. On the same day the assembly for my solar weighing was held. On the 26th, Mu\u1e63\u1e6daf\u0101 Beg, the ambassador, took his leave. In addition to what had been bestowed on him during the time of his attendance, I gave him 20,000 rupees more in cash and a dress of honour, and in answer to the letter he had brought sent a friendly letter written in the perfection of friendship. On the 4th of the month of Mihr the mansab of M\u012br Jam\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn \u1e24usain, which was 2,000 personal and 500 horse, was fixed at 4,000 personal and 2,000 horse. On the 5th, Mah\u0101bat Kh\u0101n, in company with Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n, who had been appointed to serve in the Deccan, at the hour that had been appointed for him, took his leave; he was honoured with a dress of honour, a jewelled dagger, a ph\u016bl ka\u1e6d\u0101ra, a special sword, and an elephant. On the 8th, Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n took his leave, and I presented him with a dress of honour, and a special n\u0101d\u012br\u012b (a dress), and an ambling horse with a saddle, a special elephant, and a special sword. On the same date 1,700 horse of those under the command of Mah\u0101bat Kh\u0101n were ordered to have assignments (tankhw\u0101h) for two or three horses given them. The whole of the men who were at this time appointed for service in the Deccan were 330 mansabdars, 3,000 ahadis, 700 horse from the \u016aymaqs, and 3,000 Dalaz\u0101k Afghans. Altogether there were 30,000\\(^1\\) cavalry, and 3,000,000 rupees of treasure, and an efficient artillery, and war elephants. They proceeded on this duty. The mansab of Sarbuland R\u0101y was increased by 500 personal and 260 horse, and came to 2,000 personal and 1,500 horse. B\u0101lj\u016b, nephew of Qilij Kh\u0101n, was\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Text wrongly has 3 instead of 30.\npromoted to the mansab of 1,000 personal and 700 horse, original and increase. I also increased R\u0101ja Kishan D\u0101s\u2019s mansab by 500. At the request of Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n, the mansab of Sh\u0101hb\u0101z Kh\u0101n Lodi, who belonged to the Deccan force, was fixed, original and increase, at 2,000 personal and 1,000 horse; and 200 horse were added to the mansab of Waz\u012br Kh\u0101n. The mansab of Suhr\u0101b Kh\u0101n, son of Mirz\u0101 Rustam, was fixed at 1,000 personal and 400 horse, original and increase. On the 14th of the same month 1,000 was added to the mansab of M\u012br Jam\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn Husain, and by increasing it also by 500 horse he was raised to the exalted rank of 5,000 personal and 2,500 horse. On the 19th, R\u0101ja S\u016braj Singh, with his son Gaj Singh, who had gone home, came and paid their respects, and presented as offerings 100 muhrs and 1,000 rupees. I gave Sayyid Kab\u012br, who had been sent by \u2018\u0100dil Kh\u0101n, one N\u016brjah\u0101n\u012b muhr, which weighed 500 t\u016blcha. On the 23rd, ninety elephants of those which Q\u0101sim Kh\u0101n had acquired from the conquest of the country of K\u016bch (Behar), and the conquest of the Maghs and the zamindars of Orissa, were brought before me and placed in the special elephant houses. On the 26th, Ir\u0101dat Kh\u0101n was raised to the rank of M\u012br-s\u0101m\u0101n\u012b (head butler), Mu\u2019tamad Kh\u0101n to that of Bakhshi of the Ahadis, Muhammad Riz\u0101 J\u0101bir\u012b to that of Bakhshi of the Subah of the Panjab and news-writer of that place. Sayyid Kab\u012br, who had come on the part of \u2018\u0100dil Kh\u0101n to beg pardon for the offences of the rulers (dumy\u0101-d\u0101r\u0101n) of the Deccan, and to promise the restoration of the fort of Ahmadnagar and the royal territory which had been taken out of the possession of the chiefs of the victorious State through the rebellion of certain rebels, came and waited on me, and obtained leave to go on this date; and, having received a dress of honour, an elephant, and a horse, started off. As R\u0101ja R\u0101j Singh Kachhw\u0101ha had died in the Deccan, I promoted his son R\u0101m D\u0101s\nto the mansab of 1,000 personal and 400 horse. On the 4th of \u0100b\u0101n, drums were given to Saif Kh\u0101n B\u0101rha and his mansab increased by 300 horse, so as to bring it up to 3,000 personal and 2,000 horse. On the same date I released R\u0101ja M\u0101n, who was in confinement in the fort of Gwalior, on the security of Murta\u1e93\u0101 Kh\u0101n, and, confirming his mansab, sent him to the said Kh\u0101n for duty at the fort of K\u0101ngra. At the request of Kh\u0101n Daur\u0101n, an increase of 300 horse was ordered to the mansab of \u0160\u0101diq Kh\u0101n, raising it to 1,000 personal and horse. Mirz\u0101 \u2018\u012as\u0101 Tarkh\u0101n came from the province of Sambhal, which was his jagir, and waited on me, and offered 100 muhrs. On the 16th, R\u0101ja S\u016braj Singh obtained leave to go to his duty in the Deccan, and I increased his mansab by 300 horse, so as to make it 5,000 personal and 3,300 horse; he received a dress of honour and a horse, and started. On the 18th I confirmed the mansab of Mirz\u0101 \u2018\u012as\u0101, original and increase, at 1,500 personal and 800 horse, and gave him an elephant and a dress of honour, and he took leave to go to the Deccan.\n\nOn the same day the news of the death of the wretch Chin Qilij was received by a letter from Jah\u0101ng\u012br Quli Kh\u0101n. After the death of Qilij Kh\u0101n, who was one of the old servants of this State, I had made this inauspicious man an Amir, and shown him great favour, and given him in jagir such a place as Jaunpur. I also sent his other brothers and relations with him and made them his deputies. He had one brother of the name of Lahori,\u00b9 of a very wicked disposition. It was reported to me that the servants of God (people) were greatly oppressed by his conduct. I sent an ahadi to bring him (Lahori) from Jaunpur. At the coming of the ahadi, suspicion without any cause prevailed over Chin Qilij, and it came into his mind to run away, taking\n\n\u00b9 Apparently because born in Lahore (see Blochmann, p. 500).\nhis misguided brother with him. Leaving his mansab, his government, place, and jagir, money, property, children, and people, he took a little money and gold and a few jewels and went with a small body among the zamindars. This news arrived a few days ago and caused great astonishment. In short, to whatever zamindar he went he took money\\(^1\\) from him (?) and then let him go (?), until news came that he had entered the country of Johat.\\(^2\\) When this news reached Jah\u0101ng\u012br Quli Kh\u0101n, he sent some of his men to take and bring that thoughtless one. They took him as soon as they arrived, and were intending to take him to Jah\u0101ng\u012br Quli Kh\u0101n, when he at that very moment went to hell. Some of those who had accompanied him said that for some days previously he had contracted an illness and it had killed him. But this was heard of him as well, that he committed suicide, in order that they might not take him to Jah\u0101ng\u012br Quli Kh\u0101n in this state. In any case, they brought his body with his children and servants who were with him to Allahabad. They made away with most of the money that he had, and the zamindars took it from him. Alas, that salt (i.e. loyalty) should not have brought such black-faced wretches to condign punishment!\n\n\u201cBehind the duty that lies on all people is the duty to the sovereign and benefactor\u201d (?).\\(^3\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) According to I.O. MS. 181 every zamindar took some money from Ch\u012bn Qil\u012bj and sent him out of his estate, and this seems to be the probable meaning, for we are told later on that the zamindars plundered Ch\u012bn Qil\u012bj.\n\n\\(^2\\) Tirhut. R.A.S. MS. has \u201cIt chanced that the zamindar of this place was with Jah\u0101ng\u012br Quli, and the latter sent him with some people to seize Ch\u012bn Qil\u012bj.\u201d I.O. MS. has the same, and this seems correct. The text has \u201cIt chanced that the zamindar of that place was spending some days in that neighbourhood (?).\u201d Perhaps a negative has been omitted before \u2018spending.\u2019 I.O. MS. seems to have Johirhat as the name of the zamindar\u2019s estate.\n\n\\(^3\\) Apparently the verse is quoted with reference to Jah\u0101ng\u012br Quli\u2019s failure to exact retribution from the zamindars. There is an account of Ch\u012bn Qil\u012bj in the Ma\u2019\u0101\u0161\u012br, iii, 351.\nOn the 22nd, at the request of Kh\u0101n Daur\u0101n, 200 horse were added to the mansab of N\u0101d \u2018Ali Maid\u0101n\u012b, one of the officers appointed to Bangash, which brought it to 1,500 personal and 1,000 horse; 100 horse were also added to the mansab of Lashkar Kh\u0101n, which was 2,000 personal and 900 horse. On the 24th I confirmed the mansab of Muqarrab Kh\u0101n, which was 3,000 personal and 2,000 horse, and increased it to 5,000 personal and 2,500 horse. On the same day I bestowed the title of Khan on Qiy\u0101m, son of Sh\u0101h Mu\u1e25ammad Qandah\u0101r\u012b, who was an Amir-z\u0101da, and was in service as a huntsman. On the 5th of the month of \u0100zar a jewelled dagger was given to D\u0101r\u0101b Kh\u0101n, and by the hand of R\u0101ja S\u0101rang Deo dresses of honour were bestowed on the Amirs of the Deccan. As some (evil) things had been heard about \u1e62afdar Kh\u0101n, governor of Kashmir, I dismissed him from the government, and favouring Ahmad Beg Kh\u0101n on account of his previous services, I promoted him to be Subadar of Kashmir, and confirmed his mansab of 2,500 personal and 1,500 horse, honoured him with a jewelled waist-dagger and a dress of honour, and gave him leave. By the hand of Ihtim\u0101m Kh\u0101n I sent winter dresses of honour to Q\u0101sim Kh\u0101n, governor of Bengal, and the Amirs that were attached to that province. On the 15th of the month there was laid before me the offering of Maka\u2019i, son of Iftikh\u0101r Kh\u0101n, consisting of an elephant, got\\(^1\\) horses, and pieces of cloth. He was honoured with the title of Muruwwat Kh\u0101n. At the request of Itim\u0101du-d-daula, I had sent for Day\u0101nat Kh\u0101n, who was in the fort of Gwalior, and he had the good fortune to pay his respects; his property, which had been confiscated, was restored to him.\n\nAt this time Khw\u0101ja H\u0101shim, of Dahb\u012bd, who at this day vigorously maintains in Transoxiana the profession\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) G\u016bn\u1e6dh, a breed of small horses or ponies.\nof a dervish, and in whom the people of that country have great belief, sent a letter by the hand of one of his disciples pointing out his old devotion (to the royal family) and connection and friendship of his ancestors with this illustrious family, together with a *farj\u012b*\u00b9 and a bow and a couplet which the late king B\u0101bar had made for a saint of the name of Khw\u0101jag\u012b, who also belonged to that sect of dervishes. The last hemistich is as follows:\u2014\n\n\u201cWe are bound to the Khw\u0101jag\u012b and are servants to the Khw\u0101jag\u012b.\u201d\n\nI also with my own pen wrote some lines in the style of that writing, and sent impromptu quatrains with 1,000 Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u012b muhrs to the said Khw\u0101ja\u2014\n\n\u201cO thou whose kindness to me is ever more and more,\nThe State has remembrance of thee, O Dervish,\nAs from good tidings our heart is rejoiced,\nWe are glad that thy kindness passes all bounds.\u201d\n\nAs I ordered that whoever had the poetic temperament should recite (compose?) this quatrain,\u00b2 \u1e24ak\u012bm Mas\u012b\u1e25u-z-zam\u0101n said, and said very well\u2014\n\n\u201cAlthough we have the business of kingship before us,\nEvery moment more and more we think on the dervishes.\nIf the heart of our Dervish be gladdened by us\nWe count that to be the profit of our kingship.\u201d\n\nI gave the \u1e24ak\u012bm 1,000 muhrs for the composition of this quatrain. On the 7th of the month of Day, when I was coming back from Pushkar and returning to Ajmir, on the way forty-two wild pigs were taken.\n\nOn the 20th, M\u012br M\u012br\u0101n came and waited on me. A summary of his circumstances and of his family is\n\n\u00b9 A *farj\u012b* is a coat (see Blochmann, p. 89).\n\u00b2 Text *in rub\u0101\u02bfi*, \u2018this quatrain,\u2019 which does not seem to make sense. Perhaps *in* here should be *\u0101y\u012bn-i-rub\u0101\u02bfi*, \u2018the rules or the custom of a quatrain.\u2019 Similarly, *in kit\u0101bat* five lines down may be *\u0101y\u012bn-i-kit\u0101bat*, \u2018the rules of writing.\u2019\nnow written. On the side of his father\\(^1\\) he is the grandson of Mir Ghiy\u0101\u1e63u-d-d\u012bn Mu\u1e25ammad Mir Mir\u0101n, son of Sh\u0101h Ni\u02bfmatu-llah Wali. During the reigns of the \u1e62afawi kings the family had attained to great respect, so that Sh\u0101h Tahm\u0101sp gave his own sister J\u0101nish\\(^2\\) Kh\u0101nim to Sh\u0101h Ni\u02bfmatu-llah, and so on account of his being a great Shaikh and of his being an instructor he was made a relative and a son-in-law (of kings). On the side of his mother he was the daughter\u2019s son of Sh\u0101h Isma\u02bfil Kh\u016bn\u012b (Isma\u02bfil II, the Bloody). After the death of Sh\u0101h Ni\u02bfmatu-llah, his son Ghiy\u0101\u1e63u-d-d\u012bn Mu\u1e25ammad Mir Mir\u0101n received great consideration, and the late Sh\u0101h (Tahm\u0101sp) gave to his eldest son in marriage a daughter from the royal family. He gave the daughter of the above-mentioned Sh\u0101h Isma\u02bfil to another son of his, Khalilu-llah, to whom Mir Mir\u0101n was born. The aforesaid Mir Khalilu-llah, seven or eight years before this, had come from Persia and waited on me at Lahore. As he belonged to a high and saintly family, I was much interested in his affairs, and gave him a mansab and a jagir, and honoured and cherished him. After the seat of government was at Agra, in a short time he was attacked by bilious\\(^3\\) diarrhoea from eating too many mangoes, and in ten or twelve days gave up his soul to the Creator. I was grieved at his going, and ordered what he had left in cash and jewels to be sent to his children in Persia. Meanwhile Mir Mir\u0101n, who was 22 years old, became a qalandar and dervish, and came to me at Ajmir in a way that nobody on the road could recognize him. I soothed all the troubles of his mind and the miseries of his inward and outward condition,\n\n\\(^1\\) His father was Khalilu-llah, previously mentioned in the T\u016bzuk, and who had lately died (Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, p. 84, and T\u016bzuk, pp. 62 and 69). Tahm\u0101sp gave Ni\u02bfmatu-llah\u2019s daughter in marriage to his own son Isma\u02bfil.\n\n\\(^2\\) Kh\u0101nish Kh\u0101nim in Ma\u02bf\u0101\u1e63ir, iii, 339.\n\n\\(^3\\) Ish\u0101l-i-kabd.\nand gave him a mansab of 1,000 personal and 400 horse, and presented him with 30,000 darabs in cash. He is now in waiting and attendance on me.\n\nOn the 12th, Zafar Kh\u0101n, who had been removed from the Subah of Behar, came and waited on me, and made an offering of 100 muhrs, as well as three elephants. On the 15th of Day I increased the mansab of Q\u0101sim Kh\u0101n, the Subahdar of Bengal, by 1,000 personal and horse, so as to make it 4,000 personal and horse. As the diwan and bakhshi of Bengal, \u1e24usain Beg and T\u0101hir, had not done approved service, Mukhl\u012bs Kh\u0101n, who was one of the confidential servants of the Court, was nominated to these duties. I conferred on him a mansab of 2,000 personal and 700 horse, and also gave him a standard. The duty of \u2018arz-mukarrir (reviser of petitions) I ordered to be given to Day\u0101nat Kh\u0101n. On the 25th, Friday, the weighing of my son Khurr\u0101m took place. Up to the present year, when he is 24 years old, and is married and has children, he has never defiled himself with drinking wine. On this day, when the assembly for his weighing was held, I said to him: \u201cB\u0101b\u0101, thou hast become the father of children, and kings and kings\u2019 sons have drunk wine. To-day, which is the day of thy being weighed, I will give thee wine to drink, and give thee leave to drink it on feast days and at the time of the New Year, and at all great festivals. But thou must observe the path of moderation, for wise men do not consider it right to drink to such an extent as to destroy the understanding, and it is necessary that from drinking only profit should be derived.\u201d B\u016b \u2018Al\u012b (Avicenna), who is one of the most learned of hakims and physicians, has written this quatrain\u2014\n\n\u201cWine is a raging enemy, a prudent friend;\nA little is an antidote, but much a snake\u2019s poison.\nIn much there is no little injury,\nIn a little there is much profit.\u201d\nWith much trouble wine was given to him. I had not drunk it till I was 15\\(^1\\) years old, except when in the time of my infancy two or three times my mother and wet-nurses gave it by way of infantile remedy. They asked for a little spirit from my revered father, and gave it me to the extent of a tola mixed with water and rosewater to take away a cough, designating it as medicine. At the time when the camp of my revered father had been pitched in order to put down the disturbance of Y\u016bsufza\u2019e Afghans at the fort of Attock, which is on the bank of the Nil\u0101b (Indus) River, one day I had mounted to go out to hunt. When I had moved about a good deal and the signs of weariness had set in, a gunner of the name of Ust\u0101d Sh\u0101h-qul\u012b, a wonderful gunner out of those under my revered uncle M\u012brz\u0101 Mu\u1e25ammad \u1e24ak\u012bm, said to me that if I would take a cup of wine it would drive away the feeling of being tired and heavy. It was in the time of my youth, and as I felt disposed towards it I ordered Mahm\u016bd, the \u0100b-d\u0101r (person in charge of drinking water, etc.), to go to the house of \u1e24ak\u012bm \u2018Al\u012b and bring me an intoxicating draught. He sent me\\(^2\\) the amount of one and a half cups of yellow wine of a sweet taste in a little bottle. I drank\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Two I.O. MSS. and the R.A.S. MS. have 18 instead of 15. Elliot has \u201cup to my fourteenth\u201d year. Jah\u0101ng\u012br was born in Rab\u012b\u2018, 977, or 31st August, 1569, and the beginning of wine-drinking to which he refers must have taken place at earliest in January, 1586. He tells us that it was after the death of Mu\u1e25ammad \u1e24ak\u012bm, and at the time when his father was at Attock. Now Akbar arrived there on 15th Mu\u1e25arram, 994, according to Niz\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn, and on 12th Day, 994, according to Ab\u016b-l-fa\u017cl, iii, 976, i.e. about the end of December, 1585, and at that time Jah\u0101ng\u012br was 17 years and 4 months of age, or in his 18th year. He continued to drink heavily for nine years, i.e. till he was 26 (17+9), then he moderated for seven years, i.e. till he was 33, and he kept to that for fifteen years more, i.e. till he was 48. These years were lunar years, and he tells that at the time of writing he was 47 years and 9 months old, according to the lunar calendar. It seems to follow that the MSS. are right, and that we should read 18.\n\n\\(^2\\) Elliot, vi, 341.\nit, and found its quality agreeable. After that I took to drinking wine, and increased it from day to day until wine made from grapes ceased to intoxicate me, and I took to drinking arrack ('araq, spirits), and by degrees during nine years my potions rose to twenty cups of doubly distilled spirits, fourteen during the daytime and the remainder at night. The weight of this was six Hindustani sirs or one and a half maunds of Iran. The extent of my eating in those days was a fowl\\(^1\\) with bread and vegetables (lit. radish).\\(^2\\) In that state of matters no one had the power to forbid me, and matters went to such a length that in the crapulous state from the excessive trembling of my hand I could not drink from my own cup, but others had to give it me to drink, until I sent for \u1e24akim Hum\u0101m, brother of \u1e24akim Ab\u016b-l-fath, who was of the most intimate with my revered father, and informed him of my state. He, with excessive sincerity and unfeigned burning of heart, said to me without hesitation, \"Lord of the world, by the way in which you drink spirits, God forbid it, but in six months matters will come to such a pass that there will be no remedy for it.\" As his words were said out of pure good-will, and sweet life was dear to me, they made an impression on me, and from that day I began to lessen my allowance and set myself to take fil\u016bniy\u0101.\\(^3\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The two good I.O. MSS. have, not murgh or murgh\u012b, but tughdari or tughdari, a 'bustard,' unless indeed the word be tug\u1e25addi, 'breakfast.' But probably the word is tughdari, a bustard, and the reference is to the particular memorable day when he first drank wine. His food that day, he says, was a bustard with bread and a radish (turb).\n\n\\(^2\\) Blochmann. *Calcutta Review*, 1869, has 'turnips.'\n\n\\(^3\\) Fil\u016bniy\u0101. The word is not given in ordinary dictionaries, but it is explained in Dozy's Supplement. It is stated there that it is a sedative electuary, and that the word is derived from the Greek, being \u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, which is the name of an antidote or drug invented by Philon of Tarsus. There is an account of Philon and a reference to his drug in Smith's Classical Dictionary. Philon lived in or before the first century after Christ, and is referred to by Galen and others. The word as given there is \u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd. We are not told what it was made of.\nproportion as I diminished my liquor, I increased the amount of filuniya.\n\nI also ordered that the arrack should be diluted with wine of the grape so that there should be two parts wine and one part arrack. Every day I diminished the quantity I took, and in the course of seven years I brought it down to six cups. The weight of each cupful was $18\\frac{1}{4}$ misqals. It is now fifteen years that I have drunk at this rate, neither more nor less. And my drinking time is the night except on the day of Thursdays, as it is the day of the blessed accession. Also on the eve$^1$ of Friday, which is the most blessed eve of the week, and is the prelude to a blessed day (I do not drink). I drink at the end of each day with these two$^2$ exceptions, for it does not appear right that this eve (Thursday night) should be spent in neglect, and that there should be an omission (on Friday) of returning thanks to the True Benefactor. On the day of Thursday and on the day of Sunday I do not eat\n\nPrice's Jah\u0101ng\u012br, filuniya, misread there as Kelourica, is described by Jah\u0101ng\u012br as brother's son to tiry\u0101q, i.e. theriaca (see Price, p. 6). Tiry\u0101k or tiry\u0101q is supposed to be a Greek word (see Lane), and means an antidote against poison, etc. It is so used in the verse from Avicenna quoted by Jah\u0101ng\u012br to his son Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n. See D'Herbelot, s.v. Teriak. But it is also often used apparently as a synonym for opium. The mixing of wine with spirits was intended to dilute the potation, for hitherto Jah\u0101ng\u012br had been taking raw spirit. A misq\u0101l is said to be $63\\frac{1}{2}$ grains troy, and so 18 misqals would be about 3 ounces, and the six cups would be about $1\\frac{1}{2}$ lb. troy. In Elliot, Jah\u0101ng\u012br is made to say that he does not drink on Thursdays and Fridays. But the shab-i-jum'a, as Blochmann has pointed out elsewhere, \u0100yin translation, p. 171, n. 3, means Thursday night or Friday eve, and this is clearly the case here, for Jah\u0101ng\u012br speaks of the eve's being followed by a blessed day. It should be noted that there is no connection in Jah\u0101ng\u012br's mind between abstaining from wine and abstaining from meat. He did not eat meat on Thursdays or Sundays because he did not approve of taking life on these days, but he drank on both of them.\n\n$^1$ Cf. Blochmann's translation and Calcutta Review for 1869.\n\n$^2$ I understand the two exceptions (d\u016b ch\u012bz) to be that on Thursdays he drank in the daytime, contrary to the general rule of only drinking at night, and that on Thursday evenings he did not drink.\nmeat. Not on Thursday, because it is the day of my auspicious accession, and not on Sunday, because it is the birthday of my revered father, and he greatly honoured and held dear the day. After some time I substituted opium for filuniya. Now that my age has arrived at 46 solar years and 4 months, I eat eight surkhs (a red berry used as a weight) of opium when five gharis of day have passed, and six surkhs after one watch of night.\n\nI gave a jewelled dagger to \u2018Abdu-llah Kh\u0101n by the hand of Maq\u1e63\u016bd \u2018Ali. Shaikh M\u016bs\u0101, a relation of Q\u0101sim Kh\u0101n, was dignified with the title of Kh\u0101n, and promoted to the mansab of 800 personal and 400 horse, and was allowed to go to Bengal. The mansab of Zafar Kh\u0101n was increased to 500 personal and horse, and he was appointed to duty in Bangash. On the same day Mu\u1e25ammad \u1e24usain, brother of Khw\u0101ja Jah\u0101n, was given the faujdarship of the Sarkar of \u1e2ai\u1e63\u0101r and dismissed, his mansab being increased by 200 horse to raise it to 500 personal and 400 horse, with the gift of an elephant. On the 5th Bahman an elephant was conferred on Mir M\u012br\u0101n. When the merchant \u2018Abdu-l-Kar\u012bm left Iran for Hindustan, my exalted brother Sh\u0101h \u2018Abb\u0101s sent me by his hand a rosary of cornelian from Yemen and a cup of Venetian workmanship, which was very fine and rare. On the 9th of the same month they were laid before me. On the 18th some offerings of many kinds of jewelled ornaments, etc., which Sul\u1e6d\u0101n Parwiz had sent to me, were laid before me. On the 7th Isfand\u0101rmuz, \u0160\u0101diq, nephew of Itim\u0101du-d-daulah, who was permanently employed as Bakhshi, was honoured with the title of Kh\u0101n. I had also conferred this title on Khw\u0101ja \u2018Abdu-l-\u2018Az\u012bz. According to what was right, I called him by the title of \u2018Abdu-l-\u2018Az\u012bz Kh\u0101n and \u0160\u0101diq by that of \u0160\u0101diq Kh\u0101n. On the 10th, Jagat Singh, son of Kunwar Karan, who had obtained leave\nto go to his native country, when he took leave was presented with 20,000 rupees, a horse, an elephant, a dress of honour, and a special shawl. Five thousand rupees, a horse, and a dress of honour were also given to Harid\u0101s Jh\u0101l\u0101, who was one of the confidants of the R\u0101n\u0101 and tutor to Karan\u2019s son. By his hand I also sent a mace of gold (sha\u015bhpar\u012b) for the R\u0101n\u0101.\n\nOn the 20th of the same month, R\u0101ja S\u016braj Singh, son of R\u0101ja B\u0101so, who on account of the nearness of his dwelling-place to it had been sent with Murtaz\u0101 Kh\u0101n to capture the fort of Kangra, came on my summons and waited on me. The aforesaid Kh\u0101n had entertained certain suspicions with regard to him, and on this account, considering him an undesirable companion, had repeatedly sent petitions to the Court, and wrote things about him until an order was received to summon him.\n\nOn the 26th, Niz\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn Kh\u0101n came from Multan and waited on me. In the end of this year news of victory and prosperity came in from all sides of my dominions. In the first place, this was with regard to the disturbance of A\u1e25d\u0101d, the Afghan, who for a long time past had been in rebellion in the hill country of Kabul, and round whom many of the Afghans of that neighbourhood had assembled, and against whom from the time of my revered father until now, which is the 10th year after my accession, armies have always been employed. He by degrees was defeated, and, falling into a wretched state, a part of his band was dispersed and a part killed. He took refuge for some time in Charkh, which was a place on which he relied, but Kh\u0101n Daur\u0101n surrounded it and closed the road for entry and exit. When there remained no grass for his beasts or means of living for men in the fortress, he at night brought down his animals from the hills and grazed them on the skirts, and accompanied them himself, in order that he might set an example to his men. At last this\nintelligence reached Kh\u0101n Daur\u0101n. He then appointed a body of his leaders and experienced men to go into ambush on an appointed night in the neighbourhood of Charkh. That band went and hid itself at night in places of refuge, and Kh\u0101n Daur\u0101n rode on the same day in that direction. When those ill-fated ones brought out their cattle and let them loose to graze, and the ill-conditioned A\u1e25d\u0101d himself passed by the places of ambush with his own band, suddenly a dust rose in front of him. When they enquired it became known that it was Kh\u0101n Daur\u0101n. In a state of bewilderment he endeavoured to turn back, and the scouts announced to the aforesaid Kh\u0101n that it was A\u1e25d\u0101d. The Kh\u0101n gave his horse the reins and went at A\u1e25d\u0101d; the men who were in ambush also blocked the road and attacked him. The fight lasted till midday in consequence of the broken nature of the ground and the thickness of the jungle; at last defeat fell on the Afghans and they betook themselves to the hill: about 300 fighting men went to hell and 100 were taken prisoners. A\u1e25d\u0101d could not regain the stronghold and hold on there. Necessarily he turned his face towards Qandahar. The victorious troops, entering Charkh, burnt all the places and houses of those ill-fortuned ones, and destroyed and rooted them up from their foundations.\n\nAnother piece of news was the defeat of the ill-starred \u2018Ambar and the destruction of his unfortunate army. Briefly, a band of the influential leaders and a body of Bargis (Mahrattas), who are a hardy lot and who are the centre of resistance in that country, becoming angry with \u2018Ambar, showed an intention to be loyal, and begging for quarter from Sh\u0101h-naw\u0101z Kh\u0101n, who was in B\u0101l\u0101p\u016br with an army of royal troops, agreed to interview the said Kh\u0101n, and being satisfied, \u0100dam Kh\u0101n, Y\u0101q\u016bt Kh\u0101n,\n\n1 Elliot, vi, 343.\nand other leaders, and the Barg\u012bs J\u0101do\u00b9 R\u0101y and B\u0101p\u016b K\u0101tiy\u0101, came and interviewed him. Sh\u0101h-naw\u0101z Kh\u0101n gave each of them a horse, an elephant, money, and dress of honour, according to their quality and condition, made them hot in duty and loyalty, and marching from Balapur started against the rebel \u2018Ambar in their company. On the road they fell in with an army of the Dakhanis, whose leaders were Mahalld\u0101r,\u00b2 D\u0101nish (\u0100tash ?), Dil\u0101war, Bijli, Fir\u016bz, and others, and routed it.\n\n\u201cWith broken arms and loosened loins,\nNo strength in their feet, no sense in their heads.\u201d\u00b3\n\nThey reached the camp of that ill-starred one, and he from excessive pride determined to fight with the victorious troops. Having collected those rebels who were with him and \u2018\u0100dil Kh\u0101n\u2019s army and that of Qutbu-l-mulk together, and preparing their artillery, he started to meet the royal troops until a space of not more than 5 or 6 kos remained between. On Sunday, the 25th Bahman, the armies of light and darkness approached each other and the scouts became visible. Three watches of day had passed when cannon and rocket firing began. In the end D\u0101r\u0101b Kh\u0101n, who was in command of the vanguard, with other leaders and zealous men such as R\u0101ja Bir Singh Deo, R\u0101y Chand, \u2018Al\u012b Kh\u0101n the Tatar, Jah\u0101ng\u012br Quli Beg Turkm\u0101n, and other lions of the forest of bravery, drew their swords and charged the vanguard of the enemy. Performing the dues of manliness and bravery, they scattered this army like the Ban\u0101tu-n-na\u015bh (\u2018Daughters of the Bier,\u2019 i.e. the Great Bear); and not stopping there they attacked\n\n\u00b9 The MSS. have Jad\u016bn R\u0101y and B\u0101ba Chokanth (Ji\u016b Kanth ?). The Ma\u2019\u0101\u1e63iru-l-umar\u0101, ii, 646, has M\u0101l\u016bj\u012b K\u0101ntiya. The text has B\u0101b\u016b K\u0101ntiya.\n\u00b2 The text is corrupt. The Ma\u2019\u0101\u1e63ir, id., has \u0100tash instead of D\u0101nish.\n\u00b3 The text is corrupt. In the second line of the verse the text has guft, which seems meaningless, and two I.O. MSS. and B.M. MS. Add. 26,215 have jang, \u2018battle.\u2019 The R.A.S. MS. has p\u0101y, \u2018fect,\u2019 which seems to me the best reading. Possibly guft should be read kift, \u2018shoulder.\u2019\nthe enemy\u2019s centre. Turning on the army opposed to them, such a hand-to-hand struggle took place that the onlookers remained bewildered. For nearly two gharis this combat went on. Heaps of the dead lay there, and the ill-starred \u2018Ambar, unable to offer further opposition, turned his face to flight. If darkness\\(^1\\) and gloom had not come on at the cry of those black-fortuned ones, not one of them would have found the road to the valley of safety. The crocodiles of the river of conflict followed the fugitives for 2 or 3 kos. When horses and men could move no more and the defeated were scattered, they drew rein and returned to their places. The whole of the enemy\u2019s artillery, with 300 laden camels that carried rockets, war elephants, Arab and Persian horses, weapons and armour beyond reckoning, fell into the hands of the servants of the State, and there was no counting the slain and the fallen. A great many of the leaders fell alive into their hands. The next day the victorious troops, marching from the place of victory, proceeded to Kark\u012b, which was the nest of those owlish ones, and seeing no trace of them they encamped there, and obtained news that they during that night and day had fallen miserably in different places. For some days the victorious army, delayed at Kark\u012b, levelled with the dark earth the buildings and houses of the enemy, and burnt that populous place. In consequence of the occurrence of certain events, to describe which in detail would take too long here, they returned from that place and descended by the Rohan Khan\u1e0da Pass. In reward for this service I ordered increases to be made in the mansabs of a number who had shown zeal and bravery.\n\nThe third piece of news was the conquest of the province of Khokhar\u0101\\(^1\\) and the acquisition of the diamond\n\n\\(^1\\) It will be remembered that Jah\u0101ng\u012br has called \u2018Ambar\u2019s army the army of darkness, alluding perhaps to \u2018Ambar\u2019s being an Abyssinian.\nmines, which were taken by the excellent exertions of Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Kh\u0101n. This province is one of the dependencies of the Subah of Behar and Patna. There is a river there from which they procure diamonds. At the season when there is little water, there are pools and water-holes, and it has become known by experience to those who are employed in this work that above every water-hole in which there are diamonds, there are crowds of flying animals of the nature of gnats, and which in the language of India they call jh\u012bng\u0101(?).\u00b2 Keeping the bed of the stream in sight as far as it is accessible, they make a collection of stones (sangah\u012bn) round the water-holes. After this they empty the water-holes with spades and shovels to the extent of a yard or $1\\frac{1}{2}$ yards and dig up the area. They find among the stones and sand large and small diamonds\u00b3 and bring them out. It occasionally happens that they find a piece of diamond worth 100,000 rupees. Briefly, this province and this river were in possession of a Hindu Zamindar of the name of Durjan S\u0101l, and although the governors of the Subah frequently sent armies against him and went there themselves, in consequence of the difficult roads and thickness of the jungles they contented themselves with taking two or three diamonds and left him in his former condition. When the aforesaid Subah was transferred from Zafar Kh\u0101n, and Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Kh\u0101n was\n\n\u00b9 Elliot, vi, and Blochmann, p. 479, n. 3.\n\n\u00b2 Perhaps it should be phanga or feringha, a grasshopper, or it may be jh\u012bngur, a cockroach. Presumably the country was covered with thick jungle, and the cloud of insects indicated where water was. Erskine\u2019s MS. has chika. B.M. Or. 3276 has chika or jika. Possibly the word is jh\u012bngur, a cockroach (see Blochmann in J.A.S.B. for 1871, vol. xl). He quotes a Hindustani Dict., which says that the jh\u012bng\u0101 is what in Arabic is called the jar\u0101du-l-bahr or water-locust. The river referred to by Jah\u0101ng\u012br is the Sankh of I.G., xii, 222. V. Ball, Proc. A.S.B. for 1881, p. 42, suggests that the jh\u012bng\u0101 may be thunder-stones!\n\n\u00b3 Compare Tavernier\u2019s account of the searching for diamonds in Sambhalpur (vol. ii, p. 311, of ed. of 1676).\nappointed in his place, at the time of his taking leave I ordered him to go and take the province out of the possession of that unknown and insignificant individual. As soon as he arrived in the province of Behar he assembled a force and went against that Zamindar. According to former custom he sent some of his men with a promise to give some diamonds and some elephants, but the Kh\u0101n did not agree to this and entered impetuously into the province. Before the fellow could collect his men he found guides and invaded it. Just when the zamindar received this news, the hills and vales that are his abode were beleaguered. Ibr\u0101h\u012bm sent men about to find him, and they got hold of him in a cave with several women, one of whom was his mother, while others were also his father's wives. They arrested him, and also one of his brothers. They searched and took from them the diamonds they had with them. Twenty-three male and female elephants also fell into Ibr\u0101h\u012bm's hands. In reward for this service the mansab of Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Kh\u0101n, original and increase, was made up to 4,000 personal and horse, and he was exalted with the title of Fath-jang. Orders were also given for an increase in the mansabs of those who accompanied him on this service and had shown bravery. That province is now in possession of the imperial servants of the State. They carry on work in the bed of the stream, and bring to Court whatever diamonds are found. A large diamond, the value of which has been estimated at 50,000 rupees, has lately been brought from there. If a little pains are taken, it is probable that good diamonds will be found and be placed in the jewel-room.\nThe Eleventh New Year's Feast after the Auspicious Accession.\n\nFifteen gharis of day had passed on Sunday, the last day of Isfand\u0101rmuz\u0304, corresponding with the 1st Rab\u012b\u2018u-l-awwal (19th March, 1616), when from the mansion of Pisces the sun cast the ray of prosperity on the palace of Ari\u1e63\u0304. At this auspicious hour, having performed the dues of service and supplication at the throne of Almighty God, I ascended the throne of State in the public audience hall, the area of which was laid out with tents and canopies (sh\u0101mi-y\u0101nah\u0101), and its sides adorned with European screens, painted gold brocades, and rare cloths. The princes, Amirs, the chief courtiers, the ministers of State, and all the servants of the Court performed their congratulatory salutations. As H\u0101fi\u1e93 N\u0101d \u2018Ali, g\u016byanda (singer), was one of the ancient servants, I ordered that whatever offerings were made on the Monday by anyone in the shape of cash or goods should be given to him by way of reward. On the 2nd day (of Farwardin) the offerings of some of the employ\u00e9s were laid before me. On the 4th day the offering of Khw\u0101ja Jah\u0101n, who had sent them from Agra, and which consisted of several diamonds and pearls, of jewelled things, cloth stuffs of all kinds, and an elephant, worth altogether 50,000 rupees, was brought before me. On the 5th day, Kunwar Karan, who had been given leave to go to his home, returned and waited on me. He presented as offering 100 muhrs, 1,000 rupees, an elephant with fittings, and four horses. To the mansab of \u0100\u1e63af Kh\u0101n, which was 4,000 personal and 2,000 horse, I on the 7th made an addition of 1,000 personal and 2,000 horse, and honoured him with drums and a standard. On this day the offering of Mir Jam\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn \u1e2ausain was laid before me; what he offered was approved and accepted. Among the things was a jewelled dagger which had\nbeen made under his superintendence.\\(^1\\) On its hilt was a yellow ruby\\(^2\\) (\\(y\u0101q\u016bt-i-zard\\)), exceeding clear and bright, in size equal to half a hen\u2019s egg. I had never before seen so large and beautiful a yellow ruby. Along with it were other rubies of approved colour and old emeralds. Brokers (\\(muq\u012bm\u0101n\\)) valued it (the dagger) at 50,000 rupees. I increased the mansab of the said M\u012br by 1,000 horse, which brought it to 5,000 personal and 3,500 horse. On the 8th I increased the mansab of \u0160\u0101diq H\u0101ziq by 300 personal and horse, and that of Ir\u0101dat Kh\u0101n by 300 personal and 200 horse, so as to raise each to 1,000 personal and 500 horse. On the 9th the offering of Khw\u0101ja Ab\u016b-l-\u1e25asan was laid before me; of jewelled ornaments and cloth stuffs, what was of the value of 40,000 rupees was accepted, and the remainder I made a present to him. The offering of T\u0101t\u0101r Kh\u0101n Bak\u0101wul-beg\u012b, consisting of one ruby (\\(la\u2019l\\)), one \\(y\u0101q\u016bt\\), a jewelled takht\u012b (signet?), two rings, and some cloths, was accepted. On the 10th three elephants which R\u0101ja Mah\u0101 Singh sent from the Deccan, and 100 and odd pieces of gold brocade, etc., which Murta\u1e93\u0101 Kh\u0101n sent from Lahore, were laid before me. On this date Day\u0101nat Kh\u0101n presented his offering of two pearl rosaries, two rubies, six large pearls, and one gold tray, to the value of 28,000 rupees. At the end of Thursday, the 11th, I went to the house of I\u2019tim\u0101du-d-daulah in order to add to his dignity. He then presented me with his offering, and I examined it in detail. Much of it was exceedingly rare. Of jewels there were two pearls worth 30,000 rupees, one \\(qutb\u012b\\) ruby which had been purchased for 22,000 rupees, with other pearls and rubies.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Text, kh\u016bd-hunark\u0101r\u012b, \u2018his own workmanship,\u2019 but the MSS. have kh\u016bd-sark\u0101r\u012b. See also Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, p. 87, which says that Jam\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn had had it made in B\u012bj\u0101pur.\n\n\\(^2\\) Really a topaz. Tavernier points out that the natives call various precious stones rubies, distinguishing them by their colour.\nAltogether the value was 110,000 rupees. These had the honour of acceptance, and of cloth, etc., the value of 15,000 rupees was taken. When I had finished inspecting the offering I passed nearly one watch of the night in conviviality and enjoyment. I ordered that cups (of wine) should be given to the Amirs and servants. The ladies of the mahall (harem) were also with me, and a pleasant assembly was held. After the festive assembly was over I begged Itim\u0101du-d-daulah to excuse me, and went to the hall of audience. On the same day I ordered N\u016br-mahall Begam to be called N\u016br-Jah\u0101n Begam. On the 12th the offering of Itib\u0101r Kh\u0101n was laid before me. They had made a vessel (zarf) in the form of a fish, jewelled with beautiful gems, exceedingly well shaped and calculated to hold my allowance.\\(^1\\) This, with other jewels and jewelled things and cloth stuffs, the value of which was worth 56,000 rupees, I accepted and gave back the rest. Bah\u0101dur Kh\u0101n, governor of Qandahar, had sent seven Iraq horses and nine tug\u016bz (81?) of cloth stuffs. The offerings of Ir\u0101dat Kh\u0101n and R\u0101ja S\u016braj Mal, son of R\u0101ja B\u0101so, were laid before me on the 13th. \u2018Abdu-s-Subh\u0101n, who held a mansab of 1,200 personal and 600 horse, was promoted to 1,500 personal and 700 horse. On the 15th the Subahdarship of the province of Thatha was transferred from Shamsh\u012br Kh\u0101n \u016azbeg to Mu\u1e93affar Kh\u0101n. On the 16th the offering of Iti\u1e33\u0101d Kh\u0101n, son of Itim\u0101du-d-daulah, was laid before me. Of this the equivalent of 32,000 rupees was taken, and I gave back the rest to him. On the 17th the offering of Tarbiyat Kh\u0101n was inspected. Of jewels and cloth what was valued at 17,000 rupees was approved. On the 18th I went to the house of \u0100\u1e63af Kh\u0101n, and his offering was presented to me there. From the palace\n\n\\(^1\\) Text, ba-and\u0101za-i-mu\u2019t\u0101d-i-man, \u2018of capacity corresponding to my custom.\u2019 Presumably it was a drinking-cup, and held Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u2019s customary potion.\nto his house was a distance of about a kos. For half the distance he had laid down under foot velvet woven with gold and gold brocade and plain velvet, such that its value was represented to me as 10,000 rupees. I passed that day until midnight at his house with the ladies. The offerings he had prepared were laid before me in detail. Jewels, jewelled ornaments, and things of gold and beautiful cloth stuffs, things of the value of 114,000 rupees, four horses, and one camel were approved of. On the 19th (Farwardin), which was the day of honour (r\u016bz-i-sharaf) of the sun, a grand assembly was held in the palace. In order to observe the auspicious hour, when $2\\frac{1}{2}$ gharis of day were left of the aforesaid day, I seated myself on the throne. My son B\u0101b\u0101 Khurr\u0101m at this blessed hour laid before me a ruby of the purest water and brilliancy, which they pronounced to be of the value of 80,000 rupees. I fixed his mansab, which was 15,000 personal and 8,000 horse, at 20,000 personal and 10,000 horse. On the same day my lunar weighing took place. I increased the mansab of I\u2019tim\u0101du-d-daulah, which was 6,000 personal and 3,000 horse, to 7,000 personal and 5,000 horse, and bestowed on him a t\u016bm\u0101n t\u016bgh (horse-tail standard), and ordered his drums to be beaten after those of my son Khurr\u0101m. I increased the mansab of Tarbiyat Kh\u0101n by 500 personal and horse, so as to bring it to 3,500 personal and 1,500 horse. The mansab of I\u2019tiq\u0101d Kh\u0101n was increased by 1,000 personal and 400 horse. N\u012bz\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn Kh\u0101n was promoted to 700 personal and 300 horse, and appointed to the Subah of Behar. Sal\u0101mu-llah, the Arab, was honoured with the title of Shaj\u0101\u2019at Kh\u0101n, and, being dignified with a necklace of pearls, became one of the royal servants. I promoted Mir Jam\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn Inj\u016b to the title of \u2018Azudu-d-daulah (Arm of the State). On the\n\n---\n\n1 \u1e24alqa-ba-g\u016bsh\u0101n. Apparently referring to his being one of those who bored their ears in imitation of Jah\u0101ng\u012br.\n21st Almighty God gave Khusrau a son by the daughter of Muqim, son of Mihtar F\u0101zil Rik\u0101b-d\u0101r (stirrup-holder). To Allah-d\u0101d, the Afghan, who, accepting my service, had separated himself from the evil-minded A\u1e25dad and come to Court, I gave 20,000 darabs (10,000 rupees). On the 25th came the news of the death of R\u0101y Manohar, who had been attached to the army of the Deccan. Giving his son a mansab of 500 personal and 300 horse, I bestowed upon him his father\u2019s place and property. On the 26th the offering of N\u0101d \u2018Al\u012b Maid\u0101n\u012b, consisting of nine horses, several bits (?dah\u0101na k\u012bsh\u00b9), and four Persian camels (wil\u0101yat\u012b), was brought before me. On the 28th I presented Bah\u0101dur Kh\u0101n, governor of Qandahar, Mir M\u012br\u0101n, son of Khalilu-llah, and Sayyid B\u0101yazid, governor of Bhakar, each with an elephant. On the 1st Urdibihisht, at the request of \u2018Abdu-llah Kh\u0101n, I presented drums to his brother Sard\u0101r Kh\u0101n. On the 3rd I gave Allah-d\u0101d Kh\u0101n, the Afghan, a jewelled khapwa (dagger). On the same day news came that Qadam,\u00b2 one of the Afridi Afghans who had been loyal and obedient, and to whom the r\u0101h-d\u0101r\u012b (transit dues) of the Khaibar Pass belonged, from some slight suspicion had withdrawn his feet from the circle of obedience and raised his head in sedition. He had sent a force against each of the posts (th\u0101na), and wherever he and his men went, through the carelessness of those men (in the posts), had plundered and killed many of the people. Briefly, in consequence of the shameful action of this senseless Afghan, a new disturbance broke out in the hill country of Kabul. When this news arrived I ordered H\u0101r\u016bn, brother of Qadam, and Jal\u0101l, his son, who were at Court, to be apprehended and handed over to \u0100\u1e63af Kh\u0101n to be imprisoned in the fort of Gwalior.\n\n\u00b9 The text is corrupt. The true reading seems to be sad d\u0101na-i-k\u012bsh, \u2018one hundred pieces of muslin\u2019 (?). I.O. 181 seems to have kabsh, \u2018rams.\u2019\n\n\u00b2 Here follow two unintelligible words, Pag\u0101na Bank\u0101na.\nmanifestation of the Divine mercy and kindness and the signs of God's favour, an affair took place at this time which is not devoid of strangeness. After the victory over the R\u0101n\u0101 my son presented me in Ajmir with an exceedingly beautiful and clear ruby, valued at 60,000 rupees. It occurred to me that I ought to bind this ruby on my own arm. I much wanted two rare pearls of good water of one form to be a fit match for this kind of ruby. Muqarrab Kh\u0101n had procured one grand pearl of the value of 20,000 rupees, and given it to me as a New Year's offering. It occurred to me that if I could procure a pair to it they would make a perfect bracelet. Khurr\u0101m, who from his childhood had had the honour of waiting on my revered father, and remained in attendance on him day and night, represented to me that he had seen a pearl in an old turban (sar-band) of a weight and shape equal to this pearl. They produced an old sar-p\u012bch (worn on the turban), containing a royal pearl of the same quality, weight, and shape, not differing in weight even by a trifle, so much so that the jewellers were astonished at the matter. It agreed in value, shape, lustre, and brilliance; one might say they had been shed from the same mould. Placing the two pearls alongside of the ruby, I bound them on my arm, and placing my head on the ground of supplication and humility, I returned thanks to the Lord that cherished His slave, and made my tongue utter His praise\u2014\n\n\"Who succeeds with hand and tongue?\nHe who performs the dues of thanks.\"\n\nOn the 5th (Urdibihisht) 30 Iraq and Turki horses that Murta\u1e93\u0101 Kh\u0101n had sent from Lahore were brought before me, as also 63 horses, 15 camels, male and female, a bundle of crane's (kulang) plumes, 9 \u0101q\u012br\u012b (?),\n\n1 Perhaps this should be faghf\u016br\u012b, 'porcelain.'\n9 veined fish-teeth, 9 pieces of china from Tartary, 3 guns, etc., from Kh\u0101n Daur\u0101n, which he had sent from Kabul, were accepted. Muqarrab Kh\u0101n presented an offering of a small elephant from Abyssinia which they had brought by sea in a ship. In comparison with the elephants of Hindustan it presents some peculiarities. Its ears are larger than the ears of the elephants of this place, and its trunk and tail are longer. In the time of my revered father I\u2019tim\u0101d Kh\u0101n of Gujarat sent a young elephant as an offering; by degrees it grew up and was very fiery and bad-tempered. On the 7th a jewelled dagger was given to Mu\u1e93affar Kh\u0101n, governor of Thatha. On the same day news came that a band of Afghans had attacked \u2018Abdu-s-Subh\u0101n, brother of Kh\u0101n \u2018\u0100lam, who was stationed at one of the posts, and had laid siege to his post. \u2018Abdu-s-Subh\u0101n, with certain other mansabdars and servants who had been appointed to go with him, had behaved valiantly. But at last, in accordance with the saying\u2014\n\n\u201cWhen gnats get wings they smite the elephant,\u201d\n\nthose dogs overcame them, and elevated \u2018Abdu-s-Subh\u0101n with several of the men of the post to the dignity of martyrdom. As a condolence for this affair a gracious farman and a special dress of honour were sent to Kh\u0101n \u2018\u0100lam, who had been appointed ambassador to Iran (and was still in that country). On the 14th the offering of Mukarram Kh\u0101n, son of Mu\u2019azzam Kh\u0101n, came from Bengal. It consisted of jewels and articles procurable in that province, and was brought before me. I increased the mansab of some of the jagirdars of Gujarat. Of these,\n\n1 Jauhar-d\u0101r, defined by Vullers as bone or wood bearing veins, i.e. striated.\n2 See Akbar-n\u0101ma, ii, 315. It was sent before Jah\u0101ng\u012br was born. It, too, was an African elephant.\n3 Here the two words referred to at note 2 on p. 321 are repeated.\n4 Ma\u2019\u0101\u015firu-l-um\u0101ra, i, 736. Kh\u0101n \u2018\u0100lam\u2019s name was Mirz\u0101 Barkh\u016brd\u0101r.\nSard\u0101r Kh\u0101n, whose mansab was that of 1,000 personal and 500 horse, was raised to 1,500 personal and 300\\(^1\\) horse, and had a standard given to him as well. Sayyid Q\u0101sim, son of Sayyid Dil\u0101war B\u0101rha, was raised to an original and increased mansab of 800 personal and 450 horse, and Y\u0101r Beg, nephew of Al\u012bmad Q\u0101sim Koka, to one of 600 personal with 250 horse. On the 17th there came the news of the death of Razz\u0101q of Merv, the \u016azbeg who belonged to the army of the Deccan. He was well skilled in war, and one of the distinguished Amirs of M\u0101war\u0101\u02bea-n-nahr. On the 21st, Allah-d\u0101d, the Afghan, was honoured with the title of Kh\u0101n, and his mansab, which was 1,000 personal and 600 horse, was raised to 2,000 personal and 1,000 horse. Three hundred thousand rupees out of the treasury of Lahore were ordered as a reward and for expenses to Kh\u0101n Daur\u0101n, who had greatly exerted himself in the Afghan disturbance. On the 28th, Kunwar Karan obtained leave to go home for his marriage. I conferred on him a dress of honour, a special Iraq horse with a saddle, an elephant, and a jewelled waist-dagger. On the 3rd of this month (Kh\u016brd\u0101d) the news of the death of Murta\u1e93\u0101 Kh\u0101n came. He was one of the ancients of this State. My revered father had brought him up and raised him to a position of consequence and trust. In my reign also he obtained the grace of noteworthy service, namely, the overthrow of Khusrau. His mansab had been raised to 6,000 personal and 5,000 horse. As he was at this time Subahdar of the Panjab, he had undertaken the capture of Kangra, to which in strength no other fort in the hill country of that province or even in the whole inhabited world can be compared. He had obtained leave to go on this duty. I was much grieved in mind at this news; in truth, grief at the death of such\n\n\\(^1\\) This seems wrong; the number of horse would probably not be reduced.\na loyal follower is only reasonable. As he had died after spending his days in loyalty, I prayed to God for pardon for him. On the 4th Khurd\u0101d the mansab of Sayyid Ni\u1e93\u0101m was fixed, original and increase, at 900 personal and 650 horse. I gave N\u016bru-d-d\u012bn Quli the post of entertainer to the ambassadors from all parts. On the 7th news came of the death of Saif Kh\u0101n B\u0101rha; he was a brave and ambitious young man. He had exerted himself in an exemplary way in the battle with Khusrau. He bade farewell to this perishable world in the Deccan through cholera (haiza). I conferred favours on his sons. \u2018Al\u012b Mu\u1e25ammad, who was the eldest and most upright of his children, was given the mansab of 300\\(^1\\) personal and 400 horse, and his (\u2018Al\u012b Mu\u1e25ammad\u2019s) brother, by name Bah\u0101dur, that of 400 personal and 200 horse. Sayyid \u2018Al\u012b, who was his nephew, received an increase in rank of 500 personal and horse. On the same day Kh\u016bb-Allah, son of Sh\u0101h-b\u0101z Kh\u0101n Kamb\u016b, received the title of Ran-b\u0101z Kh\u0101n. On the 8th\\(^2\\) the mansab of H\u0101shim Kh\u0101n, original and increase, was fixed at 2,500 personal and 1,800 horse. On this date I bestowed 20,000 darabs (10,000 rupees) on Allah-d\u0101d Kh\u0101n, the Afghan. Bikram\u0101jit, Raja of the province of Bandh\u016b, whose ancestors were considerable zamindars in Hindustan, through the patronage of my fortunate son B\u0101b\u0101 Khurr\u0101n, obtained the blessing of paying his respects to me, and his offences were pardoned. On the 9th,\\(^3\\) Kaly\u0101n of Jesalmir, to summon whom R\u0101ja Kishan D\u0101s had gone, came and waited on me. He presented 100 muhrs and 1,000 rupees. His elder brother R\u0101wal Bh\u012bm was a person of distinction. When he died he left a son 2 months old, and he too did not live\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) So in text, but No. 181 has 600, and this is more likely, for the number of horse is never, I think, larger than the z\u0101t rank.\n\n\\(^2\\) I.O. MSS. have 18th.\n\n\\(^3\\) I.O. MSS. have 20th.\nlong. In the time when I was prince I had taken his daughter in marriage, and called her by the title of Malika-Jah\u0101n\u00b9 (queen of the world). As the ancestors of this tribe had come of ancient loyal people, this alliance took place. Having summoned the aforesaid Kaly\u0101n, who was the brother of R\u0101wal Bh\u012bm, I exalted\u00b2 him with the \u1e6d\u012bka of R\u0101ja and the title of R\u0101wal. News came that after the death of Murtaz\u0101 Kh\u0101n loyalty was shown by R\u0101ja M\u0101n, and that, after giving encouragement to the men of the fort of Kangra, an arrangement had been made that he should bring to Court the son of the Raja of that country, who was 29 years old. In consequence of his great zeal in this service, I fixed his mansab, which was 1,000 personal and 800 horse, at 1,500 personal and 1,000 horse. Khw\u0101ja Jah\u0101n was promoted from his original and increased mansab to that of 4,000 personal and 2,500 horse. On this date\u00b3 an event occurred such that, although I was greatly desirous of writing it down, my hand and heart have failed me. Whenever I took my pen my state became bewildered, and I helplessly ordered I\u2019tim\u0101du-d-daulah to write it.\n\n\u201cAn ancient sincere slave, I\u2019tim\u0101du-d-daulah, by order writes in this auspicious volume\u2074 that on the 11th\u2075 Kh\u016brd\u0101d the traces of fever were seen in the pure daughter\u2076 of Sh\u0101h Khurram of lofty fortune, for whom His Majesty showed much affection as the early fruit of\n\n\u00b9 The two I.O. MSS. have the following sentence here: \u201cOn this day it happened that however much I tried to write, my heart and hand would not act. Whenever I seized the pen my condition altered. At last I had to tell I\u2019tim\u0101du-d-daulah to write.\u201d\n\u00b2 This sentence is not in the I.O. MSS.\n\u00b3 Here comes the passage which the two I.O. MSS. enter higher up.\n\u2074 I.O. MS. 181 has \u201cwrites that on the 11th,\u201d etc.\n\u2075 The I.O. MSS. add here \u201cof the 11th year.\u201d\n\u2076 Probably this is the Chimm\u012b Begam, a daughter of Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n, whose grave is near that of the saint Khw\u0101ja Mu\u2018\u012bnu-d-d\u012bn Chisht\u012b (\u201cRajputana Gazetteer,\u201d ii, 62). Probably Chimm\u012b should be Chamani, which means \u2018verdant\u2019 and comes from chaman, a garden. Perhaps she died of smallpox. It was in the summer.\nthe garden of auspiciousness. After three days pustules (\u0101bila) appeared, and on the 26th of the same month, corresponding with Wednesday, the 29th Jum\u0101d\u0101-l-awwal (15th June, 1616), in the year 1025, the bird of her soul flew from her elemental cage and passed into the gardens of Paradise. From this date an order was given that Ch\u0101r-shamba (Wednesday) should be called Kam-shamba (or Gum-shamba). What shall I write as to what happened to the pure personality of the shadow of God in consequence of this heartburning event and grief-increasing calamity? Inasmuch as it happened after this manner to that soul of the world, what must be the condition of those other servants whose life was bound up with that pure personality? For two days the servants were not received in audience, and an order was given that a wall should be built in front of the house which had been the abode of that bird of paradise, so that it might not be seen. In addition to this he did not adorn the gate of the hall of audience (did not come there). On the third day he went in an agitated state to the house of the illustrious prince, and the servants had the good fortune to pay their salutations and found fresh life. On the road, however much the Hazrat (the Emperor) desired to control himself, the tears flowed from the auspicious eyes, and for a long time it was so that at the mere hearing of a word from which came a whiff of pain, the state of the Hazrat became bewildered. He remained for some days in the house of the prince of the inhabitants of the world, and on Monday of Tir, Divine month, he went to the house of \u0100\u1e63af Kh\u0101n, and turned back thence to the Chashma-i-N\u016br, and for two or\n\n---\n\n1 Apparently the reference is to the parents of the child and to the grandfather, that is, the writer of this notice.\n\n2 I.O. MSS. have Monday, the 6th Tir, and say that Jah\u0101ng\u012br went to Chashma-i-N\u016br on the 9th, which they say was a Thursday. And we see later that Jah\u0101ng\u012br speaks of Saturday as the 11th.\nthree days employed himself there. But as long as he was in Ajmir he could not control himself. Whenever the word 'friendship' reached his ear, the tears would drop from his eyes unrestrained, and the hearts of his faithful followers were torn in pieces. When the departure of the cort\u00e8ge of fortune to the Subah of the Deccan took place, he gained a little composure.\"\n\nOn this date Prithi Chand, son of R\u0101y Manohar, obtained the title of Ray and the mansab of 500 personal and 400 horse, and a jagir in his native place. On Saturday, the 11th, I went from the Chashma-i-N\u016br to the palace at Ajmir. On the eve of Sunday, the 12th, after 37 seconds had passed, at the time of the ascension of Sagittarius to the 27th degree, by the calculations of the Hindu astronomers, and the 15th degree of Capricorn, by the calculations of the Greeks, there came from the womb of the daughter of \u0100\u1e63af Kh\u0101n (wife of Khurram) a precious pearl into the world of being. With joy and gladness at this great boon the drums beat loudly, and the door of pleasure and enjoyment was opened in the face of the people. Without delay or reflection the name of Sh\u0101h Shaj\u0101\u02bfat came to my tongue. I hope that his coming will be auspicious and blessed to me and to his father. On the 12th a jewelled dagger\u00b9 and an elephant were bestowed on R\u0101wal Kaly\u0101n of Jesalm\u012br. On the same day arrived the news of the death of Khaw\u0101\u1e63\u1e63 Kh\u0101n, whose jagir was in the Sarkar of Qanauj. I gave an elephant to R\u0101y Kunwar, Diwan of Gujarat. On the 22nd of the same month (T\u012br) I added 500 personal and horse to the mansab of R\u0101ja Mah\u0101 Singh, so as to make it one of 4,000 personal and 3,000 horse. The mansab of \u2018\u0100li Kh\u0101n Tat\u0101ri, who before this had been exalted with the title of Nu\u1e63rat Kh\u0101n, was fixed at 2,000 personal and 500 horse, and\n\n\u00b9 The word 'dagger' is omitted in the text.\na standard was also conferred on him. With a view to the accomplishment of certain purposes, I had made a vow that they should place a gold railing with lattice-work at\\(^1\\) the enlightened tomb of the revered Khw\u0101ja. On the 27th of this month it was completed, and I ordered them to take and affix it. It had been made at a cost of 110,000 rupees. As the command and leading of the victorious army of the Deccan had not been carried out to my satisfaction by my son Sult\u0101n Parw\u012bz, it occurred to me to recall him, and send B\u0101b\u0101 Khurr\u0101m as the advanced guard of the victorious army, inasmuch as the signs of rectitude and knowledge of affairs were evident in him, and that I myself would follow him, so that this important matter would be carried through in one and the same campaign. With this object a farman had already been sent in the name of Parw\u012bz ordering him to start for the Subah of Allahabad, which is in the centre of my dominions. Whilst I was engaged in the campaign, he would be entrusted with the guarding and administration of that region. On the 29th of the same month a letter came from Bih\u0101r\u012b D\u0101s, the news-writer of Burh\u0101np\u016br, that the prince on the 20th had left the city safely and well and gone towards the aforesaid Subah. On the 1st Amurd\u0101d I bestowed a jewelled turban on M\u012brz\u0101 R\u0101ja Bh\u0101o Singh. An elephant was conferred on the shrine of Kushtig\u012br. On the 18th, Lashkar Kh\u0101n had sent four ambling (\\(r\u0101hv\u0101r\\)) horses, and they were brought before me. M\u012br Mughal was appointed to the faujdarship of the Sarkar of Sambal in the place of Sayyid \u2018Abdu-l-W\u0101ris, who had obtained the governorship of the Subah of Qanauj in the place of Khaw\u0101\u1e63\u1e63 Kh\u0101n. His mansab, in view of that duty, was fixed at 500 personal and horse. On the 21st the offering of R\u0101wal Kaly\u0101n of Jesalm\u012br was laid before\n\n\\(^{1}\\) I.O. MSS. have bar daur, 'round.'\nme; it was 3,000 muhrs, 9 horses, 25 camels, and 1 elephant. The mansab of Qizil-b\u0101sh Kh\u0101n was fixed, original and increase, at 1,200 personal and 1,000 horse. On the 23rd, Shaj\u0101\u02bfat Kh\u0101n obtained leave to go to his jagir that he might arrange the affairs of his servants and his territory, and present himself at the time agreed upon. In this year,\\(^1\\) or rather in the 10th year after my accession, a great pestilence appeared in some places in Hindustan. The commencement of this calamity was in the parganahs of the Panjab, and by degrees the contagion spread to the city of Lahore. Many of the people, Musulmans and Hindus, died through this. After this it spread to Sirhind and the D\u016b\u02bf\u0101b, until it reached Delhi and the surrounding parganahs and villages, and desolated them. At this day it had greatly diminished. It became known from men of great age and from old histories that this disease had never shown itself in this country\\(^2\\) (before). Physicians and learned men were questioned as to its cause. Some said that it came because there had been drought for two years in succession and little rain fell; others said it was on account of the corruption of the air which occurred through the drought and scarcity. Some attributed it to other causes. Wisdom is of Allah, and we must submit to Allah\u2019s decrees!\n\n\u201cWhat does a slave who bows not his neck to the order?\u201d\n\nOn 5th Sh\u0101hriwar 5,000 rupees towards her expenses were sent to the mother of Mir Mir\u0101n, the daughter of Sh\u0101h Isma\u02bfil II, by merchants who were proceeding to the province of Iraq. On the 6th a letter came from \u2018\u0100bid Kh\u0101n,\\(^3\\) bakhshi and news-writer of Ahmadabad,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Elliot, vi, 346. There is a better account of the plague in the Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, pp. 88, 89.\n\n\\(^2\\) The words are dar wil\u012byat, and may mean \u2018any country\u2019 or \u2018any foreign country.\u2019\n\n\\(^3\\) The son of the historian N\u012bz\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn. Sir T. Roe refers to this affair.\nto the purport that 'Abdu-llah Kh\u0101n Bah\u0101dur Fir\u016bz-jang had quarrelled with him because he had recorded among (current) events certain affairs that had been unpleasing to him, and had sent a body of men against him, and had insulted him by carrying him away to his house, and had done this and that to him. This matter appeared serious to me, and I was desirous at once to cast him out of favour and ruin him. At last it occurred to me to send Day\u0101nat Kh\u0101n to Ahmadabad to enquire into this matter on the spot from disinterested people to see if it had actually occurred, and, if so, to bring 'Abdu-llah Kh\u0101n with him to the Court, leaving the charge and administration of Ahmadabad to Sard\u0101r Kh\u0101n, his brother. Before Day\u0101nat Kh\u0101n started, the news reached Fir\u016bz-jang, and he in a state of great perturbation confessed himself an offender and started for the Court on foot. Day\u0101nat Kh\u0101n met him on the road, and seeing him in a strange condition, as he had wounded his feet with walking, he put him on horseback, and taking him with him came to wait on me. Muqarrab Kh\u0101n, who is one of the old servants of the Court, from the time when I was a prince had continually wanted the Subah of Gujarat. It thus occurred to me that, as this kind of action on the part of 'Abdu-llah Kh\u0101n had come about, I might fulfil the hope of an ancient servant and send him to Ahmadabad in the place of the aforesaid Kh\u0101n. A fortunate hour was chosen in these days, and I appointed him to be ruler of the Subah. On the 10th the mansab of Bah\u0101dur Kh\u0101n, governor of Qandahar, which was 4,000 personal and 3,000 horse, was increased by 500 personal.\n\nShauqi, the mandolin player, is the wonder of the age. He also sings Hindi and Persian songs in a manner that clears the rust from all hearts. I delighted him with the title of \u0100nand Kh\u0101n: \u0100nand in the Hindi language means pleasure and ease.\nMangoes\\(^1\\) used not to be in season in the country of Hindustan after the month of Tir (June\u2013July), (but) Muqarrab Kh\u0101n had established gardens in the parganah of Kair\u0101na,\\(^2\\) which is the native place of his ancestors, and looked after the mangoes there in such a manner as to prolong the season for more than two months, and sent them every day fresh into the special fruit storehouse. As this was altogether an unusual thing to be accomplished, it has been recorded here. On the 8th a beautiful Iraq horse of the name of La'l B\u012b-bah\u0101 (priceless ruby) was sent for Parwiz by the hand of Sharif, one of his attendants.\n\nI had ordered quick-handed stone-cutters to carve full-sized figures of the R\u0101n\u0101 and his son Karan out of marble. On this day they were completed and submitted to me. I ordered them to be taken to Agra and placed in the garden\\(^3\\) below the jharoka (exhibition-window). On the 26th the meeting for my solar weighing was held in the usual manner. The first weight came to 6,514 t\u016blcha of gold. I was weighed twelve times against different things; the second weighing was against quicksilver, the third against silk, the fourth against various perfumes, such as ambergris and musk, down to sandalwood, '\u016bd, b\u0101n, and so on, until twelve weighings were completed. Of animals, according to the number of\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Text Anand, but this makes no sense. The I.O. MSS. have amba, mangoes, and though the remark seems abrupt this is no doubt the correct reading. Jah\u0101ng\u012br was particularly fond of mangoes, and perhaps he is here playing on the similarity between the words amba and anand.\n\n\\(^2\\) In Sark\u0101r Sah\u0101ranpur (Jarrett, ii, 292). It is now in the Mu\u1e93affarnagar district (I.G., vii, 308).\n\n\\(^3\\) \"It is a pity that no trace of these is left at Agra. Had there been, they would have been the wonder of the age\" (note of Sayyid Ahmad). Perhaps they are the two figures which have generally been supposed to have been put up by Akbar and to represent Chitor heroes. The word tark\u012bb in the text may mean that they were mounted statues. But then the description of them as marble statues would be wrong.\nyears that I had passed, a sheep, a goat,\\(^1\\) and a fowl (for each year) were given to fakirs and dervishes. This rule has been observed from the time of my revered father up to the present day in this enduring State. They divide after the weighing all these things among the fakirs and those in need to the value of about 100,000 rupees.\n\nThis day a ruby which Mah\u0101bat Kh\u0101n had purchased at Burhanpur for 65,000 rupees from \u2018Abdu-llah Kh\u0101n Fir\u016bz-jang was laid before me, and was approved of. It is a ruby of beautiful form. The special mansab of Kh\u0101n \u0100\u2019\u1e93am was fixed at 7,000 personal, and an order was passed that the diwani establishment should pay an equivalent to that in a tankhw\u0101h j\u0101g\u012br. At the request of I\u2019tim\u0101du-d-daulah, what had been deducted from the mansab of Day\u0101nat on account of former proceedings was allowed to remain as before. \u2018Azudu-d-daulah, who had obtained the Subah of Malwa in jagir, took his leave, and was dignified with the gift of a horse and a dress of honour. The mansab of R\u0101wal Kaly\u0101n of Jesalmir was fixed at 2,000 personal and 1,000 horse,\n\n\\(^1\\) Text has g\u0101sfand-i-nar, \u2018a ram,\u2019 but the MSS. have g\u0101sfand u bar, or buz, and it is evident that the true reading is \u2018a sheep, a goat.\u2019 See Blochmann, p. 266, where goats are mentioned among the animals distributed by Akbar. The number of animals distributed corresponded with the years of Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u2019s age (48) multiplied by 3, and so would be \\(48 \\times 3 = 144\\) (see Blochmann, l.c.). The weight of Jah\u0101ng\u012br was 6,514 tulchas, and Blochmann (p. 267, n.) takes this to be the same as tolas, and estimates Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u2019s weight at 210\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) lb. troy or 15 stone. Probably this is excessive, and his weight might be 82 sir or about 2 maunds, i.e. 164 lb. or 11\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) stone. The perfumes against which he was weighed were ambergris, not amber (which has no scent), \u2018\u016bd, i.e. lignum aloes, and b\u0101n (not p\u0101n as in text), which apparently is the same as lub\u0101n, \u2018frankincense\u2019 (see the chapter on perfumes in Blochmann, p. 77). I am not sure of the meaning of the phrase ba-dast nih\u0101da. The MSS. have not the preposition ba. Perhaps the meaning is \u2018put them into the hands of the fakirs.\u2019 Jah\u0101ng\u012br was born on the 18th Shahr\u012bwar, 977 = 31st August, 1569. The weighings described in the text took place on the 26th Shahr\u012bwar. Perhaps this was because his birthday was on the 24th Shahr\u012bwar according to the Jal\u0101l\u012b year.\nand it was ordered that that province (Jesalmir) should be given him as tankhwah. As the (auspicious) hour of his departure was on that same day, he took leave to depart for his province well pleased and exalted with the gift of a horse, an elephant, a jewelled sword, a jewelled khapwa (dagger), a robe of honour, and a special Kashmir shawl. On the 31st, Muqarrab Kh\u0101n took leave to go to Ahmadabad, and his mansab, which was 5,000 personal and 2,500 horse, was fixed at 5,000 personal and horse, and he was honoured with a dress of honour, a n\u0101dir\u012b (a kind of dress), a takma\\(^1\\) of pearls, whilst two horses from my private stable, a special elephant, and a jewelled sword were also bestowed on him. He went off to the aforesaid Subah with delight and in a state of happiness. On the 11th of Mihr, Jagat Singh, son of Kunwar Karan, came from his native place and waited on me. On the 16th, M\u012brz\u0101 \u2018Al\u012b Beg Akbar-sh\u0101h\u012b came from the province of Oudh, which had been given him in jagir, and waited on me. He presented as offerings 1,000 rupees, and he produced before me an elephant which one of the zamindars of that province possessed, and which he had been ordered to take from him. On the 21st the offering of Qutb\u016b-l-mulk, the ruler of Golcondali, consisting of some jewelled ornaments, was inspected by me. The mansab of Sayyid Q\u0101sim B\u0101rha was fixed, original and increase, at 1,000 personal and 600 horse. On the eve of Friday, the 22nd, M\u012brz\u0101 \u2018Al\u012b Beg, whose age had passed 75 years, gave up the deposit of his life. Great\\(^2\\) services had been performed by him for this State. His mansab rose by degrees to 4,000. He was one of the distinguished heroes of this\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Generally written taghma, \u2018a badge of honour,\u2019 \u2018a medal,\u2019 etc.\n\n\\(^2\\) See T\u016bzuk, p. 11, Blochmann, p. 482, and Ma\u2018\u0101\u1e63iru-l-umar\u0101, iii, 355. The statement at T\u016bzuk, p. 11, about Delhi seems a mistake, and is not in the MSS. M\u012brz\u0101 \u2018Al\u012b came from Badakhshan. He is frequently mentioned in vol. iii of the Akbar-n\u0101ma.\nfamily (jaw\u0101n\u0101n-i \u012bn ul\u016bs)\u00b9 and of a noble disposition. He left neither son nor other descendants. He had the poetic temperament. As his inevitable destiny had been fulfilled\u00b2 on the day on which he went to pay his devotions at the venerated mausoleum of Khw\u0101ja Mu\u2018\u012bnu-d-d\u012bn, I ordered them to bury him in the same blessed place.\n\nAt the time when I gave leave to the ambassadors of \u2018\u0100dil Kh\u0101n of Bijapur, I had requested that if in that province there were a wrestler, or a celebrated swordsman, they should tell \u2018\u0100dil Kh\u0101n to send him to me. After some time, when the ambassadors returned, they brought a Mughal, by name Sh\u012br \u2018Al\u012b, who was born at Bijapur, and was a wrestler by profession and had great experience in the art, together with certain sword-players. The performances of the latter were indifferent, but I put Sh\u012br \u2018Al\u012b to wrestle with the wrestlers and athletes who were in attendance on me, and they could none of them compete with him. One thousand rupees, a dress of honour, and an elephant were conferred on him; he was exceedingly well made, well shaped, and powerful. I retained him in my own service, and entitled him \u201cthe athlete of the capital.\u201d A jagir and mansab were given him and great favours bestowed on him. On the 24th, Day\u0101nat Kh\u0101n, who had been appointed to bring \u2018Abdu-llah Kh\u0101n Bah\u0101dur Fir\u016bz-jang, brought him and waited on me, and presented as an offering 100 muhrs. On the same date R\u0101m D\u0101s, the son of R\u0101ja R\u0101j Singh, one of the Rajput Amirs who had died on duty in the Deccan, was promoted to a mansab of 1,000 personal and 500 horse. As \u2018Abdu-llah Kh\u0101n had been guilty of faults, he made B\u0101b\u0101 Khurr\u0101m his intercessor, and on the 26th, in order to please him, I ordered the former\n\n\u00b9 This is the same phrase as, according to the MSS., occurs at p. 11. Apparently the ul\u016bs referred to is the Timuride family to which Jah\u0101ng\u012br belonged. It is connected with M\u012brz\u0101 \u2018Al\u012b\u2019s title of Akbarsh\u0101h\u012b.\n\u00b2 See in Blochmann, l.c., the affecting story of his death.\nto pay his respects to me. He waited upon me with a face of complete shame, and presented as offerings 100 muhrs and 1,000 rupees. Before the coming of \u2018Adil Kh\u0101n\u2019s ambassadors I had made up my mind that, having sent B\u0101b\u0101 Khurr\u0101m with the vanguard, I should myself proceed to the Deccan and carry out this important affair, which for some reasons had been put off. For this reason I had given an order that except the prince no one should represent to me the affairs of the rulers of the Deccan. On this day the prince brought the ambassadors and laid their representation before me. After the death of Murtaz\u0101 Kh\u0101n, R\u0101ja M\u0101n and many of the auxiliary Sardars had come to Court. On this day, at the request of I\u2019tim\u0101du-d-daulah, I appointed R\u0101ja M\u0101n as the leader in the attack on the fort of Kangra. I appointed all the men to accompany him, and according to the condition and rank of each made him happy with a present\u2014a horse, an elephant, a robe of honour, or money\u2014and gave them leave. After some days I conferred on \u2018Abdu-llah Kh\u0101n, at the request of B\u0101b\u0101 Khurr\u0101m, a jewelled dagger, as he was exceedingly broken-hearted and grieved in mind, and an order was passed that his mansab should continue as it was before, and that he should remain in attendance on my son among those appointed for duty in the Deccan. On the 3rd \u0100b\u0101n I ordered the mansab of Waz\u012br Kh\u0101n, who was in attendance on B\u0101b\u0101 Parwiz, to be, original and increase, 2,000 personal and 1,000 horse. On the 4th, Khusrau, who was in the charge, for safe keeping, of Anir\u0101\u2019i Singh-dalan, for certain considerations was handed over to \u0100\u1e63af Kh\u0101n. I presented him with a special shawl. On the 7th (\u0100b\u0101n), corresponding with the 17th Shaww\u0101l (28th October, 1616), a person of the name of Mu\u1e25ammad R\u012bz\u0101 Beg, whom the ruler of Persia had sent as his representative, paid his respects. After performing the dues of prostration and salutation (k\u0101rnish,\nsijda, tasl\u012bm), he laid before me the letter he had brought. It was decided that he should produce before me the horses and other presents he had brought with him. The written and verbal messages sent were full of friendship, brotherhood, and sincerity. I gave the ambassador on that same day a jewelled tiara (t\u0101j) and a dress of honour. As in the letter much friendliness and affection were displayed, an exact copy is recorded in the Jah\u0101ng\u012br-n\u0101ma.\u00b9\n\nOn Sunday, the 18th Shaww\u0101l, corresponding to the 8th \u0100b\u0101n,\u00b2 the camp equipage of my son B\u0101b\u0101 Khurr\u0101m left Ajmir for the purpose of the conquest of the provinces of the Deccan, and it was decided that my son aforesaid should start by way of advanced guard, followed by the glorious standards (of Jah\u0101ng\u012br). On Monday, the 19th, corresponding with the 9th \u0100b\u0101n, when three gharis of day had passed, the auspicious palace moved in the same direction in the like manner. On the 10th the mansab of R\u0101ja S\u016braj Mal, who had been appointed to accompany the prince, was made up, original and increase, to 2,000 personal and horse. On the night of the 19th \u0100b\u0101n, after my usual custom, I was in the ghusul-kh\u0101na. Some of the Amirs and attendants, and by chance Mu\u1e25ammad Ri\u1e93\u0101 Beg, the ambassador of the ruler of Persia, were present. When six gharis had passed, an owl came and sat on top of a high terrace roof belonging to the palace, and was hardly visible, so that many men failed\n\n\u00b9 This letter being of the usual Persian style, and having nothing to do with Jah\u0101ng\u012br's history, is omitted. It relates to the sending of Mu\u1e25ammad Husain Cheleb\u012b with presents to the emperor, and to the offering his services for the purchase of jewels, etc.\n\n\u00b2 Text 20th \u0100b\u0101n, but the MSS. have 8th, and this is clearly right. By the latter part of the sentence Jah\u0101ng\u012br means that Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n was to start first, and that he himself was to leave afterwards. The \"auspicious palace\" referred to in the next sentence is apparently Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n's establishment. Jah\u0101ng\u012br did not leave for about a fortnight. Though Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n and the establishment (daulat-kh\u0101na-i-hum\u0101y\u016bn) made a start on the 8th or 9th \u0100b\u0101n, he did not finally leave till the 20th \u0100b\u0101n. See infra.\nto distinguish it. I sent for a gun and took aim and fired in the direction that they pointed out to me. The gun, like the decree of heaven, fell on that ill-omened bird and blew it to pieces. A shout arose from those who were present, and involuntarily they opened their lips in applause and praise. On the same night I talked with the ambassador of my brother Sh\u0101h \u2018Abb\u0101s, and at last the conversation turned on the slaying of \u1e62afi M\u012brz\u0101, his (the Shah\u2019s) eldest son. I asked him because this was a difficulty in my mind. He represented that if his slaughter had not been carried out at that time he would certainly have attempted the Shah\u2019s life. As this intention became manifest from his behaviour, the Shah was beforehand with him and ordered him to be killed.\n\nOn the same day the mansab of M\u012brz\u0101 Hasan, son of M\u012brz\u0101 Rustam, was fixed, original and increase, at 1,000 personal and 300 horse. The mansab of Mu\u2019tamad Kh\u0101n, who had been appointed to the post of paymaster of the army with B\u0101b\u0101 Khurr\u0101m, was settled at 1,000 personal and 250 horse. The time for the leave-taking of B\u0101b\u0101 Khurr\u0101m had been fixed as Friday, the 20th (\u0100b\u0101n). At the end of this day he paraded before me the pick of his men armed and ready in the public hall of audience. Of the distinguished favours bestowed on the aforesaid son one was the title of Sh\u0101h, which was made a part of his name. I ordered that thereafter he should be styled Sh\u0101h Sul\u1e6d\u0101n Khurr\u0101m. I presented him with a robe of honour, a jewelled ch\u0101rqab, the fringe and collar of which were decorated with pearls, an Iraq horse with a jewelled saddle, a Turki horse, a special elephant called Bans\u012b-badan, a carriage, according to the English fashion, for him to sit and travel about\n\n---\n\n1 Author of Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma.\n2 \u2018Of body like Krishna, or like a flute\u2019?\n3 According to Roe, it was not the English carriage, but a copy. Perhaps Jah\u0101ng\u012br had the original carriage and Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n the copy.\nin, a jewelled sword with a special *pardala* (sword-belt) that had been taken at the conquest of the fort of Ahmadnagar, and was very celebrated, and a jewelled dagger. He started with great keenness. My trust in Almighty God is that in this service he may gain renown (lit. become red-faced). On each of the Amirs and mansabdars, according to his quality and degree, a horse and an elephant were conferred. Loosening a private sword from my own waist, I gave it to 'Abdu-llah Kh\u0101n Fir\u016bz-jang. As Day\u0101nat Kh\u0101n had been appointed to accompany the prince, I gave the duty of *'arz-mukarrir* (reviser of petitions) to Khw\u0101ja Q\u0101sim Qilij Kh\u0101n.\n\nPreviously\\(^1\\) to this a band of thieves had carried off a certain sum of money from the royal treasury in the *kotw\u0101l\u012b chab\u016btara* (Police Office). After some days seven men of that band, with their leader, of the name of Nawal, were caught, and a portion of that money was recovered. It occurred to me that as they had been guilty of such boldness I ought to punish them severely. Each was punished in exemplary fashion, and I ordered Nawal, the leader of them all, to be thrown under the feet of an elephant. He petitioned that if I would give the order he would fight the elephant. I ordered it to be so. They produced a very furious elephant. I bade them put a dagger into his hand and bring him in front of the elephant. The elephant several times threw him down, and each time that violent and fearless man, although he witnessed the punishments of his comrades, got up again and bravely and with a stout heart struck the elephant's trunk with the dagger, so that the animal refrained from attacking him. When I had witnessed this pluck and manliness, I ordered them to inquire into his history. After a short time, according to his evil nature and low disposition, he ran away in his longing\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Elliot, vi, 346.\nfor his own place and abode. This annoyed me greatly, and I ordered the jagirdars of that neighbourhood to hunt him up and apprehend him. By chance he was caught a second time, and this time I ordered that ungrateful and unappreciative one to be hanged. The saying of Shaikh Mu\u1e63li\u1e25u-d-d\u012bn Sa\u02bfd\u012b accords with his case\u2014\n\n\"In the end a wolf's cub becomes a wolf,\nAlthough he be brought up with man.\"\n\nOn Tuesday,\u00b9 the 1st Zi-l-q\u0101\u02bfda (10th November, 1616), corresponding with the 21st \u0100b\u0101n, after two watches and five gharis of the day had passed, in good condition and with a right purpose I mounted the Frank carriage, which had four horses attached to it, and left the city of Ajmir. I ordered many of the Amirs to accompany me in carriages, and at about sunset alighted at a halting-place about 1\u00bc kos distant, in the village of Deo R\u0101y (Dor\u0101i?).\u00b2 It is the custom of the people of India that if the movement of kings or great men for the conquest of a country is towards the east they should ride a tusked elephant, and if the movement is towards the west on a horse of one colour; if towards the north in a palanquin or a litter (singh\u0101san), and if towards the south, that is, in the direction of the Deccan (as on this occasion), on a rath, which is a kind of cart (ar\u0101ba) or bahal (two-wheeled car).

The soil of this province is all sandy; water is found with difficulty in the land, and the reliance for cultivation is on moist\\(^1\\) soil and on the rainfall. The cold season is very equable, and the hot season is milder than in Agra. From this subah in time of war 86,000\\(^2\\) horse and 304,000 Rajput foot are provided. There are two large lakes in this city; they call one of these the B\u012bsal\\(^3\\) and the other the \u0100n\u0101s\u0101gar. The B\u012bsal tank is in ruins and its embankment is broken. At this time I ordered it to be repaired. The \u0100n\u0101s\u0101gar at the time that the royal standards were there was always full of water and waves. This t\u0101l is \\(1\\frac{1}{2}\\) kos and 5 \u1e6dun\u0101b (lit. tent-ropes) (in circumference?). Whilst at Ajmir I visited nine times the mausoleum of the revered Khw\u0101ja, and fifteen times went to look at the Pushkar lake; to the Chashma-i-N\u016br I went thirty-eight times. I went out to hunt tigers, etc., fifty times. I killed 15 tigers, 1 cheetah, 1 black-ear (lynx), 53 nilgaw, 33 gazelle (gawazn), 90 antelope, 80 boars, and 340 water-fowl. I encamped seven times at Deo R\u0101y (Deo R\u0101n\u012b) (Dor\u0101\u012b?). At this halt 5 nilgaw and 12 water-fowl were killed. Marching on the 29th from Deo R\u0101y, my camp was pitched at the village of D\u0101s\u0101wali, 2 kos and \\(1\\frac{1}{2}\\) quarters distant from Deo R\u0101y. On this day I gave an elephant to Mu'tamad Kh\u0101n. I stayed the next day at this village. On this day a nilgaw was killed, and I sent two of my falcons to my son Khurr\u0101m. I marched from this village on the\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Text tar, but MSS. have abtar, i.e. inferior and perhaps low land.

The tank in question is the B\u012bsalya tank of the Rajputana Gazetteer, ii, 4, which was made by B\u012bsal Deo Choh\u0101n about 1050 A.D. It is described in Tod's \"Personal Narrative,\" i, 824, of Calcutta reprint. It is, or was, about 8 miles in circumference and is about a mile west of the \u0100n\u0101s\u0101gar, which was made by B\u012bsal Deo's grandson.\n3rd \u0100zar, and pitched at the village of B\u0101dhal (M\u0101wal?), 2\u00bd kos distant. On the road six water-fowl, etc., were killed. On the 4th, having gone 1\u00bd kos, R\u0101msar,\u00b9 which belongs to N\u016br-Jah\u0101n Begam, became the place for the alighting of honour and glory. A halt was made at this place for eight days. In the place of Khidmat-g\u0101r Kh\u0101n I here appointed Hid\u0101yatul-lah m\u012br-t\u016bzak (master of ceremonies). On the 5th day 7 antelope, 1 kulang (crane), and 15 fish were killed. The next day Jagat Singh, son of Kunwar Karan, received a horse and a robe of honour and took leave for his native place. A horse was also given to Kesho D\u0101s L\u0101l\u0101 and an elephant to Allah-d\u0101d Kh\u0101n Afgh\u0101n. On the same day I killed a gazelle, 3 antelope, 7 fish, and 2 water-fowl. On that day was heard the news of the death of R\u0101ja Sy\u0101m Singh, who belonged to the army of Bangash. On the 7th day 3 antelope, 5 water-fowl, and a qashgald\u0101gh\u00b2 (coot) were killed. On Thursday and the eve of Friday, as R\u0101msar belongs to the jagir of N\u016br-Jah\u0101n, a feast and entertainment were prepared. Jewels, jewelled ornaments, fine cloths, sewn tapestry, and every kind of jewellery were presented as offerings. At night on all sides and in the middle of the lake, which is very broad, lamps were displayed. An excellent entertainment was arranged. In the end of the said Thursday, having also sent for the Amirs, I ordered cups for most\u00b3 of the servants. On my journeys by land some boats are always taken along with the victorious camp; the boatmen convey them on carts. On the day after this entertainment I went to fish in these boats, and in a short time 208 large fish came into one net.\n\n\u00b9 About 20 miles south-east of Ajmir.\n\u00b2 This is the name of a water-bird in Turki. It is also called m\u0101gh and water-crow (z\u0101gh-i-\u0101b), and in Hindi jalkaw\u0101 (note of Sayyid Ahmad).\n\u00b3 Probably the meaning is that he allowed those who wished to drink to do so. Many, or at least some, would be abstainers.\nHalf of these were of the species of *rah\u016b*. At night I divided them among the servants in my own presence. On the 13th \u0100zar I marched from R\u0101msar, and hunting for 4 kos along the road, the camp was pitched at the village of Balod\u0101.\\(^1\\) Here I stayed for two days. On the 16th, moving \\(3\\frac{1}{4}\\) kos, I alighted at the village of Nih\u0101l.\\(^2\\) On the 18th the march was one of \\(2\\frac{1}{4}\\) kos. On this day I gave an elephant to Mu\u1e25ammad R\u012bz\u0101 Beg, ambassador of the ruler of Persia. The village of Jons\u0101 became the halting-place of the tents of greatness and prosperity. On the 20th I marched to the halting-place of Deog\u0101on; I hunted along the road for a distance of 3 kos. I stayed at this place for two days, and at the end of the day went out to hunt. At this stage a strange affair was witnessed. Before the royal standards arrived at this halting-place, an eunuch went to the bank of a large tank there is in the village, and caught two young *saras*, which are a kind of crane; at night, when we stopped at this halting-place, two large saras appeared making loud cries near the ghusul-khana (parlour), which they had placed on the edge of the tank, as if somebody were exercising oppression on them. They fearlessly began their cries and came forward. It occurred to me that certainly some kind of wrong had been done to them, and probably their young had been taken. After enquiry was made the eunuch who had taken the young saras brought them before me. When the saras heard the cries of these young ones, they without control threw themselves upon them, and suspecting that they had had no food, each of the two saras placed food in the mouths of the young ones, and made much lamentation. Taking the two young ones between them, and stretching out their wings and fondling them, they went off to their nest. Marching on the 23rd \\(3\\frac{3}{4}\\) kos, I alighted at the\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Nam\u016bda in MSS.\n\n\\(^2\\) Sah\u016bl in MSS.\nvillage of Bah\u0101s\u016b (Bh\u0101l\u016b?). Here there was a halt of two days, and each day I rode to hunt. On the 26th the royal standards moved and the halt was outside of the village of K\u0101kal. A halt was made after traversing 2 kos. On the 27th the mansab of Bad\u012b\u2018u-z-zam\u0101n, son of Mirz\u0101 Sh\u0101hrukh, original and increased, was fixed at 1,500 personal and 750 horse. Marching on the 29th 2\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) kos, a halt was made at the village of L\u0101s\u0101, near parganah Boda.\\(^1\\) This day corresponded with the festival of Qurb\u0101n (19th December, 1616). I ordered them to observe the ordinances of that day. From the date on which I left Ajmir up to the end of the aforesaid month, viz. the 30th \u0100zar, 67 nilgaw, antelope, etc., and 37 water-fowl, etc., had been killed. A march was made from L\u0101s\u0101 on the 2nd Day, and I marched and hunted for 3 kos 10 jar\u012bb, and halted in the neighbourhood of the village of K\u0101n\u1e5b\u0101. On the 4th a march of 3\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) kos was made to the village of S\u016br\u0101\u1e6dh. Marching 4\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) kos on the 6th, a halt was made near the village of Barora (Bardar\u0101?). On the 7th, when there was a halt, 50 water-fowl and 14 qashqaldagh (coot) were killed. The next day was a halt as well. On this day 27 water-fowl became a prey. On the 9th a march of 4\\(\\frac{1}{8}\\) kos was made. Hunting and overthrowing prey, I alighted at the halting-place of Kh\u016bsh T\u0101l. At this stage a report came from Mu\u2019tamad Kh\u0101n that when the territory of the R\u0101n\u0101 became the halting-place of Sh\u0101h Khurr\u0101m, though there had been no agreement to this effect (i.e. to the R\u0101n\u0101\u2019s meeting him), the fame and dignity of the victorious army had introduced a commotion into the pillars of his patience and firmness, and he had come and paid his respects to him when he halted at D\u016bdp\u016br,\\(^2\\) which was on the border of his jagir,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) In Sark\u0101r Marosor (Jarrett, ii, 208). It was in Malwa. But the I.O. MSS. have Nauda.\n\n\\(^2\\) Text \u016adaipur, but this was not on the border of the R\u0101n\u0101\u2019s territory, and the MSS. have D\u016bdp\u016br.\nand observing all the dues and ceremonies of service he had neglected not the smallest portion of them. Sh\u0101h Khurram had paid him every attention, and pleased him with the gift of a dress of honour, a ch\u0101rqab, a jewelled sword, a jewelled khapwa, Persian and Turki horses, and an elephant, and dismissed him with every honour. He had also favoured his sons and relations with dresses of honour, and out of his offering, which consisted of five elephants, twenty-seven horses, and a tray full of jewels and jewelled ornaments, had taken three horses and given back the remainder. It was settled that his son Karan should attend on the stirrup of B\u0101b\u0101 Khurram in this expedition with 1,500 horse. On the 10th the sons of R\u0101ja Mah\u0101 Singh came from their jagir and native place (Amber) and waited on me in the neighbourhood of Ran\u1e6dambhor, making an offering of three elephants and nine horses. Each one of them, according to his condition, received an increase of mansab. As the neighbourhood of the said fort became a halting-place for the royal standards, I released some of the prisoners who were confined in that fort. At this place I halted for two days and each day went to hunt. Thirty-eight water-fowl and qashqaldagh (eoot) were taken. On the 12th I marched, and after going 4 kos halted at the village of Koyal\u0101. On the road I killed fourteen water-fowl and an antelope. On the 14th, having traversed 3\u00bd kos, I halted in the neighbourhood of the village of Ek\u1e6dor\u0101, killing on the road a blue bull, twelve herons (kurw\u0101nak), etc. On the same day \u0100gh\u0101 F\u0101zil, who had been appointed deputy for \u1e20tim\u0101du-d-daulah at Lahore, was dignified with the title of F\u0101zil Kh\u0101n. At this stage they had erected the royal lodging (duulat-kh\u0101na) on the bank of a tank, which was exceedingly bright and pleasant. On account of the pleasantness of the place\n\n1 Perhaps the Toda of Sir T. Roe.\nI halted two days there, and at the end of each went to hunt water-fowl. To this place the younger son of Mah\u0101bat Kh\u0101n, by name Bahra-war, came from the fort of Ran\u1e6dambhor, which is his father's jagir, to pay his respects to me. He had brought two elephants, both of which were included in my private stud. I promoted \u0160afi, son of Am\u0101nat Kh\u0101n, to the title of Kh\u0101n, and, increasing his mansab, made him bakhshi and news-writer of the Subah of Gujarat. Having travelled $4\\frac{1}{2}$ kos on the 17th, I halted at the village of Las\u0101y\u0101. During the halt I killed one water-fowl and twenty-three sand-grouse (durraj). As I had sent for Lashkar Kh\u0101n to Court on account of the disagreement that had occurred between him and Kh\u0101n Daur\u0101n, I at this place appointed \u2018\u0100bid Kh\u0101n, bakhshi and news-writer, in his stead. On the 19th, having made a march of $2\\frac{1}{4}$ kos, an encampment was made in the neighbourhood of the village of K\u016br\u0101ka (Kor\u0101n?), which is situated on the bank of the Chambal. On account of the excellence of the place and the pleasantness of its air and water, a halt took place here for three days. Every day I sat in a boat and went to hunt water-fowl and to wander over the river. On the 22nd there was a march, and having traversed $4\\frac{1}{2}$ kos, shooting on the road, the victorious camp was pitched at the villages of Sult\u0101npur and Chila Mala (Chil\u0101mil\u0101?). On this day of halt I bestowed on Mir\u0101n \u0160adr Jah\u0101n 5,000 rupees, and gave him leave to proceed to the place assigned to him as his jagir. Another 1,000 rupees were given to Shaikh P\u012br. On the 25th I marched and hunted for $3\\frac{1}{2}$ kos and encamped at the village of B\u0101s\u016br. According to fixed rules one halt and one march took place, and on the 27th I marched and hunted $4\\frac{1}{8}$ kos and encamped at the village of Ch\u0101rd\u016bha (Varadh\u0101?).\n\n---\n\n1 Ly\u0101sa in MSS.  \n2 Son of Niz\u0101mu-d-din the historian.  \n3 Gor\u0101na in MSS. and the distance $2\\frac{1}{4}$ kos and 1 jar\u012bb.  \n4 23rd in MSS.  \n5 M\u0101np\u016br in text.\nTwo days halt took place here. In this month of Day 416 animals were killed, namely, 97 sand-grouse (durraj), 192 qashqaldagh, 1 saras, 7 herons, 118 water-fowl, and 1 harc. On the 1st Bahman, corresponding with the 12th Muharram, 1026 (20th January, 1617), seating myself in boats with the ladies, I went forward one stage. When one ghari of day remained I arrived at the village of R\u016bp\u0101her\u0101, the halting-place, the distance being 4 kos and 15 jarib. I shot five sand-grouse. On the same day I sent by the hands of Kaikana winter dresses of honour to twenty-one Amirs on duty in the Deccan, and ordered him to take 10,000 rupees from those Amirs as a thanksgiving for the dresses of honour. This halting-place had much verdure and pleasantness. On the 3rd a march took place. As on the previous day, I embarked in a boat, and after traversing $2\\frac{1}{8}$ kos the village of K\u0101kh\u0101-d\u0101s (K\u0101kh\u0101v\u0101s?) became the encamping place of the victorious camp. As I came hunting on the way, a sand-grouse fell flying into a thicket. After much search it was marked, and I ordered one of the beaters to surround the thicket and catch it, and went towards it myself. Meanwhile another sand-grouse rose, and this I made a falcon seize. Soon afterwards the beater came and laid the sand-grouse before me. I ordered them to satisfy the falcon with this sand-grouse, and to keep the one we had caught, as it was a young bird. (But) before the order reached him the head huntsman fed the falcon with the sand-grouse (the second one, viz. that which the falcon had caught). After a while the beater represented to me that if he did not kill the sand-grouse it would die (and then could not be eaten as not properly killed). I ordered him to kill it if that was the case. As he laid his sword on its throat, it with a slight movement freed itself from the sword and flew away. After I had\n\n---\n\n1 MSS. 2,000 rupees.  \n2 Perhaps K\u0101nha D\u0101s.\nleft the boat and mounted my horse, suddenly a sparrow (kunjishk) by the force of the wind struck the head of an arrow that one of the beaters who was in my retinue had in his hand, and immediately fell down and died. I was amazed and bewildered at the tricks of destiny; on one side it preserved the sand-grouse, whose time had not arrived, in a short time from three such dangers, and on the other hand made captive in the hand of destruction on the arrow of fate the sparrow whose hour of death had come\u2014\n\n\"The world-sword may move from its place,\nBut it will cut no vein till God wills.\"\n\nDresses of honour for the winter had also been sent by the hand of Qar\u0101, the yas\u0101wul (usher), to the Amirs at Kabul. I halted at this place on account of the pleasantness of the spot and the excellence of the air. On this day there came the news of the death of N\u0101d \u2018Al\u012b Kh\u0101n Maid\u0101n\u012b at Kabul. I honoured his sons with mansabs, and at the request of Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Kh\u0101n Fir\u016bz-jang increased the mansab of R\u0101wat Shankar by 500 personal and 1,000 horse. On the 6th there was a march, and going for $4\\frac{1}{8}$ kos by the pass known as Gh\u0101\u1e6de Ch\u0101nd\u0101, the royal camp was pitched at the village of Amh\u0101r (Amj\u0101r ?). This valley is very green and pleasant and good trees are seen in it. Up to this stage, which is the limit of the country of the Subah of Ajmir, 84 kos had been traversed. It was also a pleasant stage. N\u016br-Jah\u0101n Begam here shot with a gun a qar\u012bsha (?), the like of which for size and beauty of colour had never been seen. I ordered them to weigh it, and it came to 19 tolas and 5 mashas. The aforesaid village is the commencement of the Subah of Malwa, which is in the second clime. The length of this Subah from the extremity of the province of G\u0101\u1e5bha to the province of B\u0101nsw\u0101la (B\u0101nsvar\u0101 ?) is 245 kos, and its\n\n---\n\n1 Should be Fath-jang as in MSS.  \n2 Jarrett, ii, 195.\nbreadth from the parganah of Chander\u012b to the parganah of Nandarb\u0101r is 230 kos. On the east is the province of Bandho, and on the north the fort of Narwar, on the south the province of Bagl\u0101n\u0101, and on the west the Subahs of Gujarat and Ajmir. Malwa is a large province abounding in water and of a pleasant climate. There are five rivers in it in addition to streams, canals, and springs, namely, the Godavari,\\(^1\\) Bh\u012bm\u0101, K\u0101lisindh, Nir\u0101, and Narbada. Its climate is nearly equable. The land of this province is low, but part of it is high. In the district of Dh\u0101r, which is one of the noted places of Malwa, the vine gives grapes twice in the year, in the beginning of Pisces and the beginning of Leo, but the grapes of Pisces are the sweeter. Its husbandmen and artificers are not without arms. The revenue of the province is 24,700,000 dams. When needful there are obtained from it about 9,300\\(^2\\) horse and four lakhs, 70,300 foot-soldiers, with 100 elephants. On the 8th, moving on 3\u00bd kos, an encampment was made near Khair\u0101b\u0101d. On the road 14 sand-grouse and 3 herons were killed, and having traversed and shot over 3 kos the camp was pitched at the village of Sidh\u0101r\u0101. On the 11th, while there was a halt, I mounted at the end of the day to hunt, and killed a blue bull. On the 12th, after traversing 4\u00bd kos, a halt was made at the village of Bachhay\u0101r\u012b. On that day R\u0101n\u0101 Amar Singh had sent some baskets of figs. In truth it is a fine fruit, and I had never seen such delicious figs in India. But one must eat only a few of them; it does harm to eat many. On the 14th there was a march; having traversed 4\u00bd kos, I encamped at the village of Balbali.\n\nR\u0101ja J\u0101nb\u0101, who is an influential zamindar in these\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The name seems to be wrong. Jah\u0101ng\u012br is evidently copying from the \u0100y\u012bn, and the rivers mentioned there (Jarrett, ii, 195) are the Narbada, Sipra, K\u0101lisindh, Betwa, and the Kodi (or Go\u1e0d\u012b).\n\n\\(^2\\) 29,668 (Jarrett, ii, 198).\nregions, had sent two elephants as an offering, and they were brought before me. At the same stage they brought many melons grown in K\u0101r\u012bz near Herat. Kh\u0101n \u2018\u0100lam had also sent 50 camels. In former years they had never brought melons in such abundance. On one tray they brought many kinds of fruit\u2014K\u0101r\u012bz melons, melons from Badakhshan and Kabul, grapes from Samarkand\\(^1\\) and Badakhshan, apples from Samarkand, Kashmir, Kabul, and from Jalalabad, which is a dependency of Kabul, and pineapples, a fruit that comes from the European ports, plants of which have been set in Agra. Every year some thousands are gathered in the gardens there which appertain to the private domains (kh\u0101li\u1e63a-i-shar\u012bfa)\\(^2\\); kaula,\\(^3\\) which are similar in form to an orange, but smaller and better in flavour. They grow very well in the Subah of Bengal. In what language can one give thanks for such favours? My revered father had a great liking for fruit, especially for melons, pomegranates, and grapes. During his time the K\u0101r\u012bz melons, which are the finest kind, and pomegranates from Yezd, which are celebrated throughout the world, and Samarkand grapes had not been brought to Hindustan. Whenever I see these fruits they cause me great regret. Would that such fruit had come in those days, so that he might have enjoyed them!\n\nOn the 15th, which was a halting day, news came of the death of M\u012br \u2018Al\u012b, son of Far\u012bd\u016bn Kh\u0101n Barl\u0101s, who was one of the trusted am\u012br-z\u0101das (descended from amirs) of this family (the Timurides). On the 16th a march took place. Having traversed 4\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) kos, the camp of heavenly dignity was pitched near the village of Giri.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The MSS. also have sweet pomegranates from Yezd, and sub-acid (may-khwush) ones from Far\u0101h, and pears from Badakhshan (see Elliot, vi, 348).\n\n\\(^2\\) The MSS. have kh\u0101\u1e63\u1e63a-i-shar\u012bfa.\n\n\\(^3\\) Qu. komla? Instead of q\u0101biltar the MSS. have m\u0101\u2019iltar.\na lion in this neighbourhood. I went to hunt him and finished him with one shot. As the braveness of the lion (sh\u012br babar) has been established, I wished to look at his intestines. After they were extracted, it appeared that in a manner contrary to other animals, whose gall-bladder is outside their livers, the gall-bladder of the lion is within his liver(?). It occurred to me that the courage of the lion may be from this cause. On the 18th, after traversing $2\\frac{3}{4}$ kos, the village of Amriy\u0101 was our halting-place. On the 19th, which was a halt, I went out to hunt. After going 2 kos, a village came to view exceedingly sweet and pleasant. Nearly 100 mango-trees were seen in one garden; I had seldom seen mango-trees so large and green and pleasant. In the same garden I saw a bar-tree (a banyan), exceedingly large. I ordered them to measure its length, breadth, and height in yards (gaz). Its height from the surface to the highest branch (sar-sh\u0101kh) was 74 cubits (\u1e93\u012bra'). The circumference of its trunk was $44\\frac{1}{2}$ cubits and its breadth $175\\frac{1}{2}$ measured by the gaz. This has been recorded as it is very unusual. On the 20th was a march, and on the road a blue bull was shot with a gun. On the 21st, which was a halt, I went out to hunt at the end of the day. After returning, I came to the house of I'tim\u0101du-d-daulah for the festival of Khw\u0101ja Khizr, whom they call Khizr\u012b; I remained there till a watch of the night had passed, and then feeling inclined for food I went back to the royal quarters. On this day I honoured I'tim\u0101du-d-daulah as an intimate friend by directing the ladies of the harem not to veil their faces from him. By this favour I bestowed everlasting honour on him. On the 22nd an order was given to march, and after $3\\frac{1}{2}$ kos were traversed the camp was pitched at the village of B\u016blghar\u012b (Nawalkher\u012b ?). On the road two blue\n\nPahn\u0101'i. Its area or shade. Perhaps the $175\\frac{1}{2}$ are yards, not cubits.\nbulls were killed. On the 23rd day of Tir, which was a halt, I killed a blue bull with a gun. On the 24th, traversing 5 kos, the village of Q\u0101sim-kher\u0101 was the halting-place. On the road a white animal\\(^1\\) was killed, which resembled the k\u016bt\u0101h p\u0101ya (hog-deer); it had four horns, two of which were opposite the extremities of its eyes, and two finger-breadths in height, and the two other horns four finger-breadths towards the nape of the neck. These were four finger-breadths in height. The people of India call this animal d\u016bdh\u0101dh\u0101r\u012bt (dudh\u0101riy\u0101?). The male has four horns and the female none. It was said that this kind of antelope has no gall-bladder, but when they looked at its intestines the gall-bladder was apparent, and it became clear that this report has no foundation. On the 25th, which was a halt, at the end of the day I rode out to hunt and killed a female nilgaw with my gun. B\u0101lj\u016b, nephew of Qilij Kh\u0101n, who held the mansab of 1,000 personal and 850 horse, and had a jagir in Oudh, I promoted to 2,000 personal and 1,200 horse, dignified him with the title of Qilij Kh\u0101n, and appointed him to the Subah of Bengal. On the 26th a march took place, and after traversing 4\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) kos a halt was made at the village of Dih Q\u0101ziy\u0101n, which is in the neighbourhood of Ujjain. A number of mango-trees in this place had blossomed. They had pitched the\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Evidently the four-horned antelope, the *Tetracerus quadricornis* of Blanford, p. 520, and which has the Hindustani name of *doda*. Blanford describes its colour as dull pale brown. \u201cThe posterior horns are much larger than the anterior ones, which are situated between the orbits and are often mere knobs. It is the only Indian representative of the *duikarbok* of Africa. Another Indian name is *chausingha*. In jungle this species and the hog-deer may easily be mistaken the one for the other. It is not gregarious, and moves with a peculiar jerky action.\u201d The resemblance between the four-horned antelope and the hog-deer\u2014the k\u016bt\u0101h p\u0101ycha or short-legged deer of B\u0101bar and Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u2014may account for Blanford\u2019s giving *doda* as a native name for the hog-deer (*Cervus porcinus*). For B\u0101bar\u2019s description of the k\u016bt\u0101h p\u0101ya or p\u0101ycha see Erskine, p. 317.

Pah\u0101r, son of Ghazn\u012bn\u00b9 Kh\u0101n, was capitally punished at this stage. Cherishing this unlucky one after the death of his father, I had given him the fort and province of J\u0101laur, which was the place of his ancestors. As he was of tender years, his mother used to forbid him certain evil practices. That eternally black-faced one with some of his companions one night came into the house and killed his own full mother with his own hand. This news reached me and I ordered them to bring him. After his crime was proved against him, I ordered them to put him to death (k\u012bh ba biy\u0101s\u016b ras\u0101n\u012b-dand). At this halting-place a tamarind\u00b2-tree came to view, the form and habit of which were somewhat strange. The original tree had one trunk; when it had grown to 6 gaz, it turned into two branches, one of which was 10 and the other 9\u00bd gaz. The distance between the two branches was 4\u00bd gaz. From the ground to the place where the branches and leaves came to an end (?), there were on the side of the large branch 16 gaz, and on the other branch 15\u00bd gaz. From the place whence the branches and green leaves began (?) to the top (trunk ?) of the tree was 2\u00bd gaz, and the circumference was 2\u00be gaz. I ordered them to make a chab\u016btara (platform) round it of the height of 3 gaz. As the trunk was very straight and well-shaped, I told my artists to depict it in the illustrations to the Jah\u0101ng\u012br-n\u0101ma. A march was made on the 27th. After traversing 2\u00bd kos, a halt was made\n\n\u00b9 Blochmann, p. 493.\n\u00b2 Text, khurm\u0101, a date, but evidently the khurm\u0101-i-Hind or the tamarind, i.e. \u2018the palm of India,\u2019 is meant (see B\u0101bar\u2019s Mem., Erskine, p. 324). I do not understand the measurements. The word yak, \u2018one,\u2019 before the word sh\u0101kh is not in the MSS. and is, I think, wrong. I think the 16 gaz and 15\u00bd gaz are the lengths of the two branches, and that the measurements 2\u00bd and 2\u00be gaz refer to the length and circumference of the two branches at the place when they started from the trunk and before they put out leaves.\nat the village of Hinduw\u0101l\\(^1\\); on the road a blue bull was killed. On the 28th, after traversing 2 kos, the village of K\u0101liy\u0101daha became the halting-place. K\u0101liy\u0101daha is a building which was made by N\u0101\u1e63iru-d-d\u012bn, son of Ghiy\u0101\u1e63u-d-d\u012bn, son of Sult\u0101n Mahm\u016bd Khalj\u012b, who was ruler of Malwa. In the time of his rule he had made it in the neighbourhood of Ujjain, which is one of the most celebrated cities in the Subah of Malwa. They say that the heat overcame him so much that he passed his time in the water. He made this building in the middle of the river, and divided its waters into canals, and brought the water on all sides, as well as inside and outside, of the house, and made large and small reservoirs suited to the place. It is a very pleasant and enjoyable place, and one of the noted habitations of Hindustan. Before it was decided to halt at this place I sent architects and ordered them to clean up the place again. On account of its pleasantness I remained in this place for three days. At the same place Shaj\u0101'at Kh\u0101n came from his jagir and waited on me. Ujjain is one of the old cities, and is one of the seven established places of worship of the Hindus. R\u0101ja Bikram\u0101jit, who introduced the observation of the heavens and stars into Hindustan, lived in this city and province. From the time of his observations until now, which is the 1026th Hijra year (1617 A.D.) and the 11th year from my accession, 1,675\\(^2\\) years have passed. The deductions of the astronomers of India are all based on his observations. This city is on the bank of the River Sipra. The belief\\(^3\\) of the\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Hindwas or Hind\u0101was in MSS.\n\n\\(^2\\) This is in accordance with and probably derived from B\u0101bar's Commentaries, Erskine, p. 51, where he says that 1,584 years have elapsed from the time when Bikram\u0101jit made his observatory. Erskine takes this to show that B\u0101bar was writing in 934, and if we add 92 years, or the difference between 934 and 1026, we get 1,676 years (or 1,675 if we take the year to be 1025).\n\n\\(^3\\) See Jarrett, ii, 196. Ab\u016b-l-fa\u017cl says there that the flow occurred a week before his arrival at Ujjain.\nHindus is that once in some year at an uncertain time the water of this river turns into milk. In the reign of my revered father, at the time when he had sent Ab\u016b-l-fa\u017cl to set in order the affairs of my brother Sh\u0101h Mur\u0101d, he sent a report from that city that a large body of Hindus and Musulmans had borne testimony that some days previously at night this river had become milk, so that people who took water from it that night found in the morning their pots full of milk.\\(^1\\) As this obtained currency it has been recorded, but my intelligence will in no way agree to it. The real truth of this affair is known to Allah. On the 2nd Isfand\u0101rmuz I embarked in a boat from K\u0101liy\u0101daha, and went to the next stage. I had frequently heard that an austere Sany\u0101si\\(^2\\) of the name of Jadr\u016bp many years ago retired from the city of Ujjain to a corner of the desert and employed himself in the worship of the true God. I had a great desire for his acquaintance, and when I was at the capital of Agra I was desirous of sending for and seeing him. In the end, thinking of the trouble it would give him, I did not send for him. When I arrived in the neighbourhood of the city I alighted from the boat and went \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) kos on foot to see him. The place he had chosen to live in was a hole on the side of a hill which had been dug out and a door made. At the entrance there is an opening in the shape of a mihr\u0101b,\\(^3\\) which\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Cf.

The account in the text may be compared with the Ma\u2019\u0101\u0161iru-l-um\u0101r\u0101, i, 574, and with the Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, p. 94. The measurements of the mouth of the hole in the Ma\u2019\u0101\u0161ir are taken from the Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, and differ from the account in the T\u016bzuk. The Ma\u2019\u0101\u0161ir, following the Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, calls the ascetic Achhad or Ajhad. It also gives his subsequent history. He went to Mathura and was there cruelly beaten by H\u0101kim Beg. Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u2019s visit to Jadr\u016bp is referred to by Sir Thomas Roe, who mentions a report that the saint was said to be 300 years old. Jah\u0101ng\u012br does not say any such nonsense.\nis in length (?height) 1 gaz and in breadth 10 gira (knots, each \\( \\frac{1}{16} \\) of a gaz), and the distance from this door to a hole which is his real abode is 2 gaz and 5 knots in length and in breadth 11\\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) knots. The height from the ground to the roof is 1 gaz and 3 knots. The hole whence is the entrance to the abode is in length 5\\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) knots and its breadth 3\\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) knots. A person of weak body (thin ?) can only enter it with a hundred difficulties. The length and breadth of the hole are such. It has no mat and no straw. In this narrow and dark hole he passes his time in solitude. In the cold days of winter, though he is quite naked, with the exception of a piece of rag that he has in front and behind, he never lights a fire. The Mulla of R\u016bm (Jal\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn) has put into rhyme the language of a dervish\u2014\n\n\"By day our clothes are the sun,\nBy night our mattress and blanket the moon's rays.\"\n\nHe bathes twice a day in a piece of water near his abode, and once a day goes into the city of Ujjain, and nowhere but to the houses of three brahmans whom he has selected out of seven, who have wives and children and whom he believes to have religious feelings and contentment. He takes by way of alms five mouthfuls of food out of what they have prepared for their own eating, which he swallows without chewing, in order that he may not enjoy their flavour; always provided that no misfortune has happened to their three houses, that there has been no birth, and there be no menstruous woman in the house. This is his method of living, just as it is now written. He does not desire to associate with men, but as he has obtained great notoriety people go to see him. He is not devoid of knowledge, for he has thoroughly mastered the science of the Ved\u0101nta, which is the science of Sufism. I conversed with him for six gharis; he spoke well, so much so as to make a great impression on me. My society also suited him.\nAt the time when my revered father conquered the fort of \u0100s\u012br, in the province of Khandesh, and was returning to Agra, he saw him in the very same place, and always remembered him well.\n\nThe learned of India have established four modes of life for the caste of brahmins, which is the most honoured of the castes of Hindus, and have divided their lives into four periods. These four periods they call the four \u0101\u015bram.\u00b9 The boy who is born in a brahmin\u2019s house they do not call brahmin till he is 7 years old, and take no trouble on the subject. After he has arrived at the age of 8 years, they have a meeting and collect the brahmins together. They make a cord of m\u0101nj grass, which they call m\u0101nji, in length 2\u00bd gaz, and having caused prayers and incantations to be repeated over it, and having had it made into three strands, which they call sih tan, by one in whom they have confidence, they fasten it on his waist. Having woven a zun\u0101r (girdle or thread) out of the loose threads, they hang it over his right\u00b2 shoulder. Having given into his hand a stick of the length of a little over 1 gaz to defend himself with from hurtful things and a copper vessel for drinking-water, they hand him over to a learned brahmin that he may remain in his house for twelve years, and employ himself in reading the Vedas, which they believe in as God\u2019s book. From this day forward they call him a brahmin. During this time it is necessary that he should altogether abstain from bodily pleasures. When midday is passed he goes as a beggar to the houses of other brahmins, and bringing what is given him to his preceptor, eats it with his permission. For clothing, with the exception of a loin cloth (lung\u012b) of cotton to cover his private parts, and 2 or 3 more gaz of cotton\n\n\u00b9 See Jarrett, iii, 271, etc. The Sanskrit word is \u0100\u015brama, or \u0100shrama.\n\u00b2 Left shoulder in \u0100y\u012bn.\nwhich he throws over his back, he has nothing else. This state is called brahmacharya, that is, being busied with the Divine books. After this period has passed, with the leave of his preceptor and his father, he marries, and is allowed to enjoy all the pleasures of his five senses until the time when he has a son who shall have attained the age of 16 years. If he does not have a son, he passes his days till he is 48 in the social life. During this time they call him a grihast, that is, householder. After that time, separating himself from relatives, connections, strangers, and friends, and giving up all things of enjoyment and pleasure, he retires to a place of solitude from the place of attachment to sociality (ta'alluq-i-\u0101b\u0101d-i-k\u0101\u1e63rat), and passes his days in the jungle. They call this condition b\u0101nprasta,\\(^1\\) that is, abode in the jungle. As it is a maxim of the Hindus that no good deed can be thoroughly performed by men in the social state without the partnership of the presence of a wife, whom they have styled the half of a man, and as a portion of the ceremonies and worshipping is yet before him (has to be accomplished), he takes his wife with him into the jungle. If she should be pregnant, he puts off his going until she bear a child and it arrive at the age of 5 years. Then he entrusts the child to his eldest son or other relation, and carries out his intention. In the same way, if his wife be menstrual, he puts off going until she is purified. After this he has no connection with her, and does not defile himself with communication with her, and at night he sleeps apart.\\(^2\\) He passes twelve years in this place, and lives on vegetables which may have sprung up of themselves in the desert and jungle. He keeps his zunnar by him and worships fire. He does not waste his time in looking\n\n\\(^1\\) Sanskrit, V\u0101naprastha.\n\n\\(^2\\) Text qat\u02bfi dar miy\u0101n \u0101lat nih\u0101da, but apparently this should be \u0101lat qat\u02bf ba miy\u0101n nih\u0101da; that is, \"membrum virile in involucris reponens.\"\nafter his nails or the hair of his head, or in trimming his beard and moustaches. When he completes this period in the manner related, he returns to his own house, and having commended his wife to his children and brothers and sons-in-law, goes to pay his respects to his spiritual guide, and burns by throwing into the fire in his presence whatever he has in the way of a zunnar, the hair of his head, etc., and says to him: \"Whatever attachment (ta'alluq) I may have had, even to abstinence and worshipping and will, I have rooted up out of my heart.\" Then he closes the road to his heart and to his desires and is always employed in contemplation of God, and knows no one except the True Cause of Being (God). If he speak of science it is the science of Ved\u0101nta, the purport of which B\u0101b\u0101 F\u012bgh\u0101n\u012b has versified in this couplet\u2014\n\n\"There's one lamp in this house, by whose rays\nWherever I look there is an assembly.\"\n\nThey call this state sarvabiy\u0101s,\\(^1\\) that is, giving up all. They call him who possesses it sarvabiy\u0101si.\n\nAfter interviewing Jadr\u016bp I mounted an elephant and passed through the town of Ujjain, and as I went scattered to the right and left small coins to the value of 3,500 rupees, and proceeding \\(1\\frac{3}{4}\\) kos alighted at D\u0101'\u016bd-khe\u1e63\u0101, the place where the royal camp was pitched. On the 3rd day, which was a halting day, I went, from desire for association with him, after midday, to see Jadr\u016bp, and for six gharis enjoyed myself in his company. On this day also he uttered good words, and it was near evening when I entered my palace. On the 4th day I journeyed \\(3\\frac{1}{4}\\) kos and halted at the village of Jar\u0101o.\\(^2\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Text, sarb biy\u0101si, which may mean 'distributing everything.'

No. 306 says nothing about a garden, but speaks of a village Khirw\u0101r and of halting under a mango-tree. Nor does No. 305 mention a garden.\nin the P\u0101r\u0101niy\u0101 garden. This is also a very pleasant halting-place, full of trees. On the 6th there was a march; after proceeding for $4\\frac{3}{4}$ kos I halted on the bank of the lake of Debalp\u016br Bheriyy\u0101. On account of the pleasantness of the place and the delights of the lake, I halted at this stage for four days, and at the end of each day, embarking in a boat, employed myself in shooting ducks (murgh\u0101b\u012b) and other aquatic animals. At this halting-place they brought fakhri grapes from Ahmadnagar. Although they are not as large as the Kabul fakhri grapes, they do not yield to them in sweetness.\n\nAt the request of my son B\u0101b\u0101 Khurr\u0101m the mansab of Bad\u012b\u2018u-z-zam\u0101n, son of Mirz\u0101 Sh\u0101hrukh, was fixed at 1,500 personal and 1,000 horse. On the 11th I marched, and after proceeding for $3\\frac{1}{4}$ kos halted in the parganah Daulatabad. On the 12th, which was a halt, I rode out to hunt. In the village of Shaikh\u016bp\u016br, which belonged to the said parganah, I saw a very large and bulky banyan-tree, measuring round its trunk $18\\frac{1}{2}$ gaz, and in height from the root to the top of the branches $128\\frac{1}{4}$ cubits. The branches spread a shade for $203\\frac{1}{2}$ cubits. The length of a branch, on which they have represented the tusks of an elephant, was 40 gaz. At the time when my revered father passed by this, he had made an impression of his hand by way of a mark at the height of $3\\frac{3}{4}$ gaz from the ground. I ordered them also to make the mark of my hand 8 gaz above another root. In order that these two hand-marks might not be effaced in the course of time, they were carved on a piece of marble and fastened on to the trunk of the tree. I ordered them to place a chab\u016btara and platform round the tree.\n\nAs at the time when I was prince I had promised Mir Ziy\u0101\u2018u-din Qazw\u012bn\u012b, who was one of the Saifi Sayyids, and whom during my reign I have honoured with the\ntitle of Mu\u1e63\u1e6daf\u0101 Kh\u0101n, to give the parganah of Maldah, which is a famous parganah in Bengal, to him and his descendants\u00b9 in \u0101l tamgh\u0101 (perpetual royal grant), this great gift was bestowed in his honour at this halting-place. On the 13th a march took place. Going separately from this camp to look round the country and hunt with some of the ladies and intimates and servants, I proceeded to the village of \u1e24\u0101\u0161ilp\u016br, and whilst the camp was pitched in the neighbourhood of N\u0101lcha (B\u0101lchha?) I halted at the village of S\u0101ngor. What shall be written of the beauty and sweetness of this village? There were many mango-trees, and its lands were altogether green and delightful. On account of its greenness and pleasantness I halted here for three days. I gave this village to Kam\u0101l Kh\u0101n, the huntsman, in place of Kesho D\u0101s M\u0101r\u016b. An order was passed that they should hereafter call it Kam\u0101lp\u016br. At this same halting-place occurred the night of Shivr\u0101t (Shivr\u0101tri). Many Jogis collected. The ceremonies of this night were duly observed, and I met the learned of this body in social intercourse. In these days I shot three blue bulls. The news of the killing of R\u0101ja M\u0101n reached me at this place. I had appointed him to head the army that had been sent against the fort of Kangr\u0101. When he arrived at Lahore he heard that Sangr\u0101m, one of the zamindars of the hill-country of the Panjab, had attacked his place and taken possession of part of his province. Considering it of the first importance to drive him out, he went against him. As Sangr\u0101m had not the power to oppose him, he left the country of which he had taken possession and took refuge in difficult hills and places. R\u0101ja M\u0101n pursued him there, and in his great pride, not looking to the means by which he himself could advance and retreat, came up to him with\n\n\u00b9 Cf. Elliot, vi, 348. The MSS. say nothing about two sons.\na small force. When Sangr\u0101m saw that he had no way to flee by, in accordance with this couplet\u2014\n\n\"In time of need when no (way of) flight is left,\nThe hand seizes the edge of the sharp sword.\"\u00b9\n\nA fight took place, and according to what was decreed, a bullet struck R\u0101ja M\u0101n and he delivered his soul to the Creator thereof. His men were defeated and a great number of them killed. The remainder, wounded, abandoned their horses and arms, and with a hundred alarms escaped half-dead.\n\nOn the 17th I marched from S\u0101ngor, and after proceeding 3 kos came again to the village of \u1e24\u0101\u1e63ilp\u016br. On the road a blue bull was killed. This village is one of the noted places in the Subah of Malwa. It has many vines and mango-trees without number. It has streams flowing on all sides of it. At the time I arrived there were grapes contrary to the season in which they are in the Wilayat (Persia or Afghanistan). They were so cheap and plentiful that the lowest and meanest could get as much as they desired. The poppy had flowered and showed varied colours. In brief, there are few villages so pleasant. For three days more I halted in this village. Three blue bulls were killed with my gun. From \u1e24\u0101\u1e63ilp\u016br on the 21st in two marches I rejoined the big camp. On the road a blue bull was killed. On Sunday, the 22nd, marching from the neighbourhood of N\u0101lcha (B\u0101lchha ?), I pitched at a lake that is at the foot of the fort of M\u0101nd\u016b. On that day the huntsmen brought news that they had marked down a tiger within 3 kos. Although it was Sunday, and on these two days, viz. Sunday and Thursday, I do not shoot, it occurred to me that as it is a noxious animal it ought to be done away with. I proceeded towards him, and when I arrived at the place it was sitting\n\n\u00b9 From the \"Gulist\u0101n.\"\nunder the shade of a tree. Seeing its mouth, which was half open, from the back of the elephant, I fired my gun. By chance it entered its mouth and found a place in its throat and brain, and its affair was finished with that one shot. After this the people who were with me, although they looked for the place where the tiger was wounded, could not find it, for on none of its limbs was there any sign of a gunshot wound. At last I ordered them to look in its mouth. From this it was evident that the bullet had entered its mouth and that it had been killed thereby. Mirz\u0101 Rustam had killed a male wolf and brought it. I wished to see whether its gall-bladder was in its liver like that of the tiger, or like other animals outside its liver. After examination it was clear that the gall-bladder was also inside the liver. On Monday, the 23rd, when one watch had passed in a fortunate ascension and a benign hour, I mounted an elephant and approached the fort of M\u0101nd\u016b. When a watch and three gharis of day had passed, I entered the houses which they had prepared for the royal accommodation. I scattered 1,500 rupees on the way. From Ajmir to M\u0101nd\u016b, 159 kos, in the space of four months and two days, in forty-six marches and seventy-eight halts, had been traversed. In these forty-six marches our halts were made on the banks of tanks or streams or large rivers in pleasant places which were full of trees and poppy-fields in flower, and no day passed that I did not hunt while halting or travelling. Riding on horseback or on an elephant I came along the whole way looking about and hunting, and none of the difficulties of travelling were experienced; one might say that there was a change from one garden to another. In these huntings there were always present with me \u0100\u1e63af Kh\u0101n, Mirz\u0101 Rustam, Mir Mir\u0101n, An\u012br\u0101\u2019i, Hid\u0101yatu-llah, R\u0101ja S\u0101rang Deo, Sayyid K\u0101s\u016b, and Khaw\u0101\u1e63\u1e63 Kh\u0101n. As before the arrival of the royal standards in these\nregions I had sent 'Abdu-l-Karim, the architect, to look to the repair of the buildings of the old rulers in M\u0101nd\u016b, he during the time the camp halted at Ajmir had repaired some of the old buildings that were capable of repair, and had altogether rebuilt some places. In short, he had made ready a house the like of which for pleasantness and sweetness has probably not been made anywhere else. Nearly 300,000 rupees, or 2,000 Persian tumans, were expended on this. There should be such grand buildings in all great cities as might be fit for royal accommodation. This fort is on the top of a hill 10 kos in circumference; in the rainy season there is no place with the fine air and pleasantness of this fort. At nights, in the season of the *qalbu-l-asad* (Cor Leonis or Regulus, the star \u03b1 of Leo), it is so cold that one cannot do without a coverlet, and by day there is no need for a fan (*b\u0101d-zan*). They say\\(^1\\) that before the time of R\u0101ja Bikram\u0101jit there was a Raja of the name of Jai Singh Deo. In his time a man had gone into the fields to bring grass. While he was cutting it, the sickle he had in his hand appeared to be of the colour of gold. When he saw that his sickle had been transmuted, he took it to a blacksmith of the name of M\u0101dan\\(^2\\) to be repaired. The blacksmith knew the sickle had been turned into gold. It had before this been heard that there was in this country the alchemist\u2019s stone (*sang-i-p\u0101r\u0101s*), by contact with which iron and copper became gold. He immediately took the grass-cutter with him to that place and procured the stone. After this he brought to the Raja of the time this priceless jewel. The Raja by means of this stone made gold, and spent part of it on the buildings of this fort.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Cf. Jarrett, ii, 197. The story is also told with many more details in Price\u2019s Jah\u0101ng\u012br, p. 108, etc.\n\n\\(^2\\) Text, *M\u0101dan*. But the name is *M\u0101dan*, as MS. No. 181 and the \u0100y\u012bn-i-Akbari (Jarrett, ii, 197) show. The legend is intended to show how M\u0101nd\u016b got its name (see also Tiefenthaler, i, 353).\nand completed them in the space of twelve years. At the desire of that blacksmith he caused them to cut into the shape of an anvil most of the stones that were to be built into the wall of the fort. At the end of his life, when his heart had given up the world, he held an assembly on the bank of the Narbada, which is an object of worship among the Hindus, and, assembling brahmins, made presents to each of cash and jewels. When the turn of a brahmin came who had long been associated with him, he gave this stone into his hand. He from ignorance became angry and threw the priceless jewel into the river. After he came to know the true state of the affair he was a captive to perpetual sorrow. However much he searched, no trace of it was found. These things are not written in a book; they have been heard, but my intelligence in no way accepts this story. It appears to me to be all delusion. M\u0101nd\u016b\u00b9 is one of the famous Sarkars of the Subah of Malwa. Its revenue is 1,390,000 dams. It was for a long time the capital of the kings of this country. There are many buildings and traces of former kings in it, and up till now it has not fallen into ruin.\n\nOn the 24th I rode to go round and see the buildings of the old kings, and went first to the J\u0101mi\u2018 mosque, which is one built by Sult\u0101n H\u016bshang Gh\u016br\u012b. A very lofty building came to view, all of cut stone, and although 180 years have passed since the time of its building, it is as if the builder had just withdrawn his hand from it. After this I went to the building containing the tombs of the Khalj\u012b rulers. The grave of Na\u1e63\u012bru-d-d\u012bn, son of Sult\u0101n Ghiy\u0101\u1e63u-d-d\u012bn, whose face is blackened for ever, was also there. It is well known that that wretch advanced himself by the murder of his own father, Ghiy\u0101\u1e63u-d-d\u012bn, who was in his 80th year. Twice\n\n\u00b9 Elliot, vi. 348.\nhe gave him poison, and he twice expelled it by means of a zahr-muhra (poison antidote, bezoar) he had on his arm. The third time he mixed poison in a cup of sherbet and gave it to his father with his own hand, saying he must drink it. As his father understood what efforts he was making in this matter, he loosened the zahr-muhra from his arm and threw it before him, and then turning his face in humility and supplication towards the throne of the Creator, who requires no supplication, said: \"O Lord, my age has arrived at 80 years, and I have passed this time in prosperity and happiness such as has been attained to by no king. Now as this is my last time, I hope that Thou wilt not seize Na\u1e63\u012br for my murder, and that reckoning my death as a thing decreed Thou wilt not avenge it.\" After he had spoken these words, he drank off that poisoned cup of sherbet at a gulp and delivered his soul to the Creator. The meaning of his preamble was that he had passed the time of his reign in enjoyment such as has not been attained to by any of the kings. When in his 48th year he came to the throne, he said to his intimates and those near him, \"In the service of my revered father I have passed thirty years in warfare and have committed no fault in my activity as a soldier; now that my turn to reign has arrived, I have no intention to conquer countries, but desire to pass the remainder of my life in ease and enjoyment.\" They say that he had collected 15,000 women in his harem. He had a whole city of them, and had made it up of all castes, kinds, and descriptions\u2014artificers, magistrates, qazis, kotwals, and whatever else is necessary for the administration of a town. Wherever he heard of a virgin possessed of beauty, he would not desist (lit. did not sit down from his feet) until he possessed her. He taught the girls all kinds of arts and crafts, and was much inclined to hunt. He had made a deer park and collected all kinds of animals in it.\nHe often used to hunt in it with his women. In brief, in the period of thirty-two years of his reign, as he had determined, he went against no enemy, and passed this time in ease and enjoyment. In the same way no one invaded his country. It is reported that when Sh\u012br Kh\u0101n, the Afghan, in the time of his rule, came to the tomb of Na\u1e63\u012bru-d-d\u012bn, he, in spite of his brutish nature, on account of Na\u1e63\u012bru-d-d\u012bn\u2019s shameful conduct, ordered the head of the tomb to be beaten with sticks. Also when I went to his tomb I gave it several kicks, and ordered the servants in attendance on me to kick the tomb. Not satisfied with this, I ordered the tomb to be broken open and his impure remains to be thrown into the fire. Then it occurred to me that since fire is Light, it was a pity for the Light of Allah to be polluted with burning his filthy body; also, lest there should be any diminution of torture for him in another state from being thus burnt, I ordered them to throw his crumbled bones, together with his decayed limbs, into the Narbada. During his lifetime he always passed his days in the water in consequence of the heat that had acquired a mastery over his temperament. It is well known that in a state of drunkenness he once threw himself into one of the basins at K\u0101liy\u0101daha, which was very deep. Some of the attendants in the harem exerted themselves and caught his hair in their hands and drew him out of the water. After he had come to his senses they told him that this thing had happened. When he had heard that they had pulled him out by the hair of his head, he became exceedingly angry, and ordered the hands of the attendants to be cut off. Another time, when an affair of this kind took place, no one had the boldness to pull him out and he was drowned. By chance, after 110 years had passed since his death, it came to pass that his decayed limbs also became mingled with the water.\nOn the 28th, as a reward for the buildings of M\u0101nd\u016b having been completed through his excellent exertions, I promoted \u2018Abdu-l-Kar\u012bm to the rank of 800 personal and 400 horse, and dignified him with the title of Ma\u2019m\u016br Kh\u0101n (the architect-Kh\u0101n). On the same day that the royal standards entered the fort of M\u0101nd\u016b, my son of lofty fortune, Sult\u0101n Khurr\u0101m, with the victorious army, entered the city of Burhanpur, which is the seat of the governor of the province of Khandesh.\n\nAfter some days, representations came from Af\u1e93al Kh\u0101n and the R\u0101y R\u0101y\u0101n, to whom at the time of leaving Ajmir my son had given leave to accompany the ambassador to \u2018\u0100dil Kh\u0101n, reporting that when the news of our coming reached \u2018\u0100dil Kh\u0101n he came out for 7 kos to meet the order and the litter of the prince, and performed the duties of salutation and respect which are customary at Court. He did not omit a hair\u2019s point of such ceremonies. At the same interview he professed the greatest loyalty, and promised that he would restore all those provinces that \u2018Ambar of dark fate had taken from the victorious State, and agreed to send to the Court with all reverence a fitting offering with his ambassadors. After saying this he brought the ambassadors in all dignity to the place that had been prepared for them. On the same day he sent some one to \u2018Ambar with a message of the matters it was necessary to acquaint him with. I heard this news from the reports of Af\u1e93al Kh\u0101n and the R\u0101y R\u0101y\u0101n.\n\nFrom Ajmir up to Monday, the 23rd of the aforesaid\u00b9 month, during four months, 2 tigers, 27 blue bulls, 6 ch\u012b\u1e6dal (spotted deer), 60 deer, 23 hares and foxes, and 1,200 water-fowl and other animals had been killed. On these nights I told the story of my former hunting expeditions and the liking I had for this occupation to\n\n\u00b9 Monday, the 23rd Isfand\u0101rmuz, the day on which he reached M\u0101nd\u016b. It was about the 6th March, 1617.\nthose standing at the foot of the throne of the Caliphate. It occurred to me that I might make up the account of my game from the commencement of my years of discretion up to the present time. I accordingly gave orders to the news-writers, the hunt-accountants and huntsmen, and others employed in this service to make enquiries and tell me of all the animals that had been killed in hunting. It was shown that from the commencement of my 12th year, which was in 988 (1580), up to the end of this year, which is the 11th year after my accession and my 50th lunar year, 28,532 head of game had been taken in my presence. Of these, 17,167 animals I killed myself with my gun or otherwise, viz.: Quadrupeds, 3,203; viz., tigers, 86; bears, cheetahs, foxes, otters (\u016bdbil\u0101o), and hyenas, 9; blue bulls, 889; m\u0101ka, a species of antelope, in size equal to a blue bull, 35 head; of antelope, male and female, chik\u0101ra, ch\u012btal, mountain goats, etc., 1,670\u00b9; rams (q\u016bj) and red deer, 215; wolves, 64; wild buffaloes, 36; pigs, 90; rang, 26; mountain sheep, 22; arghal\u012b, 32; wild asses, 6; hares, 23. Birds, 13,964; viz., pigeons, 10,348; lagar-jhagar (a species of hawk), 3; eagles, 2; qal\u012bw\u0101j (qhal\u012bw\u0101j, kite), 23; owls (chughd), 39; gau\u1e6d\u0101n (goldfinch ?), 12; kites (m\u0101sh-khwur, mice-eaters), 5; sparrows, 41; doves, 25; owls (b\u016bm), 30; ducks, geese, cranes, etc., 150; crows, 3,276. Aquatic animals, 10 magar machha, that is, crocodiles\u00b2 (nahang).\n\n\u00b9 The MSS. have 1,672.\n\u00b2 See Elliot, vi, 351 and 362, note. Jah\u0101ng\u012br only gives details of the 17,167 animals killed by himself. The m\u0101ka is possibly a clerical error for m\u0101r-khwur. The text says it is allied to the gawazn, but the MSS. have g\u0101r, a wild ass. The details of the quadrupeds come to 3,203, the total stated by Jah\u0101ng\u012br. The details of the birds come to 13,954, but the 10 crocodiles bring up the figures to 13,964, and the total 3,203 + 13,964 comes to the 17,167 mentioned. It has been suggested to me that the m\u0101ka of the text is the mah\u0101 or swamp-deer of the Terai, Rucervus Duvaucelli.\nThe Twelfth New Year's Feast after my Auspicious Accession.\n\nOne ghari of day remained of Monday, the 30th of the aforesaid (Isfandiy\u0101r) month, corresponding to the 12th Rabi\u2018u-l-awwal, 1026 (20th March, 1617), when the sun changed from the constellation of Pisces into the pleasure-house of Aries, which is his abode of honour and good fortune. At the very time of transit, which was a fortunate hour, I sat upon the throne. I had ordered that according to the usual custom they should decorate the public audience hall with fine cloths, etc. Notwithstanding that many of the Amirs and chief men of the State were in attendance on my son Khurram, a meeting was arranged which was not inferior to those of previous years. I presented the offerings of Tuesday\\(^1\\) to \u0100nand Kh\u0101n. On the same day, which was the 1st Farwardin of the 12th year (21st or 22nd March, 1617), a representation arrived from Sh\u0101h Khurram to the effect that the New Year's festival had been arranged for in the same manner as in previous years, but as the days of travelling and service had occurred the annual offerings of the servants would be remitted. This proceeding of my son was much approved. Remembering my dear son in my prayers, I besought for him from the throne of Allah his welfare in both worlds, and ordered that on this New Year's Day no one should present offerings.\n\nIn consequence of the disturbance that tobacco brings about in most temperaments and constitutions, I had ordered that no one should smoke it (lit. draw). My brother Sh\u0101h \u2018Abb\u0101s had also become aware of the mischief arising from it, and had ordered that in Iran no one should venture to smoke. As Kh\u0101n \u2018\u0100lam\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The MSS. have Saturday instead of Tuesday, and this seems reasonable, for there were no offerings on Tuesday (see infra).\n(ambassador to Persia) was without control in continual smoking of tobacco, he frequently practised it. Y\u0101dg\u0101r \u2018Al\u012b Sult\u0101n, ambassador of the ruler of Iran, represented to Sh\u0101h \u2018Abb\u0101s that Kh\u0101n \u2018\u0100lam could never be a moment without tobacco, and he (Sh\u0101h \u2018Abb\u0101s) wrote this couplet in answer\u2014\n\n\"The friend's envoy wishes to exhibit tobacco;\nWith fidelity's lamp I light up the tobacco-market.\"\n\nKh\u0101n \u2018\u0100lam in answer wrote and sent this verse\u2014\n\n\"I, poor wretch, was miserable at the tobacco notice;\nBy the just Shah's favour the tobacco-market became brisk.\"\n\nOn the 3rd of the same month, \u1e24usain Beg, the diwan of Bengal, had the good fortune to kiss the threshold, and made an offering of twelve elephants, male and female. T\u0101hir, bakhshi of Bengal, who had been accused of several offences, obtained the favour of paying his respects to me, and presented before me an offering of twenty-one elephants. Twelve of these were approved and the remainder I conferred on him. On this day a wine-feast was arranged, and I gave wine to most of the servants who were engaged in waiting on me, and made them all heated with the wine of loyalty. On the 4th the huntsmen sent news that they had marked down a lion in the neighbourhood of the Shakkar\u00b9 tank, which is inside the fort and one of the famous constructions of the rulers of Malwa. I at once mounted and went towards that game. When the lion appeared he charged the ahadis and the retinue and wounded ten\u00b2 or twelve of them. At last I finished his business with three shots\u00b3 (lit. arrows) from my gun, and removed his evil from the servants of God. On the 8th the mansab of Mir Mir\u0101n, which was 1,000 personal and 400 horse, was\n\n\u00b9 Text, Sakar. Now locally called the S\u0101gan, 'sea,' tank.\n\u00b2 The MSS. only speak of twelve.\n\u00b3 The MSS. seem to have merely ba t\u012br-i-band\u016bq, 'with bullets.'\nfixed at 1,500 personal and 500 horse. On the 9th, at the request of my son Khurram, I increased the mansab of Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n by 1,000 personal and horse, making it thus 6,000 personal and horse; that of Ya\u02bfq\u016bb Kh\u0101n, which was 1,500 personal with 1,000 horse, was made 2,000 personal and 1,500 horse; that of Bahl\u016bl Kh\u0101n Miy\u0101na\u00b9 was increased by 500 personal and 300 horse to 1,500 personal and 1,000 horse; and that of M\u012brz\u0101 Sharafu-d-d\u012bn K\u0101shghar\u012b, by whom and his son great bravery had been shown in the Deccan, was increased to 1,500 personal and 1,000 horse. On the 10th Farward\u012bn, corresponding with the 22nd Rab\u012b\u02bfu-l-awwal, 1026, my lunar weighing took place. On this day two \u2018Iraq horses from my private stable and a dress of honour were conferred on my son Khurram and sent to him by Bahr\u0101m Beg. I increased the mansab of I\u02bftib\u0101r Kh\u0101n to 5,000 personal and 3,000 horse. On the 11th, \u1e24usain Beg, of Tabriz, whom the ruler of Iran had sent to the ruler of Golconda by way of embassy, as, in consequence of the quarrel of the Franks with the Persians, the road of the M\u012br had been closed,\u00b2 waited upon me with the ambassador of the ruler of Golconda. Offerings came from him of two horses and some tuq\u016bz\u00b3 (nine-pieces?) of cloth from the Deccan and Gujarat. On the same day an \u2018Iraq horse from my private stable was bestowed on Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n. On the 15th, 1,000 personal were added to the mansab of M\u012brz\u0101 R\u0101ja Bh\u0101o Singh, raising it to 5,000 personal and 3,000 horse. On the 17th, 500 horse were added to the mansab of M\u012brz\u0101 Rustam, and I made it up to 5,000 personal and 1,000 horse; that of \u0160\u0101diq Kh\u0101n was fixed at 1,500 personal and 700 horse, original and increase; Ir\u0101dat Kh\u0101n in the same manner was raised to the mansab of 1,500 and\n\n\u00b9 Biy\u0101na in text.\n\u00b2 That is, apparently, the journey back by sea from the Deccan. The MSS. have \u1e24asan instead of \u1e24usain, and say the route by Ormuz was closed. Perhaps the ba M\u012br of text is a mistake for bar bah\u1e5b, \u2018by sea.\n\u00b3 Tuq\u016bz means nine in Turki.\n600 horse. To the mansab of Anir\u0101\u2019i 500 personal and 100 horse were added, and it was made one of 1,500 personal and 500 horse. Three gharis of Saturday, the 19th, remained when the beginning of the sharaf (day of sun\u2019s culmination) occurred, and at the same time I again took my seat on the throne. Of the thirty-two prisoners from the army of the rebel \u2018Ambar who had been captured by the servants of the victorious State in the battle won by Sh\u0101h-naw\u0101z Kh\u0101n and the defeat of that disastrous man (\u2018Ambar), I had handed one man over to I\u2019tiq\u0101d Kh\u0101n. The guards who had been appointed to keep him showed carelessness and let him escape. I was much annoyed at this, and I forbade I\u2019tiq\u0101d Kh\u0101n to come to wait on me for three months. As the said prisoner\u2019s name and condition were unknown, he was not caught again, although they showed activity in the matter. At last I ordered the captain of the guards who had been careless in keeping him to be capitally punished. I\u2019tiq\u0101d Kh\u0101n on this day, at the request of I\u2019tim\u0101du-d-daulah, had the good fortune to pay his respects to me.\n\nAs for a long time no good had been heard of the affairs of Bengal and of the conduct of Q\u0101sim Kh\u0101n, it entered my mind to send to the Subah of Bengal Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Kh\u0101n Fath-jang, who had carried on successfully the affairs of the Subah of Behar and had brought a diamond mine into the possession of the State, and to despatch Jah\u0101ng\u012br Quli Kh\u0101n, who had a jagir in the Subah of Allahabad, in his place to Behar. I sent for Q\u0101sim Kh\u0101n to Court. At the same hour on the auspicious day (the day of culmination) an order was given that they should write royal farmans to the effect that saz\u0101wal\u0101n (revenue collectors) should be appointed to take Jah\u0101ng\u012br Quli Kh\u0101n to Behar and to send Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Kh\u0101n Fath-jang to Bengal. Patronizing Sikandar,\u00b9 the\n\n\u00b9 The I.O. MSS. seem to have Sakakdar or Sak\u0101kandar.\njeweller, I promoted him to the mansab of 1,000 personal and 300 horse.\n\nOn the 21st I gave leave to Mu\u1e25ammad Riz\u0101, ambassador of the ruler of Iran, and bestowed on him 60,000 darbs, equal to 30,000 rupees, with a dress of honour. As an equivalent to the souvenir (y\u0101d-b\u016bd\u012b) that my brother Sh\u0101h \u2018Abb\u0101s had sent to me, I forwarded with the aforesaid ambassador certain presents of jewelled things which the rulers of the Deccan had sent, with cloths and rare things of every kind fit for presentation, of the value of 100,000 rupees. Among these was a crystal cup that Cheleb\u012b had sent from \u2018Iraq. The Shah had seen this cup and said to the ambassador that if his brother (Jah\u0101ng\u012br) would drink wine out of it and send it to him it would be a great mark of affection. When the ambassador represented this, having drunk wine several times out of the cup in his presence, I ordered them to make a lid and a saucer for it and sent it along with the presents. The lid was of enamel (m\u012bn\u0101-k\u0101r\u012b). I ordered the Munshis of mercurial writing (\u2018U\u1e6d\u0101rid-raqm) to write in due form an answer to the letter he had brought.\n\nOn the 22nd the scouts brought in news of a tiger. Mounting immediately, I went against the tiger and with three shots I delivered the people from his wickedness, and himself from the wickedness of his vile nature. Masi\u1e25u-z-zam\u0101n produced before me a cat, and represented that it was a hermaphrodite, and that in his house it had young ones, and that when it had connection with another cat, young were born to the latter.\n\nOn the 25th the contingent of I\u02bftim\u0101du-d-daulah passed before me in review on the plain under the jharoka. There were 2,000 cavalry well horsed, most of whom\n\n---\n\n1 It appears from Sh\u0101h \u2018Abb\u0101s\u2019s letter to Jah\u0101ng\u012br (T\u016bzuk, p. 165) that Mu\u1e25ammad Husain Cheleb\u012b had been employed by Jah\u0101ng\u012br to collect curios in Persia.\nwere Moghuls, 500 foot armed with bows and guns, and fourteen elephants. The bakhshis reckoned them up and reported that this force was fully equipped and according to rule. On the 26th a tigress was killed. On Thursday, the 1st Urdibihisht, a diamond that Muqarrab Kh\u0101n had sent by runners was laid before me; it weighed 23 surkh, and the jewellers valued it at 30,000 rupees. It was a diamond of the first water, and was much approved. I ordered them to make a ring of it. On the 3rd the mansab of Y\u016bsuf Kh\u0101n was, at the request of B\u0101b\u0101 Khurram, fixed at 1,000 with 1,500 horse, and in the same way the mansabs of several of the Amirs and mansabdars were increased at his suggestion. On the 7th, as the huntsmen had marked down four tigers, when two watches and three gharis had passed I went out to hunt them with my ladies. When the tigers came in sight N\u016br-Jah\u0101n Begam submitted that if I would order her she herself would kill the tigers with her gun. I said, \u201cLet it be so.\u201d She shot two tigers with one shot each and knocked over the two others with four shots. In the twinkling of an eye she deprived of life the bodies of these four tigers. Until now such shooting was never seen, that from the top of an elephant and inside of a howdah (\u2018am\u0101r\u012b) six shots should be made and not one miss, so that the four beasts found no opportunity to spring or move.\u00b9 As a reward for this good shooting I gave her a pair of bracelets\u00b2 (pahunch\u012b) of diamonds worth 100,000 rupees and scattered 1,000 ashrafis (over her). On the same day Ma\u2019m\u016br Kh\u0101n (the architect-\n\n\u00b9 Note by Sayyid A\u1e25mad. They say that a poet recited this impromptu couplet\u2014\n\n\u201cThough N\u016br-Jah\u0101n be in form a woman,\nIn the ranks of men she\u2019s a tiger-slayer.\u201d\n\nThe point of this couplet is that before N\u016br-Jah\u0101n entered Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u2019s harem she was the wife of Sh\u012br-afgan, the tiger-slayer. The line may also read \u201cIn battle she is a man-smiter and a tiger-slayer.\u201d\n\n\u00b2 The two I.O. MSS. have \u201ca pair of pearls and a diamond.\u201d\nKhan) obtained leave to go to Lahore to complete the buildings of the palace there. On the 10th the death of Sayyid W\u0101ris, who was faujdar of the Subah of Oudh, was reported. On the 12th, as M\u012br Mahm\u016bd asked for a faujdarship, I dignified him with the title of Tahawwur Kh\u0101n, and, increasing his mansab, appointed him to the faujdarship of some of the parganahs of the Subah of Multan. On the 22nd, T\u0101hir, the bakhshi of Bengal, who had been forbidden to pay his respects, waited upon me and presented his offerings. Eight elephants were also presented as the offering of Qasim Kh\u0101n, governor of Bengal, and two as that of Shaikh Modh\u016b. On the 28th, at the request of Kh\u0101n Daur\u0101n, an order was given for the increase of the mansab of \u2018Abdu-l-\u2018Az\u012bz Kh\u0101n by 500. On the 5th Khurd\u0101d the duty of the Diwanship of Gujar\u0101t was given to M\u012brz\u0101 \u1e24usain in supercession of Kesho. I dignified him with the title of Kif\u0101yat Kh\u0101n.\n\nOn the 8th, Lashkar Kh\u0101n, who had been appointed bakhshi of Bangash, came and waited on me; he offered 100 muhrs and 500 rupees. Some days before this Ust\u0101d Muhammad N\u0101yi (flute-player), who was unequalled in his craft, was sent by my son Khurr\u0101m at my summons. I had heard some of his musical pieces \\(^1\\) (majlis-s\u0101z), and he played a tune which he had composed for an ode (ghazal) in my name. On the 12th I ordered him to be weighed against rupees; this came to 6,300 rupees. I also gave him an elephant with a howdah,\\(^2\\) and I ordered him to ride on it and, having packed\\(^3\\) his rupees about him, to proceed to his lodging. Mull\u0101 Asad, the story-\n\n---\n\n1 There is a fuller account of this flute-player in Price\u2019s Jah\u0101ng\u012br, p. 114. The melody which he composed in Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u2019s name is there called by Price Saut Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u012b. (The text does not give the name Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u012b.) It is there stated that Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n brought the flute-player with him from Burhanpur and introduced him.\n\n2 Hauza-d\u0101r\u012b, \u2018with a basin-shaped litter on it.\u2019\n\n3 The word p\u0101shida, \u2018scattered,\u2019 does not occur in the I.O. MSS. But perhaps the word has two opposite meanings.\nteller, one of the servants of M\u012brz\u0101 Gh\u0101zi, came on the same day from Tattah and waited on me. As he was a reciter and story-teller full of sweetness and smartness, I liked his society, and I made him happy with the title of Mahz\u016bz Kh\u0101n, and gave him 1,000 rupees, a dress of honour, a horse, an elephant, and a palanquin. After some days I ordered him to be weighed against rupees, and his weight came up to 4,400. He was raised to the mansab of 200 personal and 20 horse. I ordered him always to be present at the meetings for talk (gap). On the same day Lashkar Kh\u0101n brought his men to the darshan jharoka before me. There were 500 horse, 14 elephants, and 100 musketeers. On the 24th news came that Mah\u0101 Singh, grandson of R\u0101ja M\u0101n Singh, who was entered among the great officers, had died from excessive wine-drinking at B\u0101l\u0101p\u016br in the province of Berar. His father also had died at the age of 32\\(^1\\) from the drinking of wine beyond measure. On the same day they had brought to my private fruit-house many mangoes from all parts of the province of the Deccan, Burhanpur, Gujarat, and the parganahs of Malwa. Although this province is well known and celebrated for the sweetness, freedom from stringiness, and size of its mangoes, and there are few mangoes that equal its mangoes\u2014so much so that I often ordered them to be weighed in my presence, when they were shown to come to a seer or \\(1\\frac{1}{4}\\) seer or even more\u2014yet in sweetness of water and delicious flavour and digestibility the mangoes of Chapr\u0101mau,\\(^2\\) in the province of Agra, are superior to all the mangoes of this province and of all other places in India.\n\nOn the 28th I sent for my son B\u0101b\u0101 Khurr\u0101m a special gold-embroidered n\u0101diri of a fineness such as had never\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Father and son both died apparently at the same age.\n\n\\(^2\\) It was in Sarkar Qanauj (Jarrett, ii, 185). It is Chibr\u0101mau of I.G., iii, 397, and is in Farrukhabad district.\nbeen produced before in my establishment; I ordered the bearer to tell him that as this rarity had the speciality that I had worn it on the day I quitted Ajmir for the conquest of the Deccan, I had sent it to him. On the same day I placed the turban from my own head, just as it was, on the head of I'tim\u0101du-d-daulah, and honoured him with this favour. Three emeralds, a piece of jewelled \u016brbasi,\u00b9 and a ruby signet ring that Mah\u0101bat Kh\u0101n had sent by way of offering were laid before me. They came to 7,000 rupees in value. On this day, by the mercy and favour of Allah, continued rain fell. Water in M\u0101nd\u016b had become very scarce and the people were agitated about the matter, so that most of the servants had been ordered to go to the bank of the Narbada. There was no expectation of rain at that season. In consequence of the agitation of the people I turned by way of supplication to the throne of God, and He in His mercy and grace gave such rain that in the course of a day and a night tanks, ponds (birkah\u0101), and rivers became full, and the agitation of the people was changed to complete ease. With what tongue can I render thanks for this favour? On the 1st of T\u012br a standard was presented to Waz\u012br Kh\u0101n. The offering of the R\u0101n\u0101, consisting of two horses, a piece of Gujarati cloth, and some jars of pickles and preserves, was laid before me. On the 3rd, Mu'azz\u0101\u00b2 (?) brought news of the capture of 'Abdu-l-Lat\u012bf, a descendant of the rulers of Gujarat, who had always been the originator of mischief and disturbance in that Subah. As his capture was a reason for the contentment of the people, praise was given to God, and I ordered Muqarrab Kh\u0101n to send him to Court.\n\n\u00b9 \u016arv\u0101s\u012b is the name of an Apsara or celestial nymph. Probably it is here the name of a dress. (In Forbes's Hindustani Dictionary \u016brbasi is said to denote a particular kind of ornament worn on the breast.)\n\n\u00b2 The MSS. have maghra, which may be connected with the Arabic maghr, 'travelling quickly.' It may be the name of a courier, or merely mean 'quickly.'\nby one of his mansabdars. Many of the zamindars in the neighbourhood of M\u0101nd\u016b came and waited on me, and laid offerings before me. On the 8th, R\u0101m D\u0101s, son of R\u0101ja R\u0101j Singh Kachhw\u0101ha, was given the \u1e6d\u012bka of a Raja, and I honoured him with that title. Y\u0101dg\u0101r Beg, who was known in M\u0101war\u0101'a-n-nahr (Transoxiana) as Y\u0101dg\u0101r Q\u016brchi, and had not been without connection and influence with the ruler of that country, came and waited on me. Of all his offerings a white china cup on a stand was the most approved. The offering of Bah\u0101dur Kh\u0101n, governor of Qandahar, consisting of nine horses, nine tuq\u016bz of fine cloth (81 pieces?), two black foxes' skins, and other things, was brought before me. Also on this day the R\u0101ja of Gadeha, Pem Nar\u0101yan, had the good fortune to wait on me, and made an offering of seven elephants, male and female. On the 10th a horse and dress of honour were given to Y\u0101dg\u0101r Q\u016brchi. On the 13th was the feast of rose-water scattering (gul\u0101b-p\u0101sh\u0101n). The rites due to that day were performed. Shaikh Maud\u016bd Chisht\u012b, one of the officers of Bengal, was honoured with the title of Chisht\u012b Kh\u0101n, and I presented him with a horse. On the 14th, R\u0101wal Samarsi (Samarsimha), son of R\u0101wal \u016aday Singh, zamindar of B\u0101nsw\u0101la, waited on me; he gave as offering 30,000 rupees, three elephants, a jewelled p\u0101n-d\u0101n (box for betel), and a jewelled belt. On the 15th nine diamonds which Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Kh\u0101n Fath-jang, the governor of Behar, had sent along with Mu\u1e25ammad Beg from the mine, and from the collections of the zamindars of that place, were laid before me. Of these, one weighed 14\u00bd tanks, and was of the value of 100,000 rupees. On the same day Y\u0101dg\u0101r Q\u016brchi was presented with 14,000 darbs,\n\n---\n\n1 Apparently it should be Bh\u012bm; see infra. Gadeha is probably Gadhi in Khandesh; see Lethbridge's \"Golden Book of India,\" p. 138. It is the Garv\u012b of I.G., v, 33, and is one of the Bhil States in the D\u0101ng Traet.\nand I promoted him to the mansab of 500 personal and 300 horse. I fixed the mansab of T\u0101t\u0101r Kh\u0101n, bak\u0101wul-beg\u012b (chief steward), original and increase, at 2,000 personal and 300 horse, and each of his sons was separately promoted to an increased mansab. At the request of Prince Sult\u0101n Parw\u012bz, I increased the personal mansab of Waz\u012br Kh\u0101n by 500.\n\nOn the 29th, which was the auspicious day of Thursday, Sayyid \u2018Abdu-llah B\u0101rha, the envoy of my son of good fortune, B\u0101b\u0101 Khurram, waited on me, and presented a letter from that son containing news of a victory over the provinces of the Deccan. All the chiefs, laying the head of duty in the noose of obedience, had consented to service and humility, and laid before him the keys of forts and strongholds, especially the fort of Ahmadnagar. In gratitude for this great favour and beneficence, placing the head of supplication on the throne of that God who requires no return, I opened my lips in thankfulness, and, humbling myself, ordered them to beat the drums of rejoicing. Thanks be to Allah that a territory that had passed out of hand has come back into the possession of the servants of the victorious State, and that the seditious, who had been breathing the breath of rebellion and boasting, have turned towards supplication and weakness, and become deliverers of properties and payers of tribute. As this news reached me through N\u016br-Jah\u0101n Begam, I gave her the parganah of Bod\u0101 (T\u014d\u1e0d\u0101 ?),\\(^1\\) the revenue of which is 200,000 rupees. Please God, when the victorious forces enter the province of the Deccan and its forts, and the mind of my excellent son Khurram is satisfied with regard to their possession, he will bring with the ambassadors such an offering from\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) There was a Bodah in Sark\u0101r Marosor in Malwa, but its revenue was only \\(2\\frac{1}{2}\\) lakhs of dams (Jarrett, ii, 208). The two I.O. MSS. and Debi Prasad\u2019s Hindi version have T\u014d\u1e0d\u0101. T\u014d\u1e0d\u0101 was in Ajmir, Rantambhor Sarkar, and its revenue in Akbar\u2019s time was \\(1\\frac{1}{2}\\) lakhs of rupees (Jarrett, ii, 275).\nthe Deccan as no other king of this age has received. It was ordered that he should bring with him the Amirs who were to receive jagirs in this Subah, in order that they might have the honour of waiting on me. They will thereafter get leave to depart, and the glorious royal standards will return with victory and rejoicing to the capital of Agra. Some days before the news of this victory reached me, I took one night an augury from the diwan of Khw\u0101ja \u1e24\u0101fiz as to what would be the end of this affair, and this ode turned up\u2014\n\n\"The day of absence and night of parting from the friend are o'er.\nI took this augury; the star passed and fulfilment came.\"\u00b9\n\nWhen the secret tongue (lis\u0101nu-l-ghaib) of \u1e24\u0101fiz showed such an ending it gave me a strong hope, and accordingly, after twenty-five days, the news of victory arrived. In many of my desires I have resorted to the Khw\u0101ja's diwan, and (generally) the result has coincided with what I found there. It is seldom that the opposite has happened.\n\nOn the same day I added 1,000 horse to the mansab of \u0100\u1e63af Kh\u0101n, and raised it to that of 5,000 personal and horse. At the end of the day I went with the ladies to look round the building of the Haft Manz\u0101r\u00b2 (seven storeys), and at the beginning of the evening returned to the palace. This building was founded by a former ruler of Malwa, Sult\u0101n Mahm\u016bd Khalj\u012b. It has seven storeys, and in each storey there are four chambers (suffa) containing four windows. The height of this tower (m\u012bn\u0101r) is $54\\frac{1}{2}$ cubits, and its circumference 50 yards (gaz). There are 171 steps from the ground\n\n\u00b9 Ode 192 of Brockhaus' edition, p. 112, first couplet.\n\u00b2 This is the building described by William Finch. See the Journal of John Jourdain, ed. by Foster for the Hakluyt Society, App. D. Finch speaks of a high turret 170 steps high. The tower was the Tower of Victory erected by Sult\u0101n Mahm\u016bd I in 1443 to commemorate a victory over the Raja of Chitor. \"The stump of it has been found.\" Jourdain speaks of six storeys. It was built of green stone like marble.\nto the seventh storey. In going and returning I scattered 1,400 rupees.\\(^1\\)\n\nOn the 31st I honoured Sayyid 'Abdu-llah with the title of Saif Kh\u0101n, and having exalted him with a dress of honour, a horse, an elephant, and a jewelled dagger, gave him leave and sent him to do duty with my son of lofty fortune. I also sent by him a ruby of the value of more than 30,000 rupees for my son. I did not regard its value, but as for a long time I used to bind it on my own head, I sent it him by way of good augury, considering it lucky for him. I appointed Sultan Mahm\u016bd, a son-in-law of Khw\u0101ja Ab\u016b-l-hasan bakhshi, to be bakhshi and news-writer of the Subah of Behar, and when he took leave I gave him an elephant.\n\nAt the end of the day of Thursday, 5th Amurd\u0101d, I went with the ladies to see the Nil-kund, which is one of the most\\(^2\\) pleasant places in the fort of Mandu (M\u0101ndog\u0101r). Sh\u0101h-bud\u0101gh Kh\u0101n, who was one of my revered father\u2019s most considerable Amirs, at the time when he held this province in jagir, built in this place an exceedingly pleasing and enjoyable building. Delaying there till two or three gharis of night had passed I returned to the auspicious palace.\n\nAs several indiscretions on the part of Mukhli\u1e63 Kh\u0101n, diwan and bakhshi of the Subah of Bengal, had come to my ears, I reduced his mansab by 1,000 personal and 200 horse. On the 7th a war (mast\u012b) elephant from among those sent as offerings by '\u0100dil Kh\u0101n, by name Gaj-r\u0101j, was sent to R\u0101n\u0101 Amr Singh. On the 11th, I went out to hunt, and came one stage from the fort. There was excessive rain; and the mud was such that there was hardly any moving. For the convenience of the people and the comfort of the animals I gave up\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Two hundred rupees per storey (?).\n\n\\(^2\\) Blochmann, p. 371, and Ma'\u0101\u015firu-l-umar\u0101, ii, 537. Now locally called the Nil-kan\u1e6dh, \u2018blue neck.\u2019\nthis undertaking, and passing the day of Thursday outside, returned on Friday eve. On the same day Hid\u0101yatu-llah, who is very well suited to carry out the rules and movements (in travelling) of the headquarters (lit. presence), was honoured with the title of Fid\u0101\u2019i Kh\u0101n. In this rainy season rain fell in such quantities that old men said that they did not remember such rain in any age. For nearly forty days there was nothing but cloud and rain, so that the sun only appeared occasionally. There was so much wind that many buildings, both old and new, fell down. On the first night there was\\(^1\\) such rain and thunder and lightning as has seldom been heard of. Nearly twenty women and men were killed, and the foundations even of some of the stone buildings were broken up. No noise is more terrifying than this. Till the middle of the month was passed, wind and rain increased. After this they gradually became less. What can be written of the verdure and self-grown fragrant plants? They covered valley and plain and hill and desert. It is not known if in the inhabited world there exists another such place as Mandu for sweetness of air and for the pleasantness of the locality and the neighbourhood, especially in the rainy season. In this season, which lasts for months and extends up to the hot weather, one cannot sleep inside houses without coverlets, and in the day the temperature is such that there is no need for a fan or for change of place. All that could be written would still fall short of the many beauties of the place. I saw two things that I had not seen in any other place in Hindustan. One was the tree of the wild plantain that grows in most of the uncultivated places in the fort, and the other the nest of the wagtail (mam\u016bla), which they call in Persian the dum-s\u012bcha (tail-wagger). Up till now none of the hunters had pointed out its nest. By\n\n\\(^1\\) The text misses out a conjunction before \u0161ad\u0101.\nchance in the building I occupied there was its nest, and it brought out two young ones.\n\nThree watches of day had passed on Thursday, the 19th, when I mounted with the ladies in order to go round and see the courts and buildings on the Shakkar tank, founded by former rulers of Malwa. As an elephant had not been conferred on Itim\u0101du-d-daulah on account of his government of the Panjab, I gave him on the road one of my private elephants of the name of Jagjot. I remained in this enchanting place until the evening, and was much delighted with the pleasantness and greenness of the surrounding open spaces. After performing my evening prayer and counting my rosary, we returned to our fixed residence. On Friday an elephant named Ran-b\u0101dal (cloud of war ?), which Jah\u0101ng\u012br Qul\u012b Kh\u0101n had sent as an offering, was brought before me. Having adopted for myself certain special cloths and cloth-stuffs, I gave an order that no one should wear the same but he on whom I might bestow them. One was a n\u0101dir\u012b coat that they wear over the qab\u0101 (a kind of outer vest). Its length is from the waist down to below the thighs, and it has no sleeves. It is fastened in front with buttons, and the people of Persia call it kurd\u012b (from the country of the Kurds). I gave it the name of nadiri. Another garment is a \u1e6c\u016bs shawl, which my revered father had adopted as a dress. The next was a coat (qaba) with a folded collar (bat\u016b gir\u012bb\u0101n). The ends of the sleeves were embroidered. He had also appropriated this to himself. Another was a qaba with a border, from which the fringes of cloth were cut off and sewn round the skirt and collar and the ends of the sleeve. Another was a qaba of Gujarati satin, and another a ch\u012bra and waistbelt woven with silk, in which were interwoven gold and silver threads.\n\nAs the monthly pay of some of Mah\u0101bat Kh\u0101n\u2019s horsemen, according to the regulation of three and two\nhorsed men, for the performance of duty in the Deccan, had become increased and the service\\(^1\\) had not been performed, I gave an order that the civil officers (div\u0101niy\u0101n) should levy the difference from his jagir. In the end of Thursday, the 26th, corresponding with the 14th Sha'b\u0101n, which is the Shab-i-bar\u0101t, I held a meeting in one of the houses of the palace of N\u016br-Jah\u0101n Begam, which was situated in the midst of large tanks, and summoning the Amirs and courtiers to the feast which had been prepared by the Begam, I ordered them to give the people cups and all kinds of intoxicating drinks according to the desire of each. Many asked for cups, and I ordered that whoever drank a cup should sit according to his mansab and condition. All sorts of roast meats, and fruits by way of relish, were ordered to be placed before everyone. It was a wonderful assembly. In the beginning of the evening they lighted lanterns and lamps all round the tanks and buildings, and a lighting up was carried out the like of which has perhaps never been arranged in any place. The lanterns and lamps cast their reflection on the water, and it appeared as if the whole surface of the tank was a plain of fire. A grand entertainment took place, and the drinkers of cups took more cups than they could carry.\n\n\u201cA feast was arranged that lighted up the heart,\nIt was of such beauty as the heart desired.\nThey flung over this verdant mead\nA carpet broad as the field of genius.\nFrom abundance of perfume the feast spread far,\nThe heavens were a musk-bag by reason of incense,\nThe delicate ones of the garden (the flowers) became glorious,\nThe face of each was lighted up like a lamp.\u201d\\(^2\\)\n\n\\(^1\\) Apparently the meaning is that the standard of two and three horses had not been kept up.\n\n\\(^2\\) Some lines of this agree with the verses in the Akbar-n\u0101ma, ii, 190. The last two lines are quoted again in the account of the 15th year (p. 299 of Persian text).\nAfter three or four gharis of night had passed, I dismissed the men and summoned the ladies, and till a watch of night (remained?) passed the time in this delightful place, and enjoyed myself. On this day of Thursday several special things had happened. One was that it was the day of my ascension of the throne; secondly, it was the Shab-i-bar\u0101t; thirdly, it was the day of the r\u0101kh\u012b, which has already been described, and with the Hindus is a special day. On account of these three pieces of good fortune I called the day Mub\u0101rak-shamba.\n\nOn the 27th, Sayyid K\u0101s\u016b was dignified with the title of Parvarish Kh\u0101n. Wednesday, in the same way that Mub\u0101rak-shamba had been a fortunate one for me, had fallen out exactly the opposite. On this account I gave this evil day the name of Kam-shamba, in order that this day might always fail from the world (lessen).\n\nOn the next day a jewelled dagger was conferred on Y\u0101dg\u0101r Q\u016br\u010d\u012b, and I ordered that after this he should be styled Y\u0101dg\u0101r Beg. I had sent for Jay Singh, son of R\u0101ja Mah\u0101 Singh. On this day he waited on me and presented an elephant as an offering. A watch and three gharis of Mub\u0101rak-shamba, the 2nd of Shahriy\u0101r, had passed, when I rode to look round the Nil-kund and its neighbourhood; thence I passed on to the plain of the \u2018\u012ad-g\u0101h on the top of a mound that was very green and pleasant. Champa flowers and other sweet wild herbs of that plain had bloomed to such a degree that on all sides on which the eye fell the world looked like a world of greenery and flowers. I entered the palace when a watch of night had passed.\n\nAs it had been several times mentioned to me that a kind of sweetmeat was obtained from the wild plantain such that dervishes and other poor people made it their food, I wished to enquire into the matter. What I found was that the fruit of the wild plantain was an exceedingly hard and tasteless thing. The real fact is that in the\nlower part (of the trunk) there is a thing shaped like a fir-cone from which the real fruit of the plantain comes out. On this a kind of sweetmeat forms which has exactly the juiciness and taste of p\u0101l\u016bda. It appears that men eat this and enjoy it.\\(^1\\)\n\nWith regard to carrier pigeons (*kab\u016btar-i-n\u0101ma-bar*), it had been stated to me in the course of conversation that in the time of the Abbaside Caliphs they taught\\(^2\\) the Baghdad pigeons who were styled \u2018letter-carriers\u2019 (*n\u0101ma-bar*), and were one-half larger\\(^3\\) than the wild pigeon. I bade the pigeon-fanciers to teach their pigeons, and they taught some of them in such a manner that we let them fly from Mandu in the early morning, and if there was much rain they reached Burhanpur by \\(2\\frac{1}{2}\\) pahars (watches) of the day, or even in \\(1\\frac{1}{2}\\) pahars. If the air was very clear most of them arrived by one pahar of the day and some by four gharis (hours) of the day.\n\nOn the 3rd a letter came from B\u0101b\u0101 Khurr\u0101m, announcing the coming of Afzal Kh\u0101n and R\u0101y R\u0101y\u0101n and the arrival of the ambassadors of \u2018\u0100dil Kh\u0101n, and their bringing suitable offerings of jewels, jewelled things, elephants, and horses, offerings such as had never come in any reign or time, and expressing much gratitude for the services and loyalty of the aforesaid Kh\u0101n, and his faithfulness to his word and duty. He asked for a gracious royal firman bestowing on him the title of *farzand* (son) and for other favours, which had never\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The account is obscure. Elliot\u2019s translation is \u201cIn the root of the tree is found a lump of sweet substance which is exactly like that of Faluda. It is eaten by the poor.\u201d The text and some MSS. have *yak p\u0101rcha-i-shirin\u012b*, but B.M. Or. 3276 has *yak p\u0101ra*. Roxburgh says nothing about any such growth on the wild plantain. *Fal\u016bda* or *p\u0101l\u016bda* is the name of a sweetmeat.\n\n\\(^2\\) It is curious that the word *am\u0101khta*, \u2018taught,\u2019 in the text, and which appears to be almost necessary for the sense, does not occur either in the two I.O.

Since it was very gratifying to me to please my son, and his request was reasonable, I ordered that the Munshis of the mercurial pen should write a farman in the name of \u2018\u0100dil Kh\u0101n, conveying every kind of affection and favour, and exceeding in his praise ten or twelve times what had been previously written. They were ordered in these farmans to address him as farzand. In the body of the farman I wrote this couplet with my own hand\u2014\n\n\u201cThou\u2019st become, at Sh\u0101h Khurram\u2019s request,\nRenowned in the world as my son\u201d (farzandi).\n\nOn the 4th day this farman was sent off with its copy, so that my son Sh\u0101h Khurram might see the copy and send off the original. On Mub\u0101rak-shamba, the 9th, I went with the ladies to the house of \u0100\u1e63af Kh\u0101n. His house was situated in the valley, and was exceedingly pleasant and bright. It had several valleys round it; in some places there were flowing waterfalls, and mango and other trees exceedingly green and pleasant and shady. Nearly 200 or 300 keora shrubs (gul-i-keor\u0101, Pandanus odoratissimus) grew in one valley. In fine that day passed in great enjoyment. A wine party was held and cups were presented to the Amirs and intimates, and an offering from \u0100\u1e63af Kh\u0101n was laid before me. There were many rare things. I took whatever I approved, and the remainder was given to him. On the same day Khw\u0101ja Mir, son of Sult\u0101n Khw\u0101ja, who had come on a summons from Bangash, waited on me, and presented as an offering a ruby, two pearls, and an elephant. R\u0101ja Bh\u012bm Nar\u0101yan, a zamindar of the province of Gadeha, was promoted to the mansab of 1,000 personal and 500 horse. An order was given that a jagir should be provided him out of his native country. On the 12th a letter came from my son Khurram that R\u0101ja S\u016braj Mal, son of R\u0101ja B\u0101so, whose territory is near the fort of Kangra, had promised that in the course of a year he would\nbring that fort into the possession of the servants of the victorious State. He also sent his letter which covenanted for this. I ordered that after comprehending his desires and wishes, and satisfying himself with regard to them, he should send off the Raja to wait on me, so that he might set about the said duty. On the same day, which was Monday, the 11th, corresponding with the 1st Ramaz\u0101n (2nd September, 1617), after four gharis and seven pals had passed, a daughter was born to my son by the mother of his other children, who was the daughter of \u0100\u1e63af Kh\u0101n. This child was named R\u016bsh\u0101n\u0101r\u0101 Begam. As the Zamindar of Jaitp\u016br, which is in the jurisdiction\\(^1\\) of Mandu, in consequence of wickedness had not had the felicity of kissing the threshold, I ordered Fid\u0101\u2019i Kh\u0101n to proceed against him with some mansabdars and 400 or 500 musketeers and plunder his country. On the 13th one elephant was given to Fid\u0101\u2019i Kh\u0101n and one to Mir Q\u0101sim, son of Sayyid Mur\u0101d. On the 16th Jay Singh, son of R\u0101ja Mah\u0101 Singh, who was 12 years old, was promoted to the mansab of 1,000 personal and horse. To Mir Mir\u0101n, son of Mir Khalilull\u0101h, I gave an elephant which I had myself approved, and another to Mull\u0101 \u2018Abdu-s-Satt\u0101r.\\(^2\\) Bhoj, son of R\u0101ja Bikram\u0101jit Bhadauriy\u0101, after his father\u2019s death, came from the Deccan and waited on me, and presented 100 muhrs as an offering. On the 17th it was represented that R\u0101ja Kaly\u0101n had come from the province of Orissa, and proposed to kiss my threshold. As some unpleasant stories had been told with regard to him, an order was given that they should hand him over with his son to\n\n---\n\n1 The word is \u1e25aw\u0101l\u012b, which is sometimes translated \u2018neighbourhood,\u2019 and has been so translated here by Mr. Rogers. But either Jah\u0101ng\u012br has made a mistake or the word \u1e25aw\u0101l\u012b is capable of a wide interpretation, for Jaitp\u016br appears to be Jaitp\u016br in Kathiawar. See Jarrett, ii, 258, and I.G., vii, 192. Possibly Mandu is a mistake for B\u0101ndh\u016b. But there is a Jetgarh in Malwa (Jarrett, ii, 200).\n\n2 Probably this was the author who collaborated with Jerome Xavier. See Rieu\u2019s Catalogue, iii, 1077.\n\u0100\u1e63af Kh\u0101n to enquire into the truth of what had been said about him. On the 19th an elephant was given to Jay Singh. On the 20th 200 horses were added to the mansab of Kesho D\u0101s M\u0101r\u016b, so that it came, original and increase, to 2,000 personal and 1,200 horse. On the 23rd, having distinguished Allah-d\u0101d, the Afghan, with the title of Rash\u012bd Kh\u0101n, I gave him a parm-narm (shawl). The offering of R\u0101ja Kaly\u0101n Singh, consisting of eighteen elephants, was brought before me; sixteen elephants were included in my private elephant stud, and I presented him with two. As the news had arrived from Iraq of the death of the mother of Mir Mir\u0101n, daughter of Sh\u0101h Isma\u02bfil II, of the race of the \u1e62afaw\u012b kings, I sent him a dress of honour and brought him out of the robes of mourning. On the 25th Fid\u0101\u02bei Kh\u0101n received a dress of honour, and, in company with his brother R\u016b\u1e25u-llah and other mansabdars, obtained leave to go to punish the Zamindar of Jaitpur. On the 28th, having come down from the fort with the intention of seeing the Narbada and to hunt in its neighbourhood, I took the ladies with me, and halted two stages down on the bank of the river. As there were many mosquitoes and fleas, I did not stay more than one night. Having come the next day to T\u0101r\u0101p\u016br, I returned on Friday, the 31st. On the 1st of the month of Mihr, Mu\u1e25sin Khw\u0101ja, who at this time had come from Transoxiana, received a dress of honour and 5,000 rupees. On the 2nd, after enquiry into the matters of R\u0101ja Kaly\u0101n, with regard to which a report had been received, and which \u0100\u1e63af Khan had been appointed to investigate, as he appeared innocent, he enjoyed the good fortune to kiss the threshold, and presented as an offering 100 muhrs and 1,000 rupees. His offering of a string of pearls, consisting of eighty pearls and two rubies, with a bracelet with a ruby and two pearls, and the golden figure of a horse studded with jewels, was laid before\nme. A petition from Fid\u0101'\u012b Kh\u0101n arrived stating that when the victorious army entered the province of Jaitpur the zamindar had elected to run away. He could not oppose Fid\u0101'\u012b, and his country was ravaged. He now repented of what he had done, and intended to come to the Court, which was the asylum of the world, and proffer service and obedience. A force with R\u016b\u1e25u-llah was sent in pursuit of him to capture and bring him to Court, or to lay waste and ruin his domain and imprison his women and dependants, who had gone into the country of the neighbouring zamindars. On the 8th Khw\u0101ja Ni\u1e93\u0101m came and laid before me fourteen pomegranates from the port of Mukh\u0101 (Mocha), which they had brought to Surat in the space of fourteen days, and in eight days more to Mandu. The size of these was the same as that of the Thatta pomegranates. Though the pomegranates of Thatta are seedless and these have seeds,\\(^1\\) yet they are delicate, and in freshness excel those of Thatta. On the 9th news came that while R\u016b\u1e25u-llah was passing through the villages, he came to know that the women and dependants of the Jaitp\u016br\u012b zamindar were in a certain village. He remained outside, and sent men into the village to make enquiries and to bring out the persons who were there. Whilst he was making enquiries, one of the devoted servants of the zamindar came along with the villagers. Whilst his men were scattered here and there, and R\u016b\u1e25u-llah with some servants had brought out his furniture and was sitting on a carpet, that devoted servant came behind him and struck him with a spear; the blow was fatal and the spearhead came out at his breast. The pulling out of the spear and the reverting\\(^2\\) to his original (dying) of R\u016b\u1e25u-llah took place together. Those who were present sent that wretch to hell. All the men who had been\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) I.O.

Those doomed men (kh\u016bn-giriftah\u0101) had the disgrace of harbouring\\(^1\\) rebels and sedition-mongers, and were killed in the course of an astronomical hour. They brought into captivity their wives and daughters, and, setting fire to the village, made it so that nothing was seen but heaps of ashes. They then lifted up the body of R\u016b\u1e25u-llah and went and joined Fid\u0101\u02bei Kh\u0101n. With regard to the bravery and zeal of R\u016b\u1e25u-llah, there was no dispute; at the most, his carelessness brought about this turn of fortune. No traces of habitation remained in that region; the zamindar of that place went into the hills and jungles and concealed and obliterated himself. He then sent someone to Fid\u0101\u02bei Kh\u0101n and begged for pardon for his offences. An order was given that he should be allowed quarter and brought to Court.\n\nThe mansab of Muruwwat Kh\u0101n was fixed, original and increase, at 2,000 personal and 1,500 horse, on condition that he should destroy Harbh\u0101n,\\(^2\\) Zamindar of Chandarko\u1e6da, from whom travellers endured great annoyance. On the 13th R\u0101ja S\u016braj Mal, together with Taq\u012b, the bakhshi who was in attendance on B\u0101b\u0101 Khurram, came and waited on me. He represented all his requirements. His engagement to perform the work was approved, and at the request of my son he was honoured with a standard and drums. To Taq\u012b, who had been appointed with him, a jewelled khapwa (dagger) was given, and it was arranged that he should finish his own affairs and start off quickly. The mansab of Khw\u0101ja \u2018Al\u012b Beg M\u012brz\u0101, who had been appointed to the defence and\n\n\\(^1\\) J\u0101 d\u0101dan, \u2018to give way,\u2019 the meaning apparently being that they had protected R\u016b\u1e25u-llah\u2019s murderers. But I.O. MS. 305 seems to have j\u0101wid\u0101n, \u2018eternal,\u2019 which would mean that they were killed and also eternally disgraced as rebels. The Ma\u02be\u0101\u0161\u012bru-l-umar\u0101, iii, 13, has a different account of the manner of R\u016b\u1e25u-llah\u2019s death. He was Fid\u0101\u02bei\u2019s elder brother.\n\n\\(^2\\) The I.O.

An elephant apiece was given to N\u016bru-d-d\u012bn Quli, Khw\u0101jag\u012b T\u0101hir, Sayyid Kh\u0101n Mu\u1e25ammad, Murta\u1e93\u0101 Kh\u0101n, and Wali Beg. On the 17th the mansab of \u1e24\u0101kim Beg was fixed, original and increase, at 1,000 personal and 200 horse. On the same day, after presenting R\u0101ja S\u016braj Mal with a dress of honour, an elephant, and a jewelled khapwa, and Taq\u012b with a dress of honour, I gave them leave to proceed on duty to Kangra. When those who had been sent by my son of lofty fortune, Sh\u0101h Khurr\u0101m, with the ambassadors of \u2018\u0100dil Kh\u0101n and his offerings, arrived at Burhanpur, and my son\u2019s mind was completely satisfied with regard to the affairs of the Deccan, he prayed for the Subahdarship of Berar, Khandesh, and Ahmadnagar for the Commander-in-Chief, the Khankhanan, and sent his son Sh\u0101h-naw\u0101z Kh\u0101n, who is really Khankhanan junior, with 12,000 cavalry to hold possession of the conquered provinces. Every place and estate were put as jagirs into the hands of reliable men, and fitting arrangements were made for the government of the province. He left, out of the troops that were with him, 30,000 horse and 7,000 musketeer infantry, and took with him the remainder, amounting to 25,000 horse and 2,000 gunners, and set off to wait on me. On Thursday (Mub\u0101rak-shamba), the 20th\\(^1\\) of the month of Mihr (Divine month), in the twelfth year from my accession, corresponding with the 11th Shaww\u0101l, 1026 Hijra (12th October, 1617), after three watches and one ghari had passed, he entered the fort of Mandu auspiciously and joyfully, and had the honour of waiting on me. The duration of our separation was 11\\(^2\\) months and 11 days. After he had\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Text 8th, but should be 20th. See p. 196, where the next Thursday is mentioned as the 27th.

Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n left his father at Ajmir on the last day of Shaww\u0101l, 1025, and he rejoined him on 11th Shaww\u0101l of the following year.\nperformed the dues of salutation and kissing the ground, I called him up into the jharokha, and with exceeding kindness and uncontrolled delight rose from my place and held him in the embrace of affection. In proportion as he strove to be humble and polite, I increased my favours and kindness to him and made him sit near me. He presented 1,000 ashrafis and 1,000 rupees as nazr and the same amount by way of alms. As the time did not allow of his presenting all his offerings, he now brought before me the elephant Sarn\u0101k (?) (snake-head ?), that was the chief of the elephants of \u0100dil Kh\u0101n\u2019s offering, with a casket of precious stones. After this the bakhshis were ordered to arrange according to their mansabs the Amirs who had come with my son to pay their respects. The first who had the honour of audience was Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n. Sending for him above, I selected him for the honour of kissing my feet. He presented 1,000 muhrs and 1,000 rupees as nazr, and a casket filled with jewels and jewelled things as an offering (p\u012bsh-kash). What was accepted of his offering was worth 45,000 rupees. After this \u2018Abdu-llah Kh\u0101n kissed the threshold, and presented 100 muhrs as nazr. Then Mah\u0101bat Kh\u0101n had the honour of kissing the ground, and presented an offering of 100 muhrs and 1,000 rupees, with a parcel (g\u0101th\u1e5b\u012b)\u00b9 of precious stones and jewelled vessels, the value of which was 124,000 rupees. Of these one ruby weighed 11 miskals; an European brought it last year to sell at Ajmir, and priced it at 200,000 rupees, but the jewellers valued it at 80,000 rupees. Consequently the bargain did not come off, and it was returned to him and he took it away. When he came to Burhanpur, Mah\u0101bat Kh\u0101n bought it from him for 100,000 rupees. After this R\u0101ja Bh\u0101o Singh waited on me, presenting 1,000 rupees as nazr and some jewels and jewelled things as a p\u012bsh-kash.\n\n\u00b9 So in text, but I.O. MSS. have kur\u1e63\u012b, \u2018a chair or stool\u2019 (l. 37).\nIn the same manner D\u0101r\u0101b Kh\u0101n, son of the Khan-khanan, Sard\u0101r Kh\u0101n, brother of \u2018Abdu-l-lah Kh\u0101n, Shaj\u0101\u2019at Kh\u0101n the Arab, Day\u0101nat Kh\u0101n, Sh\u0101h-b\u0101z Kh\u0101n, Mu\u2019tamad Kh\u0101n bakhshi, \u016ad\u0101 R\u0101m,\\(^1\\) who was one of the chief Amirs of Ni\u1e93\u0101mu-l-mulk, and who came on the promise of my son Sh\u0101h Khurr\u0101m and joined the ranks of the loyal, waited on me in the order of their mansabs. After this the Wakils of \u2018\u0100dil Kh\u0101n had the honour of kissing the ground, and presented a letter from him. Before this, as a reward for the conquest of the R\u0101n\u0101, a mansab of 20,000 personal and 10,000 horse was conferred on my son of lofty fortune. When he had hastened to the capture of the Deccan he had obtained the title of Shah, and now, in reward for this distinguished service, I gave him a mansab of 30,000 personal and 20,000 horse, and bestowed on him the title of Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n. An order was given that henceforth they should place a chair in the paradise-resembling assemblies near my throne for my son to sit upon. This was a special favour for my son, as it had never been the custom heretofore. A special dress of honour with a gold-embroidered ch\u0101rqab, with collar, the end of the sleeves and the skirt decorated with pearls, worth 50,000 rupees, a jewelled sword with a jewelled pard\u0101la (belt), and a jewelled dagger were bestowed upon him. In his honour I myself came down from the jharokha and poured over his head a small tray of jewels and a tray of gold (coins).\\(^2\\) Having called Sarn\u0101k elephant to me, I saw without doubt that what had been heard in its praise and of its beauty was real. It stood all the tests in size, form, and beauty. Few elephants are to be seen of such beauty. As it appeared acceptable to me, I myself mounted (i.e. drove it) and took it into my private palace, and scattered a quantity of gold coins on its head,\n\n\\(^1\\) Text b\u016bdand, but \u016ad\u0101 R\u0101m is the only Dakhani officer mentioned.\n\n\\(^2\\) The MSS. have zar-baft, \u2018gold brocade.\u2019\nand ordered them to tie it up inside the royal palace. With regard to this I gave it the name of N\u016br-bakht\\(^1\\) (light of fortune). On Friday, the 24th, R\u0101ja Bharjiv, Zamindar of Bagl\u0101\u1e47a, came and waited on me. His name is Part\u0101p; every Raja there has been of that place they call Bharjiv. He has about 1,500 horse in his pay (\\textit{maw\u0101jib-khw\u0101r}), and in time of need he can bring into the field 3,000 horse. The province of Bagl\u0101\u1e47a lies between Gujarat, Khandesh, and the Deccan. It has two strong forts, S\u0101ler and M\u0101ler (Muler), and as M\u0101ler is in the midst of a populous country he lives there himself. The country of Bagl\u0101\u1e47a has pleasant springs and running waters. The mangoes of that region are very sweet and large, and are gathered for nine months from the beginning of immaturity\\(^2\\) until the end. It has many grapes, but not of the best kinds. The afore-said Raja does not drop the thread of caution and prudence in dealing with the rulers of Gujarat, the Deccan, and Khandesh. He has never gone himself to see any of them, and if any of them has wished to stretch out his hand to possess his kingdom, he has remained undisturbed through the support of the others.\n\nAfter the provinces of Gujarat, the Deccan, and Khandesh came into the possession of the late king (Akbar), Bharjiv came to Burhanpur and had the honour of kissing his feet, and after being enrolled among his servants was raised to the mansab of 3,000. At this time, when Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n went to Burhanpur, he brought eleven elephants as an offering. He came to Court in attendance on my son, and in accordance with his friendship and service was dignified with royal favours, and had presented to him a jewelled sword, an elephant, a horse, and dress of honour. After some days I conferred on him three rings of jacinth (\\textit{y\u0101q\u016bt}), diamond, and ruby. On Mub\u0101rak-\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) In reference to his own name of N\u016bru-d-d\u012bn.\n\n\\(^2\\) \\textit{Gh\u016brag\u012b}, \u2018unripeness.\u2019\nshamba (Thursday), the 27th, N\u016br-Jah\u0101n Begam prepared a feast of victory for my son Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n, and conferred on him dresses of honour of great price, with a n\u0101dir\u012b with embroidered flowers, adorned with rare pearls, a sarpi\u010d (turban ornament) decorated with rare gems, a turban with a fringe of pearls, a waistbelt studded with pearls, a sword with jewelled pardala (belt), a ph\u016bl kai\u1e6d\u0101ra (dagger), a sadu (?) of pearls, with two horses, one of which had a jewelled saddle, and a special elephant with two females. In the same way she gave his children and his ladies dresses of honour, t\u016bquz (nine pieces) of cloth with all sorts of gold ornaments, and to his chief servants as presents a horse, a dress of honour, and a jewelled dagger. The cost of this entertainment was about 300,000 rupees. Presenting on the same day a horse and dress of honour to \u2018Abdu-llah Kh\u0101n and Sard\u0101r Kh\u0101n, his brother, I gave them leave to go to the Sarkar of Kalpi, which had been given them in jagir, and also dismissed Shaj\u0101\u2018at Kh\u0101n to his jagir, which was in the Subah of Gujarat, with a dress of honour and an elephant. I dismissed Sayyid H\u0101j\u012b, who was a jagirdar of Behar, with a gift of a horse.\n\nIt was frequently reported to me that Kh\u0101n Daur\u0101n had become old and weak, so as to be unfit for active duty, and the Subahs of Kabul and Bangash is a land of disturbance, and to subdue the Afghans required riding and active movement. Inasmuch as caution is the condition of rule, I appointed Mah\u0101bat Kh\u0101n, Subahdar of Kabul and Bangash, giving him a dress of honour, and promoted Kh\u0101n Daur\u0101n to the governorship of the province of Thatta. Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Kh\u0101n Fath-jang had sent as an offering from Behar forty-nine elephants; these were submitted to me. On this day they brought some s\u014dna-kela (golden plantains, bananas) for me. I had never eaten such plantains before. In size they are one finger, and are very sweet and of good flavour; they\nhave no resemblance to plantains of other descriptions, but are somewhat indigestible, so that from the two that I ate I experienced heaviness, whilst others say they can eat as many as seven or eight. Though plantains are really unfit to eat, yet of all the kinds this is the one fit to eat. This year, up to the 23rd of the month of Mihr, Muqarrab Kh\u0101n sent Gujarat mangoes by post (d\u0101k-chauk\u012b).\n\nOn this date I heard that Muhammad Riz\u0101, ambassador of my brother Sh\u0101h \u2018Abb\u0101s, gave up the deposit of his life at Agra through the disease of ish\u0101l (diarrhoea). I made the merchant Mu\u1e25ammad Q\u0101sim, who had come from my brother, his executor, and ordered that according to the will he should convey his goods and chattels to the Shah, so that he might grant them in his own presence to the heirs of the deceased. Elephants and dresses of honour were conferred on Sayyid Kab\u012br and Bakhtar Kh\u0101n, Wakils of \u2018\u0100dil Kh\u0101n. On Mub\u0101rak-shamba, the 13th \u0100b\u0101n, Jah\u0101ng\u012br Quli Beg, Turkman, who is dignified with the title of J\u0101n-sip\u0101r Kh\u0101n, came from the Deccan and waited on me. His father was included among the Amirs of Iran. He had come from Persia in the time of the late king Akbar, and having a mansab conferred on him was sent to the Deccan. He was brought up in that Subah. Although he had been appointed to a duty, yet as my son Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n came at this time to pay his respects and represented his sincerity and devotion, I ordered that he should come post to Court and have the good fortune to wait upon me and then return. On this day I promoted \u016ad\u0101 R\u0101m\u00b9 to the rank of 3,000 personal and 1,500 horse. He is a brahmin by caste, and was much relied on by \u2018Ambar. At the time when Sh\u0101h-naw\u0101z Kh\u0101n went against \u2018Ambar, \u0100dam Kh\u0101n Habshi, J\u0101d\u016b R\u0101y, B\u0101b\u016b R\u0101y K\u0101yath, \u016ad\u0101 R\u0101m, and some other Sard\u0101rs of Niz\u0101mu-l-mulk\n\n\u00b9 The \u016ad\u0101j\u012b R\u0101m of Ma\u2019\u0101\u0161iru-l-umar\u0101, i, 142.\nleft him and came to Sh\u0101h-naw\u0101z Kh\u0101n. After \u2018Ambar\u2019s defeat they, by the persuasions of \u2018\u0100dil Kh\u0101n and the deceit of \u2018Ambar, left the right road again and gave up their loyalty and service. \u2018Ambar took an oath on the Koran to \u0100dam Kh\u0101n and put him off his guard, and, capturing him deceitfully, imprisoned him in the fort of Daulatabad, and at last killed him. B\u0101b\u016b R\u0101y K\u0101yath and \u016ad\u0101 R\u0101m came away and went to the borders of \u2018\u0100dil Kh\u0101n\u2019s dominions, but he would not admit them into his territory. About that time B\u0101b\u016b R\u0101y K\u0101yath lost his life (lit. played away the coin of existence) by the deceit of his intimates, and \u2018Ambar sent a force against \u016ad\u0101 R\u0101m. He fought well and defeated \u2018Ambar\u2019s army. But afterwards, as he could not remain in that country, he threw himself on to the borders of the royal dominions, and, having got a promise, came with his family and dependants and entered the service of my son Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n. That son distinguished him with favours and kindnesses of all sorts, and made him hopeful by giving him a mansab of 3,000 personal and 1,000 horse, and brought him to Court. As he was a useful servant, I increased this by 500 horse. I also increased the mansab of Sh\u0101h-b\u0101z Kh\u0101n, who had one of 2,000 personal and 1,500 horse, by 500 more horse, and gave him the faujdarship of the Sarkar of S\u0101rangp\u016br and a part of the Subah of Malwa. A special horse and elephant were given to Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n.\n\nOn Mub\u0101rak-shamba (Thursday), the 10th of the month, my son Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n produced his own offerings\u2014jewels and jewelled things and fine cloths and other rare things. These were all laid out in the courtyard of the jharokha, and arranged together with the horses and elephants adorned with gold and silver trappings. In order to please him I came down from the jharokha and looked through them in detail. Among all these there was a fine ruby they had bought for my son at the port of Goa for 200,000 rupees; its weight was $19\\frac{1}{2}$ tanks, or\n17 miskals, and $5\\frac{1}{2}$ surkhs. There was no ruby in my establishment over 12 tanks, and the jewellers agreed to this valuation. Another was a sapphire, among the offerings of \u2018\u0100dil Kh\u0101n; it weighed 6 tanks and 7 surkhs and was valued at 100,000 rupees. I never before saw a sapphire of such a size and good colour. Another was the Chamkora diamond, also of \u2018\u0100dil Kh\u0101n\u2019s; its weight was 1 tank and 6 surkhs, which they valued at 40,000 rupees. The name of Chamkora is derived from this, that there is in the Deccan a plant called s\u0101g-i-chamkora.\\footnote{Jamk\u016bra is given in Forbes as the Dakhani word for a covering made of reeds or palm-leaves and used in rainy weather.} At the time when Murta\u1e93\u0101 Ni\u1e93\u0101mu-l-mulk conquered Berar he had gone one day with his ladies round to look at the garden, when one of the women found the diamond in a chamkora vegetable, and took it to Ni\u1e93\u0101mu-l-mulk. From that day it became known as the Chamkora diamond, and came into the possession of the present Ibr\u0101h\u012bm \u2018\u0100dil Kh\u0101n during the interregnum (fatar\u0101t) of Ahmadnagar.\n\nAnother was an emerald, also among \u2018\u0100dil Kh\u0101n\u2019s offerings. Although it is from a new mine, it is of such a beautiful colour and delicacy as I have never before seen. Again, there were two pearls, one of the weight of 64 surkhs, or 2 miskals and 11 surkhs, and it was valued at 25,000 rupees. The other weighed 16 surkhs, and was of exceeding roundness and fineness. It was valued at 12,000 rupees. Another was a diamond from the offerings of Qu\u1e6dbu-l-mulk, in weight 1 tank, and valued at 30,000 rupees. There were 150 elephants, out of which three had gold trappings, chains, etc., and nine had silver trappings. Though twenty\\footnote{The MS. has eight.} elephants were put into my private stud, five were very large and celebrated. The first, N\u016br-bakht, which my son presented on the day of meeting, was worth 125,000 rupees. The second, Mahipati,\\footnote{In the MSS. the name seems to be Hansomat (swan-like ?).} from the offerings of \u2018\u0100dil Kh\u0101n, was valued...\nat 100,000 rupees; I gave it the name of Durjans\u0101l. Another, also from his offerings, was Bakht-buland, and valued at 100,000 rupees; I called it Gir\u0101n-b\u0101r. Another was Qadd\u016bs Kh\u0101n, and the fifth was Im\u0101m Riz\u0101. They were from the offerings of Qu\u1e63bu-l-mulk. Each of the two was valued at 100,000 rupees. Again, there were 100 Arab and Iraq horses, most of which were good horses. Of these, three had jewelled saddles. If the private offerings of my son and those of the rulers of the Deccan were to be written down in detail, it would be too long a business. What I accepted of his presents was worth 2,000,000 rupees. In addition to this he gave his (step-)mother,\\(^1\\) N\u016br-Jah\u0101n Begam, offerings worth 200,000 rupees, and 60,000 rupees to his other mothers and the Begams. Altogether my son\u2019s offerings came to 2,260,000 rupees, or 75,000 tumans of the currency of Iran or 6,780,000 current T\u016br\u0101n-kh\u0101nis. Such offerings had never been made during this dynasty. I showed him much attention and favour; in fact, he is a son who is worth grace and kindness. I am very pleased and satisfied with him. May God Almighty allow him to enjoy long life and prosperity!\n\nAs I had never in my life had any elephant-hunting, and had a great desire to see the province of Gujarat and to look on the salt sea, and my huntsmen had often gone and seen wild elephants and fixed on hunting-places, it occurred to me to travel through Ahmadabad and look on the sea, and having hunted elephants on my return, when it was hot and the season for hunting them, to go back to Agra. With this intention I despatched to Agra \u1e24a\u1e93rat Maryamu-z-zam\u0101n (his mother) and the other Begams and people of the harem with the baggage and extra establishments, and betook myself to a tour in the Subah of Gujarat to hunt, with such as were indispensable\n\n\\(^1\\) Text has w\u0101lida-i-kh\u016bd, \u2018his own mother.\u2019\nwith me. On the eve of Friday in the month of \u0100b\u0101n (precise date not given, but apparently the 10th), I marched auspiciously and happily from Mandu, and pitched on the bank of the tank of N\u0101lchh\u0101. In the morning I went out to hunt and killed a blue bull with my gun. On the eve of Saturday, Mah\u0101bat Kh\u0101n was presented with a special horse and an elephant, and obtained leave to go to his Subah of Kabul and Bangash. At his request I conferred on Rash\u012bd Kh\u0101n a robe of honour, a horse, an elephant, and a jewelled dagger, and appointed him to assist him. I promoted Ibr\u0101h\u012bm \u1e24usain to the post of bakhshi in the Deccan, and M\u012brak \u1e24usain to that of news-writer in the same Subah. R\u0101ja Kaly\u0101n,\u00b9 son of R\u0101ja Todar Mal, had come from the Subah of Orissa; on account of some faults which had been attributed to him he had for some days been forbidden the honour of paying his respects. After enquiry his innocence appeared clear, and having given him a dress of honour and a horse, I appointed him to do duty together with Mah\u0101bat Kh\u0101n in Bangash. On Monday I gave the Wakils of \u2018\u0100dil Kh\u0101n jewelled turban fringes after the fashion of the Deccan, one of the value of 5,000 rupees and the other worth 4,000 rupees. As Afzal Kh\u0101n and R\u0101y R\u0101y\u0101n had performed the duties of Wakils to my son Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n in a becoming manner, I raised them both in mansab and honoured R\u0101y R\u0101y\u0101n with the title of Bikram\u0101jit, which among Hindus is the highest title. In truth he is a servant worthy of patronage. On Saturday, the 12th, I went to hunt and shot two female nilgaw. As the hunting-ground was a long way from this halting-place, I on Monday marched $4\\frac{1}{2}$ kos\u00b2 and pitched at the village of Kaid \u1e24asan. On Tuesday, the 15th, I killed three blue bulls, the larger one of which weighed 12 maunds. On this day Mirz\u0101\n\n\u00b9 A repetition. \u00b2 The MSS. have $3\\frac{3}{4}$ kos.\nRustam escaped a great danger.\\(^1\\) It seems that he had taken aim at a mark and fired his gun. Then he reloaded, and as his bullet was very flexible, he rested the gun on his chest and put the bullet between his teeth in order that he might contract it and put it right. By chance the match reached the pan, and his chest at the place where the gun was resting was burnt to the extent of the palm of the hand, and the grains of powder got into his skin and flesh and a wound was made, and he suffered much pain.\\(^2\\)\n\nOn Sunday (?), the 16th,\\(^3\\) four nilgaw were killed, three females and one b\u016bkra\\(^4\\) nilgaw. On Mub\u0101rak-shamba (Thursday) I went to look round a hill valley in which there was a waterfall near the camp. At this season it had but little water, but as for two or three days they had dammed the watercourse and, about the time of my reaching the place, let it loose, it flowed over very well. Its height might be 20 gaz. It separates at the top of the hill and flows down. In this way it is a great boon (ghan\u012bmat) on the road. Having enjoyed the usual cups on the edge of the stream and the shade of the hill, I came back to the camp at night. On this day the Zamindar of Jaitpur, whose offences I had forgiven at the request of my son Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n, had the good fortune of kissing the threshold. On Friday, the 18th, a large blue bull and a bukra, and on Saturday, the 19th, two females, were killed.\n\n\\(^1\\) Text kh\u0101\u1e6da, \u2018fault,\u2019 but the MSS. show that the word is kh\u0101\u1e6dar, \u2018danger.\u2019\n\n\\(^2\\) The passage is obscure, and the MSS. do not throw much light on it. Fortunately for the Mirz\u0101, there was no bullet in his gun. The word which I have translated by \u2018flexible\u2019 is raw\u0101n. Perhaps the meaning is quite different. Possibly it is \u201che would fire a shot and then reload. As many of his bullets had been shot away, he put a pellet (ghalul\u0101) into his mouth and was shaping it,\u201d etc.\n\n\\(^3\\) He has just spoken of Tuesday as the 15th! And as Jah\u0101ng\u012br did not shoot on Sundays, Sunday must be a mistake for Wednesday. It is Wednesday in L.O. MS. 305.\n\n\\(^4\\) Perhaps b\u016bkra here means a male nilgaw; b\u016bkra means also a he-goat.\nAs my huntsmen represented that there was much game in the parganah of H\u0101\u1e63ilp\u016br, I left my large camp at this halting-place, and on Sunday, the 20th, and with some of my close attendants, hastened to H\u0101\u1e63ilp\u016br, a distance of 3 kos. Mir \u1e24us\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn, son of Mir Jam\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn \u1e24usain Inj\u016b, who has the title of \u2018A\u1e93udu-d-daulah, was promoted to the mansab, original and increase, of 1,000 personal and 400 horse. I presented Y\u0101dg\u0101r \u1e24usain Q\u016bsh-begi and Y\u0101dg\u0101r Q\u016brchi, who had been appointed to do duty in Bangash, with an elephant each. On this day some \u1e24usain\u012b grapes without seeds arrived from Kabul; they were very fresh. The tongue of this suppliant at the throne of God fails in gratitude for the favours by which, notwithstanding a distance of three months, grapes from Kabul arrive quite fresh in the Deccan. On Monday, the 21st, three small blue bulls, on Tuesday, the 22nd, one blue bull and three cows, and on Kam-shamba (Wednesday), the 23rd, one cow, were killed. On Mub\u0101rak-shamba, the 24th, a feast of cups was held on the bank of the tank of H\u0101\u1e63ilp\u016br. Cups were presented to my son Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n and some of the great Amirs and private servants. On Yus\u016bf Kh\u0101n, son of \u1e24usain Kh\u0101n (Tukriyah), who was of the houseborn ones worthy of patronage, was bestowed the mansab of 3,000 personal and 1,500 horse, original and increase, and he was dismissed to the faujdarship of Gondw\u0101na, dignifying him with a gift of a dress of honour and an elephant. R\u0101y Bih\u0101r\u012b D\u0101s, the diwan of the Subah of the Deccan, had the good fortune to kiss the threshold. On Friday J\u0101n-sip\u0101r Kh\u0101n was exalted with a standard, presented with a horse and a dress of honour, and despatched to the Deccan. This day I made a remarkable shot with a gun. By chance there was inside the palace a khirn\u012b tree (*Mimusops Kauki*). A qurisha\u00b9 (?) came\n\n\u00b9 This is the same kind of bird that N\u016br-Jah\u0101n is mentioned as having shot. Perhaps a green pigeon is meant.\nand sat on a high branch, and I saw its breast in the midst of it. I fired at it and struck it in the middle of its breast; from where I stood to the top of the branch was 22 gaz. On Saturday, the 26th, marching about 2 kos, I pitched at the village of Kam\u0101lp\u016br. On this day I shot a blue bull.\\(^1\\) Rustam Kh\u0101n, who was one of the principal attendants of my son Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n, and who had been appointed from Burhanpur with a body of the royal servants against the zamindars of Gondw\u0101na, having taken a tribute of 110 elephants and 120,000 rupees, came this day to wait upon me. Z\u0101hid, son of Shaj\u0101'at Kh\u0101n, was given the mansab of 1,000 personal and 400 horse, original and increase. On Sunday, the 27th, I hunted with hawks and falcons. On Monday I killed a large blue bull and a bukra; the bull weighed \\(12\\frac{1}{2}\\) maunds. On Tuesday, the 29th, a blue bull was killed. Bahl\u016bl Miy\u0101na and Allah-y\u0101r came from service in Gondw\u0101na, and had the good fortune to wait upon me. Bahl\u016bl Kh\u0101n is the son of Hasan Miy\u0101na, and Miy\u0101na is an Afghan tribe. In the commencement of his career \u1e24asan was a servant of \u0160\u0101diq Kh\u0101n, but a servant who recognized the king (worthy of a king's service), and was at last included among the royal servants and died on service in the Deccan. After his death his sons were granted mansabs. He had eight sons, and two of them became famous as swordsmen. The elder brother in his youth gave up the deposit of his life. Bahl\u016bl by degrees was promoted to the mansab of 1,000. At this time my son Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n arrived at Burhanpur, and, finding him worthy of patronage, made him hopeful with a mansab of 1,500 personal and 1,000 horse. As he had not yet waited on me and was very desirous to kiss the threshold, I summoned him to Court. He is in truth\n\n\\(^1\\) Text nila, without the addition of g\u0101v. The MSS. have gor or chor, a pheasant (?).\na good Kh\u0101na-z\u0101da (household-born one), inasmuch as his heart is adorned with the perfection of bravery and his exterior is not wanting in good appearance. The mansab my son Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n had bespoken for him was granted at his request, and he was honoured with the title of Sar-buland Kh\u0101n. Allah-y\u0101r Koka was also a brave youth and a servant worthy of patronage. Finding him fit and suitable for service in my presence, I sent for him to Court. On Kam-shamba (Wednesday), the 1st of the month of \u0100zar, I went out to hunt and shot a blue bull. On this day the Kashmir reports were laid before me. One was that in the house of a certain silk-seller two girls were born with teeth, and with their backs as far as the waist joined together, but the heads, arms, and legs were separate; they lived a short time and died. On Mub\u0101rak-shamba, the 2nd, on the bank of a tank where my tents were, a feast of cups was held. Presenting Lashkar Kh\u0101n with a dress of honour and an elephant, I promoted him to the duty of diwan of the Subah of the Deccan, and gave him the mansab of 2,500 personal and 1,500 horse, original and increase. To each of the Wakils of \u2018\u0100dil Kh\u0101n two kaukab-i-\u1e6d\u0101li\u2018 (horoscope star) muhrs, the weight of each of which was 500 ordinary muhrs, were given. I gave a horse and robe of honour to Sar-buland Kh\u0101n. As fitting service and approved activity were manifest in Allah-y\u0101r Koka, I honoured him with the title of Himmat Kh\u0101n and gave him a dress of honour. On Friday, the 3rd, I marched 4\u00bd kos and halted the royal standards in the parganah of Dikht\u0101n. On Saturday also I marched 4\u00bd kos and halted at the township of Dh\u0101r.\n\nDh\u0101r is one of the old cities, and R\u0101ja Bhoj, who was\n\n---\n\n1 Elliot, vi, 352.\n2 The 'two' is omitted in text.\n3 In Sark\u0101r M\u0101nd\u016b (Jarrett, ii, 207).

From his time 1,000\\(^1\\) years have passed, and in the time of the Sultans of Malwa it was for a long time the capital. At the time when Sult\u0101n Mu\u1e25ammad Tughluq was proceeding to the conquest of the Deccan, he built a fort of cut stone on the top of a ridge. Outside it is very showy and handsome, but inside the fort is devoid of buildings. I ordered them to measure its length, breadth, and height. The length inside the fort was 12 tan\u0101b, 7 gaz; the breadth, 17 tanab, 13 gaz, and the breadth of the fort wall 19\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) gaz. Its height up to the battlements appeared to be 17\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) gaz. The length of the outer circuit (?) of the fort was 55 tanabs. \u2018Am\u012bd Sh\u0101h Ghor\u012b, who was called Dil\u0101war Kh\u0101n, and who in the time of Sult\u0101n Mu\u1e25ammad, son of Sult\u0101n Fir\u016bz, king of Delhi, had complete authority over the province of Malwa, built the J\u0101mi\u2019 mosque in the inhabitable part outside the fort, and opposite the gate of the mosque fixed a quadrangular iron column. When Sult\u0101n Bah\u0101dur of Gujarat took the province of Malwa into his own possession, he wished to transfer this column to Gujarat. The artificers did not take proper precautions when they lowered it, and it fell and broke into two pieces, one of them of 7\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) gaz and the other of 4\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) gaz. The column was 1\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) gaz round. As it was lying there useless, I ordered them to take the larger piece to Agra and put\\(^2\\) it up in the courtyard of the mausoleum of H.M. Akbar, and to burn a lamp on the top of it at night. The aforesaid mosque has two gates. In front of the arch of one gate some sentences in prose have been carved on a stone tablet; their purport is that \u2018Am\u012bd Sh\u0101h Ghor\u012b founded this mosque in the\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The MSS. have \u201cmore than 1,000.\u201d R\u0101ja Bhoj\u2019s date, according to Tod, is 567 A.D.

After his death through destiny the rule was transferred4 to Mahm\u016bd Khalji, son of Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n, who had been Vizier to H\u016bshang, and passed from him to his son Ghiy\u0101\u1e63u-d-d\u012bn, and after him to N\u0101\u1e63iru-d-d\u012bn, son of Ghiy\u0101\u1e63u-d-d\u012bn, who gave his father poison and sat on the throne of infamy. From him it passed to his son Mahm\u016bd. Sult\u0101n Bah\u0101dur of Gujar\u0101t took from Mahm\u016bd the province of Malwa. The succession of kings of Malwa ended with the aforesaid Mahm\u016bd.\n\nOn Monday, the 6th, I went to hunt and shot a female nilgaw. Presenting an elephant to Mirz\u0101 Sharafu-d-d\u012bn Husain K\u0101shghari, I dismissed him to duty in the Subah of Bangash. A present of a jewelled dagger, a muhr of 100 tolas, and 20,000 darbs was made to \u016ad\u0101 R\u0101m. On Tuesday, the 7th, I shot an alligator in the tank at Dh\u0101r. Though only the top of his snout was visible and the rest of his body was hidden in the water, I fired\n\n---\n\n1 The MSS. have 807, and this is correct, for Dil\u0101war conquered Malwa in 803 = 1400.\n2 Probably this means that \u2018Am\u012bd was the son of D\u0101\u2019\u016bd.\n3 Text 70, but should be 7. 807 = 1405.\n4 A son of H\u016bshang, Muhammad Sh\u0101h, intervened.\nat a guess and hit him in his lungs and killed him with a single shot. An alligator is of the crocodile species and exists in most of the rivers of Hindustan, and grows very large. This one was not so very big. An alligator has been seen (by me) 8 gaz long and 1 gaz in breadth. On Sunday, marching $4\\frac{1}{2}$ kos, I halted at Sa\u2019dalp\u016br. In this village there is a stream over which N\u0101\u0161iru-d-d\u012bn Khalji built a bridge and erected buildings. It is a place like K\u0101liy\u0101da, and both are his works. Although his building is not worthy of praise, yet as it has been built in the river-bed and they have made rivulets and reservoirs, it is somewhat remarkable. At night I ordered them to place lamps all round the canals and streams. On Mub\u0101rak-shamba (Thursday), the 9th, a feast of cups was held. On this day I made a present to my son Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n of a ruby of one colour, weighing 9 tanks and 5 surkh, of the value of 125,000 rupees, with two pearls. This is the ruby which had been given to my father at the time of my birth by \u1e24azrat Maryam-mak\u0101n\u012b, mother of H.M. Akbar, by way of present when my face was shown, and was for many years in his sarpich (turban ornament). After him I also happily wore it in my sarpich. Apart from its value and delicacy, as it had come down as of auspicious augury to the everlasting State, it was bestowed on my son. Having raised Mub\u0101riz Kh\u0101n to a mansab of 1,500 personal and horse, I appointed him to the faujdarship of the province of Mew\u0101t, distinguishing him with the present of a dress of honour, a sword, and an elephant. A sword was given to Himmat Kh\u0101n, son of Rustam Kh\u0101n. I gave Kam\u0101l Kh\u0101n, the huntsman, who is one of the old servants and is always present with me on hunting expeditions, the title of Shik\u0101r Kh\u0101n (hunting-Kh\u0101n). Appointing \u016ad\u0101 R\u0101m to service in the Subah of the Deccan, I conferred on him a dress of honour, an elephant, and Iraq horses (lit. wind-footed ones), and sent with him for the\nCommander-in-Chief, Khankhanan, the \u0100t\u0101liq, a special gilt dagger (zar-nish\u0101n). On Friday, the 10th, I halted. On Saturday, the 11th, I marched $3\\frac{3}{4}$ kos and halted at the village of \u1e24alwat.\\(^1\\) On Sunday, the 12th, marching 5 kos, I halted in the parganah \\(^2\\) of Badnor. This parganah from the time of my father had been in the jagir of Kesho D\u0101s M\u0101r\u016b,\\(^3\\) and in fact had become a kind of wa\u1e6dan (native country) to him. He had constructed gardens and buildings. Out of these one was a well (b\u0101ol\u012b) (step-well probably) on the road, which appeared exceedingly pleasant and well made. It occurred to me that if a well had to be made anywhere on a roadside it should be built like this one. At least two such ought to be made.\n\nOn Monday, the 13th, I went to hunt and shot a blue bull. From the day on which the elephant N\u016br-bakht was put into the special elephant stables, there was an order that he should be tied up in the public palace (court). Among animals elephants have the greatest liking for water; they delight to go into the water, notwithstanding the winter and the coldness of the air, and if there should be no water into which they can go, they will take it from a water-bag (mashk) with their trunks and pour it over their bodies. It occurred to me that however much an elephant delights in water, and it is suited to their temperament, yet in the winter the cold water must affect them. I accordingly ordered the water to be made lukewarm (as warm as milk) before they (the elephants) poured it into their trunks. On other days when they poured cold water over themselves they evidently shivered, but with warm water, on the contrary, they were delighted. This usage is entirely my own.\n\n\\(^1\\) The MSS. have Jalot (as in the Hindi version).\n\\(^2\\) Text, \u201cthe parganah aforesaid.\u201d But the MSS. have Badnor. See infra, p. 204 of text. (In this passage the Hindi version has Madlor.)\n\\(^3\\) Blochmann, p. 502.\nOn Tuesday, the 14th, marching 6 kos, I halted at Silgarh (Sabalgargh ?). On Wednesday, the 15th, crossing the Mahi River, a halt was made near R\u0101mgarh. A march of 6 kos was made on Thursday, the 16th, and a halt was made and a feast of cups held at a waterfall near the camp. Distinguishing Sar-buland Kh\u0101n with a standard and giving him an elephant, I dismissed him to do duty in the Deccan. His mansab, original and increase, was fixed at 1,500 personal and 1,200 horse. R\u0101ja Bhim Nar\u0101yan, Zamindar of Gadeha, who had been promoted to the mansab of 1,000 horse, obtained leave to go to his jagir. Having raised R\u0101ja Bharjiv, Zamindar of Bagl\u0101na, to the mansab of 4,000, I gave him leave to go to his native country, and an order was given that when he arrived there he should send to Court his eldest son, who was his successor, that he might do duty in my presence. I honoured H\u0101ji Bal\u016bch, who was the chief of the huntsmen and was an active and old servant, with the title of Bal\u016bch Kh\u0101n. On Friday, the 17th, marching 5 kos, I alighted at the village of Dh\u0101vala. On Saturday, the 18th, which was the feast of Qurb\u0101n, after the Qurb\u0101n rites had been performed, marching $3\\frac{1}{4}$ kos, I halted on the bank of the tank of the village of N\u0101gor.\u00b9 On Sunday, the 19th, marching about 5 kos, the royal standards were erected on the bank of the tank of the village of Samriya. On Monday, the 20th, marching $4\\frac{1}{4}$ kos, we alighted at the chief place of the Dohad\u00b2 parganah. This parganah is on the boundary between Malwa and Gujarat. Until I passed Badnor the whole country was a jungle, with an abundance of trees and stony land. On Tuesday, the 21st, I halted. On Kamshamba (Wednesday), the 22nd, marching $5\\frac{1}{4}$ kos, I halted at the village of Rany\u0101d (Ren\u0101v ?). On Thursday, the 23rd, I halted and held a feast of cups on the bank of\n\n\u00b9 MSS. B\u0101kor.\n\u00b2 Dah\u016bt in MSS. But Dohad seems right, as it means two boundaries.\nthe village tank. On Friday, the 24th, marching 2\u00bd kos, the royal standards were hoisted at the village of J\u0101lot. At this halt some jugglers from the Carnatic came and showed their tricks. One of them placed one end of an iron chain, 5\u00bd gaz in length and weighing 1 seer and 2 dams,\u00b9 in his throat and slowly swallowed it with the aid of water. It was for a while in his stomach; after this he brought it up. On Saturday, the 25th, there was a halt. On Sunday, the 26th, marching 5 kos, I alighted at the village of Nimdah. On Monday, the 27th, also marching 5 kos, I pitched on the bank of a tank. On Tuesday, the 28th, marching 3\u00be kos, the royal standards alighted near the township of Sahr\u0101\u00b2 on the edge of a tank. The flower of the lotus, which in the Hindi language they call kumudini, is of three colours\u2014white, blue, and red. I had already seen the blue and white, but had never seen the red. In this tank red flowers were seen blooming. Without doubt it is an exquisite and delightful flower, as they have said\u2014\n\n\u201cFrom redness and moistness it will melt away.\u201d\u00b3\n\nThe flower of the kanwal\u2074 is larger than the kumudini. Its flower is red. I have seen in Kashmir many kanwal with a hundred leaves (petals). It is certain that it opens during the day and becomes a bud at night. The kumudini, on the contrary, is a bud during the day and opens at night. The black bee, which the people of India call bhau\u1e47r\u0101, always sits on these flowers, and goes inside them to drink the juice that is in both of them. It often happens that the kanwal flower closes and\n\n\u00b9 The dam was also used as a weight, and was equal to 5 t\u0101nk or 1 tola, 8 masha, 7 surkh (Blochmann, p. 31).\n\u00b2 Apparently Sahr\u0101 is the name of a town, and does not mean an open space here.\n\u00b3 Perhaps the line refers to the bee, and means that the bee wishes to suck the moisture of the flower.\n\u2074 The MSS. have gul-i-k\u016bl, \u2018the flower of the tank.\u2019 It seems to be a water-lily.\nthe bee remains in it the whole night. In the same manner it remains in the kumudini flower. When the flower opens it comes out and flies away. As the black bee is a constant attendant on these flowers, the poets of India look on it as a lover of the flower, like the nightingale, and have put into verse sublime descriptions of it. Of these poets the chief was T\u0101n Sen Kal\u0101want, who was without a rival in my father's service (in fact, there has been no singer like him in any time or age). In one of his compositions he has likened the face of a young man to the sun and the opening of his eyes to the expanding of the kanwal and the exit of the bee. In another place he has compared the side-glance of the beloved one to the motion of the kanwal when the bee alights on it.\n\nAt this place figs arrived from Ahmadabad. Although the figs of Burhanpur are sweet and well-grown, these figs are sweeter and with fewer seeds, and one may call them 5 per cent. better. On Kam-shamba, the 29th, and Mub\u0101rak-shamba, the 30th, we halted. At this stage Sar-far\u0101z Kh\u0101n came from Ahmadabad and had the good fortune to kiss the threshold. Out of his offerings a rosary of pearls, bought for 11,000 rupees, two elephants, two horses, two bullocks and a riding cart, and some pieces of Gujarati cloth, were accepted, and the remainder presented to him. Sar-far\u0101z Kh\u0101n is a grandson of Mu\u1e63\u0101\u1e25ib Beg, by which name he was called by Akbar after his grandfather, who was one of the Amirs of Hum\u0101y\u016bn. In the beginning of my reign I increased his mansab and appointed him to the Subah of Gujarat. As he had an hereditary connection with the Court as a Khana-zada (one born in the house), he proved himself efficient in the Subah of Gujarat. Considering him worthy of patronage, I gave him the title of Sar-far\u0101z Kh\u0101n and raised him in the world, and his mansab has risen to 2,000 personal and 1,000 horse. On Friday,\nthe 1st of Day, I marched $3\\frac{3}{4}$ kos and halted on the bank of the tank of Jhasod.\\footnote{Query \"the tank of Yasod\u0101,\" the foster-mother of Krishna?} At this stage R\u0101y M\u0101n, captain of the Khidmatiya,\\footnote{Blochmann, p. 252.} caught a roh\u016b fish and brought it. As I am particularly partial to the flesh of fish, especially that of the rohu, which is the best kind of fish in Hindustan, and I had never, notwithstanding much enquiry, had one for eleven months from the time of crossing the pass of Gh\u0101t\u012b Chand\\footnote{Jah\u0101ng\u012br crossed the Gh\u0101t\u012b Chand or Ch\u0101nd, between Ajmere and Malwa, in the 11th year (see p. 172), but he does not speak of having had any rohu fish there. Perhaps the reference is to his halt at R\u0101msar shortly before coming to Gh\u0101t\u012b Chand. He got 104 rohu at R\u0101msar. See p. 169.} until the present time, and now obtained it, I was greatly delighted. I presented a horse to R\u0101y M\u0101n. Although the parganah of Dohad is reckoned as within the boundary of Gujarat, yet, in fact, it was from this stage that all things appeared different. The open plains and soil are of a different kind; the people are different and the language of another description. The jungle that appeared on the road has fruit-bearing trees, such as the mango and khirni and tamarind, and the method of guarding the cultivated fields is with hedges of zaqq\u016bm. The cultivators separate their fields with cactus, and leave a narrow road between them for coming and going. Since all this country has a sandy soil, when any movement takes place, so much dust rises that the faces of people are seen with difficulty, so that one should call Ahmadabad 'Gard\u0101b\u0101d'\\footnote{Elliot, vi, 353.} (abode of dust). On Saturday, the 2nd, having marched $3\\frac{3}{4}$ kos, I encamped on the bank of the Mah\u012b. On Sunday, the 3rd, again after a march of $3\\frac{3}{4}$ kos, I halted at the village of Bardala. At this stage a number of mansabdars who had been appointed to serve in Gujarat had the good fortune to kiss the threshold. Marching 5 kos on Monday, the 4th, the royal\nstandards halted at Chitras\u012bm\u0101, and the next day, Tuesday, after a march of 5 kos, in parganah Mond\u0101.\u00b9 On this day three blue bulls were killed; one was larger than the others and weighed 13 maunds and 10 seers. On Wednesday, the 6th, I marched 6 kos and halted in parganah Nary\u0101d.\u00b2 In passing through the town I scattered 1,500 rupees. On Thursday, the 7th, marching 6\u00bd kos, I halted in the parganah of Pitl\u0101d.\u00b3 In the country of Gujarat there is no larger parganah than this; it has a revenue of 700,000 rupees, equal to 23,000 current tumans of Iraq. The population of the town (qasba), too, is dense. Whilst I passed through it I scattered 1,000 rupees. All my mind is bent upon this, that under any pretext the people of God may be benefited. As the chief way of riding among the people of this country is in carts, I also wished to travel in a cart. I sat for 2 kos in a cart, but was much troubled with the dust, and after this till the end of the stage rode on horseback. On the road Muqarrab Kh\u0101n came from Ahmadabad, and had the good fortune to wait on me, and presented an offering of a pearl he had bought for 30,000 rupees. On Friday, the 8th, marching 6\u00bd kos, the place of the descent of prosperity was on the shore of the salt sea.\n\nCambay\u2074 is one of the old ports. According to the brahmins, several thousand years have passed since its foundation. In the beginning its name was Trimb\u0101wati, and R\u0101ja Tryambak Kunwar had the government of the country. It would take too long to write in detail the circumstances of the aforesaid Raja as the brahmins relate it. In brief, when the turn to the government came round\n\n\u00b9 Mondah of Jarrett, ii, 253.\n\u00b2 Text Nil\u0101o. No such parganah is mentioned in the \u0100y\u012bn; the two I.O. MSS. have Nary\u0101d.\n\u00b3 Pitl\u0101d is mentioned in Bayley\u2019s Gujarat, p. 9, as having a very large revenue. It is the Patl\u0101d of Jarrett, ii, 253. Text wrongly has Nil\u0101b. Possibly Bhil is the parganah meant.\n\u2074 Elliot, vi, 353.\nto R\u0101ja Abhay Kum\u0101r,\\(^1\\) who was one of his grandsons, by the decree of heaven a great calamity happened to this city. So much dust and earth were poured on it that all the houses and buildings were hidden, and the means of livelihood of many people was destroyed. Before the arrival of this calamity, an idol (but), which the Raja worshipped, came in a dream and announced this event. The Raja with his family embarked in a ship, and carried away the idol with them with a pillar it had behind it for a support. By chance the ship also was wrecked by a storm of misfortune. As there was left still a term of life for the Raja, that pillar bore the boat of his existence in safety to the shore, and he proposed to rebuild the city. He put up the pillar as a mark of repopulation and the coming together of the people. As in the Hindi language they call a pillar istambh and khambh, they called the city Istambhnagari and Khamb\u0101wati, and sometimes also Trimb\u0101wati, in connection with the Raja\u2019s name; Khamb\u0101wati has by degrees and much use become Khamb\u0101yat (Cambay). This port is one of the largest ports\\(^2\\) in Hindustan and is near a firth, which is one of the firths of the Sea of Oman. It has been estimated to be 7 kos in width, and nearly 40 kos in length. Ships cannot come inside the firth, but must cast anchor in the port of Gog\u0101, which is a dependency\\(^3\\) of Cambay and situated near the sea. Thence, putting their cargoes into ghur\u0101bs\\(^4\\) (commonly called \u2018grabs\u2019) they bring them to the port of Cambay. In the same way, at the time of loading a ship they carry the cargo in ghurabs and put it in the ships. Before the arrival of the victorious host some ghurabs from European ports had come to Cambay to buy and sell, and were about to return. On Sunday,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The I.O. MSS. have Abhay or Abh\u012b K\u0101r.\n\n\\(^2\\) Tiefenthaler, i, p. 380, etc., has an interesting notice of Cambay. He also gives a sketch of its bay (plate xxxii).\n\n\\(^3\\) Now so silted up that no tolerably large vessel can approach it.\n\n\\(^4\\) Abu-l-fa\u1e93l calls them t\u0101war\u012b (Jarrett, ii, 241).\nthe 10th, they decorated them and showed them to me. Taking leave they went about their business. On Monday, the 11th, I myself went on board a ghurab for about a kos on the face of the water. On Tuesday, the 12th, I went out with cheetahs (y\u016bz), and captured two\u00b9 antelope. On Wednesday, the 13th, I went to see the tank of T\u0101rangsar (Narangsar?),\u00b2 and passed through the streets and bazaar on the way, scattering nearly 5,000 rupees. In the time of H.M. Akbar (may Allah\u2019s lights be his testimony), Kaly\u0101n R\u0101y, the superintendent of the port, by His Majesty\u2019s order built a wall of brick and cement round the city, and many merchants came from various quarters and settled there, and built fine houses and employed themselves in gaining their livelihood under easy circumstances. Although its market is small, it is clean and full of people. In the time of the Sultans of Gujarat the customs of this port came to a large sum. Now in my reign it is ordered that they should not take more than one in forty. In other ports, calling it a tithe, they take one in ten or one in eight, and give all kinds of trouble to merchants and travellers. In Jeddah, which is the port of Mecca, they take one in four or even more. One may imagine from this what the customs of the ports of Gujarat must have come to in the time of the former rulers. God be praised that this suppliant at the throne of God obtained the grace to remit the whole of the customs dues of his dominions, which came to a countless sum, and the very name of customs (tamgh\u0101) has passed away from my empire. At this time an order was given that tankas\u00b3 of gold and silver should be coined twice the weight of ordinary muhrs and rupees. The legend\n\n\u00b9 I.O. MSS. have \u2018ten.\u2019\n\u00b2 T\u0101l t\u0101rang. Possibly t\u0101rang should read tarang (waves), and the meaning be that Jah\u0101ng\u012br went to see the famous bore in the Gulf of Cambay.\n\u00b3 See Elliot, vi, 355, and note.\non the gold coin was on one side the words \"Jah\u0101ng\u012br-sh\u0101hi, 1027\" (1618), and on the reverse \"Struck in Cambay in the 12th year of the reign.\" The legend for silver coins was on one side \"Sikka, Jah\u0101ng\u012br-sh\u0101hi, 1027\"; round it this hemistich, \"King Jah\u0101ng\u012br of the conquering ray struck this\"; and on the reverse, \"Coined at Cambay in the 12th year of the reign,\" with this second hemistich round it\u2014\n\n\"When after the conquest of the Deccan he came to Guj\u0101rat from M\u0101nd\u016b.\"\n\nIn no reign except mine have tankas been coined except of copper; the gold and silver tankas are my invention. I ordered it to be called the Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u012b coinage. On Mub\u0101rak-shamba (Thursday), the 14th, the offering of Am\u0101nat Kh\u0101n, the superintendent (mutasadd\u012b) of Cambay, was laid before me in the women's apartments. His mansab was fixed, original and increase, at 1,500 personal and 400 horse. N\u016bru-d-d\u012bn Qul\u012b was honoured with the mansab, original and increase, of 3,000 personal and 600 horse. On Friday, the 15th, mounted on the elephant N\u016br-bakht, I made it run after a horse. It ran exceedingly well, and when it was stopped stood well. This is the third time that I myself have ridden it. On Saturday, the 16th, R\u0101m D\u0101s, son of Jay Singh, was promoted to the mansab, original and increase, of 1,500 personal and 700 horse. On Sunday, the 17th, an elephant each was given to D\u0101r\u0101b Kh\u0101n, Am\u0101nat Kh\u0101n, and Sayyid B\u0101yz\u012bd B\u0101rha.\n\nIn these few days during which I was encamped on the shore of the salt sea, merchants, traders, indigent people, and other inhabitants of the port of Cambay having been summoned before me, I gave each according to his condition a dress of honour or a horse or travelling money or assistance\n\n---\n\n1 In the text a\u1e25\u1e0d\u012b occurs by mistake instead of \u2018a\u1e25\u1e0d\u012b, and man instead of mas.\n\n2 Wrongly so in text, but Jay Singh should be corrected to Raj Singh. The son of Jay Singh, Raja of Ajmir, was R\u0101m Singh, who was born in Sambat, 1692.\nin living. On this day, Sayyid Mu\u1e25ammad, \u0160\u0101h\u012bb Sajj\u0101da (Lord of the prayer carpet) of \u0160h\u0101h \u2018\u0100lam (a mosque near Ahmadabad), the sons of Shaikh Mu\u1e25ammad Ghaus, Shaikh \u1e24aidar, grandson of Miy\u0101n Wajih\u016b-d-d\u012bn, and other Shaikhs living at Ahmadabad came to meet me and pay their respects. As my desire was to see the sea and the flow and ebb of the water, I halted for ten days, and on Tuesday, the 19th (Day, about 30th December, 1618), the royal standards started for Ahmadabad. The best description of fish procurable in this place, the name of which is \u2018arb\u012byat,\u00b9 was caught and frequently brought for me by the fishermen. Without doubt these fish are, as compared with other fish of this country, more delicious and better, but they are not of the flavour of the roh\u016b. One might say as nine to ten or even eight to ten. Of the food which is peculiar to the people of Gujarat there is the khichr\u012b of b\u0101jr\u0101 (a mixture of split peas and millet boiled together); this they also call la\u1e93\u012bza. It is a kind of split grain, which does not grow in any other country but Hindustan, and which in comparison with many other regions of India is more abundant in Gujarat; it is cheaper than most vegetables. As I had never eaten it, I ordered them to make some and bring it to me. It is not devoid of good flavour, and it suited me well. I ordered that on the days of abstinence, when I partake of dishes not made with flesh, they should frequently bring me this khichri. On the said Tuesday, having marched 6\u00bd kos, I halted at the village of Kos\u0101l\u0101. On Wednesday, the 20th, I passed through the parganah of B\u0101br\u0101\u00b2 and halted on the bank of the river. This was a march of 6 kos. On Mub\u0101rak-shamba, the 21st, I halted and held a feast of cups. In this river I caught many fish, and divided them among the servants who were present at the feast. On Friday, the 22nd, having moved on 4 kos, I pitched at\n\n\u00b9 Or \u2018Arab\u012b (Arabian?). \u00b2 M\u0101\u1e6dar or N\u0101\u1e6dar in I.O. MSS.\nthe village of B\u0101r\u012bch\u0101. On this road, walls came in sight from $2\\frac{1}{2}$ to 3 gaz in length, and on enquiry it appeared that people had made them from the desire of spiritual reward. When a porter is tired on the road he places his burden on the wall and gains his breath a little, and lifting it up again with ease and without assistance from anyone proceeds towards his destination. This is one of the peculiar ideas of the people of Gujarat. The building of these walls pleased me greatly, and I ordered that in all large towns$^1$ they should make walls of this kind at the imperial expense. On Saturday, the 23rd, marching $4\\frac{3}{4}$ kos, the camp was pitched at the K\u0101nkriya tank. Q\u016b\u1e6dbu-d-d\u012bn Mu\u1e25ammad, grandson of Sult\u0101n Al\u1e25mad, the founder of the city of Ahmadabad, made this tank, and placed round it steps of stone and cement. In the middle of the tank he constructed a little garden and some buildings. Between the bank of the tank and these buildings he had made a causeway, which was the way for entering and leaving. Since this occurred a long time ago, most of the buildings had become dilapidated, and there was no place left fit to sit in. At the time when the host of prosperity was about to proceed towards Ahmadabad, \u1e62afi Kh\u0101n, bakhshi of Gujarat, repaired at the expense of government what was broken down and in ruins, and clearing out the little garden erected a new building in it. Certainly it is a place exceedingly enjoyable and pleasant. Its style pleased me. On the side where the causeway is, N\u012bz\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn Al\u1e25mad,$^2$ who was for a while bakhshi of Gujarat in my father\u2019s time, had made a garden on the bank of the tank. At this time a representation was made to me that \u2018Abdu-llah Kh\u0101n, in consequence of a dispute that he had with \u2018\u0100bid, son of N\u012bz\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn Al\u1e25mad, cut down the trees of this garden. I also heard that during his government\n\n---\n\n$^1$ I.O. MS. 181 has \u201cin all the cities of Upper India.\u201d\n$^2$ The historian.\nhe, at a wine party, signed to a slave, and cut off the head of an unfortunate man who was not wanting in fun and jesting, merely because in a state of drunkenness he had uttered some improper expressions by way of a joke. On hearing these two reports, my sense of justice was shocked, and I ordered the Diwans to change one thousand of his two-horsed and three-horsed cavalry into one-horsed, and to deduct from his jagir the difference (of pay), which came to 7,000,000 dams.\n\nAs at this stage the tomb of Sh\u0101h \u2018\u0100lam was by the roadside, I recited the f\u0101ti\u1e25a in passing by it. About 100,000 rupees had been spent in building this mausoleum. Sh\u0101h \u2018\u0100lam was the son of Qu\u1e6db \u2018\u0100lam, and their family goes back to Makhd\u016bm-i-Jah\u0101niy\u0101n\u00b9 (a saint). The people of this country, high and low, have a wonderful belief in him, and they say that Sh\u0101h \u2018\u0100lam used to raise the dead. After he had raised several dead men, his father became aware of this and sent him a prohibition, saying it was presumption in him to meddle with the workshop of God, and was contrary to true obedience. It happened that Sh\u0101h \u2018\u0100lam had an attendant (female) who had no children, but at Sh\u0101h \u2018\u0100lam\u2019s prayer God Almighty bestowed a son on her. When he reached his 27th\u00b2 year he died, and that slave came weeping and wailing into his presence, saying, \u201cMy son has died, and he was my only son; since God Almighty gave him to me by your favour, I am hopeful that through your prayer he may become alive.\u201d Sh\u0101h \u2018\u0100lam fell into thought for a time and went into his cell, and the attendant went to his son, who greatly loved her, and besought him to ask the Shah to make his son alive. The son, who was of tender years, went into his cell, and used much entreaty.\n\n\u00b9 A saint of Multan who died in 1384. See Beale, s.v. Shaikh Jal\u0101l, and Jarrett, iii, 369.\n\u00b2 So in text, but surely it should be \u201c8th or 7th\u201d? It appears from the Khaz\u012bnatu-l-asfiy\u0101, ii, 71, that the attendant who lost the child was a female disciple, and that the child was young.\nSh\u0101h \u2018\u0100lam said, \u201cIf you are content to give up your life for him, perhaps my petition may be accepted.\u201d He represented \u201cI am perfectly contented with what may be your wish and the desire of God.\u201d Sh\u0101h \u2018\u0100lam took his son\u2019s hands, and lifting him up from the ground turned his face towards heaven and said, \u201cO God, take this kid in place of that one.\u201d Instantaneously the boy surrendered his soul to God, and Sh\u0101h \u2018\u0100lam laid him down on his own bed and covered his face with a sheet, and coming out of the house said to that attendant, \u201cGo home, and get news of thy son; perhaps he may have been in a trance and not have died.\u201d When she arrived at her house she saw her son alive. In short, in the country of Gujarat they say many things of this sort of Sh\u0101h \u2018\u0100lam. I myself asked Sayyid Muhammad, who is lord of his prayer carpet (in charge of the mausoleum), and who is not wanting in excellence and reasonableness, what was the real state of the case. He said, \u201cI have also heard the same from my father and grandfather, and it has come down in succession, and wisdom is from Allah.\u201d Although this affair is beyond the laws of understanding, yet, as it has attained great notoriety among men, it has been recorded as a strange occurrence. His departure from this perishable mansion to the eternal world took place in 880 (1475), in the time of the reign of Sult\u0101n Mahm\u016bd Bigara, and the buildings of this mausoleum are the memorial of T\u0101j Kh\u0101n Tariy\u0101n\u012b,\u00b9 who was one of the Amirs of Sult\u0101n Mu\u1e93affar, the son of Mahm\u016bd.\n\nAs an hour on Monday had been chosen for my entry into the city, on Sunday, the 24th, I halted. At this place some melons came from K\u0101r\u012bz, which is a town dependent on Herat, and it is certain that in Khurasan there are no melons better than those of K\u0101r\u012bz. Although\n\n\u00b9 According to Bayley\u2019s Gujarat, p. 238, and Index, p. 515, the name is either T\u0101j Kh\u0101n T\u00fcrp\u0101li or Narp\u0101li.\nthis is at a distance of 1,400 kos, and kafilahs (caravans) take five months to come, they arrived very ripe and fresh. They brought so many that they sufficed for all the servants. Together with these there came oranges (kaunl\u0101) from Bengal, and though that place is 1,000 kos distant most of them arrived quite fresh. As this is a very delicate and pleasant fruit, runners bring by post as much as is necessary for private consumption, and pass it from hand to hand. My tongue fails me in giving thanks to Allah for this.\n\n\"Thankfulness for Thy favours is one of Thy favours.\"\n\nOn this day Am\u0101nat Kh\u0101n presented two elephants' tusks; they were very large, one of them being 3 cubits 8 tass\u016b (finger-breadths) in length and 16 tassu in circumference; it weighed 3 maunds and 2 seers, or 24\u00bd Iraq maunds. On Monday, the 25th, after six gharis, I turned towards the city in pleasure and prosperity at the propitious hour, and mounted the elephant \u0160\u016brat-gaj, a favourite elephant of mine, which is perfect in appearance and disposition. Although he was fractious (mast), I had confidence in my own riding and his pleasant paces (?).\n\nCrowds of people, men and women, had assembled, and were waiting in the streets and bazars and at the gates and the walls. The city of Ahmadabad did not seem to me so worthy of praise as I had heard. Although they had made the main road of the bazar wide and spacious, they had not suited the shops to this breadth. Its buildings are all of wood and the pillars of the shops slender and mean (zab\u016bn). The streets of the bazar were full of dust, and there was dust from the K\u0101nkriy\u0101 tank up to the citadel, which in the dialect of the country they call Bhadar. I hastened along scattering\n\n1 Suw\u0101r\u012b-i-kh\u016bd u khwush-jal\u016b-i-\u016b, \"my own riding and his pleasant paces (?).\" It does not seem likely that Jah\u0101ng\u012br would himself drive the elephant. The meaning here probably is that Jah\u0101ng\u012br trusted to his being on the elephant. Khwush-jal\u016b is used lower down about another elephant, and seems to refer to the elephant's paces. See p. 214.\nmoney. The meaning of Bhadar is 'blessed' (bhadra). The houses of the Sultans of Gujarat, which were inside the Bhadar, have fallen into ruin within the last fifty or sixty years, and no trace of them is left. However, our servants who have been sent to the government of this country have erected buildings. When I was proceeding from M\u0101nd\u016b to Ahmadabad, Muqarrab Kh\u0101n had done up the old buildings and prepared other places for sitting that were necessary, such as a jharokha, a public audience hall, etc. As to-day was the auspicious day for the weighing of my son Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n, I weighed him in the usual manner against gold and other things, and the 27th year from his blessed birth began in pleasure and enjoyment. I hope that the Giver of gifts will bestow him on this suppliant at His throne and let him enjoy life and prosperity. On the same day I gave the province of Gujarat in jagir to that son. From the fort of M\u0101nd\u016b to the fort of Cambay, by the road we came, it is 124 kos, which were traversed in twenty-eight marches and thirty halts. I remained at Cambay for ten days; from that place to the city of Ahmadabad is 21 kos, which we traversed in five marches with two halts. Altogether, from M\u0101nd\u016b to Cambay and from Cambay to Ahmadabad by the road we came is 145 kos, which we accomplished in two months and fifteen days; this was in thirty-three marches and forty-two halts.\n\nOn Tuesday, the 26th, I went to see the J\u0101mi\u2019 mosque, and gave with my own hand in alms to the fakirs who were present there about 500 rupees. This mosque was one of the memorials of Sult\u0101n A\u1e25mad, the founder of the city of Ahmadabad. It has three gates,\u00b9 and on each side a bazar. Opposite the gate that looks towards the east is the mausoleum of the said Sult\u0101n A\u1e25mad. In that dome Sult\u0101n A\u1e25mad, his son Mu\u1e25ammad, and his\n\n\u00b9 Or doors. The Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, 108, has \"in front of each gate there is a bazar.\"\ngrandson Qu\u1e6dbu-d-d\u012bn are laid to rest. The length of the court of the mosque, excluding maq\u1e63\u016bra (the holy of holies), is 103 cubits, and its breadth 89 cubits. Round this they have made an ayw\u0101n (portico), in breadth 4\u00bd cubits. The flooring of the court is of trimmed bricks, and the pillars of the portico of red stone. The maqsura contains 354 pillars, above which there is a dome. The length of the maqsura is 75 cubits, and its breadth 37 cubits. The flooring of the maqsura, the mihr\u0101b (arch towards which the face is turned in prayer), and the pulpit are made of marble. On both sides of the main arch (p\u012bsh-t\u0101q) are two polished minarets of cut stone, containing three \u0101shy\u0101na (stories) beautifully shaped and decorated. On the right-hand side of the pulpit near the recess of the maqsura they have made a separate seat for the king. The space between the pillars has been covered in with a stone platform, and round this up to the roof of the maqsura they have put stone cages (in which women sit so as not to be seen). The object of this was that when the king came to the Friday service or the \u2018Id he went up there with his intimates and courtiers, and performed his devotions. This in the dialect of the country they call the Mul\u016bk-kh\u0101na (King\u2019s chamber). This practice and caution were on account of the crowding of the people. Truly this mosque is a very noble building.\n\nOn Wednesday, the 27th, I went to the monastery of Shaikh Wajihu-d-d\u012bn, which was near the palace, and the f\u0101ti\u1e25a was read at the head of his shrine, which is in the court of the monastery. \u0160\u0101diq Kh\u0101n, who was one of the chief Amirs of my father, built this monastery.\n\n1 123 in Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma.\n2 350 in I.O. MSS.\n3 Panjara-i-sang, presumably lattice-work in stone.\n4 See for dimensions of the mosque Bayley\u2019s Gujarat, p. 92 and note, and the authorities there quoted.\n5 Text wrongly has Sunday.\nThe Shaikh was a successor of Shaikh Muhammad Ghaus, but a successor against whom the teacher disputed. Wajihu-d-din\u2019s loyalty to him is a clear proof of the greatness of Shaikh Muhammad Ghaus. Shaikh Wajihu-d-din was adorned with visible excellencies and spiritual perfection. He died thirty years ago in this city (Ahmadabad), and after him Shaikh \u2018Abdu-llah, according to his father\u2019s will, took his place. He was a very ascetic dervish. When he died his son Shaikh Asadu-llah sat in his place, and also quickly went to the eternal world. After him his brother Shaikh \u1e24aidar became lord of the prayer carpet, and is now alive, and is employed at the grave of his father and grandfather in the service of dervishes and in looking after their welfare. The traces of piety are evident on the forehead of his life. As it was the anniversary festival of Shaikh Wajihu-d-din, 1,500 rupees were given to Shaikh \u1e24aidar for the expenses of the anniversary, and I bestowed 1,500 rupees more on the band of fakirs who were present in the monastery, with my own hand in charity, and made a present of 500 rupees to the grandson (?) of Shaikh Wajihu-d-din. In the same way I gave something for expenses, and land to each of his relatives and adherents according to his merit. I ordered Shaikh \u1e24aidar to bring before me the body of dervishes and deserving people who were associated with him, in order that they might ask for money for expenses and for land. On Thursday, the 28th, I went to look round the Rustam-Kh\u0101nb\u0101r\u012b, and scattered 1,500 rupees on the road. They call a garden a b\u0101r\u012b in the language of India.\n\n1 Mu\u1e25ammad Ghaus was accused of heresy by some of the Gujar\u0101t\u012b mullas. He was much respected by Hum\u0101y\u016bn, and is buried at Gwalior.\n2 Jah\u0101ng\u012br means that Wajihu-d-din was a very learned man, and that his devotion to Mu\u1e25ammad Ghaus, who was an ignorant man (ummi), shows what a great personality the latter was. Cf. Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, 169, and Ma\u2019\u0101\u0161iru-l-umar\u0101, ii, 583, where we are told that Wajihu-d-din thanked God that both his Prophet and his Pir were ignorant.\na garden that my brother Sh\u0101h Mur\u0101d made in the name of his son Rustam. I made a Thursday entertainment in this garden, and gave cups to some of my private servants. At the end of the day I went to the little garden of the \u1e25aw\u0101l\u012b (mansion) of Shaikh Sikandar, which is situated in the neighbourhood of this garden, and which has exceedingly good figs. As picking the fruit with one's own hand gives it quite a different relish, and I had never before plucked figs with my own hand, their excellence in this respect was approved. Shaikh Sikandar\\(^1\\) is by origin a Gujarati, and is not wanting in reasonableness, and has complete information about the Sultans of Gujarat. It is now eight or nine years since he has been employed among the servants (of the State). As my son Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n had appointed to the government of Ahmadabad Rustam Kh\u0101n, who is one of his chief officers, at his request I, in accordance with the association of his name, presented him with (the garden) Rustamb\u0101r\u012b. On this day R\u0101ja Kaly\u0101n, zamindar of the province of \u012a\u1e0dar, had the good fortune to kiss my threshold, and presented an elephant and nine horses as an offering; I gave him back the elephant. He is one of the most considerable zamindars on the frontier of Gujarat, and his country is close to the hill-country of the R\u0101n\u0101. The Sultans of Gujarat constantly sent armies against the Raja of that place. Although some of them have professed obedience and presented offerings, for the most part none of them have come to see anyone personally. After the late king Akbar conquered Gujarat, the victorious army was sent to attack him. As he understood that his deliverance lay in obedience and submission, he agreed to serve and be loyal, and hastened to enjoy the good fortune of kissing the threshold. From that date he has been enrolled among the servants (of the\n\n\\(^1\\) He wrote a history of Gujarat\u2014the Mir\u0101t-i-Sikandar\u012b. Rieu, Cat., i, 287.\nState). He comes to see whoever is appointed to the government of Ahmadabad, and when work and service are necessary appears with a body of his men. On Saturday, the 1st of the month of Bahman, in the 12th year of my reign, Chandar Sen, who is one of the chief zamindars of this country, had the good fortune to kiss the threshold, and presented an offering of nine horses. On Sunday, the 2nd, I gave elephants to R\u0101ja Kaly\u0101n, zamindar of \u0130d\u0101r, to Sayyid Mu\u1e63\u1e6daf\u0101, and M\u012br F\u0101\u017cil. On Monday I went out hawking, and scattered nearly 500 rupees on the road. On this day pears came from Badakhshan. On Mub\u0101rak-shamba, the 6th, I went to see the \u201cgarden of victory\u201d at the village of Sair-khaiz (Sarkhej), and scattered 1,500 rupees on the way. As the tomb of Shaikh Al\u1e25mad Khatt\u016b\u00b9 is on the road, I first went there and the f\u0101ti\u1e25a was read. Khatt\u016b is the name of a town in the Sarkar of N\u0101gor, and was the birthplace of the Shaikh.\u00b2 The Shaikh lived in the time of Sul\u1e6d\u0101n Al\u1e25mad, who founded the city of Ahmadabad, and the latter had a great respect for him. The people of this country have a strange belief in him, and consider him one of the great saints. Every Friday night a great crowd of people, high and low, go to visit his shrine.\n\n\u00b9 Blochmann, 507, note.\n\u00b2 \u201cShaikh Al\u1e25mad Khatt\u016b, who had the title of Jam\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn, was born at Delhi of a noble family in 737 A.H. (1336\u20137). He was the disciple and successor of B\u0101b\u0101 Ish\u0101q (Isaac) Maghribi. His name was Na\u1e63\u012bru-d-d\u012bn. By the jugglery of the heavens he was separated from his home in a storm, and after a while entered the service of B\u0101b\u0101 Ish\u0101q Maghribi. He acquired from him spiritual and secular learning, and came to Gujarat in the time of Sul\u1e6d\u0101n Al\u1e25mad. High and low accepted him, and paid him homage. Afterwards he travelled to Arabia and Persia, and made the acquaintance of many saints. He is buried at Sarkhech, near Al\u1e25madabad.\u201d\u2014\u0100y\u012bn-i-Akbar\u012b (vol. ii, p. 220, of Bib. Ind., ed. Jarrett, iii, 371). See Bayley\u2019s Gujarat, p. 90, note, and Khaz\u012bnatu-l-asf\u012by\u0101, ii, 314, and Blochmann, 507, note, where the reference to the Khaz\u012bna, 957, seems wrong. The story told in the Khaz\u012bna is that Shaikh Al\u1e25mad belonged to the royal family of Delhi, and was, as a baby, blown out of his nurse\u2019s arms into the street during a storm.\nbuilt lofty buildings in the shape of mausoleums, mosques, and monasteries at the head of his tomb, and near his mausoleum on the south side made a large tank, and surrounded it with stone and lime (masonry). This building was completed in the time of Qu\u1e6dbu-d-d\u012bn, son of the aforesaid Mu\u1e25ammad. The shrines of several of the Sultans of Gujarat are on the bank of the tank by the feet of the Shaikh. In that dome there have been laid at rest Sul\u1e6d\u0101n Ma\u1e25m\u016bd Bigara, Sul\u1e6d\u0101n Mu\u1e93affar, his son, and Ma\u1e25m\u016bd, the martyr, grandson of Sul\u1e6d\u0101n Mu\u1e93affar, and who was the last of the Sultans of Gujarat. Bigara, in the language of the people of Gujarat, signifies \u2018turned-up moustache,\u2019 and Sul\u1e6d\u0101n Ma\u1e25m\u016bd had a large turned-up moustache; on this account they call him Bigara. Near his (Shaikh Kha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u016b\u2019s) tomb is the dome of his ladies.\u00b9 Without doubt the mausoleum of the Shaikh is a very grand building and a beautiful place. It is estimated that 500,000 rupees were spent on it. God only knows what is true.\n\nAfter performing this visitation I went to Fath-b\u0101gh (garden of victory). This garden is situated on the ground on which the Commander-in-Chief, Kh\u0101nkhan\u0101n \u0100\u1e6d\u0101liq, fought with and defeated Nab\u016b (Nann\u016b ? Nanh\u016b?), who gave himself the title of Mu\u1e93affar Kh\u0101n. On this account he called it B\u0101gh-i-fa\u1e6d\u1e25; the people of Gujarat call it Fath-b\u0101r\u012b. The details of this are that when, by means of the good fortune of the late king Akbar, the country of Gujarat was conquered, and Nab\u016b fell into his hands, I\u2018tim\u0101d Kh\u0101n represented that he was the son of a carter. As no son was left by Sul\u1e6d\u0101n Ma\u1e25m\u016bd, and moreover there was no one of the descendants of the Sultans of Gujarat whom he could raise to the throne, he (I\u2018tim\u0101d) had accepted the most available course, and had made out that this was the son of Ma\u1e25m\u016bd. He gave him\n\n\u00b9 Text khaw\u0101nin, \u2018khans,\u2019 but evidently this is a mistake for khaw\u0101tin, the plural of kh\u0101t\u016bn, \u2018a lady.\u2019\nthe name of Sult\u0101n Mu\u1e93affar, and raised him to the sovereignty. Men from necessity consented to this. As His Majesty considered the word of I\u2019tim\u0101d Kh\u0101n of weight, he ignored Nab\u016b, and for some time he did duty among the servants, and the king paid no attention to his case. In consequence of this he ran away from Fathp\u016br, and coming to Gujarat lived for some years under the protection of the zamindars. When Shih\u0101bu-d-d\u012bn Al\u1e25mad Kh\u0101n was turned out from the government of Gujarat and I\u2019tim\u0101d Kh\u0101n installed in his place, a body of the servants of Shih\u0101bu-d-d\u012bn Kh\u0101n, who were attached to Gujarat, separated from him, and remained at Ahmadabad in the hope of service with I\u2019tim\u0101d. After I\u2019tim\u0101d entered the city they had recourse to him, but had no good luck with him. They had not the face to go to Shih\u0101bu-d-d\u012bn, and had no prospects in Ahmadabad. As they were without hope they thought their remedy lay in betaking themselves to Nab\u016b, and in making him an excuse for disturbance. With this intent 600 or 700 horsemen from among them went to Nab\u016b and carried him off along with Lon\u0101 K\u0101th\u012b, under whose protection he was living, and proceeded to Ahmadabad. When he arrived near the city many wretched men on the look out for an occasion joined him, and nearly 1,000 horsemen, Mughals and Gujaratis, collected together. When I\u2019tim\u0101d Kh\u0101n became aware of this he left his son Sh\u012br Kh\u0101n in the city, and hastened off in search of Shih\u0101b Kh\u0101n, who was proceeding towards the Court, in order that with his help he might quiet the disturbance. Many of the men had separated themselves from him, and he read on the faces of those who were left the signs of unfaithfulness, but Shih\u0101bu-d-d\u012bn, in company with I\u2019tim\u0101d Kh\u0101n, turned his rein. It happened that before their arrival Nab\u016b had entered the fort of Ahmadabad. Those who were loyal drew up their troops near the city, and the rebels came out of the fort and hastened to the\nbattlefield. When the army of the rebels showed itself, those of the servants of Shih\u0101b Kh\u0101n who were left took the wrong road and joined the enemy. Shih\u0101b Kh\u0101n was defeated and hastened towards Pa\u1e6dan (P\u0101tan ?), which was in the possession of the royal servants. His retinue and camp were plundered, and Nab\u016b, bestowing mansabs and titles on the rebels, went against Q\u016b\u1e6dbu-d-d\u012bn Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n, who was in Baroda. The servants of the latter, like the servants of Shih\u0101b Kh\u0101n, took the road of faithlessness and chose separation, as is related in detail in the Akbar-n\u0101ma. In the end, after giving his word to Q\u016b\u1e6dbu-d-d\u012bn Mu\u1e25ammad, he sent him to martyrdom, and his goods and property, which were equal to the treasure of his courtesy and grandeur, were plundered. Nearly 45,000 horsemen collected round Nab\u016b.\n\nWhen this state of affairs was represented to H.M. Akbar he sent against him Mirz\u0101 Kh\u0101n, son of Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n, with a force of brave warriors. On the day when Mirz\u0101 Kh\u0101n arrived near the city, he drew up the ranks of good fortune. He had about 8,000 or 9,000 horse, and Nab\u016b met him with 30,000, and drew up his host tainted with ruin. After prolonged fighting and slaughter the breeze of victory blew on the flag of the loyal, and Nab\u016b, being defeated, fled in wretched plight. My father, in reward for this victory, gave Mirz\u0101 Kh\u0101n a mansab of 5,000, with the title of Kh\u0101nkhan\u0101n and the government of the country of Gujarat. The garden that Kh\u0101nkhan\u0101n made on the field of battle is situated on the bank of the River S\u0101barmati. He founded lofty buildings along that eminence on the river, and made a strong wall of stone and cement round the garden. The garden contains 120 jari\u0113 of land, and is a charming resort. It may have cost 200,000 rupees. It pleased me greatly. One may say that in the whole of Gujarat there is no garden like this. Arranging a Thursday feast, I bestowed cups on my private servants, and remained there for the\nnight. At the end of the day, on Friday, I entered the city, scattering about 1,000 rupees on the road. At this time the gardener represented that a servant of Muqarrab Kh\u0101n had cut down some champ\u0101 trees above the bench alongside the river. On hearing this I became angry, and went myself to enquire into the matter and to exact satisfaction. When it was established that this improper act had been committed by him, I ordered both his thumbs to be cut off as a warning to others. It was evident that Muqarrab Kh\u0101n knew nothing of this affair, or otherwise he would have punished him there and then.\n\nOn Tuesday, the 11th, the Kotwal of the city caught a thief and brought him. He had committed several thefts before, and each time they had cut off one of his members; once his right hand, the second time the thumb of his left hand, the third time his left ear, and fourth time they hamstringed him, and the last time his nose; with all this he did not give up his business, and yesterday entered the house of a grass-seller in order to steal. By chance the owner of the house was on the look out and seized him. The thief wounded the grass-seller several times with a knife and killed him. In the uproar and confusion his relatives attacked the thief and caught him. I ordered them to hand over the thief to the relatives of the deceased, that they might retaliate on him.\n\n\"The lines of the face show the thought of your head(?).\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the 12th, 3,000 rupees were handed over to \u2018Azamat Kh\u0101n and Mu\u2019taqad Kh\u0101n, that they might go the next day to the tomb of Shaikh Ahmad Khat\u1e6d\u016b, and divide it among the fakirs and indigent people who had taken up their abode there. On Thursday, the 13th, I went to the lodging of my son Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n, and held a Mub\u0101rak-shamba entertainment there, and distributed cups among my private servants. I gave my son the elephant Sundar Mathan, which was\n\n1 I.O. MSS. have Sundar Sen.\nsuperior to all my private elephants in speed and beauty and pleasant paces, and competed with horses, and was the first among the elephants, and one much liked by King Akbar. My son Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n had a great liking for him, and frequently asked him of me, and seeing no way out of it I gave it to him with its gold belongings of chains, etc., together with a female elephant. A present of 100,000 of darbs was given to the wakils of \u0100dil Kh\u0101n. At this time it was represented\\(^1\\) to me that Mukarram Kh\u0101n, son of Mu\u2018azzam Kh\u0101n, who was the governor of Orissa, had conquered the country of Kh\u016brd\u0101, and that the Raja of that place had fled and gone into the R\u0101jmahendra. As he was a kh\u0101na-z\u0101d (houseborn one) and worthy of patronage, I ordered his mansab, original and increase, to be 3,000 personal and 2,000 horse, and honoured him with drums, a horse, and a dress of honour. Between the province of Orissa and Golconda there were two zamindars, one the Raja of Kh\u016brd\u0101 and the second the Raja of R\u0101jmahendra. The province of Kh\u016brd\u0101 has come into the possession of the servants of the Court. After this it is the turn of the country of R\u0101jmahendra. My hope in the grace of Allah is that the feet of my energy may advance farther. At this time a petition from Qutbu-l-mulk reached my son Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n to the effect that as the boundary of his territory had approached that of the King, and he owed service to this Court, he hoped an order would be issued to Mukarram Kh\u0101n not to stretch out his hand, and to acquire possession of his country. It was a proof of Mukarram\u2019s valour and energy that such a one as Qutbu-l-mulk should be apprehensive about his (Mukarram) becoming his neighbour.\n\nOn this day Ikr\u0101m Kh\u0101n, son of Isl\u0101m Kh\u0101n, was appointed faujdar of F\u0101\u1e6dhp\u016br and its neighbourhood, and presented with a dress of honour and an elephant; Chandar\n\n\\(^1\\) See Elliot, vi, 355.\nSen, the zamindar of Haloz (Halwad?),\n\n1 was given a dress of honour, a horse, and an elephant. An elephant was also given to L\u0101ch\u012bn Q\u0101qsh\u0101l. At the same time Mu\u1e93affar,\n\n2 son of Mirz\u0101 B\u0101qi Tarkh\u0101n, had the honour of kissing the threshold. His mother was the daughter of B\u0101rha (Bh\u0101r\u0101), the zamindar of Kachh. When Mirz\u0101 B\u0101qi died and the government of Thatta went to Mirz\u0101 J\u0101n\u012b, Mu\u1e93affar was apprehensive of Mirz\u0101 J\u0101n\u012b, and he took refuge with the aforesaid zamindar. He had remained from his childhood until now in that country. Now that the fortunate retinue had reached Ahmadabad, he came and did homage. Though he had been reared among men of the wilds, and was unfamiliar with civilized ways and ceremonies, yet as his family had had the relations of service with our exalted dynasty from the times of Timur\n\n3 \u2014may God make his proof clear!\u2014I considered it right to patronize him. For the present I gave him 2,000 rupees for expenses, and a dress of honour. A suitable rank will be given to him, and perhaps he will show himself efficient as a soldier.\n\nOn Thursday, the 20th, I went to the \u201cGarden of Victory,\u201d and contemplated the red roses. One plot had bloomed well. There are not many red roses (gul-i-surkh) in this country, so it was pleasant to see so many here. The anemone\n\n4 bed, too, was not bad, and the figs had\n\n---\n\n1 This name is doubtful, for the MSS. have a different reading, apparently Nam\u016bd. There is a Hal\u014dd in Gujarat (Jarrett, ii, 242). See also Bayley\u2019s Gujarat, 439. Perhaps it is the Halol of the Indian Gazetteer.\n\n2 The existence of this son of B\u0101qi Tarkh\u0101n does not seem to have been known to Ab\u016b-l-fa\u017cl or to Blochmann. Nor is he mentioned in the Ma\u02bf\u0101\u0161iru-l-umar\u0101. See Jarrett, ii, 347, where only Payanda is spoken of as the son of B\u0101qi Kh\u0101n, and Blochmann, p. 362. See also Ma\u02bf\u0101\u0161iru-l-umar\u0101, iii, 485, the biography of Mirz\u0101 \u1e24as Tarkh\u0101n. His name appears, however, in the pedigree of his house in the Tarkh\u0101n-n\u0101ma of Jam\u0101l Sh\u012br\u0101z\u012b.\n\n3 The word s\u0101n\u012b in S\u0101\u1e25\u012bb-qir\u0101n-i-s\u0101n\u012b in text is a mistake.\n\n4 Shaq\u0101\u02beiq, which perhaps means tulips. In Price\u2019s Jahangir, p. 115, there is much more said about the \u201cGarden of Victory,\u201d and Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u2019s entertainment there by his wife Khairu-n-nis\u0101, the daughter of the Kh\u0101nkh\u0101n\u0101n.\nripened. I gathered some figs with my own hands, and weighed the largest one. It came to $7\\frac{1}{2}$ tolas. On this day there arrived 1,500 melons from K\u0101r\u012bz. The Kh\u0101n \u2018\u0100lam had sent them as a present. I gave a thousand of them to the servants in attendance, and five hundred to the women of the harem. I spent four days in this garden in enjoyment, and on Monday eve, the 24th, I came to the city. Some of the melons were given to the Shaikhs of Ahmadabad, and they were astonished to see how inferior were the Gujarat melons. They marvelled at the goodness of the Deity.\n\nOn Thursday, the 27th, I held a wine-feast in the Nag\u012bna\u00b9 garden, which is inside the palace grounds, and which one of the Gujarat Sultans had planted. I made my servants happy with flowing bowls. A pergola (takhta) of grapes had ripened in this garden, and I bade those who had been drinking to gather the bunches with their own hands and partake of them.\n\nOn Monday, the 1st of Isfand\u0101rmuz, I left Ahmadabad and marched towards Malwa. I scattered money on the road till we reached the bank of the K\u0101nkriy\u0101 tank, where I halted for three days. On Thursday, the 4th, the presents of Muqarrab Kh\u0101n were laid before me. There was nothing rare among them, nor anything that I took a fancy to, and so I felt ashamed. I gave them to my children to take into the harem. I accepted jewellery and decorated vessels and cloths to the value of a lakh, and gave him back the rest. Also about one hundred Kachhi horses were taken, but there was none of great excellence.\n\nOn Friday, the 5th, I marched 6 kos, and encamped on the bank of the Ahmadabad River. As my son Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n was leaving Rustam Kh\u0101n, one of his chief servants, in charge of the government of Gujarat, I, at my son\u2019s request, gave him a standard, drums, a dress\n\n\u00b9 Bag\u012bna in text. Debi Prasad has Bak\u012bn\u0101.\nof honour, and a decorated dagger. Up till now it had not been the custom in this dynasty to give to the prince's servants standards or drums. For instance, H.M. Akbar, with all his affection and graciousness to me, did not decide upon giving to my officers a title or a standard. But my consideration for this son is so unbounded that I would do anything to please him, and, in fact, he is an excellent son, and one adorned with every grace, and in his early youth has accomplished to my satisfaction, everything that he has set his hand to.\n\nOn this day Muqarrab Kh\u0101n took leave to go to his home.\n\nAs the shrine of Qu\u1e6db \u2018\u0100lam, the father of Sh\u0101h \u2018\u0100lam Bukh\u0101ri, was in the village of Batoh,\u00b9 and on my way, I went there and gave 500 rupees to the guardians. On Saturday, the 6th, I entered a boat on the Ma\u1e25m\u016bd\u0101b\u0101d River and went a-fishing. On the bank is the tomb of Sayyid Mub\u0101rak Bukh\u0101ri. He was one of the leading officers of Gujarat, and his son Sayyid Mir\u0101n erected this monument to him. It is a very lofty cupola, and there is a very strong wall of stone and lime round it. It must have cost more than two lakhs of rupees. None of the tombs of the Gujarat Sultans that I saw came up to one-tenth of it. Yet they were sovereigns, and Sayyid Mir\u0101n was only a servant. Genius and the help of God have produced this result. A thousand blessings on a son who has made such a tomb for his father:\u00b2\n\n\"That there may remain a memorial of him upon earth.\"\n\nOn Sunday I halted and fished, and caught 400 fish. One of them had no scales, and is called the sang-m\u0101h\u012b,\n\n\u00b9 Banoh in text. See Bayley's Gujarat, p. 237; also Tiefenthaler, i, 377, who speaks of it as being 3 leagues south of Ahmadabad. See also Jarrett, ii, 240, n. 7.\n\n\u00b2 For Sayyid Mub\u0101rak and his son see Bayley's Gujarat. Sayyid Mub\u0101rak was the patron of the author of the Mir\u0101t-i-Sikandar\u012b. See loc. cit., p. 454.\n'the stone-fish.' Its belly was very large and swollen, so I ordered them to cut it open in my presence. Inside was a fish with scales which it had recently swallowed and which had as yet undergone no change. I told them to weigh both fish. The stone-fish came to $6\\frac{1}{2}$ seers and the other to nearly 2.\n\nOn Monday, the 8th, I marched $4\\frac{1}{4}$ kos, and encamped in the village of Moda (Mah\u0101ondat). The inhabitants praised the rainy season of Gujarat. It happened that on the previous night and on this day before breakfast some rain fell, and the dust was laid. As this is a sandy country, it is certain that there would not be any dust in the rainy season, nor would there be any mud. The fields would be green and cheerful. At any rate, a specimen of the rainy season has been seen by me. On Tuesday I marched $5\\frac{1}{2}$ kos, and halted at the village of Jarsima (Jarisam\u0101).\n\nAt this stage news came that M\u0101n Singh Sewr\u0101 had surrendered his soul to the lords of hell. The account of this in brief is that the Sewras are a tribe of infidel Hindus who always go with their head and feet bare. One set of them root out their hair, their beards, and moustaches, while another set shave them. They do not wear sewn garments, and their central principle is that no living creature should be injured. The Banyans regard them as their p\u012brs and teachers, and even worship them. There are two sects of Sewras, one called Pat\u0101 (Tap\u0101) and the other Kanthal (Kartal). M\u0101n Singh was the head of the latter, and B\u0101l Chand the head of the Pat\u0101s. Both of them used to attend upon H.M. Akbar. When he died and Khusrau fled and I pursued him, R\u0101y Singh Bhur\u1e6diy\u0101, zamindar of Bikanir, who had been made an Amir by Akbar's kindness, asked M\u0101n Singh what\n\n---\n\n1 It is the Chandsuma of Bayley's map.\n2 Jarrett, iii, 210; and Akbar-n\u0101ma, translation, i, 147, n. 2.\n3 This should be Tap\u0101. See Addenda.\nwould be the duration of my reign and the chances of my success. That black-tongued fellow, who pretended to be skilled in astrology and the extraction of judgments, said to him that my reign would, at most, last for two years. The doting old idiot (R\u0101y Singh) relied upon this, and went off without leave to his home. Afterwards, when the glorious God chose out this suppliant and I returned victorious to the capital, he came, ashamed and downcast, to Court. What happened to him in the end has been told in its proper place.\\(^1\\) In fine, M\u0101n Singh, in the course of three or four months, was struck with leprosy (\\(juz\u0101m\\)), and his limbs fell off him till he was in such a state that death was by many degrees preferable to life. He was living at Bikanir, and now I remembered him and sent for him. On the road he, out of excessive fear, took poison, and surrendered his soul to the lords of hell. So long as the intentions of this suppliant at God\u2019s courts are just and right, it is sure that whoever devises evil against me will receive retribution according to his merits.\n\nThe sect of the Sewras exists in most of the cities of India, but is especially numerous in Gujarat. As the Banyans are the chief traders there, consequently the Sewras also are plentiful. Besides making idol-temples for them, they have built houses for them to dwell in and to worship in. In fact, these houses are the headquarters of sedition. The Banyans send their wives and daughters to the Sewras, who have no shame or modesty. All kinds of strife and audacity are perpetrated by them. I therefore ordered that the Sewras should be expelled, and I circulated farmans to the effect that wherever there were Sewras in my empire they should be turned out.\n\n\\(^1\\) L.O. MS., instead of \\(kh\u0101timat-i-\u0101hw\u0101l-i-\u016b\\), has \\(chunanchik \u0101hw\u0101l\\), \u201cas has been stated in its place.\u201d This is probably correct, as Jah\u0101ng\u012br has already referred to his death. See also the account of the 2nd year, where he speaks of R\u0101y Singh\u2019s going home without leave.\nOn Wednesday, the 10th, I went out to hunt, and shot two nilgaw, one male and one female. On this day the son of Dil\u0101war Kh\u0101n came from Pattan, which was his father's fief, and paid his respects. He presented a Kachh\u012b horse. It was a very handsome animal, and pleasant to ride. Till I came to Gujarat no one had presented me with so fine a horse. Its value was 1,000 rupees.\n\nOn Thursday, the 11th, I had a wine party on the bank of the tank, and bestowed many favours on those servants who had been appointed to the province, and then dismissed them. Among the promotions was that of Shaj\u0101'at Kh\u0101n, the Arab, to the rank of 2,500 personal and 2,000 horse. I also gave him drums, a horse, and a robe of honour. Himmat Kh\u0101n was raised to the rank of 1,500 with 800 horse, and had a robe of honour and an elephant. Kif\u0101yat Kh\u0101n, who was made Diwan of the province, received the rank of 1,200 with 300 horse. \u015eafi Kh\u0101n bakhshi received a horse and a robe of honour. Khwaja '\u0100qil had the rank of 1,500 with 650 horse, and was made bakhshi of the Ahadis, and had the title of '\u0100qil Kh\u0101n. Thirty thousand darbs were given to the wakil of Qu\u1e6dbu-l-Mulk, who had brought the tribute.\n\nOn this day my son Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n presented pomegranates and quinces that had been sent to him from Far\u0101h. I had never seen such large ones, and I ordered them to be weighed. The quince weighed 29 tolas 9 mashas and the pomegranate 40\u00bd tolas. On Friday, the 12th, I went a-hunting and shot two nilgaw, a male and a female. On Saturday, the 13th, I shot three nilgaw, two males and one female. On Sunday, the 14th, I gave Shaikh Ism\u0101'il, the son of Shaikh Mu\u1e25ammad Ghaus, a robe of honour and 500 rupees. On Monday, the 15th, I went a-hunting and shot two female nilgaw. On Tuesday, the 16th, I again presented the Shaikhs of Gujarat, who were in attendance, with robes of honour and maintenance-lands. To each of them I gave a book from my special\nlibrary, such as the Tafs\u012br-i-kashsh\u0101f,\\(^1\\) the Tafs\u012br-i-\u1e24usain\u012b,\\(^2\\) and the Rau\u1e93atu-l-ahb\u0101b.\\(^3\\) I wrote on the back of the books the day of my arrival in Gujarat and the day of presentation of the books.\n\nAt the time that Ahmadabad was adorned by the setting up of the royal standards my employment by day and by night was the seeing of necessitous persons and the bestowing on them of money and land. I directed Shaikh Ahmad the \u1e62adr and some other tactful servants to bring before me dervishes and other needy persons. I also directed the sons of Shaikh Mu\u1e25ammad Ghaus, the grandson of Shaikh Wajihu-d-din, and other leading Shaikhs to produce whatever persons they believed to be in want. Similarly I appointed some women to do the same thing in the harem. My sole endeavour was that as I a king had come to this country after many years, no single person should be excluded. God is my witness that I did not fall short in this task, and that I never took any rest from this duty. Although I have not been delighted with my visit to Ahmadabad, yet I have this satisfaction\u2014that my coming has been the cause of benefit to a large number of poor people.\n\nOn Tuesday, the 16th, they caught Kaukab, the son of Qamar Kh\u0101n. He had in Burhanpur put on a faqir\u2019s dress and gone off into the wilds. The brief account of his case is this:\u2014He was the grandson of Mir \u2018Abdu-l-Lat\u012bf, who was one of the Saifi Sayyids and was attached to this Court. Kaukab had been appointed to the Deccan army, and had spent some days with it in poverty and wretchedness. When for a long time he did not get promotion he suspected that I was unfavourable to him, and foolishly took the dress of asceticism and went off to the wilderness. In the course of six months he\n\n\\(^1\\) Perhaps an explanation of Zamakhshari\u2019s Commentary.\n\\(^2\\) A Persian commentary on the Koran (Rieu, p. 96).\n\\(^3\\) A life of Mu\u1e25ammad (Rieu, i, 147).\ntraversed the whole of the Deccan, including Daulatabad, Bidar, Bijapur, the Carnatic, and Golconda, and came to the port of D\u0101bul.\\(^1\\) From there he came by ship to the port of Gog\u0101, and after visiting the ports of Surat, Broach, etc., he reached Ahmadabad. At this time Z\u0101hid, a servant of Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n, arrested him and brought him to Court. I ordered them to bring him before me heavily bound. When I saw him I said to him, \u201cConsidering the obligations of service of your father and grandfather, and your position as a houseborn one, why have you behaved in such an inauspicious manner?\u201d He replied that he could not tell a lie in the presence of his qibla and real teacher, and that the truth was that he had hoped for favours, but as he was unlucky he had left outward ties and gone into the wilderness of exile. As his words bore the marks of truth they made an impression on me, and I abandoned my harsh tone and asked him if in his misfortunes he had waited upon \u2018\u0100dil Kh\u0101n, or Qu\u1e6dbu-l-Mulk, or \u2018Ambar. He replied that though he had been unsuccessful at this Court and had remained thirsty in this boundless ocean of beneficence, he had never\u2014God forbid that he should\u2014approached with his lips other fountains. Might his head be cut off if it had bowed at this Court and then lowered itself at another! From the time that he went into exile he had kept a diary showing what he had done, and by examining it it would be seen how he had conducted himself. These words of his increased my compassion for him, and I sent for his papers and read them. It appeared from them that he had encountered great hardship, and that he had spent much time on foot, and that he had suffered from want of food. On this account I felt kindly disposed towards him. Next day I sent for him and ordered them to remove the bonds from his arms and legs, and gave him a robe of honour, a horse,\n\n\\(^1\\) D\u0101bhol (I.G., new ed., xi, 100).\nand 1,000 rupees for his expenses. I also increased his rank by one half, and showed him such kindness as he never had imagined. He repeated this verse\u2014\n\n\u201cWhat I see, is it, O God, waking or in a trance?\nDo I behold myself in such comfort after such torture?\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, the 17th, I marched 6 kos and halted at the village of B\u0101ras\u012bn\u014dr (B\u0101las\u012bn\u014dr). It has already been mentioned that the plague had appeared in Kashmir. On this day a report of the chronicler of events arrived, stating that the plague had taken firm hold of the country and that many had died. The symptoms were that the first day there was headache and fever and much bleeding at the nose. On the second day the patient died. In the house where one person died all the inmates were carried off. Whoever went near the sick person or a dead body was affected in the same way. In one instance the dead body was thrown on the grass, and it chanced that a cow came and ate some of the grass. It died, and some dogs that had eaten its flesh also all died. Things had come to such a pass that from fear of death fathers would not approach their children, and children would not go near their fathers. A strange thing was that in the ward in which the disease began, a fire broke out and nearly 3,000 houses were burnt. During the height of the plague, one morning when the people of the city and environs got up, they saw circles on their doors. There were three large circles, and on the face of these (i.e. inside them) there were two circles of middle size and one small one. There were also other circles which did not contain any whiteness\u00b9 (i.e. there were no inner circles). These figures were found on all the houses and even on the mosques. From the day when the fire took place and these circles appeared, they say there was a diminution of the plague. This has been\n\n\u00b9 Biy\u0101z. The meaning is not clear. Perhaps what is meant is that there was no writing, only the circles.\nrecorded as it seems a strange affair. It certainly does not agree with the canons of reason, and my intellect cannot accept it. Wisdom is with God! I trust that the Almighty will have mercy on his sinful slaves, and that they will be altogether freed from such calamity.\n\nOn Thursday, the 18th, I marched $2\\frac{1}{2}$ kos and halted on the bank of the Mahi. On this day the J\u0101n zamindar had the good fortune to kiss the ground. He presented 50 horses, 100 muhrs, and 100 rupees. His name is Jass\u0101, and J\u0101m is his title. Whoever succeeds is called J\u0101m. He is one of the chief zamindars of Gujarat, and, indeed, he is one of the noted rajas of India. His country is close to the sea. He always maintains 5,000 or 6,000 horse, and in time of war can supply as many as 10,000 or 12,000. There are many horses in his country; Kachhi horses fetch as much as 2,000 rupees. I gave him a dress of honour.\n\nOn the same day Lachmi Nar\u0101yan, Raja of K\u016bch (Bih\u0101r), which adjoins Bengal, did homage and presented 500 muhrs. He received a dress of honour and an ornamented dagger.\n\nNaw\u0101zish Kh\u0101n, son of Sa\u2018id Kh\u0101n, who had been appointed to J\u016bnagarh, had the good fortune to pay his respects. On Friday, the 19th, I halted, and on Saturday, the 20th, I marched $3\\frac{3}{4}$ kos and halted at the tank of Jhan\u016bd. On Sunday I marched $4\\frac{1}{2}$ kos and halted at the tank of Badarw\u0101l\u0101. On this day there came the news of the death of \u2018Azamat Kh\u0101n Gujar\u0101ti. On account of illness he had remained in Ahmadabad. He was a servant who knew one\u2019s disposition, and did good work. As he had thorough knowledge of the Deccan and Gujarat, I was grieved at his death. In the tank above mentioned I noticed a plant which at the approach of the finger or the end of a stick contracts its leaves. After a while it opens them out again. Its leaves resemble those of\n\n---\n\n1 Elliot, vi, 356.\nthe tamarind, and it is called in Arabic *Shajaru-l-hay\u0101*, \u2018the plant of modesty.\u2019 In Hindi it is called *Lajvanti*. *Laj* means modesty. It is certainly not void of strangeness. They also call it *naghzak*, and say that it also grows on dry land.\n\nOn Monday, the 22nd, I halted. My scouts reported that there was a tiger in the neighbourhood which vexed wayfarers, and in the forest where it was they had seen a skull and some bones lying. After midday I went out to shoot it, and killed it with one discharge. Though it was a large tiger, I had killed several that were larger. Among them was a tiger which I killed in the fort of M\u0101nd\u016b, and which was $8\\frac{1}{2}$ maunds. This one weighed $7\\frac{1}{2}$ maunds, or 1 maund less.\n\nOn Tuesday, the 23rd, I marched over $3\\frac{1}{2}$ kos and alighted on the bank of the River B\u0101yab.\\(^1\\) On Wednesday I marched nearly 6 kos and halted at the tank of Hamda.\\(^2\\) On Thursday I ordered a halt and had a wine party, and gave cups to my special servants. I promoted Naw\u0101zish Kh\u0101n to the rank of 3,000 with 2,000 horse, which was an increase of 500 personal, and gave him a robe of honour and an elephant, and allowed him to go to his fief. Mu\u1e25ammad \u1e24usain Sabzak,\\(^3\\) who had been sent to Balkh to buy horses, came to Court to-day and paid his respects. Of the horses he brought, one was piebald and was of fine shape and colour. I had never seen a piebald horse of this colour before. He had also brought other good roadsters. I therefore gave him the title of Tij\u0101rati Kh\u0101n.\n\nOn Friday, the 26th, I marched $5\\frac{1}{4}$ kos and halted at the village of J\u0101lod.\\(^4\\) R\u0101ja Lachm\u012b Nar\u0101yan, the paternal uncle of the Raja of K\u016bch, to whom I had now given the territory of K\u016bch, was presented with a horse. On\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) MSS. seem to have M\u0101nib.\n\n\\(^2\\) MSS. seem to have Nimda.\n\n\\(^3\\) The MSS. have Mu\u1e25ammad \u1e24usain Saud\u0101gar (trader).\n\n\\(^4\\) The Jhalod of Bayley\u2019s map.\nSaturday I marched 3 kos and halted at Boda.\\footnote{MSS. have Ran\u016bd.} On Sunday I marched 5 kos and set up the royal standards at Dohad. It is on the borders of Malwa and Gujarat.\n\nPahluw\u0101n Bah\u0101\u2019u-d-d\u012bn, the musketeer, brought a young monkey (\\textit{lang\u016br}) with a goat, and represented that on the road one of his marksmen had seen the female langur with a young one in its arms on a tree. The cruel man had shot the mother, which on being struck had left the young one on a branch, and had herself dropped on the ground and died. Pahluw\u0101n Bah\u0101\u2019u-d-d\u012bn had then come up and taken down the young one, and had put it beside the goat to be suckled. God had inspired the goat with affection for it, and it began to lick the monkey and to fondle it. In spite of difference of species she showed such love as if it had come out of her own womb. I told them to separate them, but the goat immediately began to lament, and the young langur also became much distressed. The affection of the monkey is not so remarkable, as it wanted to get milk, but the affection of the goat for it is remarkable. The langur is an animal belonging to the monkey tribe. But the hair of the monkey (\\textit{maim\u016bn}) is yellowish and its face is red, while the hair of the langur is white and its face is black. Its tail, too, is twice as long as the maimun\u2019s. I have written these things on account of their strangeness. On Monday, the 29th, I halted and went to hunt nilgaw. I shot two, one male and one female. On Tuesday also, the 30th, I halted.\n\nEnd of the twelfth year of the Emperor\u2019s reign, in the T\u016bzuk-i-Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u012b.\nERRATA AND ADDENDA.\n\nPage 15, line 7 from foot.

The MSS. seem to have Jaih\u0101l.\n\np. 66, last line. Kil\u012bn means 'daughter-in-law' in Turk\u012b. Perhaps Kil\u0101n here is a synonym for 'son-in-law.'\n\np. 67, l. 8. The words 'which in Hindustani is called ball\u012b' are not in the I.O. MSS. I do not know the word ball\u012b as meaning a pole. Perhaps it is a mistake for lag\u012b.\n\np. 76, l. 3 from foot.

It is the Shekhopura of the maps, and is 22 miles from \u1e24\u0101fiz\u0101b\u0101d and 18 miles west of Lahore. It was called Shaikh\u016bp\u016bra in allusion to Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u2019s pet name of Shaikh\u016b B\u0101b\u0101, and also in honour of Shaikh Sal\u012bm. See Khul\u0101\u1e63a T. in account of Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u2019s reign. The I.G., xxii, 270, wrongly ascribes its origin to D\u0101r\u0101 Shuk\u016bh.

According to Terry, Jah\u0101nd\u0101r was called Sultan Takht because born when Jah\u0101ng\u012br first sat on his throne.\n\np. 158, l. 9. Perhaps Y\u016bz\u012b = Y\u016bz-b\u0101sh\u012b, i.e. centurion. But I.O. 181 has not the word, only saying \u2018Sh\u0101h Beg Kh\u0101n,\u2019 and No. 305 has Sh\u0101h Beg Kh\u0101n B\u016br\u012b (?).\n\np. 158, l. 10. The passage is wrongly translated. No elephant was\npresented to Sal\u0101m\u016b-llah. The sentence should end on l. 9 after the word \u2018panther-keeper,\u2019 which word is probably a mistranslation. Then this new sentence should come, i.e. \u2018Sal\u0101mu-llah \u2018Arab, who is a young man of a distinguished Arabian family (k\u012bh az jaw\u0101n\u0101n-i-qar\u0101r-d\u0101da-i-\u2018Arab ast) and related to Mub\u0101rak, the governor of Dizf\u016bl, came to wait upon me on account of his being suspicious of the designs of Sh\u0101h \u2018Abb\u0101s (against himself).\u2019 \u2018I patronized him,\u2019 etc. (as on p. 158).\n\np. 158, n. 3, and p. 162, n. 1. Both notes are wrong. The place meant by Jah\u0101ng\u012br is Dizf\u016bl, a town in the Kh\u016bzist\u0101n province of Persia, and J\u016byza is evidently a copyist\u2019s error for Kh\u016bz or Kh\u016bza, another name for Kh\u016bzist\u0101n. Dizf\u016bl is an ancient name, and according to Y\u0101q\u016bt, Barbier de Meynard\u2019s translation, p. 231, the proper spelling is Dizp\u016bl, i.e. \u2018the Bridge of the Citadel,\u2019 the town being named after a famous bridge built over the river. For Kh\u016bz see B. de Meynard, 216.\n\np. 160, l. 12 from foot. Q\u0101bul\u0101h was a town in the Bet J\u0101landhar D\u016b\u2019\u0101b.\n\np. 163, l. 9. It is 2,000 rupees in I.O. MSS.\n\np. 163, l. 12. It is not Q\u0101ch\u0101 Dakhan\u012b in I.O. MSS., but I am not sure what the clause, as given by them, means. No. 181 seems to have bafat\u0101h\u0101ig\u012b for \u2018assistance\u2019 (?). Two B.M. MSS. have apparently bafat\u0101h\u0101i kapi, but Add. 26,215 has the Arabic \u1e25a, while Or. 3276 has the ordinary h, so that the words possibly mean \u2018the young of the monkey\u2019 (kapi).\n\np. 166, l. 2. \u1e24us\u0101nu-d-d\u012bn was married to Ab\u016b-l-fa\u017cl\u2019s sister, Blochmann, 441.\n\np. 167, l. 16. The word rojh in brackets is wrong. The MSS. have qar\u0101-quyr\u0101gh and qar\u0101-quyr\u0101gh. P. de Courteille gives quyr\u0101gh as meaning a tail, so perhaps qar\u0101-quyr\u0101gh means a black-tailed sheep or deer. See p. 129, l. 17, where the qar\u0101-quyr\u0101gh is said to be the chik\u0101ra.\n\np. 168, last line.

This is the annular eclipse entered in Dr. R.

P\u0101\u1e6dal means \u2018red\u2019 or \u2018rose-coloured\u2019 in Sanskrit. Query \u2018red deer.\u2019\n\np. 192, l. 2. Add year 1020.\n\np. 195, last line. The passage is rather obscure, but the meaning seems to be that though formalities are not regarded by the wise, yet weak persons (q\u0101w\u0101\u1e63ir, which apparently is a plural of q\u0101\u1e63ir), regard\nexternals as the means of paying the dues of friendship (and so we must attend to them). Hence when at this auspicious time a province which had gone out of my ('Abb\u0101s's) possession has been settled by the exertions of angelic servants in accordance with the hopes of well-wishers, I ('Abb\u0101s) have returned to the capital, and have despatched Kam\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn, etc.\n\np. 197, l. 7. For Khankh\u0101n\u0101n read Kh\u0101n.\n\np. 197, l. 12. The I.O. MSS. have a different reading here. They say nothing about three ratis. What they say is, \"At this time I had made some increase in the amounts of weights and measures. For instance, I added one-fourth (siw\u0101'\u012b) to the weight of the muhrs and rupees.\" The sih rati of text is a mistake for siw\u0101'\u012b.\n\np. 197, l. 12 from foot. I.O. MSS. have 'Sunday in \u1e62afar,' but they wrongly have 1022.\n\np. 197, l. 9 from foot. Both I.O. MSS. have 'Neknahar' instead of 'in the interior.'\n\np. 198, l. 11. Or Lohgar.\n\np. 205, l. 14. I do not think that the translation 'should not force Islam on anyone,' or the version in Elliot, vi, 325, 'Not to forcibly impose Musulman burdens on anyone,' gives the full force of the words takl\u012bf-i-Musalm\u0101n\u012b bar k\u0101s\u012b nakunand. I think the reference clearly is to circumcision, and that the words takl\u012bf-i-Musalm\u0101n\u012b should be rendered 'the Muhammadan ceremonial,' This explains why the injunction comes in immediately after the prohibitions against blinding and mutilation. It has been said, and I believe with truth, that the members of the Delhi royal family never were circumcised. Probably one reason for this was that in many instances they had Hindu mothers. As pointed out in Elliot, the passage is omitted in the Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma. It also does not occur in the version given in 'Al\u012b Mu\u1e25ammad's \"History of Gujarat,\" vol. i, p. 200 of lithograph.\n\np. 214, verse. For red read a river.\n\np. 216.

For Nih\u0101lp\u016br substitute Th\u00e4lner as in the MSS. The news of the death seems to have reached Agra very quickly.\n\np. 232, l. 1. Insert the word 'and' before 'allowed.'\n\np. 234, l. 2 from foot. The word translated 'cranes' is k\u0101rw\u0101nak, and probably means 'a little crane.' In Blochmann, 63, karw\u0101nak is rendered by 'stone-curlew.'\n\np. 234, l. 5 from foot. The word seems to be kunjishk, 'sparrow,' in the MSS., but probably it should be kunjak, 'a curiosity, a rarity.'\n\np. 235, l. 2. It is Thursday, the 28th, in the MSS., and instead of 'night' we should read 'eve.' The English date corresponding to 28th Muharram is 10th March, 1613.\n\np. 237, l. 8. It is 1,000 in the MSS., and this is probably correct, though B.M. MS. 1645 has changed the word for 1,000 into one for 100.\nThe ordinary kaukab-i-tali' was 100 tolas in weight, see p. 11. At p. 406 two kaukab-i-tali's are mentioned of 500 tolas each. It is a mistake, I think, to regard the word muhr as always implying gold. The ordinary kaukab-i-tali' was of silver, and these large muhrs were no doubt also of silver. The note 1 to Elliott, vi, 355, is probably incorrect.\n\np. 237, l. 10. 'The feast went off well,' etc. The passage is obscure, but probably the translation should be 'There was a splendid assemblage (majis'higufa gasht), and after it was over I ordered that they should arrange an illumination.' The words in text, p. 116, l. 3, are hukm kardam kih asbab u \u0101yin b\u0101r kunand. The MSS. have asbab-i-\u0101yin r\u0101. No. 181 seems to have b\u0101z kunand, and so has B.M. MS. 1645, but No. 305 has b\u0101r kunand, as in text. It may be that the meaning is that Jah\u0101ng\u012br told the servants they might appropriate the decorations, but I rather think the order was to make an illumination. It may also simply mean that he ordered the decorations to be taken down. B\u0101z kunand ordinarily means 'to open out,' b\u0101r kunand 'to load.'\n\np. 237, l. 12. Delete 'the' before Muqarrab.\n\np. 237, note. I.O. MSS. seem to have zar\u012bn, 'golden' (?).\n\np. 241, l. 5 from foot. I.G., new ed., xvii, 309, speaks of a handsome mosque in Mairtha having been founded by Akbar, but probably it is this one of Shaikh Pir. Perhaps Shaikh Pir is the old beggar referred to in Roe's Journal.\n\np. 247, l. 5 from foot. For chakr\u012b read jhakkar. It was not necessarily a dust-storm.\n\np. 250, l. 6. The MSS. have R\u016bp instead of R\u0101wal, and so has Elliot, vi, 335. They have 'hill country of Mew\u0101t,' as in text. They have Chitor, and not Jaipur, as in Elliot, and they make (by error) Jah\u0101ng\u012br speak of the year as the 10th, instead of the 8th. Instead of 'have' at l. 12 we should read 'had,' and instead of 'from the R\u0101wal who was first known as R\u0101wal,' they have, as also has Elliot, 'Rahab, who was the first to take the title of R\u0101n\u0101.' Rahab is the Rahup of Tod, who says he came to the throne in 1201 A.D.\n\np. 253, ll. 10 and 11. I cannot find the word pulta-b\u0101zi. My friend, Mr. Irvine, suggests that we should read pat\u1e6d\u0101 b\u0101zi. Pat\u1e6d\u0101 means a 'foil,' or 'wooden sword,' and pat\u1e6d\u0101 b\u0101z is given in Forbes as meaning a 'fencer.' Pat\u1e6dha m\u0101rn\u0101 occurs in Forbes as meaning a 'peculiar posture.' The yag\u0101nag\u012b of l. 11 should be yak\u0101ngag\u012b, meaning 'one body,' or 'one limb,' and corresponds to the yakh\u0101th of Blochmann, 252, both phrases meaning apparently 'that the fencer fights with one hand,' that is, 'without using a shield.'\n\np. 260, l. 8. This I'tiq\u0101d is the father of Mumt\u0101z-mahall, the wife of Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n. He now became \u0100\u1e63af Kh\u0101n, and apparently the title of I'tiq\u0101d was transferred to his younger brother (or cousin?) Sh\u0101hp\u016br, who was afterwards governor of Kashmir. See Ma'asir i, 180. The two previous \u0100\u1e63af Kh\u0101ns of the family are Ghiy\u0101su-d-d\u012bn of Qazw\u012bn (Blochmann, 433), and M\u012brz\u0101 Ja'far Beg, who was Ghiy\u0101su-d-d\u012bn's nephew. The father of N\u016br-Jah\u0101n was Ghiy\u0101s Beg of T\u012bran (Blochmann, 508). Blochmann, in his Table, 512, has not mentioned Sh\u0101hp\u016br, i.e. the I'tiq\u0101d who became governor of Kashmir.\np. 261, l. 17 from foot. For mother read mothers (i.e. stepmothers).\np. 261, l. 10 from foot. For nephews read nephew.\np. 278, l. 13. For named read namad, and it should be in italics.\np. 281, l. 2. The permission to beat his drums is explained by the Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, p. 79, where it is said that he was permitted to beat his drums in the capital, dar p\u0101y-i-takht.\np. 281, l. 6 from foot. This eclipse is noted in Dr. Schram\u2019s Tables as occurring on 19th March, 1615.\np. 282, l. 10 from foot. Delete word \u2018Egyptian.\u2019\np. 286, l. 6. For Frank read Venetian. K\u0101r-i-Wanadik, as in MSS.\np. 288, l. 5. Chat\u016br, instead of Tahayyur, in No. 305, and Bakhtar (?) in No. 181.\np. 293. According to the Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, 80, Kunwar Karan, son of R\u0101n\u0101 Amar Singh, became an officer of Jah\u0101ng\u012br, receiving the rank of 5,000 personal and horse. He was the first of the direct royal line of his family to accept office.\np. 293, l. 2 from foot. No. 181 has 102 horses.\np. 294, n. 2. No. 181 has Rasht.\np. 300, l. 18. According to Vullers\u2019 Dict., i, 482, a t\u016blcha is 96 grains or about half a tola. The Gh\u012by\u0101su-l-logh\u0101t, however, says that t\u016blcha is merely the Persian form of the Hindust\u0101n\u012b t\u016bla. According to the Burh\u0101n-i-q\u0101ti\u2019 a tola is only 2\u00bd m\u0101sha in Upper India. Generally it is reckoned as 12 m\u0101sha. According to Sir Thomas Roe 2\u00bd tolas were equal to 1 ounce.\np. 317, MS. No. 181 has a.h. date 1025.\np. 321, l. 11. For several bits read some marten skins. See T\u016bzuk text, p. 308, l. 3 from foot, and Vullers\u2019 Dict. ii, 6. The MS. No. 181 has sad d\u0101na-i-k\u012bsh, \u2018one hundred marten skins.\u2019\np. 321, l. 13 from foot. For transit dues read for keeping open the Pass (r\u0101h-d\u0101r\u012b).\np. 321, n. 2. The words in I.O. MSS. seem to be \u012bg\u0101na beg\u0101na, which is perhaps a mere jingle on the word aj\u012bgh\u0101na, but may mean \u2018known, unknown.\u2019 Jah\u0101ng\u012br puns on the name Qadam, which means \u2018a foot, a pace.\u2019 The words occur again at p. 323.\np. 322, last line. Probably \u2018aq\u012bri is, or is derived from, \u2018aq\u0101r, which means a bird whose feathers were used for ornamentation. According to P. de Courteille, Turk\u012b Dict., 384, \u2018aq\u0101r is a heron.\np. 328, l. 13 from foot. For Sh\u0101h Shaj\u0101\u2018at read Sh\u0101h Shuj\u0101\u2018. He was Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n\u2019s second son, and was born at Ajmir on the eve of Sunday, and on 11th T\u012br. Apparently this corresponds to 24th June, 1616, which is the date of birth mentioned by Sir Thomas Roe. Beale\u2019s date of 12th May is wrong.\np. 332, l. 6 from foot. Here the word t\u016blcha is used again, and apparently as meaning the same thing as tola; 6,514 t\u016blchas or tolas would be about 82 s\u012brs, or over 2 maunds, and about 12 stone. Next year Sir Thomas Roe saw Jah\u0101ng\u012br weighed, and he understood that his weight was 9,000 rupees. If so, his weight would appear to have considerably increased during the twelve months. Perhaps we should read 8,514, instead of 6,514 t\u016blchas. Hasht (8) and shash (6) are often confounded.\np. 341, l. 8 from foot. For times read days, the word r\u016bz (days) having been omitted from the text.\n\np. 344, n. 1. Apparently we should read Toda. The difference between it and Nauda is, in Persian writing, only one dot. Toda is mentioned by Roe as the place where he overtook Jah\u0101ng\u012br, and the stages given by him come to 21 kos, counting from R\u0101msar, and this agrees very nearly with Jah\u0101ng\u012br's stages from the same place.\n\np. 351, l. 15 from foot. The MS. No. 181 has the word gaz twice, and makes the pahna\u02bfi, or width, 175\u00bd gaz (yards).\n\np. 351, last line. For Bulghari read P\u016blkhar\u012b.\n\np. 352, l. 1. Delete the words \u2018of Tir.\u2019 The month was Bahman, corresponding to January\u2013February, 1617, and 23rd Bahman would be about 1st February. In Sayyid Al\u1e25mad\u2019s edition the word Tir is a mistake for niz, \u2018also,\u2019 the meaning being that the 23rd was a halt as well as the 22nd.\n\np. 353, l. 2. Ghazn\u012bn Kh\u0101n is mentioned by Finch under the name of Gidney Kh\u0101n, and he is said to have been originally a Hindu. But this seems doubtful, as his father\u2019s name is given in the Mir\u02be\u0101t-i-Al\u1e25mad\u012b as Malik Kh\u0101nji Afgh\u0101n. See also Bayley\u2019s \u201cGujarat,\u201d p. 15. J\u0101l\u014dr is now in Jodhp\u016br. It is described by Finch.\n\np. 353, l. 2. This seems to be the case of matricide mentioned in Terry\u2019s \u201cVoyage,\u201d p. 362, of ed. of 1777. His statement that it occurred at Al\u1e25mad\u0101b\u0101d is presumably an oversight. Terry says the matricide was put to death by being bitten by two snakes. See also Irvine\u2019s \u201cManucci,\u201d iv, 422. Apparently the punishment recorded by Jah\u0101ng\u012br took place on the 4th February, for Sir Thomas Roe mentions that they reached K\u0101liy\u0101daha, the next stage, on 6th February. The bi in biy\u0101sa should be deleted. J\u0101laur, or Jalor, is in Jodhp\u016br (I.G., xiv, 29). It used to be in Ajmir. It is not quite clear if Terry was with Roe at K\u0101liy\u0101daha, but if not he was with him at Ujjain. The execution may have taken place there.\n\np. 353, l. 16. For \u2018from the city of Ujjain,\u2019 etc., read \u2018to a rural spot near the city of Ujjain.\u2019\n\np. 360, l. 22. For 128\u00bd cubits read 28\u00bd cubits. I.O. MS. 181 has 28\u00bd yards. The printed text of Sayyid Al\u1e25mad has 128\u00bd cubits.\n\np. 362, l. 8 from foot. Delete (B\u0101lchha?).\n\np. 373, l. 11 seq. This I\u02bftiq\u0101d was the younger brother or perhaps cousin of A\u1e63af Kh\u0101n, the brother of N\u016br-Jah\u0101n. He was also known as Sh\u0101hpur. See Ma\u02bf\u0101\u0161iru-l-umar\u0101, i, 180.\n\np. 375, n. 2. Read two diamonds.\n\np. 406, n. 3. Dikht\u0101n or Daikht\u0101n seems right. It is so in both the I.O. MSS.\n\np. 406, l. 11 from foot. These muhrs were probably of silver, and were called muhrs because they were medals rather than coins. Dr. Kehr has given an account of a large muhr which is now apparently in Dresden. See also Richardson\u2019s Dict., article Sikka.\n\np. 407, l. 4. This is J\u016bna Kh\u0101n, son of Gh\u012by\u0101\u1e63u-d-d\u012bn Tughluq. He ascended the throne in 1325 under the title of Mu\u1e25ammad bin Tughluq.\n\np. 407, l. 15. This is the prince known as Na\u1e63\u012bru-d-d\u012bn. He ascended the throne as Mu\u1e25ammad bin Fir\u016bz in 1387, and again in 1390.\np. 413, ll. 11 and 3' from foot. I.O. MSS. show that Sar-far\u0101z should be Sarafr\u0101z; apparently his present was 'seven bullock-carts' (\u1e25a\u1e63\u1e6d r\u0101s g\u0101v bahal) and not two bullocks.\n\np. 417, n. 2. Cancel note. N\u0101rangsar seems right.\n\np. 417, l. 2 from foot. The words are dah b\u012bst wazn muhr u r\u016bpiya ma'nil. Elliot, p. 354, renders this 'ten and twenty times heavier than the current gold muhr and rupee.'\n\np. 418, l. 10. See n. 2 in Elliot, vi, 355. Apparently Jah\u0101ng\u012br means that he was the first person to coin double muhrs and double rupees. There is an account of tankas in the Bah\u0101r-i-'\u0100jam, 261, col. 2, p. 421, n. 2. But it is 27 in I.O. MSS. 113, p. 423, l. 14. A \u1e0dass\u016b is more than a finger-breadth, it is the \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of a gaz or yard, and should be about 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) inches.\n\np. 437. I am indebted to my friend Dr. Hoernle for the explanation of the names of the two sects of Sewras. They should be Tap\u0101 and Kharatara. M\u0101n Singh's name in religion was Jin-simha. See Epigraphia Indica, i, 37, and Ind. Antiquary, xi, 250. M\u0101n Singh died at Mairtha (in Jodhpur) according to the Jain books, in the beginning of 1618. The head of the Tap\u0101 sect in Jah\u0101ng\u012br's time was Vijayasena. There is an elaborate paper on the Jains of Gujarat and Marwar by Colonel Miles in the Transactions R.A.S., iii, pp. 335-71.\n\np. 442, l. 8.
